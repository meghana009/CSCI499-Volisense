predictions for holiday retail sales are rosy with the national retail federation calling for record gains of 8 5 to 10 5 from year ago levels but a record high amount of people or 11 5 of americans aren t buying any gifts this holiday season according to a survey by deloitte wealthy consumers are planning to spend more which will mask the fact that many others are sitting out the season higher income households in the u s plan to spend five times that of lower income households this holiday season said deloitte source code tenderloin code tenderloin a nonprofit group serving the homeless in san francisco said it has about 7 000 worth of gift cards to hand out to those who need the extra financial assistance over the holidays in recent weeks requests from members of the community have poured in for food clothing and gifts others are merely seeking code tenderloin s help to put a roof over their heads on a rainy evening and those solicitations will likely only mount as the holiday season drags on said donna hilliard executive director at code tenderloin get dfw local news weather forecasts and entertainment stories to your inbox sign up for nbc dfw newsletters while everybody is going through their day to day super excited about this holiday season we have a whole community of folks who are stressed out said hilliard in a phone interview we re seeing more demand this year than we ve ever seen the dynamic that code tenderloin witnesses playing out in san francisco speaks to a bigger wealth gap that has only accelerated during the covid 19 pandemic and will be especially evident over the holiday season predictions for holiday sales are rosy with the national retail federation the industry s biggest trade group calling for historic gains of 8 5 to 10 5 from year ago levels but the growth is largely being driven by a wealthy fraction of consumers meanwhile a record high amount of people aren t expecting to partake in any gifting according to one survey folks are freaking out the rising prices for fuel grocery items and other goods are weighing on many shoppers minds consumer confidence hit a 10 year low in november according to the university of michigan consumer sentiment index as inflation climbed to the highest levels since the early 1990s shoppers are spending but they re increasingly nervous about opening their wallets the people who had already been struggling before the pandemic right are really struggling now said hilliard and everyone that has spent their stimulus are coming in now now that the rent moratorium is gone folks are freaking out this holiday 11 5 of people plan to sit out the season by not spending anything on presents gift cards or other items for entertaining according to a survey by deloitte that s a record amount of americans on the sidelines for as long as the consulting firm has been keeping track deloitte found high income households will spend five times that of lower income households this holiday season the consulting firm polled 4 315 consumers about their holiday shopping plans between sept 7 and sept 14 this tale of two holidays is a pretty good reflection of the tale of two pandemics right said stephen rogers executive director of deloitte s consumer industry division what starts off as a health crisis turns into a financial crisis if you re in the lower income those of us who have investments in 401ks did quite well he said you can see from 2019 to 2021 the lower income group is spending almost half of what they used to spend and the higher income group is almost double what they used to spend two years ago households that bringing in more than 100 000 a year will shell out 2 624 apiece this holiday up 15 from 2020 deloitte s survey found while lower income groups which make less than 50 000 per year plan to spend 536 per household a 22 decline from year ago levels big spenders mask those not spending karthik easwar an associate professor at georgetown university s mcdonough school of business who specializes in consumer psychology said he agrees that the pandemic s economic impact has been stark and uneven for some americans it has meant a lost job a lengthy furlough or added health risks as they worked on the frontlines in an hourly retail position for americans in white collar jobs it simply meant a change of venue from the company office to the home office meanwhile these workers socked away savings from canceled vacations summer camps and other activities as the value of the stocks in their retirement accounts grew we all experienced the pandemic but some experiences were very different for different parts of our society especially our workforce said easwar we are seeing the effects of that still several key economic indicators point to recovery however the unemployment rate has fallen there are more job openings than people looking to fill them and a tight labor market means many employers are raising wages and sweetening perks macy s for example is investing 35 million over the next four years to give its workers an education program that will cover 100 of tuition books and fees but an economic divide will still be playing out this holiday season in who can afford to spend lavishly and those who feel like they have little room to spend at all said easwar some retailers will cater to the big spenders their spending along with higher sticker prices will likely mask the drop among financially strapped consumers he said there are consumers that are looking to spend a lot and if i spend 5 000 on a trip to disney and then a few thousand dollars on fancy and expensive gifts for my family or buy a new car that s going to outweigh a host of people who aren t spending the 700 they might normally spend easwar said source neiman marcus neiman marcus known for its affluent shoppers puts out an annual holiday catalog that features over the top fantasy gifts this year s copy includes a 30 86 carat diamond called the mughal heart that s going for a whopping 6 1 million among the listed items is a moet chandon champagne vending machine on sale for 38 000 the department store said it has already sold several lana todorovich president and chief merchandising officer at neiman marcus said the company has seen its customers getting a head start on their holiday shopping this year and spending more money per transaction we are seeing a lot of activity that is earlier and more robust than in previous years which really speaks to their anticipation and excitement she said we are also selling an extraordinary amount of gowns dresses and our tuxedo sales are extremely high some retailers try to keep prices low on the other end of the pricing pendulum however discount retailers and dollar stores are trying to keep costs low for those shoppers who are buying on budgets last week walmart ceo doug mcmillon and target ceo brian cornell both pledged to maintain low prices even if that ate into profits saying consumers are looking for value especially as inflation drives the price of pantry staples and household items up that s our purpose walmart ceo doug mcmillon said in an interview with cnbc s squawk on the street we save people money and help them live a better life those are the words that came out of sam walton s mouth he loved to fight inflation so do we inflation has been widespread even dollar stores have had to take increases dollar tree is bumping its price floor to 1 25 in an attempt to offset the pressure it faces from increased freight costs but it still believes that the slightly higher price is competitive we believe that at 1 25 it s still going to be an undeniable value because of what seeing out in the marketplace said dollar tree ceo michael witynski on an earnings call this week a separate deloitte survey found that of the 70 of people who had already kicked off their holiday shopping by late october 54 said they were spotting higher prices compared with last year and about one third of consumers said they increased their holiday budgets from what they were planning in september deloitte polled 1 200 consumers from oct 21 to oct 25 but not everyone has that same flexibility to just decide to spend more money it s just going to be tough on a fair number of folks said rod sides vice chairman of deloitte s retail distribution practice when gas prices food prices and those kinds of normal things continue to rise at the pace that we re seeing there s this uncertainty that says i probably don t need to splurge on that particular item because now i have to cover my rent and maybe i didn t before price sensitivity aside there might also be some consumers who are sitting out the holidays because they still have anxiety from the pandemic according to easwar either they lost a loved one due to the coronavirus or they re still nervous about catching it should i go to the store or should i order online should i go to the big holiday party or should i not that is going to weigh a lot on how consumers act this year because we re all struggling with that balance he said before it pivots to gift giving and doling out gift cards code tenderloin said it s been busy trying to secure enough turkeys to cook for thanksgiving meals this week we are just getting bombarded said del seymour executive director at code tenderloin and this is an enormously wealthy city
the heritage of cornelius jahnke by lyn harrington it was a great source of pride to cornelius neil jahnke that three of his sons took to ranching when he died in the spring of 1952 peter ben and elmer were all on ranches and working in partnership friends and acquaintances gathered from close by and for 150 miles around to attend the funeral and they re still saying of neil jahnke he was one of nature s gentlemen the only one of a kind they threw away the pattern after they made him cornelius jahnke was born in clear springs manitoba but left it for the northwest territories in 1903 in that year before the province of saskatchewan was established mr jahnke settled on a ranch beside the south saskatchewan river 11 miles northwest of main centre near herbert sask he was a real pioneer one of the first settlers in the region and definitely the first to start ranching thereabouts his brand was f rowlock on the left shoulder and that s what it still is for the sons still work in partnership even though their ranches are miles apart peter the eldest worked with his father a long time and indeed it was largely his efforts that put the ranch on its feet according to his sister mrs herbert wiebe of herbert the other sons were quite a bit younger but they too decided on ranching including bruce who left it later neil jahnke acquired two other ranches peter now has the big coulee ranch formerly the gordon ironsides and fares ranch near gouldtown elmer has the log valley ranch near glen kerr which once belonged to gib kerr and ben jahnke is on the home ranch the one his father started all the ranches border on the saskatchewan but ben s home is close to the river he draws water there for his household and his cattle help themselves to all they care to drink peter s ranch has a little spring which he dammed back to form a pond on the log valley ranch elmer with the assistance of the p f r a has dammed up a coulee in the hills to catch surface run off in every instance the ranch buildings are well kept surrounded by trees which had to be planted except right along the bank of the river the homes are heated with oil burners and propane gas is installed in the kitchens for summer work altogether the jahnke brothers run about 2 000 head of cattle a good commercial herd with purebred sires these are herefords which they cross with shorthorn bulls every now and then last spring ben bought eight purebred shorthorns to run with the hereford cows believing that it improves the milk quality of the latter and produces thriftier calves being in the buffer zone which surrounded saskatchewan s quarantine area the jahnke brothers had to hold over their cattle for a year the embargo was therefore an inconvenience but it was an occasion for thanksgiving when not a sign of foot and mouth cropped up in their herds beef cattle are sold by private treaty as a rule and are sometimes shipped from teakle on the c n r occasionally the brothers drive the cattle 21 miles to herbert an overnight drive which seems to do them little harm many years ago they sent a carload of steers to england for a fancy price unfortunately it was just at the moment when the pound was being devalued and the end price was much less attractive thana it had looked at first previous to the sanitary embargo most of the cattle were shipped to the american market and the high prices of several years ago made things easier on these ranches as well as on others there s plenty of work on a ranch at any season of the year such as fencing haying and harvesting of coarse grains the jahnke brothers have some alfalfa and raise a lot of oats and barley for their own use even at that they have to buy more they make a lot of hay in low areas which is baled and hauled to winter quarters winter brings its own problems of blizzards with only a whisper of a chinook once in a while to ease the cold when the cattle drift the jahnke brothers don their warmest clothing and ride out after them ranching in this part of the country isn t exactly cowboy stuff they insist it s more a matter of farming but the jahnke brothers have had their share of rodeo honors and still do the roping at branding season and cutting out herds for breeding and shipping pete was calf roping champion of saskatchewan for a time and ben competed in shows at calgary and swift current but they ve settled down to the more serious business of raising beef nowadays all are members of the saskatchewan stock growers association of which ben is vice president this year and pete a director when conventions are held in winter the boys manage to get to them come wind or cold weather if the roads are blocked with snow they summon a light airplane to pick them up ben has a good way out however the saskatchewan river forms an icy highway past his front door to saskatchewan landing where he strikes the highway advertisement read also history reminiscences of the north west rebellion 1885

the minister for defence has defended his department s handling of the offer of two heavy lift aircraft and insisted he wasn t aware of the full details of the proposal received by his officials an investigation by the journal discovered evidence that simon coveney s defence department was aware of the offer a full eight months before the army s elite ranger wing were sent to kabul in august to spearhead an operation to rescue stranded irish citizens the department of defence refused efforts to provide two long range second hand heavy lift aircraft for the irish air corps months before that operation was launched our article published on monday revealed the purchase or lease offer was made by the seraph aviation group the ranger wing s flights to and from the war torn country were on board french and finnish aircraft as the irish air corps did not have a long range aircraft suitable for the mission speaking on prime time in august after it was confirmed that the successful mission had resulted in the rescue of dozens of irish citizens and residents coveney said he was not aware of any offer of a second hand plane the minister had just steppped out of a reception to take part in the impromptu interview and appeared to be taken by surpise by the question on the issue he was asked about the offer of two heavy lift aircraft and responded that he was not aware of it however documents obtained by the journal show that the company making the offer contacted him on his oireachtas email and on the department of defence ministerial email account while attending a conference of the defence forces officers representative body raco this week the minister was asked about the offer by the journal i certainly wasn t aware of the details of it he said i m aware that we get offers all the time and the department deals with them as they should as professional civil servants just because an offer comes in and a few months later it looks like we could have used that type of equipment doesn t mean that we should necessarily take it each time alamy stock photo alamy stock photo coveney said that the department was engaged in a multi million euro purchase of aircraft for the air corps advertisement he said that the offer of the two strategic heavy lift aircraft did not follow the normal tendering process although documents show that the seraph aviation group executive had offered to enter the normal manner procurement protocol the documents revealed that seraph had offered the two aircraft on a lease or buy outright basis they also offered to meet officials and to enter the tendering process if required this isn t how you do equipment purchase we get offers all the time for people want to do business with the department of defence in terms of equipment or whatever i mean we have a procurement process we have legal obligations in terms of procurement we have a capital expenditure programme that is multi annual we are spending a fortune on aircraft as we speak referring to recent purchases of single engine and maritime patrol aircraft he continued we have spent a lot of money on on pc 12s four of them we ve committed over 200 million to two new casas which will be arriving in the next two years so we re spending a lot of money on aviation aircraft an air corps casa which was not suitable for the mission in kabul alamy stock photo alamy stock photo coveney said that the issue of strategic heavy lift aircraft to facilitate movements of large numbers of troops and cargo was being considered in the ongoing commission on the defence forces he said that the kabul operation had shown the need for such a resource following repeated reports and commentary from former members of the defence forces the government decided to set up the independent commission its terms of reference have enabled it to examine pay conditions and resourcing across the defence forces seraph aviation group said that they would be willing to talk directly to the department in regard to the provision of aircraft we concur with the comments of the minister as we fully recognise the need for a procurement process we would be happy to engage in one should the opportunity arise as this would enable us to demonstrate the benefits and value of our proposal in that context we note that the two c295 aircraft remain available to the state the spokesperson said criticism cathal berry td a former senior officer in the army ranger wing has said that questions must be asked about the funding model for the defence forces read next related reads documents show ireland was offered aircraft eight months before afghan rescue mission despite coveney denial photos the army rangers mission to evacuate irish people from afghanistan he was speaking after the raco conference held in kildare this week and said that he and all delegates were not impressed with simon coveney s address coveney said in his speech that the commission would examine the vulnerabilities across the defence forces and link it back to the needs of government berry said my reaction to the minister s attendance at raco is that it was very disappointing the audience were very disappointed it was a great opportunity to announce tangible solutions to address the retention crisis but the minister did not do that secondly the department of public expenditure and reform was blamed a lot by the minister simon coveney is the minister for foreign affairs and is the minister for defence also foreign affairs is getting significant investment and resources but defence is not getting the same there is a lot of expenditure for foreign affairs new embassies opened big increase in budgets while defence is closing down barracks morale is the lowest ever in living memory and the budget is in freefall line ministers like minister coveney should take responsibility cathal berry td former officer in the army ranger wing and also medical doctor cathal berry cathal berry security council ireland is currently has a seat of the un security council the former army officer said that the current lack of funding in defence is adversely affecting ireland s international reputation other members of the council view ireland as negligent and as free loaders they will say how dare we use american and european tax money to provide for our security they believe we are not pulling our weight we are abdicating our defence and using other people s money to do it they take a very dim view we are not playing our part their view is that at the very least we need to be able to look after our own defence and security it really undermines our international reputation he added

tom barker born westmoreland england 1887 died london 1970 tom barker became the editor of the australian iww s direct action in 1915 after tom glynn was arrested in 1915 he supported industrial unionism because of the failure of labourism i was absolutely convinced after seeing politicians in both new zealand and australia that a strong and even ruthless working class body was necessary to see that people were properly protected and paid tom glynn and tom barker brought an infusion of marxist perspective to the australian socialist party and the iww clubs when they joined in 1913 all governments in modern society barker argued existed for the purpose of protecting private property and the interests of the propertied class whether the politicians were socialists or conservatives they could only safeguard and perpetuate the system of oppression barker attacked the second international for being spineless let us get to work we of the industrial workers of the world we the countryless the pariahs the hobos the migratory workers let us throw off the pusillanimity of political sentimentalists economic conditions are bringing us together in spite of ourselves and we the workers of the world are dependent upon one another born in westmoreland england in 1887 of lakeland farming stock he worked as a farmer at age 11 and then at a milkhouse at age 14 in 1905 he joined

a series of strikes in which the coloured workers refused to scab against the awu the class war is a nobler sentiment than the race war for it strives for the abolition of chains and not for their perpetuation coloureds and immigrants were an economic factor and it would be better if they organized with white workers instead of against them when edith cavell was murdered by the germans barker was disgusted by the ensuing outcry it ill becomes the capitalist press of australia to howl about the murder of one englishwoman when it consistently stood for the exploitation of little girls who have been taken from the playground and pushed into the unhealthy and dangerous atmosphere of the factories working for wages that are not sufficient to house and feed them he believed feminists to be misguided the women s suffrage had not secured equal pay for equal work he believed women should be fighting with the men of their class and not against them he also blamed capitalism for prostitution when wandering the streets of sydney one sees the ever growing army of the night with its sweet recruits and its battered veterans you can see the gripping hand of commercialism and low wages under

lapse to insure fairness and true democracy when the labour government began arresting wobblies for selling anti conscription literature in sydney s domain baker spent a week in jail rather than pay

representatives in the room they barricaded the doors after cutting the lights the representatives where rescued by police after breaking a number of windows and shortly afterwards the prohibition of selling literature was lifted after the conscription issue was defeated in referendum barker claimed the iww through its speaking tours of sydney and wide circulation of literature had swayed public opinion barker detested state ownership of industries and fought for worker controlled industry after the capitalist turns his profitless industry over to the state his interest comes in regularly year by year and he is save the worry of managing the industry and trying to calm the waters of industrial discontent it is no consolation to the worker to know that the state exploits him now in place of his capitalist employer there is no hope for the working class in state ownership let us organize to control society by organizing to control the job we who would be free ourselves must strike the first blow barker sent out the call for wobblies to send donations to support the 1916 wildcat strike by shearers he also went on a speaking tour to raise funds for the miners strike at broken hill which was for shorter hours and better pay in 1916 barker cautioned australian workers against jingoism and said they have no quarrel with german austrian and turkish workers let those who own australia do the fighting put the wealthiest in the front ranks the middle class next and follow them with the politicians lawyers and ministers answer the declaration of war with call for a

in russia lenin has denounced them he worked with big bill haywood on the autonomous industrial colony kuzbas which sought to utilize foreign expertise to bring heavy industry to siberia he never joined the communist party of russia because it conflicted with his iww ideals when the matter was brought to lenin and trotsky both men support him in 1926 he and his wife berta isaakovna went to nyc

extension shared these basics at the economic alliance coffee talk a regular remote chat largely among wadena county leaders on nov 15 ray works with crops that the university breeds including barley oats camelina and hemp and previously worked with whole foods market and national cooperative grocers association in commerce a supply chain is a system of organizations people activities information and resources involved in supplying a product or service to a consumer ray noted during the virtual meeting each company has their set supply chain to manage in the short and long term which impacts the larger supply chain as a whole for example a company might have parts delivered to their factory these parts are transformed into a specific product based on the internal system the products are transported and sold swan ray supply chain development specialist with regional sustainable development partnerships with university of minnesota extension contributed university of minnesota extension 2021 advertisement within a supply chain the goal is to minimize waste companies don t want to have to throw away products create too many products or have employees do work over again one thing a lot of people think of when they think of supply chain is they just think of transportation and logistics however supply chain management is production ray said supply chain management is customer service and information flows it is very very broad supply is really just a balance of that demand over time and finding the right level of production for consumption swan ray supply chain development specialist with regional sustainable development partnerships with university of minnesota extension consumer patterns impact supply chains such as how much of a certain product people are buying this demand helps companies know the amount of products that will be needed ray said consumers decide their purchases based on what is best for them whether buying in bulk or focusing on the necessities and corporations have the goal of increasing shareholder profits through more sales or decreasing production costs when the pandemic really hit the area in spring 2020 there was a demand shock as people bought extra products and bought different products based on what funds they had available both changed the demand and disrupted the supply chain ray said and when businesses worked to adjust to the new patterns there were short term supply chain failures supply is really just a balance of that demand over time and finding the right level of production for consumption ray said it takes the production side a considerable amount of time to adapt when there are products and services available why aren t they getting to consumers ray sees the truck driver shortage as the real issue besides ships waiting at port with the demand changing often and drivers having to wait long periods at port to have their trucks filled it s quite challenging for trucking companies to constantly adjust ray said advertisement as far as the supply locally chain getting to convenience stores small grocery stores even larger grocery stores there s a pretty strong network there if there

menafn ein presswire americans increasing concerned about rising taxes and financial privacy chirag giri charlotte north carolina united states november 25 2021 einpresswire com an increasing number of americans are looking for financial emancipation by seeking solutions outside of us borders as the american government tightens the noose around wealth through the new proposed tax reform those who worked their entire lives amassing their assets are left to ponder whether holding on to the american passport is actually worth it in many cases the answer is that it isn t record numbers of americans are renouncing their citizenship but they need to obtain a second one so they aren t left stateless some are already dual citizens but those who don t have a second home are steering towards the caribbean nation of st kitts nevis a small commonwealth country that offers its citizenship in exchange for an affordable investment in its economy why are us citizens renouncing their citizenship the us long labelled as the holy grail of immigration and home to the american dream is not what it used to be the american dream turned out to be shackled by a complex and exhausting tax regime while financial privacy in the us is near extinction the american foreign account tax compliance act fatca has been a thorn in every american s side living outside of the us complex tax return filings and debilitating tax rates have left americans abroad reeling no one likes paying taxes but people expect something in return when they do those living abroad are hardly getting the bare minimum in return for their taxes making it no wonder why many of them especially those living in tax friendly nations are looking to relieve themselves of the massive tax burden why americans are rushing towards st kitts nevis situated in the caribbean st kitts nevis is already popular among the american elite as a touristic hotspot full of luxurious resorts and unmatched natural beauty but the most intriguing allure of st kitts nevis is its citizenship by investment program which has seen a massive influx of american applicants in the past couple of years starting at 150 000 usd investment for a single applicant an applicant with a clean criminal background can become a citizen of st kitts nevis within a few months the country s passport which provides visa free travel to 157 destinations worldwide including the uk eu and singapore is one of the best in the world for americans looking to escape the usa s massive tax burden the st kitts nevis passport offers a good alternative in terms of global mobility but goes beyond that in what it offers in terms of financial emancipation the caribbean country does not impose wealth capital gains or inheritance tax more crucially it does not tax its citizens based on their citizenship status rather their status as tax residents this means anyone who does not spend more than six months a year in st kitts nevis is not taxed on their worldwide income the lack of capital gains and wealth tax in st kitts nevis is extremely interesting especially now since the us government is looking into nearly doubling capital gains tax while gifts and estate tax may rise a staggering 62 hence st kitts nevis offers a robust alternative for the american elite to safeguard their assets against ludicrous tax rates but it isn t just about the taxes it is about the entire financial framework in the caribbean country nevis in particular has a robust financial services sector that is highly exclusive and extremely private people will still announce their assets and income to the government to maintain their legitimate standing but the public especially foreign creditors will find it near impossible to gather information about a nevisian bank account or llc except what the owner wants to divulge this gives the wealthy more privacy in a world dominated by social media and a lack of confidentiality nevis also has a great setup for asset protection tools such as offshore bank accounts and offshore trusts which are legal tools one can use to protect their wealth a crypto haven another reason americans are flocking to st kitts nevis is the crypto friendly nature of the country american cryptocurrency investors are finding it harder and harder to maintain their investments as their nationality can be a hindrance in important coin offerings or mega crypto deals but it isn t just the challenging investment landscape as the irs is trying to crack down on cryptocurrency and is taxing cryptocurrency gains as it would stocks or bonds st kitts nevis does not impose capital gains tax so that is an important point but the overall perspective of the st kittian government towards cryptocurrency is what draws the likes of roger ver maybe the most influential bitcoin investor to its shores roger ver gained a st kitts nevis citizenship through investment a few years back and has been living his life worry free on the islands he even claimed in a recent interview that not having to file tax returns even if he did not have to pay anything was one of the greatest feelings in the world due to the complexity of the tedious time consuming process crypto investors like roger will find a country that is welcoming towards cryptocurrency in st kitts nevis as most of its banks deal with cryptocurrency investors bitcoin atms can be found throughout the nation and the government is even part of the first union to launch an official digital currency dubbed d coin it is no wonder then why american cryptocurrency investors are heading over to the sunny shores of st kitts nevis for more information about st kitts nevis and how you can become a citizen through investment contact hepta global today to book a free

valuations do not matter until they do as the pandemic was in full swing during 2020 green energy stocks and the etfs that hold them did incredibly well blackrock inc s global clean energy etf ticker icln and the invesco solar etf tan were up 71 and 125 respectively before the 2020 election when it became clear that biden would become president and democrats would retain their majority in the house and possibly gain enough seats to get a majority in the senate the green energy complex got an additional boost after pfizer s announcement of an effective vaccine last november 9 the surge in green energy stocks continued until the beginning of february of this year tan was up 76 between the november 3 election and february 9 when it peaked with most green energy stocks and etfs like many other growth stocks in the market green energy stocks started to go the opposite direction of rising long term treasury yields in the spring investors who had been willing to pay for growth at any cost were suddenly hesitant when treasury yields were no longer at just a few basis points the rationale goes something like this if interest rates rise a higher discount rate is used to value these businesses and companies valued more on what they will hopefully one day earn far out in the future such as growth stocks are worth less relative to companies that earn their profits now when discounted back to a value today the 10 year yield on u s treasuries went from 0 9 at the start of the year and peaked at 1 7 at the end of march although the move was significant because the yield almost doubled it was nowhere near its 10 year historical average of 2 2 but what sparked the selloff was the velocity of the move in rates with investors now fearing elevated inflation they started to pile into cyclical stocks that would benefit from a rising rate environment green energy stocks quietly fell anywhere from 40 to 70 from their most recent highs in february to the middle of may of this year although the move down may have been justified considering the surge in green energy stocks throughout 2020 and into the beginning of 2021 it may have seemed counterintuitive because of the green energy policy president biden supports compared to the fossil fuel energy policy his predecessor backed while the green energy space of the market cratered during the spring fossil fuels soared but a similar pattern occurred when president trump took office bank and energy stocks rallied as investors expected deregulation and tax cuts still the state street energy select sector spdr fund xle spent much of trump s presidency below the high it made in december of 2016 the state street financial select sector spdr fund xlf was up more than 50 between the 2016 election and late january 2018 but had fallen over 25 by the end of 2018 is the lesson here to go against what seems rational to most investors maybe not stocks and their valuations get ahead of themselves all the time if they do there are generally periods to follow where the stocks come down and companies must grow into their valuations if the underlying business is still doing well and there are tailwinds for the industry in which it operates the company will likely grow into its valuation after green energy stocks came down from their highs they have started to stage a comeback since mid may and the valuations in the space seem more reasonable now than they were at the beginning of the year a quaker immigration divestment list and the growing scope of esg data enphase energy inc enph a company that makes solar microinverters is back to making all time highs after its 50 drawdown at the same time the company s enterprise to sales multiple has gone from 29 times sales at the beginning of this year to 26 times sales now per bloomberg but many stocks in the icln and tan etfs are still far off their highs and the etfs themselves are down more than 20 from their highs in february a low valuation is not a good reason to buy an asset still investors should ask themselves if the accelerating green energy trend and the massive drawdown the sector has seen this year does not present a buying opportunity with world leaders announcing goals of making their countries carbon neutral in the coming decades at the recent 26th un climate change conference of the parties cop26 some renewable energy companies are here to stay and help those countries transition in the long run investors should see the rewards of having at least some allocation to green energy as the underlying trend of governments and businesses converting from fossil fuels to renewables is on a global scale and as esg investing is becoming the standard more funds are likely to flow into the area there are few regulations concerning sustainability and esg investing today yet if the u s is following in europe s footsteps more will come and green energy companies might benefit from their sustainable line of business for comparison consider the early days of the internet if you bought amazon amzn at its ipo in 1997 you saw the stock surge for a couple of years after that however you had to endure a 95 drawdown from the peak in 1999 to the trough in 2001 one should not forget that there were also stocks in 1999 that never recovered from their highs and companies that went out of business altogether still there was a great buying opportunity in many businesses after their valuations had come down the transition from fossil fuel to renewable energy is arguably on par if not a stronger trend than the internet not all green energy companies today are amazon but when stocks and valuations come down like they have yet the underlying trend is still intact it is worth looking at as investors
wadena minn supply chain issues they re the dreaded topics for every supplier company and consumer or maybe you ve seen grocery prices increase schools having to change their menus or low covid 19 testing supplies but what is a supply chain and how did this happen swan ray supply chain development specialist with regional sustainable development partnerships with university of minnesota extension shared these basics at the economic alliance coffee talk a regular remote chat largely among wadena county leaders on nov 15 ray works with crops that the university breeds including barley oats camelina and hemp and previously worked with whole foods market and national cooperative grocers association in commerce a supply chain is a system of organizations people activities information and resources involved in supplying a product or service to a consumer ray noted during the virtual meeting each company has their set supply chain to manage in the short and long term which impacts the larger supply chain as a whole for example a company might have parts delivered to their factory these parts are transformed into a specific product based on the internal system the products are transported and sold swan ray supply chain development specialist with regional sustainable development partnerships with university of minnesota extension contributed university of minnesota extension 2021 advertisement within a supply chain the goal is to minimize waste companies don t want to have to throw away products create too many products or have employees do work over again one thing a lot of people think of when they think of supply chain is they just think of transportation and logistics however supply chain management is production ray said supply chain management is customer service and information flows it is very very broad supply is really just a balance of that demand over time and finding the right level of production for consumption swan ray supply chain development specialist with regional sustainable development partnerships with university of minnesota extension consumer patterns impact supply chains such as how much of a certain product people are buying this demand helps companies know the amount of products that will be needed ray said consumers decide their purchases based on what is best for them whether buying in bulk or focusing on the necessities and corporations have the goal of increasing shareholder profits through more sales or decreasing production costs when the pandemic really hit the area in spring 2020 there was a demand shock as people bought extra products and bought different products based on what funds they had available both changed the demand and disrupted the supply chain ray said and when businesses worked to adjust to the new patterns there were short term supply chain failures supply is really just a balance of that demand over time and finding the right level of production for consumption ray said it takes the production side a considerable amount of time to adapt when there are products and services available why aren t they getting to consumers ray sees the truck driver shortage as the real issue besides ships waiting at port with the demand changing often and drivers having to wait long periods at port to have their trucks filled it s quite challenging for trucking companies to constantly adjust ray said advertisement as far as the supply locally chain getting to convenience stores small grocery stores even larger grocery stores there s a pretty strong network there if there s a problem normally as a company we had a 98 fill rate the problem comes before the wholesaler and the local distribution methods said wadena county commissioner murlyn kreklau he worked for 46 years at mason brothers which delivers in five states if the company could get it they distribute it they have trucks going anyway and they have the network to do it the issues lie beyond the distributors that are serving most of minnesota it s a bigger issue than when something s not available it s because they can t get it haley dietman loads a candy order at mason brothers in wadena in march 2020 rebecca mitchell pioneer journal companies including agricultural businesses also have experienced issues getting a railroad spot or having enough trucks to transport the products availability is one factor that impacts how products are moved globally nationally and within the region i would anticipate that in ag you will see higher food prices continue input costs are increasing directly to the farmer and therefore they will need a higher price per bushel to make ends meet said cory detloff central lakes college ag and energy center and farm business management director in a message corn alone will cost more than 125 acre more to raise in 2022 than 2021 that cost will need to be passed on to the consumer the labor shortage throughout every industry means certain work can t be completed or in a less timely manner but detloff also wonders how students choosing jobs over college will impact the supply chain long term while ray said she hasn t seen a decline in enrollment if jobs are paying higher than before younger workers might choose entering a job as academia we need to consider the way that we educate a little bit differently especially in the career and tech ed institutions right now are areas we re really seeing that demand out there detloff said something that we re focused on at central lakes college is trying to get people out the door faster and prepare them for the workforce the federal covid 19 vaccine mandate for private businesses with over 100 employees will also impact the number of workers available advertisement on the logistics side supply needs like different masks required change how companies store products at tri county health care the inventory system was well set and items came in a timely manner during the pandemic the hospital bought items earlier and searches for space to store the items president and ceo joel beiswenger said something that we didn t anticipate and i think is going to create a new challenge for businesses is that you are having to invest a lot more operating capital in inventory management beiswenger said one thing that covid has taught us and the supply chain challenges right now is we better stock up corn alone will cost more than 125 acre more to raise in 2022 than 2021 that cost will need to be passed on to the consumer cory detloff central lakes college ag and energy center and farm business management director fresh products or cold chains have long been particularly challenged with a lack of storage spots ray said in july 2021 mason brothers expanded their overstock groceries storage to verndale minn with plans to create a refrigerated space there and expand the freezer space at their wadena location they store lots of popular products to try to meet the next round of demand holding of inventory and holding of goods that s going to be a constant throughout really this decade ray said there s really no easy answers for fixing supply chain issues and covid has highlighted some

campaign this summer accelerated that momentum we expect to exceed our sales projections in 2021 by more than us1 billion a1 4 billion subway s newest eat fresh refresh campaign was a play on the brand s well known eat fresh slogan picture istock some deal makers are sceptical noting that subway two years ago hired john chidsey to be its first permanent chief executive mr chidsey s most notable achievement they say may have been his stint as ceo of burger king which culminated in the chain getting sold in 2010 to restaurant brands since taking the reins at subway mr chidsey has squeezed franchisees for cash raising fees and tightening lease restrictions moves that can typically precede a sale now however deal makers say the thinking of mr buck and mr deluca s heirs remains a mystery this throws a wrench into the sale one source said of mr buck s death last week noting that elisabeth buck was now a widower now the shares might be tied up in probate mr deluca who ran the company for more than half a century did little succession planning his sister suzanne greco took the ceo job after his death but stepped down in 2018 after a rocky tenure mr deluca s son jonathan is a director on the board but has no operational role at the company ditto for mr buck s son christopher who runs the media non profit retro report no one knows what is in his will a deal maker close to the situation added of mr buck sounds like the subway sale process is on indefinite hold with restaurant brands out of the picture subway s sale prospects look dimmer roark capital s inspire brands which owns sonic and buffalo wild wings had been the other most logical buyer but it acquired subway competitor jimmy john s in 2019 yum owner of taco bell and kfc is still an outside possibility but conventional wisdom is that buying subway would drag down its stock price sources said now the most likely buyer would be a private equity firm like tpg capital which would likely pay a lower price than a major fast food operator deal makers familiar with the situation said i think it is private equity a source close to the situation said and i don t think sponsors would pay a big multiple hopes to sell the struggling chain look more complicated than ever picture istock sources briefed on the mega franchise s business whose nearly 22 000 locations nationwide generated us634 million a884 million in royalty fees last year down from us834 million a1162 million in 2019 say it would likely fetch between us8 billion a11 billion and us10 billion a14 billion in a sale that s a far cry from the us50 billion a70 billion valuation that subway had privately been eyeing as it prepped for a possible initial public offering in 2012 according to sources that also was before former spokesman jared fogle s 2015 conviction on child porn and sex crime charges meanwhile subway since has been slammed with bad publicity over its food including accusations that its bread contained chemicals found in yoga mats reports that its processed chicken contained sawdust and this year a lawsuit that alleges it has been selling fake tuna subway in 2014 changed its bread recipe after the yoga mat flap but has consistently defended its chicken and tuna in may 2012 subway said it had over 25 000 us restaurants and it was growing at a quick pace now that number is lower than 22 000 with more than 1000 net closings a year for the last several years as many franchisees lose money outside of the us australia was its first overseas market where it hit 1000 stores with the first subway opening in perth in 1988 there are potential positives to subway waiting to begin a formal sales process or even listing its shares insiders said the 56 year old chain recently started producing audited financials for the first time under mr deluca the chain had more than 100 related entities making it hard to fully understand a source said this article originally appeared on the new york post and

few things scream special occasion like a properly cooked roast turkey from its eye popping bronze finish to its large impressive size a roast turkey is sure to turn heads like duane the rock johnson at a dinner party at the same time cooking turkey can feel like an imposing feat after all that same size that makes turkey a grand spectacle also makes it a potential nightmare to deal with for aspiring home cooks this includes adding flavor to the bird s interior as well as temperature management for its white and dark meat portions the other barbecue sauce bbq chicken with alabama white sauce recipe when folks say they don t like roast turkey it s likely because they had one that didn t have much flavor beyond the skin or had either dry breast meat or undercooked thighs that s unfortunate as a good roast turkey is one of the most delicious things that you can eat just ask my relatives who have turned from turkey haters to turkey gobblers after they finally tasted a proper roast turkey today i ll share two techniques to help you achieve turkey perfection in the kitchen or your backyard more easily say hello to brining and spatchcocking why should you brine turkey there s a reason why batman can beat superman despite not having superpowers that would be preparation yes these extra steps require a bit more effort the payoff however can transform your turkey travails from a nightmare to a culinary dream come true take brining for example at its most basic form a brine involves mixing a gallon of water with 1 cup of salt simply soaking meat in that solution will make a huge difference in the final cooked product for starters brining imparts flavor into the meat this is especially helpful for large pieces of protein like turkey which can be difficult to flavor on the inside brining also makes meat a lot more juicy by allowing it to absorb more moisture this is especially a godsend for lean turkey breast meat which can easily dry out before dark meat such as the legs and thighs cook properly that extra moisture also provides extra breathing room before the turkey meat turns tough giving cooks additional margin for error in case they cook it a bit too long why should you spatchcock turkey spatchcocking a turkey just so you can have some weird looking flat bird might sound like unnecessary work there is a reason however to this seeming madness if you ve ever roasted a whole turkey then you know that one of the big challenges is the uneven cooking times for the breast meat vs the leg and thighs since the breast cooks faster it ll often end up drying out by the time the dark meat is done kitchen gift guide gift ideas for home cooks from gadgets to pans and more brining helps alleviate this issue to an extent spatchcocking however takes it to a whole other level by cutting off the backbone and laying the turkey flat with the breast side up you can get more even cooking in the process and cut your cooking time to boot here s how to spatchcock a turkey courtesy of pitmaster and traeger grills ambassador danielle bennett also known as diva q place the turkey on a chopping board with its back facing upward use a knife to score the turkey along each side of the backbone going as far down as you can cut the score marks will act as a guide for cutting out the backbone take some kitchen shears and start cutting through the scored section if you need extra support you can grab the lower part of both legs and start cutting from the tail don t be afraid to also twist the shears when you hit thicker troublesome areas like the section near the thigh joints as well as the neck area just cut and twist to crack those spots open once the backbone is out turn over the chicken so the breast side is now facing upward use a cpr motion to push down to flatten the chicken even more you should hear a cracking sound if you ve done it right tuck in the wingtips and spread out the turkey legs on that note onward to the recipe ingredient list now it s time to check out our recipe here are the ingredients you need to make this spatchcock smoked paprika turkey with herb butter and orange dashi brine the bird 1 turkey 10 15 pounds olive oil for rubbing pepper for sprinkling paprika for sprinkling the brine 1 cup salt 1 4 cup sugar 4 tbsp chicken bouillon powder 2 tbsp dashi powder 1 tbsp garlic powder 1 tbsp peppercorns 1 gallon water 1 can frozen orange juice concentrate ice and water to cover turkey the compound butter 2 sticks unsalted butter 1 tsp rosemary chopped 1 tsp thyme chopped 1 tsp parsley chopped 1 tsp garlic powder putting it all together the first step is to make the brine in a large pot combine all brine ingredients except the frozen orange juice and ice heat the liquid enough to dissolve all the powdered ingredients turn off the heat then add the frozen orange juice and mix to dissolve let the brine cool once the brine has cooled pour it into a larger container if needed then add the turkey pour enough ice and water so the brine covers the bird brine overnight leave out the two sticks of butter until they reach room temperature if you re in a hurry microwave the butter for 10 seconds to speed up the process if the butter is still hard microwave for another 10 seconds you want to just soften it as opposed to melting it add the rest of the compound butter ingredients and mix well you can use this right away or place it in cling wrap then roll and twist the plastic like a candy wrapper you can then keep it in the fridge until needed by the way if you d rather inject your turkey instead of brining it you can mix 100 grams of the compound butter with ⅔ cups stock ¼ cup orange juice and a teaspoon of salt in a saucepan heat it up until the butter just melts and mixes with the rest of the ingredients don t boil the mixture and you have a brine for injecting instead now back to our regularly scheduled program take out the turkey from the brine and spatchcock it using the instructions given earlier next we ll adopt a technique used in preparing peking duck boil some water an electric kettle works great with this if you have one and with the turkey breast side facing up start pouring some boiling water on the skin to tighten and firm it up pat it with a paper towel then let the skin dry once dry it s time to season the bird rub the turkey skin with olive oil and make sure you get the skin on the underside as well the turkey should be sufficiently salted due to the brine so extra salt should not be needed instead apply a liberal amount of pepper and garlic powder for extra flavor and color sprinkle smoked paprika on the skin as well roasting the turkey temps and more whether you use your home oven or a pellet grill there are various ways to roast a turkey when it comes to temperature you can start high then go low start low then go high or maintain a single temperature across your cook times can also vary depending on the weight of the turkey the one constant is that you typically want to reach an internal temperature of 165f so it s important to have a thermometer ideally a probe thermometer with an alarm that you can stick midway into the thickest part of the breast a quick read thermometer is also good so you can easily check the temperature between the leg and thigh note that carryover cooking means you can take out the turkey at 160f and it ll reach 165 while resting one of the neat things about spatchcock turkey is that you can go use a higher temperature to cook the bird faster cooking a turkey at the standard 325f for example can take between three to four hours with a spatchcocked turkey you can go up to 450f and be done much quicker typically less than an hour and a half due to the flat surface otherwise if you re using a pellet grill like the traeger ironwood 885 which has the super smoke feature you can start at 225f for two to two and a half hours to get that extra smoke then you can raise the temperature to 375f for the final hour to hour and a half as the turkey cooks melt some of that compound butter in the microwave and start brushing it on the skin depending on how long the cook is you ll need to do this at least a couple of times or more you can also do one final brush prior to serving voila your smoked paprika turkey with herb butter and orange dashi brine is done jason hidalgo covers business and technology for the reno gazette

konstantopoulos are behind the asx s new joiner key members of the artrya team they put their heads together in may 2019 and formed the artrya business aiming to bring tech to market that could lead to a heart disease diagnosis before it s too late their answer is the salix product suite a range of ai powered solutions that analyses cardiac ct scans to rapidly accurately and non invasively detect cad complementing sca is artrya s salix coronary flow scf solution which is currently in development essentially scf measures coronary blood flow without the need for invasive procedures that are normally associated with this assessment by delivering a whole of heart assessment at the point of care from a single ccta scan the scf solution can save time and cost to patients healthcare providers insurers and national health systems a growing market aya is going public as it prepares to engage a market with strong growth potential artrya has positioned salix to disrupt the global market for ccta scans and ica procedures the medtech reported in its prospectus an estimated 20 million cardiac ct scans are expected to be performed annually in north america and europe by 2025 in north america alone cardiac ct procedures are forecast to rise 76 from 11 1 million to 19 5 million between 2021 and 2025 according to artrya growing demand is being driven by global population growth and ageing societies these factors increase the cad burden on national healthcare systems and the need for imaging services the company explained the global shortage of specialist physicians compounds the pressure on radiologists moreover the global burden of cad is forecast to increase with covid 19 causing cardiac injury during and after acute infections as covid continues to capture the world s attention and demand for cardiac ct scans heats up it stands to reason that ai driven solutions like salix could enjoy a strong uptake in teleradiology applications the salix product suite can help identify vulnerable plaque a key trigger for heart attacks the bottom line as a fully fledged asx lister and the latest to go public amid a biotech boom artrya promises it will save lives with its ai heart tech signing off in the prospectus non executive chair bernie ridgway said artrya had achieved many milestones since its incorporation the company was formed because its founders believed methods of cad detection were old fashioned and had not progressed for decades he explained they saw an opportunity to use the power of ai to solve this problem and save lives by helping people avoid a heart attack and possible death
the death of a nuclear physicist who co founded subway restaurants has thrown the fast food giant s future into doubt with deal makers fretting that hopes to sell the struggling chain look more complicated than ever peter buck whose us1000 a1394 loan to fred deluca in 1965 to start a sandwich shop in bridgeport connecticut launched a global fast food empire that made him a billionaire died last week at the age of 90 the company said what s less known is the fact that subway earlier this year held informal talks to possibly sell itself to restaurant brands international the brazil based owner of burger king sources close to the situation told the new york post those talks fizzled the sources said culminating in restaurant brands move last week to instead buy subway s smaller us based sandwich competitor firehouse subs for us1 1 billion a1 53 billion attempts to sell the struggling chain have so far not been successful picture istock negotiations with subway had fallen apart insiders said partly because of disagreements on price not only between restaurant brands and subway but also between mr buck and co founder mr deluca s widow elisabeth each controlled 50 per cent of the chain since mr deluca s death in 2015 and one of them it wasn t clear which had been holding out for a higher price than the other according to a source close to the situation a restaurant brands spokesman said the company bought firehouse subs partly because of its significant growth potential as for subway the company said it doesn t comment on market speculation or rumours subway declined to comment specifically when asked about the talks with restaurant brands instead it said it remains focused on a turnaround subway is not for sale a company spokesperson said in a statement sales momentum has steadily been building since the beginning of 2021 and the launch of subway s eat fresh refresh campaign this summer accelerated that momentum we expect to exceed our sales projections in 2021 by more than us1 billion a1 4 billion subway s newest eat fresh refresh campaign was a play on the brand s well known eat fresh slogan picture istock some deal makers are sceptical noting that subway two years ago hired john chidsey to be its first permanent chief executive mr chidsey s most notable achievement they say may have been his stint as ceo of burger king which culminated in the chain getting sold in 2010 to restaurant brands since taking the reins at subway mr chidsey has squeezed franchisees for cash raising fees and tightening lease restrictions moves that can typically precede a sale now however deal makers say the thinking of mr buck and mr deluca s heirs remains a mystery this throws a wrench into the sale one source said of mr buck s death last week noting that elisabeth buck was now a widower now the shares might be tied up in probate mr deluca who ran the company for more than half a century did little succession planning his sister suzanne greco took the ceo job after his death but stepped down in 2018 after a rocky tenure mr deluca s son jonathan is a director on the board but has no operational role at the company ditto for mr buck s son christopher who runs the media non profit retro report no one knows what is in his will a deal maker close to the situation added of mr buck sounds like the subway sale process is on indefinite hold with restaurant brands out of the picture subway s sale prospects look dimmer roark capital s inspire brands which owns sonic and buffalo wild wings had been the other most logical buyer but it acquired subway competitor jimmy john s in 2019 yum owner of taco bell and kfc is still an outside possibility but conventional wisdom is that buying subway would drag down its stock price sources said now the most likely buyer would be a private equity firm like tpg capital which would likely pay a lower price than a major fast food operator deal makers familiar with the situation said i think it is private equity a source close to the situation said and i don t think sponsors would pay a big multiple hopes to sell the struggling chain look more complicated than ever picture istock sources briefed on the mega franchise s business whose nearly 22 000 locations nationwide generated us634 million a884 million in royalty fees last year down from us834 million a1162 million in 2019 say it would likely fetch between us8 billion a11 billion and us10 billion a14 billion in a sale that s a far cry from the us50 billion a70 billion valuation that subway had privately been eyeing as it prepped for a possible initial public offering in 2012 according to sources that also was before former spokesman jared fogle s 2015 conviction on child porn and sex crime charges meanwhile subway since has been slammed with bad publicity over its food including accusations that its bread contained chemicals found in yoga mats reports that its processed chicken contained sawdust and this year a lawsuit that alleges it has been selling fake tuna subway in 2014 changed its bread recipe after the yoga mat flap but has consistently defended its chicken and tuna in may 2012 subway said it had over 25 000 us restaurants and it was growing at a quick pace now that number is lower than 22 000 with more than 1000 net closings a year for the last several years as many franchisees lose money outside of the us australia was its first overseas market where it hit 1000 stores with the first subway opening in perth in 1988 there are potential positives to subway waiting to begin a formal sales process or even listing its shares insiders said the 56 year old chain recently started producing audited financials for the first time under mr deluca the chain had more than 100 related entities making it hard to fully understand a source said this article originally appeared on the new york post and was reproduced with permission
dollar tree ceo michael witynski who raked in around 11 million in total compensation last year announced tuesday that his company is raising prices to 1 25 at stores across the united states pointing to the current inflationary environment corporations are using the excuse of inflation to raise prices and make fatter profits but observers weren t buying witynski s explanation for the imminent price hike which was publicized as dollar tree reported 216 8 million in net profits for the third quarter of 2021 the 25 price increase is expected to take effect at dollar tree stores nationwide in early 2022 dollar tree made 1 230 000 000 in profits this year gave its ceo 10 767 883 and pays workers as little as 8 32 an hour over 7 400 dollar tree employees are forced to rely on food stamps and medicaid subsidized by u s taxpayers warren gunnels majority staff director for senate budget committee chair bernie sanders i vt pointed out on twitter unfettered greed is corporate america closing u s factories where workers made 30 hour opening sweatshops abroad where workers make 30 cents hour hiring u s workers to sell the sweatshop goods for 8 hour and blaming inflation for a 25 price increase at dollar tree gunnels wrote dollar tree s decision to push higher costs onto consumers follows a growing trend of companies citing inflationary pressures in the economy to justify price hikes even as they bring in record profits and lavishly reward their executives and shareholders in 2020 according to a recent analysis by the economic policy institute ceos made 351 times as much as a typical worker and ceo pay has soared by 1 322 since 1978 the institute for policy studies noted in a may study that witynski who took over as dollar tree s ceo in july of 2020 received 11 3 million in total compensation last year that s 715 times as much as the pay for the company s median worker a part time u s store employee who earned 15 816 ips observed a report released earlier this month by the watchdog group accountable us found that at least a dozen major u s corporations have reported nearly 11 billion in profits the same quarter they announced price increases along with over 34 billion in stock buybacks and dividends this year as millions of americans are already struggling against a worsening hunger crisis eight of these companies including proctor gamble pepsico and coca cola have jacked up food prices or announced their intent to do so despite recent healthy financial reports the group said while acknowledging that many factors including major supply chain disruptions caused by the coronavirus pandemic are contributing to rising u s inflation progressive economists and lawmakers have argued that consolidated corporate power is a key driver of recent price increases corporations are using the excuse of inflation to raise prices and make fatter profits the result is a transfer of wealth from consumers to corporate executives and major investors former labor secretary robert reich wrote in a blog post earlier this month this has nothing to do with inflation folks it has everything to do with the concentration of market power in a relatively few hands new inflation is being blamed on workers and government spending the real culprit corporate greed in our new episode of the class room we dug into financial reports to investigate the real reason prices are going up hint corporate profits have never been higher pic twitter com mpmceddnij more perfect union moreperfectus november 23 2021 the wall street journal reported last week that as the coronavirus continues to wreak havoc worldwide executives of u s companies are seizing a once in a generation opportunity to raise prices to match and in some cases outpace their own higher expenses nearly two out of three of the biggest u s publicly traded companies have reported fatter profit margins so far this year than they did over the same stretch of 2019 before the covid 19 outbreak the journal noted nearly 100 of these giants have booked 2021 profit margins the share of each dollar of sales a company can pocket that are at least 50 above 2019 levels on monday sen elizabeth warren d mass called on the justice department to investigate major poultry companies anticompetitive practices that have lined the pockets of executives and shareholders while raising prices for families at the grocery store ahead of thanksgiving lack of competition in the poultry industry is allowing these massive companies to squeeze both american consumers and farmers to fuel record corporate profits and payouts to shareholders warren said in a statement when companies have monopoly power as massive suppliers they can jack up prices of the goods they sell and when those same companies have complete or substantial market power as large employers or buyers of inputs also known as monopsony power they can suppress their own costs for those inputs including workers wages she added this is the worst of all worlds where wages are held back while prices are jacked up faiz shakir founder of the advocacy journalism organization more perfect union wrote in the new republic earlier this week that corporate america has seized on the fears of inflation to jack up prices on you and make a ton more money for months they have with one hand fueled talk of inflation as a way to make obscene profits off the backs of consumers that s bad enough shakir noted but with the other hand they have been manipulating the talk of inflation to engage in a full frontal assault on president biden s efforts to pass a build back better bill for working families as we head into thanksgiving and christmas and we all look forward to large enjoyable feasts with friends and family we should rightly harbor anger about inflation shakir continued not just that they made us pay more for turkey cranberries and pie crusts we re having to pay more because corporate america made a choice to raise prices on us and then on top of that it tried to manipulate your fear about those prices to keep you from getting paid leave home care childcare and climate change action corporate america

in the latest ev sector report the ev kingpin tesla inc nasdaq tsla has cemented its credentials as one of the few electric vehicle manufacturers ready to challenge the ice hegemony according to a report by the korea automotive technology institute kaii global ev sales have exceeded 3 million units in the first three quarters of 2021 a run rate that puts it on course to break 4 million units a year for the first time ever bloombergnef is even more optimistic and expects global sales of electric passenger vehicles this year to clock in at 5 6 million units good for an impressive 8 of new vehicle sales wedbush securities forecasts that tesla alone could grab up to 50 of the 5 trillion ev market in the coming years with the rest of the manufacturers fighting over the remaining scraps with that in mind wedbush analyst daniel ives maintains his outperform rating raising his price target on tesla from 1 100 to 1 400 per share but ives bull case is 1 800 while tesla has been busy trying to corner the chinese market quite successfully wedbush estimates that from 2022 onwards china will be worth 400 per share for tesla on a company basis tesla remains the most popular model after moving 625 624 units in the third quarter 51 more than second placed china s saic motor which sold 413 037 units volkswagen 287 852 units and china s byd corp nyse byd with 189 751 units tesla has definitely established a strong head start on the competition in the ev market that ice incumbents as well as newer pure play ev upstarts will have a hard time catching up to keep an eye on china tesla stock rallied further monday after musk tweeted about the launch of the model s plaid in china for mid 2022 model s plaid is sickkkk musk has tweeted the 131 100 model s plaid features 1 020 horsepower a 17 inch touchscreen a steering yoke and has an estimated epa rated range of up to 390 miles china is the world s largest car market and it s the key here with ives calling it the linchpin to the overall bull thesis on tesla for q3 tesla s china sales were almost half the volume of its u s sales and climbing tesla reported 3 11 billion in ev sales in china for q3 a figure that represents 48 5 of its 6 41 billion in u s sales for the same time period it s also more than a 41 increase over china sales a year ago in january 2020 tesla delivered its first locally manufactured evs in china this year tesla started delivering its second model to the chinese straight from its gigafactory in shanghai the model 3 and model y are now the top three evs in terms of sales in china and now it s offering loans in china to spur more sales tesla s financial products even include some with zero down payments profitability and catalysts for 2022 for every quarter of 2021 so far tesla has managed to increase its profit margin largely because of reduced costs and higher sales that momentum is expected to continue next year with intensifying production demand that is clearly on track to increase and new factories coming on line if we see any improvement in supply chains for raw materials next year tesla will benefit further on monday tesla filed for approval for the first phase of its planned gigafactory texas in austin to produce the model y tesla will invest 1 billion in the texas gigafactory and construction is expected to be completed by the end of this year already the complex would contain five separate facilities it s also building gigafactory berlin in germany which has met with some delays in the environmental approval process even without these catalysts tesla is blowing everyone else away in terms of volume the financial times suggests that vw is the only carmaker that stands a chance of overtaking tesla s volume by 2024 while all other major automakers are on track to significantly scale up their ev offerings bernstein ihs and ev volumes com say they won t come close to tesla is apple really a threat to tesla the threat to tesla from giant smartphone maker apple inc nasdaq aapl which has reportedly stepped up its efforts to create an autonomous car thanks to a recent chip breakthrough is impressive but still in the fairly distant future apple has set a goal to produce a fully self driving car by 2025 though it s yet to announce a production partner anytime soon for the self driving car project nothing has delivered us a more impressive wealth generation story in the past couple of years like tesla it s certainly with that in mind that apple which has gone back and forth over the apple car appears to have turned things up a notch in the autonomous driving arena morgan stanley analyst adam jona thinks the interest in apple entering the electric shared autonomy space in transportation has been accelerated by the soaring valuation of tesla and other ev stocks in a validation of the wealth creation potential however jonas and team do not think apple will bring a car to the market in the traditional sense we believe a car without steering wheel or pedals must be a shared service and not an owned car to be clear we do not believe consumers will own title to a fully autonomous car but will engage in the service as a subscription or transport utility advertisement jonas and team also think apple s autonomous car story will play out slowly likewise morgan stanley doesn t view apple s potential entry into the autonomous mobility market as a major threat to tesla for now we think nothing holds a candle to tesla in the ev space by charles kennedy for oilprice com important by reading our content you

the 357 magnum round is longer than the 38 special preventing the more powerful round from being inserted into the cylinders of the less powerful revolvers here s what you need to remember the magnum research desert eagle is one of the most recognizable pistols today while the desert eagle is best known for being chambered in 50 action express and 44 magnum a 357 magnum version also exists the 357 magnum was originally developed from the 38 special round and was the first magnum round ever invented while the two rounds are dimensionally similar there are clear differences between the two the 357 magnum round is longer than the 38 special preventing the more powerful round from being inserted into the cylinders of the less powerful revolvers on the other hand 38 special rounds can be loaded into 357 magnum guns providing a less powerful lower recoil and less expensive shooting experience the 357 magnum is considerably more powerful than its parent round the 38 special a 38 special full metal jacket round will hit with the force of 189 pounds of pressure per square foot at a subsonic muzzle velocity of 810 feet per second a similar 357 magnum cartridge with hit with 575 pounds at 1 440 feet per second more than doubling the force and increase of velocity well above supersonic levels with essentially the same cartridge was a considerable accomplishment here are five of the best 357 magnum firearms in existence recommended 5 worst guns ever made recommended the world s most secretive nuclear weapons program recommended the fatal flaw that could take down an f 22 or f 35 smith wesson model 27 smith wesson was one of the first gun manufacturers sell firearms in 357 magnum having been on the original design team for the round the model 27 debuted in 1935 and despite being born in the midst of the great depression was an immediate hit with the average wait time for customers to receive the revolver up to four years eighty three years later the model 27 is still in production smith wesson has produced the model 27 with different barrel lengths over the years from four inches to ten and five eighths but the rest of the revolver has remained largely the same if anything the revolver is even better capable of handing newer high pressure p ammunition today s model 27 has a four inch barrel but is still otherwise the same in design and performance the 27 has a six round cylinder an overall length of 9 3 inches and weighs 42 ounces it is manufactured from carbon steel with a blue finish the model 27 is a double action revolver meaning a single pull of the trigger will cock the hammer advance the cylinder and drop the hammer to fire the gun this differentiates it from older revolver designs that required the hammer to be manually cocked winchester 1873 sporter the gun that won the west the winchester 1873 is perhaps the most recognizable of the lever action rifles that were popular in nineteenth century america today winchester still makes a variety of lever actions including the 1873 sporter in 357 magnum the sporter has a walnut grip stock with satin finish a twenty four inch octagonal barrel and case hardening on the receiver the rifle retains the 1873 s semi buckhorn rear sights for long range shooting combined with a gold dot bead front sight the rifle is loaded through gate on the right side and up to fourteen rounds of 357 magnum ammunition can be stored in the tubular magazine that runs under the barrel unfortunately this probably runs the rifle afoul of state firearms laws particularly california s magnum research 357 magnum desert eagle the magnum research desert eagle is one of the most recognizable pistols today while the desert eagle is best known for being chambered in 50 action express and 44 magnum a 357 magnum version also exists the 357 magnum desert eagle takes advantage of the desert eagle s built in recoil reduction system making it one of the softest shooting 357 magnum firearms in existence the lower recoil is due to the desert eagle s gas piston rotating bolt operating system similar to that used in the ak 47 as one well known gun reviewer claims shooting this 357 magnum is no worse than pulling the trigger on a glock 19 comparing a 357 magnum to a 9mm handgun is quite a statement the 357 magnum desert eagle comes standard with a six inch barrel and has an overall length of 10 75 inches because the pistol s barrel frame and slide are made out of carbon steel the desert eagle weighs 4 5 pounds unloaded the handgun takes a nine round magazine ruger lcr the ruger lcr was introduced in 2009 as a concealed carry personal defense handgun the lcr was originally chambered in 38 special and its light weight and short barrel made it difficult to shoot in 2010 ruger followed up with a larger lcr chambered in 357 magnum the lcr 357 has the same 1 87 inch barrel five round cylinder and matte black finish as the original model it also has the same overall length unlike the original lcr s aluminum frame the lcr 357 is made with a 400 series stainless steel frame in order to withstand the higher pressures of the magnum round this adds nearly a quarter pound to the revolver s weight the double action lcr lacks a hammer so it can only be fired in double action mode the lack of a protruding hammer makes for a smoother draw from under clothing colt single action army one of the most recognizable handguns from the days of the old west the colt single action army revolvers are a staple of cowboy and western films nicknamed the peacemaker the revolver sits high in the hand and today s offering from colt is completely unchanged from versions made a hundred years ago offered in 357 magnum the single action army has a 5 5 inch barrel a six round cylinder a spurred trigger reminiscent of cowboy boot spurs a blued barrel and a colorful case hardened frame the 357 magnum version weighs two pounds unloaded and nearly three pounds loaded unlike modern revolvers the single action army is a single action revolver that is the hammer must be cocked between shots to advance the cylinder to a fresh unfired round and ready the hammer this slows firing but the trigger pull is considerably lighter and shorter than double action revolvers kyle mizokami is a defense and national security writer based in san francisco who has appeared in the diplomat foreign policy war is

the death of a nuclear physicist who co founded subway restaurants has thrown the fast food giant s future into doubt with deal makers fretting that hopes to sell the struggling chain look more complicated than ever peter buck whose us1000 a1394 loan to fred deluca in 1965 to start a sandwich shop in bridgeport connecticut launched a global fast food empire that made him a billionaire died last week at the age of 90 the company said what s less known is the fact that subway earlier this year held informal talks to possibly sell itself to restaurant brands international the brazil based owner of burger king sources close to the situation told the new york post those talks fizzled the sources said culminating in restaurant brands move last week to instead buy subway s smaller us based sandwich competitor firehouse subs for us1 1 billion a1 53 billion attempts to sell the struggling chain have so far not been successful picture istock negotiations with subway had fallen apart insiders said partly because of disagreements on price not only between restaurant brands and subway but also between mr buck and co founder mr deluca s widow elisabeth each controlled 50 per cent of the chain since mr deluca s death in 2015 and one of them it wasn t clear which had been holding out for a higher price than the other according to a source close to the situation a restaurant brands spokesman said the company bought firehouse subs partly because of its significant growth potential as for subway the company said it doesn t comment on market speculation or rumours subway declined to comment specifically when asked about the talks with restaurant brands instead it said it remains focused on a turnaround subway is not for sale a company spokesperson said in a statement sales momentum has steadily been building since the beginning of 2021 and the launch of subway s eat fresh refresh campaign this summer accelerated that momentum we expect to exceed our sales projections in 2021 by more than us1 billion a1 4 billion subway s newest eat fresh refresh campaign was a play on the brand s well known eat fresh slogan picture istock some deal makers are sceptical noting that subway two years ago hired john chidsey to be its first permanent chief executive mr chidsey s most notable achievement they say may have been his stint as ceo of burger king which culminated in the chain getting sold in 2010 to restaurant brands since taking the reins at subway mr chidsey has squeezed franchisees for cash raising fees and tightening lease restrictions moves that can typically precede a sale now however deal makers say the thinking of mr buck and mr deluca s heirs remains a mystery this throws a wrench into the sale one source said of mr buck s death last week noting that elisabeth buck was now a widower now the shares might be tied up in probate mr deluca who ran the company for more than half a century did little succession planning his sister suzanne greco took the ceo job after his death but stepped down in 2018 after a rocky tenure mr deluca s son jonathan is a director on the board but has no operational role at the company ditto for mr buck s son christopher who runs the media non profit retro report no one knows what is in his will a deal maker close to the situation added of mr buck sounds like the subway sale process is on indefinite hold with restaurant brands out of the picture subway s sale prospects look dimmer roark capital s inspire brands which owns sonic and buffalo wild wings had been the other most logical buyer but it acquired subway competitor jimmy john s in 2019 yum owner of taco bell and kfc is still an outside possibility but conventional wisdom is that buying subway would drag down its stock price sources said now the most likely buyer would be a private equity firm like tpg capital which would likely pay a lower price than a major fast food operator deal makers familiar with the situation said i think it is private equity a source close to the situation said and i don t think sponsors would pay a big multiple hopes to sell the struggling chain look more complicated than ever picture istock sources briefed on the mega franchise s business whose nearly 22 000 locations nationwide generated us634 million a884 million in royalty fees last year down from us834 million a1162 million in 2019 say it would likely fetch between us8 billion a11 billion and us10 billion a14 billion in a sale that s a far cry from the us50 billion a70 billion valuation that subway had privately been eyeing as it prepped for a possible initial public offering in 2012 according to sources that also was before former spokesman jared fogle s 2015 conviction on child porn and sex crime charges meanwhile subway since has been slammed with bad publicity over its food including accusations that its bread contained chemicals found in yoga mats reports that its processed chicken contained sawdust and this year a lawsuit that alleges it has been selling fake tuna subway in 2014 changed its bread recipe after the yoga mat flap but has consistently defended its chicken and tuna in may 2012 subway said it had over 25 000 us restaurants and it was growing at a quick pace now that number is lower than 22 000 with more than 1000 net closings a year for the last several years as many franchisees lose money outside of the us australia was its first overseas market where it hit 1000 stores with the first subway opening in perth in 1988 there are potential positives to subway waiting to begin a formal sales process or even listing its shares insiders said the 56 year old chain recently started producing audited financials for the first time under mr deluca the chain had more than 100 related entities making it hard to fully understand a source said this article originally appeared on the new york post and was reproduced with permission originally published as subway co founder s death sparks concern for the sandwich chain
on thursday evening prime minister scott morrison announced australia would deploy police diplomats and defence force personnel to solomon islands to provide assistance following serious unrest in the capital honiara as the initial deployment start their first day in honiara there are mixed reports of what is happening around them australia s rapid response follows a request from the solomon islands government what has been happening on wednesday there were protests against the government of prime minister manasseh sogavare which deteriorated into rioting these riots persisted despite a snap 36 hour lockdown ordered by the government to keep people off the streets thankfully it appears there have been minimal injuries however damage to property has been extensive businesses in the chinatown district were targeted as has happened on several occasions previously public infrastructure including at least one police post and the honiara high school was also attacked after two days of rioting looting and arson things seem to be a bit quieter on friday as solomon islanders emerge from the lockdown they are taking stock assessing damage and starting to focus on what happens next for them their communities and their country why has this happened the question of why this is happening involves a complex mix of domestic politics and geopolitical shifts it is way too simple to say that this is because solomon islands switched allegiances from taiwan to china in late 2019 as some analyses suggest this was certainly a critical juncture for solomon islands but to understand what is happening now we need to take a wider and deeper perspective read more pacific nations grapple with covid s terrible toll and the desperate need for vaccines there has been a lot of focus on the discontent of people in the populous province of malaita the provincial premier daniel suidani has not held back in his criticism of the central government s decision to trash its 36 year relationship with taipei in favour of beijing and he enjoys strong support from his community less prominent is the fact that the provincial leadership of guadalcanal where the capital honiara is located have also been highly critical of sogavare calls for his resignation relate to longstanding concerns about corruption lack of service delivery and insufficient consultation on the part of his government including around the diplomatic switch in 2019 indeed many have commented that had sogavare and his ministers come out to meet with protesters and engage in a dialogue this week the ensuing disorder may have been avoided the history of australia in solomon islands on thursday it became clear the royal solomon islands police force resources were being stretched to breaking point this prompted sogavare to look for assistance from friends and neighbours requests were made to both papua new guinea and australia lloyd jones aap the request to and response from canberra marks the first activation of a security treaty that was signed between the two countries in 2017 further after operation helpem fren also known as the regional assistance mission to solomon islands or ramsi ended ramsi was a multi country deployment of police military and government advisers led by australia under the auspices of the pacific islands forum between 2003 and 2017 morrison has made it clear this current response is an assistance mission and not an intervention as was the case for ramsi it is expected australian personnel will be in solomon islands for a period of weeks their primary responsibility is to assist solomon islands law enforcement authorities in securing and protecting critical infrastructure under the terms of the treaty there is scope for third countries such as png and fiji to be joined to a mission with the permission of the government of solomon islands what next what happens next is not easy to predict sogavare says he will not resign as this would be anti democratic and an acceptance of mob rule he is also insisting alignment with china puts solomon islands on the right side of history in fact he has gone further to without naming names imply taiwan and the united states are fomenting discord in his country department of defence aap the people of solomon islands already bear a heavy burden their young population lack opportunities and it is no surprise to learn that many of those involved in this week s disorder are teenage boys with no meaningful political agenda in mind looking for whatever excitement presents itself on a given day while the country is covid free the impacts of extended border closures have had significant economic impact on a country struggling to provide basic services to its population for many the events of the last few days have brought back unhappy and traumatic memories of the days of the tensions the inter ethnic conflicts and bloodshed that led eventually to the ramsi intervention the people of solomon islands are strong resourceful and resilient they are blessed with some of the most articulate and strategic thinkers of our region who can help them navigate what the future brings australia has an opportunity to walk the talk of tru wantok pidgin for real friend and support them in this journey

how can govt have for years and yet not want it to be backed by saha is a lawyer and national president jai kisan andolan legislation will only create a black market and encourage corruption ghanwat is senior leader shetkari sanghatana and member of the sc appointed committee on farm laws for avik sahathe nation is grappling with the acronym msp short for minimum support price for agricultural produce for farmers who are roughly two thirds of the nation these three letters represent a lifeline and they want that lifeline to be given legal sanctity for some whose livelihoods are not dependent on income from farming they represent multiple phobias they want the msp regime to be disbanded altogether or at the very least that right of farmers to be never legalised hence this debate about legalising msp there is however no debate since survey after survey shows that income from farming is inadequate to sustain basic financial needs of farming households and the prime minister himself has assured that there was there is and there will be msp msp has existed as a policy of the government of india for nearly 60 years and an army of people is employed by the government at fixed legally guaranteed incomes to compute it twice every year india s food independence and security against hunger are non negotiable and this independence and security depends on farmers continuing to farm and produce food to feed nearly 1 38 billion citizens there is no debate that the poor of india have incomes that are too meagre for them to be able to feed themselves and hence have to be provided food for survival at highly subsidised rates in fact they have legislative guarantee to food even the most die hard capitalist is not arguing in favour of hunger deaths so let us put an end to this debate about legalising msp with a simple question should a government have a long standing policy which it publicly proclaims it is implementing and yet not want that policy to be backed by legislation that ensures legal enforcement of that policy the answer must surely be a resounding no and the debate ought to end there every indian must wonder about the credibility of a government that wants to make policy but does not want that policy to be legally enforced it reeks of plain bad governance and lack of political will the present government has sworn an affidavit before the supreme court asserting that a law to guarantee msp to farmers will distort the market the same government has since on a dozen occasions announced msp is the government s logic that msp can be announced but must not be enforced or guaranteed can any government that believes it is sovereign make announcements year after year and allow the announcements to be ignored with impunity what does this wink and nudge on msp by the government say about its intent and commitment to the nearly 900 million farm income dependent indian citizens for whom msp is a lifeline can it not be said that the government is tricking farmers into believing that they will get msp when in fact the government knows that they will not this and only this alone should be the most compelling reason for legalising msp no elected government can trick the electors no democracy can work on this premise and those who believe that the government has a right to trick electors will be the first to cry hoarse when their turn to be tricked comes not making a law to enforce msp is divisive it turns one section of indians against the other senior ministers of the present government when arguing in favour of the soon to be repealed so called agri reform laws have pleaded that these laws be allowed to be implemented before its effects are debated the same argument then holds true for a law on msp why not enact and implement a law guaranteeing msp and then examine whether the multiple phobias come true or not the proponents of free market price discovery of life saving food commodities conveniently overlook the fact that it is this very mechanism that has pushed farmers in western countries out of farming and placed food production and supply in the hands of corporate behemoths while low population countries of europe and north america may have been able to absorb the out of work farmers elsewhere in the economy where will the 900 million farmers of india be absorbed and it is these very free market pundits who want the government to control prices at the retail end the demand for legal guarantee of msp also stems from the constitutional fundamental right to life and livelihood it is the constitutional duty of the government to ensure and enforce this fundamental right in favour of the farmers of india a law legalising msp is an instrument in the hands of the government to meet this constitutional duty by not making that law the government is failing to discharge its constitutional duty that failure makes the government unlawful and liable to be replaced that s how democracies work against anil ghanwatthe origin of msp dates back to the famines of the 1960s when it was designed mainly as a way to build a strategic food reserve our organisation does not oppose msp in principle but we would like it to be used only where it has proven to be the best way to achieve a national objective even where it is determined that msp should be used open ended procurement is never the answer today around rs 2 lakh crore is locked up in stocks that exceed the buffer norms norms which are in any case too high we don t need 100 million tonnes of foodgrain sitting around rotting in the rain and being eaten by rats since our prices are not competitive globally we can t even export these mountains of foodgrain second if an objective of msp is to help the poor we can now effectively use the most direct way for less than the amount spent on msp we can lift millions out of poverty by transferring funds into their bank accounts third if our objective is to reduce farm price volatility then direct funds transfer to the poor can partially address that objective along with a well regulated trustworthy and accountable crop insurance system definitely not of the sort that exists today the harms of msp must also be taken into account msp is given only for a few crops which means there is excessive production of these at the expense of other crops that may be more nutritious and could earn us export revenues this distorted focus also depletes the water table there is a demand to expand msp to more crops that would make things much worse even setting the price for msp is fraught for only markets can truly determine any price not bureaucrats we must also take into account the effects of msp on equity poor farmers get virtually nothing from msp because they have little or no surplus many subsist as agricultural labourers some farmers do benefit on occasion maybe in a few states but the largest chunk of the funds allocated to msp is siphoned off by the government s machinery in sum msp may have a few positives but it has many negatives and should be deployed only with great circumspection our supreme court farm law committee s report provides a lot more information unfortunately a new demand has emerged for a guaranteed legislated msp in which the private sector is forced to buy at the support price we know that governments can use taxpayer funds to buy high and sell low but even they can only do so till they bankrupt the nation e g our gold was forced by the socialists to be flown to london in 1992 but no trader or stockist has this luxury a legislated guarantee will create a black market the farmer will be forced to surreptitiously sell at a price even lower than an already low market price inspector raj will look like heaven compared to the situation if traders are jailed for buying below msp this will lead to unprecedented corruption and the food distribution system will collapse a legislated msp guarantee is entirely unimplementable and extremely dangerous there is a more fundamental issue here why are we having this discussion which is a comparison between two shades of micro management of the economy the nation needs to reject the failed policies of marx let us revert to india s own economic model of shubh labh did our ancient kings operate banks run buses and hotels trade in foodgrains or produce cement in our scriptures the government s duty its dharma is to ensure justice security and infrastructure no more we have all heard of the saying jahaan ka raja ho vyapaari vahaan ki praja ho bhikhari where the king is a trader the people are beggars kautilya s arthashastra also emphasises free trade and good regulation modi talks about minimum government maximum governance but he has abandoned the three farm laws that would have reduced the stranglehold of government on farmers the farm laws had their own defects which our committee has pointed out they were neither based on a policy rationale nor were wide consultations held farmers need far more fundamental reforms to increase market and technology freedom and compensation for decades of negative subsidy let the government set up a committee to prepare a white paper on agriculture to explore the state of affairs and consider the costs and benefits of various options let there be wide consultation and let new laws be created that facilitate enterprise msp should be reviewed as part of this process excessive regulation much of it sheltered in schedule 9 of the constitution is choking farmers production and marketing efforts let farmers produce and buy and sell as they think best

the business help desk today brings to you an insight around the stock market in png and what you need to know in terms of buying shares and investing joining the desk today with these explanation is the png stock exchange and the securities commission of png what is the stock market the majority of countries in the world have a stock market you may have heard of stock markets like the australian stock exchange london stock exchange new york stock exchange or the tokyo stock exchange all these organisations each perform similar roles the stock market is the place where shares in publicly listed companies are issued and traded between investors a share is simply part ownership of a company the stock market in papua new guinea is operated by pngx markets limited pngx formerly known as port moresby stock exchange or pomsox and is a key part of the country s larger financial system the computer trading system operated by pngx is one of the most highly sophisticated available pngx like other stock exchanges around the world has been developed to meet two basic and complementary needs 1 a company s need for funds when a company needs money or funds to expand it generally has two choices it can go to a commercial bank to secure a loan and repay the amount borrowed over a given time or it can issue shares to the public through a registered prospectus thereby giving the public the opportunity to own a piece of the company thus raising funds for expansion and growth 2 an individual or company s desire to invest savings efficiently pngx offers investors the opportunity to invest in publicly listed companies by allowing individuals and companies to buy shares in companies listed on the stock exchange pngx is a critical part of the financial system within papua new guinea which provides a link between companies requiring funds and members of the public with savings to invest while at the same time providing a marketplace for the trading of these shares pngx does not determine the buying and selling prices of shares prices are determined entirely by supply and demand by investors pngx acts to promote fair trading by collecting and supplying statistics and other information concerning the companies listed on the market by publishing prices and by setting rules and standards for trading a stock also known as shares is a financial instrument that proves percentage of ownership in a certain company the person that owns shares in that company are called shareholders now that s a no brainer but the question concerns the stock market is it the same as a stock exchange while both terms are often used interchangeably if one were to make finer distinctions then a stock market is umbrella term for the overall stock market of a certain jurisdiction whereas a stock exchange refers to a single subset of the stock market this is particularly so for jurisdictions where a stock market has more than one stock exchange for example in the usa there are more than 10 stock exchanges so the blanket stock market is the usa one but there are numerous stock exchanges in that one market so there can be many stock exchanges in one stock market and of course foreign companies can always go list in another stock exchange in that other foreign stock market anyways for png we only have one exchange being pngx pngx has rules which govern the stock market in accordance with those rules it decides which companies can be listed and traded on the market and which companies can be recognised as stockbrokers pngx oversees compliance with its rules by the listed companies and stockbrokers companies and stockbrokers which do not comply with the rules are suspended from trading it monitors trading to make sure that the market is orderly and fair pngx also promotes standards of corporate governance among png s listed companies and helps to educate retail investors investors place orders to buy or sell shares in listed companies with a stockbroker the stockbroker then conducts the trading on the stock market a stockbroker is a middleman that assists investors buy and sell shares on their behalf stockbrokers are independent financial advisors providing advice to their clients on all forms of investments including investments in shares and a range of other products that they offer to their clients if you can provide us with the current breakup of the png stock market its number of participants and the value of the country s stock market to date there are currently 12 companies listed on pngx and available for investors to buy or sell the size of each company is measured by its market capitalisation the market capitalisation is the number of shares the company has issued multiplied by the price of each share on the stock

total market capitalisation 91 886 there are currently two 2 stockbroking firms which can take orders from investors and place them on the stock market they are kina securities limited www kinabank com pg jmp securities limited www jmpmarkets com relationship between the securities commission and pngx the png securities commission is a government body which is the licensor and regulator of the stock exchange stockbrokers financial advisers and companies which want to raise money from investors pngx is a company which operates the stock market on which shares are bought and sold it designs the rules of the market subject to approval by the securities commission to ensure it is orderly and fair it decides which companies can be listed and traded on the market and which companies can be recognized as a stockbroker stockbrokers are the intermediaries between the buying and selling investors because of the uncertainty about the leadership of the securities commission for the last 4 years the development and improvement of the stock market has been held back the uncertainty has now been resolved pngx is moving as quickly as possible to obtain securities commission approval to establish in png a new market for corporate bonds and to open up new sources of funding for png companies it will also move quickly to obtain securities commission approval to modernise the listing rules for the current market and to establish new markets and products what can an interested simple investor in the country do to access shares anyone individual or company can buy shares of a publicly listed company through a stockbroker the minimum amount to start is usually 2 000 kina if you want to buy shares or bonds traded on the pngx you must use the services of a licensed and recognised stockbroker on pngx establishing a relationship with a broker is easy your stockbroker will ask you to open an account with them which is a similar process to opening a bank account they may also require you to have a bank account into which they can pay you after the sale of shares the first thing you should do before investing is to work out your investment aims an investment decision like any other purchase should be based on rational and logical reasoning therefore you must clarify your personal objectives ask yourself the following questions do i want to invest what rate of return do i require do i want income or capital growth what do i want to achieve from the investment over what period of time what risks am i prepared to take how much can i afford to lose how much money do i wish to invest how can i keep track of the performance of my investments remember that money used for investment should preferably be surplus savings or income and not money which is needed for everyday living savings typically are low risk for the return you receive on the amount of money you have saved because they are low risk savings also attract low interest rates for example a savings account with a bank investments typically are higher risk for the return you receive on the amount of money you have invested because they are higher risk investments tend to attract higher returns investment is a personal matter types of investment and risk vary just as individual needs vary it is important that you and your broker work together to decide upon a mix of investments which will achieve your financial goals what are the processes for pngx enabling this pngx operates for the convenience of investors and is open during fixed hours each business day from 10 am to 4 pm pngx has some information for investors on its website www pngx com pg a new series of educational material will be posted to the website in the coming weeks a series of weekly articles on the stock market

in an era of climate crisis and with a growing portion of international markets in search of guaranteed verifiably sustainable food argentinian livestock farming is seeking to improve its productivity and traceability levels as a way to lessen its environmental impact the national livestock sector contributes 20 7 percent of argentina s total greenhouse gas output mostly caused by emissions from bovine enteric fermentation a process of digestion in cows from which the byproduct of methane is belched out livestock emissions are second only to the energy sector with 54 percent technicians and market analysts admit that there is room for improvement in the livestock sector but argue that not only is argentina s livestock industry not a major emitter but that it could also become neutral or even a sector with a positive impact to this end they call for a review of the methodologies used to calculate argentina s emissions and for the carbon captured in grasslands and pastures on which most of the country s livestock production is based to be counted in favour of the sector this however is questioned by environmental organisations which point to cattle ranching as the activity responsible for deforestation in the country s northern provinces especially since 2010 there is still a long way to go for the activity to be classified as sustainable greenpeace has said forests as well as wetlands are important reservoirs of carbon dioxide one of the main gases causing global warming worldwide it is estimated that about 20 percent of global emissions originate from deforestation livestock in argentina argentina has around 52 million head of cattle according to data from the instituto de la promoción de la carne vacuna argentina ipcva there are some 130 800 farms dedicated to cattle production according to the latest national agricultural census the report carne argentina carne sustentable published this year by the ipcva specifies that more than half of the cattle herd is concentrated in the provinces of buenos aires córdoba and santa fe argentina s core agricultural region pastures in this region are the basis for more than 50 percent of the country s meat production argentina produced some 3 17 million tonnes of meat in 2020 of which 900 700 tonnes were exported 75 percent to china this year in the first three months ahead of five months of limits and bans on exports china remained the main destination with 109 000 tonnes followed by israel with 11 000 tonnes and chile with 8 300 tonnes adrian bifaretti is an agricultural engineer and heads the ipcva s domestic department in his opinion there are mature export markets in terms of sustainability such as the european or in part the american market where the demand for certain standards is becoming increasingly strong however at the level of the argentine domestic market which consumes 70 percent of the meat produced this consumer profile is not yet in place some international markets are demanding environmental standards but for now argentinean buyers are not asking for this said pablo preliasco head of the sustainable livestock programme of the fundación vida silvestre argentina the argentine wildlife foundation in china the strengthening of sustainable consumption trends is driven by younger generations who are concerned about both traceability and food safety standards the 20 to 29 age group is the one that shows most interest in this for fernando vilella director of the agribusiness and food programme at the university of buenos aires uba although the overall percentage of the chinese population that demands high quality meat is still small the emergence of more demanding young consumers could change the scenario this requires a response in our exports of livestock which must move towards certification and traceability schemes for these products vilella added livestock farming must build a national brand associated with low environmental impact production deforestation and bad practices environmental organisations point to cattle ranching as a main driver of new deforestation in argentina concentrated in four northern provinces formosa salta santiago del estero and chaco hernán giardini coordinator of greenpeace s forests campaign explained today cattle ranching is the main cause of deforestation in the country and since 2010 more land has been cleared by cattle than by soya when we look at the requests made for deforestation in the gran chaco there are more for livestock than for agriculture greenpeace pointed to other environmental problems including those associated with free range meat they argue that animal feed for these approaches is linked to gm crops and other unsustainable practices such as animal confinement and water and soil contamination livestock farming is not sustainable in argentina in most cases it is a lie that it does not generate deforestation said giardini it is currently the main cause of deforestation just as soy was in the 1990s and early 2000s greenpeace s 2020 annual report on deforestation in northern argentina mentions that in the last decade this practice was the main source of carbon emissions in northern argentina the document states that in 2019 some 80 938 hectares were cleared in 2020 the year of the pandemic that area grew to 114 716 hectares with emissions of more than 20 million tonnes of co2 equivalent observers may however be buoyed by announcements made at the un s cop26 climate summit in glasgow including the glasgow leaders declaration on forests and land use to which argentina was a signatory that pledges to halt and reverse forest loss by 2030 elsewhere eight financial institutions committed us 3 billion in finance towards deforestation free cattle production in south america under the innovative finance for the amazon cerrado and chaco ifacc initiative emissions a key issue is argentina s livestock prepared to meet new export market standards according to ipcva s bifaretti the answer is positive our natural grassland system has a great capacity to store carbon and if properly measured more is stored than is emitted bifaretti claims this is a fight for meaning and communication that the national livestock sector must fight with scientific support for argentina s livestock sector the main argument for questioning its supposed level of emissions is based on the fact that most production is done in natural pastures rather than on deforested cleared land argentina s pastures according to the ipcva specialist have an amount of carbon stored in the soil equivalent to what the country emits in 74 years carbon accumulates as organic matter in the soil and can remain there for up to hundreds of years pastures contribute to this largely through the abundant amount of roots they produce in this way they can remove carbon from the atmosphere by sequestering it in the soil and help to mitigate global warming accounting for the sector s carbon sequestration and not just its emissions is the key to changing the image of livestock farming and even moving to a positive balance sheet there is a scientific battle that the sector must fight said bifaretti developing countries are obliged to submit their greenhouse gas inventories to the un every two years based on methods suggested by the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc there is general agreement in the scientific world on these methods however the best way to estimate carbon sequestration by forests and grasslands is still under debate it is precisely this divergence that opens the debate from the livestock sector in a paper published in 2019 a group of argentinean researchers concluded that the carbon sequestration capacity of grazing land is underestimated in inventories and that these lands are generating a carbon surplus meaning that the emissions produced by animals and production are potentially offset by the amount of carbon that grazing lands sequester miguel taboada one of the authors of the paper argues that grasslands store carbon at deeper depths than the 30 centimetres the ipcc acknowledges there is also carbon in the root biomass of grassland plants something that is also not considered by the ipcc methodology it is a technical or even academic discussion that unfortunately for some people has become a political dispute it is valid to discuss it taboada added for víctor tonelli a livestock market analyst and consultant there is a gap between what the european consumer perceives and the reality of the argentine system in which he says the animal spends 85 percent of its life outdoors in fields with an average consumption that does not go below 90 percent grass it has been suggested that grass fed cows have a lower carbon footprint than those fed on grain by stimulating soil carbon sequestration through grazing though this remains contested for advocates such as tonelli there is a lack of scientific work published in international journals a lack of awareness in government agencies and a lack of better communication on the issue of grazing and emissions he added that this was one of the reasons for the creation of the argentine roundtable on sustainable meat four years ago conversion and traceability according to preliasco of the fundación vida silvestre completing the path towards more sustainable production does not require large investments on the part of producers except for a few cases that work on deforestation or very large land conversion most livestock production is already sustainable and the largest volume of meat production can already be termed as deforestation free with ease the expert said on traceability tonelli mentioned that although there is always room for improvement argentina has a solid system it is a good system but we need to digitalise it to reduce errors make it faster and get qr codes on packages for the consumer in addition the ipcva recognises that there is still a lot of room for improvement in terms of kilos of emissions per animal and per hectare if technology is improved emissions per unit of product are reduced but there is still a technological gap to be filled said bifaretti for whom this would not require large investments what is needed more than this input he

yossi tam d m d ph d head of the obesity and metabolism laboratory and associate professor of pharmacology at the hebrew university s institute for drug research will focus on testing the potential of meai to treat binge eating and related behaviors and will support the discovery and development of novel therapeutic strategies to safely treat obesity and its associated metabolic disorders increasingly prevalent in developed nations the conditions of being overweight and obese are a serious health concern as they contribute to so many other conditions including heart disease stroke type 2 diabetes fatty liver disease and certain types of cancers some of the leading causes of preventable premature death in the us the center for disease control and prevention estimates that about 74 of adults in the us are overweight1 and over 40 are considered obese2 according to a recent study published in 2020 this phenomenon is also accompanied with the high and rising costs of obesity to the us health care system at an estimated annual medical cost for the full non institutionalized population of adults in 2013 equaling 342 2 billion3 adi zuloff shani ph d ceo of clearmind commented on the announcement the medical community has yet to establish an effective therapeutic or preventative treatment for obesity despite its increasing prevalence and severe negative impacts on the medical and economic health of people around the world clearmind has been able to demonstrate the positive influence meai has on binge behavior with regard to alcohol use and our preliminary research indicates it may have a similar effect on metabolic disorders prof tam added i have spent my career exploring the biological mechanisms underlying obesity and the metabolic syndrome intending to develop an effective drug therapy after viewing the early data on meai i am optimistic that this compound has the potential to be a building block for a real solution and look forward to working with the

china s exploration and innovation in common prosperity is of great significance to the country s economic development and prosperity xiang bing is professor of china business and globalization and the founding dean of the cheung kong graduate school of business ckgsb all commentaries reflect the personal opinion of the author and are not necessarily the official position of the school and the magazine since 1979 the market economy and global free competition has created unprecedented economic development and wealth creation however this has also led to a massively uneven distribution of income and wealth and a decline in social mobility alongside a number of other issues regarding the uneven distribution of income the un development program s human development report 2019 revealed that in 1980 the average pre tax income of the top 10 of us citizens was 11 times greater than that of the bottom 40 by 2017 this gap had become 27 times bigger and in europe the wealth gap had risen from 10 times greater to 12 times the 1980 level according to the world inequality database wealth concentration has become even more pronounced between 1980 and 2019 the combined wealth of the top 1 of the us population rose from 23 to 35 while the proportion of this group s income versus the country s total income increased from 10 5 to 18 8 during the same period in india the wealth of the top 1 rose from 7 5 to 21 7 between 1980 and 2012 the proportion of the income of this group rose from 12 to 31 un secretary antónio guterres noted in a speech in july 2020 that the 26 richest people in the world own as much wealth as half the global population between 1980 and 2016 the world s richest 1 acquired 27 of the total cumulative growth in income in recent years both developed countries such as france and oecd member countries such as chile have experienced relatively high levels of social disruption one of the reasons for this is the ever widening wealth gap and the attendant decline of social mobility the amount of disruption brought about by technology together with the impact of the covid 19 pandemic has exacerbated the already serious income and wealth gaps highlighting the urgent need to promote inclusiveness and common prosperity within the global sphere in the post covid 19 era some technology giants have led and shaped the transformation from an offline economy to online giving them the opportunity to increase their profits as a direct result of the pandemic covid 19 has accelerated the concentration of wealth according to statistics released by forbes the total amount of wealth held by the over 2 200 billionaires worldwide rose by 1 9 trillion in 2020 an average increase of 20 compared with the end of 2019 in china data released by the national bureau of statistics shows that the domestic gini coefficient has been on a downward trend since 2008 although the overall range is still within 0 46 0 47 globally 0 4 is considered a warning line for the gap between the rich and the poor when the gini coefficient exceeds this figure economies face the risk that it might trigger serious social instability wealth inequality in china is also among the most serious in the world according to the china development report issued by peking university in 2015 the top 1 of households in china own about one third of the country s property in response to the unequal distribution of income and wealth the fifth plenary session of the 19th central committee of the communist party of china listed promoting common prosperity across the country as a very important task in its 14th five year plan president xi jinping has emphasized in many speeches that the promotion of common prosperity for the whole nation must be given more importance promoting common prosperity for all people is an arduous long term task it is necessary to select some regions where we can trial this initially demonstrate the results the chinese government recently decided to support high quality development in the province of zhejiang as a model of common prosperity china s promotion of common prosperity is of strategic significance to the stability and long term development of its economy and social harmony its experience in this regard could also demonstrate workable policies for solving the issue of unequal distribution of wealth and income faced with future global changes and the impact of disruptive technology this article focuses on the issue of how to achieve common prosperity based on the three distribution theoretical framework i will examine and reflect on the experience and lessons learned by different countries and regions from a more global perspective further top down thinking the so called view of earth from the moon will i hope help to explore possible paths for common prosperity and for building more equitable and inclusive societies the first distribution by the invisible hand of the market economic growth and wealth creation need to become more inclusive and balanced the first distribution led by the market mechanism has a decisive impact on the distribution of income and wealth there are many factors that affect income and wealth distribution these include the political system the relationship between state and business whether resource allocation is market led industrial policy the level of education among the population population demographics stage of economic development level of infrastructure development technological disruption economic financialization and globalization anti monopoly regulations mechanisms to promote fair competition and so on chinese and other scholars have done extensive research on the relationship between distribution and inequality of income and wealth so i will not repeat it here instead i will focus on two changes that may help reduce the income gap caused by the first distribution the enterprise system and corporate value orientation in 1997 i proposed the concept of the enterprise system based on the degree of separation of ownership and management companies can be divided into three categories family type type a modern enterprise system type type b and state owned type type c among them type b enterprises display the characteristics of the enterprises that have achieved the separation of management and ownership dispersed equity and established a modern corporate governance system globally major developed economies such as the united states the united kingdom japan and germany have the enterprise system which is basically a combination of type a and type b companies a common feature in these developed countries is the important role and presence of a batch of those type b enterprises that transcend family ownership and control that separate management and ownership in germany b type companies include siemens basf and bayer while in japan there are toyota honda sony and panasonic in east asia japan is the only economy to date that has a significant presence of type b enterprises the united states not only has traditional type b companies such as ibm general electric general motors citi coca cola and procter gamble but also a new generation of type b enterprises like google amazon and facebook which have sprung from ground breaking innovations and hold a leading role in influencing global development since its reforms and opening up in 1978 china s social and economic development has been spectacular from the perspective of the enterprise system the current chinese system represents a combination of type a and type c companies in china type c state owned enterprises play a dominant role even a monopolistic role in many industries at the same time type a enterprises have become the backbone of china s gross domestic product gdp employment opportunities and the creation of new jobs in the long term china may need to spur and cultivate the development of type b enterprises so as to build an enterprise system that combines type a type b and type c companies this could be a necessary condition for deepening its economic transformation and promoting common prosperity for a detailed discussion of this issue you can refer to my article enterprise system and its optimization published in 2019 which is available on the ckgsb website in some countries and regions where type b companies dominate the income gap between the corporate senior management team and ordinary employees remains significant after the first distribution for example in 2019 the salary of google ceo sundar pichai was about 280 million or 1 085 times the average annual salary of a google employee of 258 000 according to statistics from bloomberg in 2018 among listed companies the ratio between the salary of a ceo and the average salary of their employees in the united states was 265 1 the ratio in the united kingdom was 201 1 in germany 136 1 and in japan 58 1 in view of this narrowing the income gap effectively may require companies to make fundamental shifts in their corporate value orientation globally there are different orientations in corporate value the corporate value of shareholders first has been very popular all over the world here the goal of the company is to maximize the interests of shareholders take the united states as an example where around 6 600 companies had implemented employee stock ownership plans covering 14 million employees by 2021 at the same time corporate high level management team incentive plans have become the standard one of the goals is to align the interests of employees the high level management team and shareholders so that employees and high level management can operate the company to better suit the interests of shareholders in recent years people from all walks of life in the united states including business and academia have reflected on the potential limitations of the value orientation which emphasizes shareholder value maximization for example in 2019 ceos from 181 top us companies including apple and amazon jointly signed the statement on the purpose of a corporation at business roundtable declaring that creating value for customers investing in employees supporting communities and protecting the environment plus continuing to protect the interests of shareholders should be a company s five main value targets this shows how american business leaders have begun to put more emphasis on their social responsibilities and have more diverse and inclusive value orientations the corporate value orientation of japan differs markedly from that of the us the two countries have very different cultural traditions japanese companies generally prioritize the interests of employees suppliers and customers and only then the interests of shareholders further in germany the rhine capitalism model also pays more attention to the interests of employees rather than only the interests of shareholders the above two corporate value orientations from japan and germany contrast with the us type of anglo saxon capitalism being relatively more inclusive and more balanced the salary ratios of their ceos and employees also illustrate this point as noted above being much smaller in the future global corporate value orientations will still be diverse however there is no doubt that it will be more balanced more holistic more long term and more inclusive everywhere while having more emphasis on social purpose and functions in this new era of tectonic global transformations social conflict is apparent and the expectations of society and government for enterprises social functions have reached a new height this further requires companies to redefine corporate social value propositions from a strategic perspective second distribution by the visible hand of government social security programs need to become more proactive more comprehensive more fair and transparent and more effective according to the principle of balancing efficiency and equity the second distribution led by government is through taxation social security expenditure and other regulatory tools this visible hand attempts to promote equity in their society through the second distribution the government intends to mitigate the income gap arising from the first distribution which constitutes an important solution to reducing uneven incomes and wealth countries in the european union and especially nordic countries are well known for their high welfare state models this security system has effectively improved uneven income distribution and maintained good social mobility helping to achieve more equitable and inclusive economies first i will use the gini coefficient to compare the impact of the first and second distributions on income inequality in eu and nordic countries comparing the gini coefficient after both the first allocation and the second we can see that the distribution policies in the nordic countries and some other european countries have significantly reduced uneven income caused by the first distribution according to the latest statistics from the oecd in 2018 the income difference after the first distribution among major nordic countries was very significant with the gini coefficient generally above 0 4 finland even exceeded 0 5 however after the second distribution the gini coefficient of these countries dropped significantly to within the range of 0 26 0 27 which made them the countries with the smallest income gap in the world meanwhile according to data from the world bank the per capita gdp of these nordic countries maintains a relatively high level in 2019 norwegian per capita gdp was around 70 000 the per capita gdp of denmark sweden and finland were all above 40 000 these countries are among the world s high income countries and have achieved common prosperity they are the successful examples of european social democracy which differs from american neoliberalism second during the five years from 2014 to 2018 the eu s total social security expenditure and social security expenditure per capita increased steadily in 2018 the total amount of social security reached 376 6 billion and the average maximum amount of social security one person could use per year was 8 435 social security accounted for 28 of gdp although there are differences in economic and social development within the eu overall it has maintained a relatively high level of social security third fair income distribution can also promote social mobility according to the world economic forum s 2020 global social mobility report the major nordic countries including denmark 1 norway 2 finland 3 and sweden 4 have the highest social mobility ranking in the world the united states ranks 27th among asian countries japan has the best social mobility ranking 15th china ranks 45th criticisms of the welfare model have not stopped since its emergence critics believe that high welfare encourages people s laziness and weakens the sense of competition while increasing the financial burden for society and hindering economic growth from the analysis of indicators such as the gini coefficient which indicates the gap between the rich and the poor social security and public finance expenditure and income per person european countries including the nordic countries plus germany and switzerland have indeed solved the problem of a high gini coefficient after the first distribution and effectively promoted social equity and social mobility through a strong active and comprehensive second distribution system european countries have accumulated some successful practical experience in promoting social harmony and achieving inclusive growth the economic and social development of these european countries is advanced and mature while china is still a developing country from this perspective the situation of other such developing countries as russia and brazil is more worthy of reference and benchmarking for china combined social security education medical care and pension expenditure account for a relatively large share of social security in various countries and regions china s public education expenditure accounted for only 3 5 of gdp in 2017 which is lower than the world average of 4 5 it not only has a large gap of more than 6 compared with the nordic countries but also is lower than brazil 6 3 russia 4 7 and india 3 8 in health care china s expenditure accounted for 5 2 of gdp in 2017 which was lower than brazil 9 5 and russia 5 3 and higher than india 3 5 by the end of 2019 more than 1 35 billion chinese people had basic medical insurance with a participation rate of over 95 however medical expenditure per person was relatively low according to data from the world health organization in 2017 china s expenditure 841 per capita per anum was not only much lower than that of the united states 10 246 dollars but also lower than brazil 1 424 and russia 1 404 regarding security for the retired according to the oecd statistics between 2015 and 2016 brazil and russia s pension expenditure accounted for around 9 1 of gdp which was even higher than some developed countries such as the us 4 9 china s pension expenditure accounted for 4 1 of its gdp these statistics show that at this stage there is still a lot of room for china to increase its investment in social security programs especially when compared with developing countries with a similar gdp per capita such as brazil or russia china lags behind in education medical care pensions unemployment benefits and spending in recent years the chinese government has attached great importance to common prosperity in the 14th five year plan it was proposed to improve the redistribution mechanism and increase the accuracy of adjustments on taxation social security and transfer payment in the future we need to have a stronger and more proactive second distribution building a more comprehensive and equitable social security system that enables the results of reform and developments to benefit all people and achieve common prosperity some of the successful experiences and failures of european high welfare countries and some of the practices in brics brazil russia india and china are worthy of reference third distribution cultivate the culture of donation and charity and promote social innovation the third distribution is to use some of the personal and institutional wealth for public welfare and for social purpose on the basis of individual volition the us is remarkable for the spirit of fraternity and generosity embodied in its donations and charity culture and the influence of various charitable organizations on its society charitable donations and non governmental charitable organizations have made an important contribution to the relief of the wealth gap after the first and second distribution in the us according to the 2020 us charitable donations report released by giving usa foundation the total amount of charitable donations in the us in 2019 was around 449 64 billion accounting for 2 1 of gdp after allowing for inflation this ranked second highest in its domestic history personal donations are the largest source of charitable donations in the us in 2019 these accounted for about 68 87 of donations totaling 309 7 billion followed by donations from foundations totaling approximately 75 7 billion legacy donations totaled around 43 2 billion and corporate donations amounted to nearly 21 1 billion in the us charitable donations have become a general consensus across strata with 70 90 of american families donating every year each family donates an average 2 500 per year which is two to 20 times that of european families in 2019 china received a total of rmb 170 14 billion 26 45 billion in domestic and foreign donations of which the mainland received a total of rmb 150 94 billion accounting for 0 15 of its gdp the largest source of donations was enterprises 61 71 followed by individuals 26 40 social organizations 5 75 public institutions and religious sites 2 49 government ministries 1 67 groups and organizations 0 21 and others 1 77 the gap between china and the us is obvious us gdp is about 1 45 times that of china while the total amount of us charitable donations is about 20 times greater according to the philanthropy 50 list in chronicle of philanthropy the us in 2020 saw the top 50 philanthropists donate a total of 24 7 billion compared with 15 8 billion in 2019 an increase of 56 such donations were mainly for various projects related to climate change epidemic prevention and control poverty relief and education andrew carnegie brought to the american entrepreneur and businessman the concept that it is shameful to die with wealth bill gates and warren buffett initiated the donation commitment in 2010 advocating that billionaires across the us donate half of their wealth to charities according to statistics from forbes to the end of january 2021 the top 25 richest americans have donated a total of 149 billion in their lifetimes in the future the solution to the problems of income and wealth inequality and diminishing social mobility will not be achieved by individual action from governments enterprises non governmental organizations or international organizations the goal of common prosperity requires the cooperation coordination and joint undertaking of governments enterprises non governmental organizations civil society and international organizations via the social innovation of consolidating all these resources and players the road to common prosperity looking at the development of major economies in the world over the past 40 years china and the us have led the world in economic development and wealth growth these two countries despite their outstanding economic performances have also experienced very serious problems with uneven income and uneven distribution of wealth in 2019 the gini coefficient was 0 48 in the us and 0 46 in china ranking 3rd and 4th among world s major economies only after brazil 0 53 and india 0 50 how can the aforementioned observations and reflections bring light to china s future path to common prosperity first china needs to maintain and strengthen its sustained and strong economic growth in the first distribution in particular relying on innovation and value competition rather than price competition to create more high value added employment opportunities and to continue to sustain a new generation of economic disruptions the reasoning behind this is that growth and continuous wealth creation are prerequisites for common prosperity future economic development and growth must also be more inclusive and balanced another necessary condition for common prosperity china must optimize its enterprise system and focus more on building more type b enterprises in terms of corporate value orientation chinese companies need to be more holistic more inclusive more balanced and go beyond the concept of maximizing shareholders interests chinese companies should also pay more attention to corporate social values and purpose actively participate in promoting social innovation and become a backbone for solving social problems social values and purposes in the new era have become an indispensable part of strategy for many large scale corporates the superimposed influence of technological disruption the covid 19 pandemic and other factors have intensified the issue of income and wealth inequality second in the future more active transparent and equitable redistribution of wealth thorough the visible hand of government is needed around the world from this point of view the rise of socialism globally may be one of the big megatrends of the new era building a more complete comprehensive and equitable social security system is a necessary condition for achieving common prosperity at the moment china and the eu countries are not at the same stage of development and thus a high welfare society is not entirely suitable for china s current situation however the eu s successful experiences with the second distribution including its failures and lessons are still worthy of reference developing countries such as russia and brazil have similar per capita gdp to china which compared with them also has room for improving education medical care and pensions in the future china needs to increase investment to construct a more active stronger and fairer second distribution system finally regarding the third distribution the us example offers some lessons the us may have the most advanced market economy unsurpassed innovation capabilities and unmatched generosity in giving charity and philanthropy but the us is not viewed as a good example of common prosperity the us case illustrates the critical role of the visible hand of the government for common prosperity and highlights potential limitations of combining the invisible hand and the third redistribution for common prosperity for the future the third hand social innovation which goes beyond charity and philanthropy will become complementary to the invisible hand of the market and the visible hand of government and may play a more important role for reaching common prosperity for common prosperity china needs to learn from many economies around the globe and to be innovative in exploring new paths to building a more equitable sustainable and inclusive society exploration and innovation in common prosperity by china is not only of great significance to the country s economic development and prosperity social harmony and advancement it could also help contribute chinese wisdom and solutions to the important challenges of human development worldwide the chinese version of the article was published in the caijing magazine on june 21
