scottish american investment company the trust that s delivered a 48 year record on resilient dividends barring a global economic calamity in the next month or so investment trust scottish american will early in the new year announce its 48th year of consecutive annual dividend increases it s a tremendous income record that has only been bettered by a handful of rival funds including city of london bankers and alliance the 940million trust managed by scottish investment house baillie gifford has already paid out three quarterly dividends to shareholders for the current calendar year totalling 9 3 pence a share a 3 3 per cent increase on the equivalent payments made last year and with the trust s objective being one of delivering real income growth above inflation the final payment that will be announced after the trust s board meets in february could be higher than the 3 pence paid last year inflation in the uk is currently running at a ten year high of 5 1 per cent 2021 is going to be another year o f dividend growth says james dow who runs the trust with colleague toby ross the key question is by how much we raise the annual dividend shares in the trust ended last week at about 5 35 dow says the trust s whole modus operandi is built around hunting down companies that can deliver resilient earnings and by implication resilient dividends all bar one of the trust s 61 equity holdings are income generating and these are supported by a small income orientated property portfolio managed by olim property and accounting for seven per cent of the trust s assets and a couple of infrastructure investments that also throw off income the trust s dividend resilience was proven last year when against the backdrop of a global collapse in company dividends scottish american managed to push up the income payments to its shareholders by one per cent like many investment trusts it was able to tap into its income reserves built up over many years to support the 2020 dividends paid to investors although dow says it still leaves the fund with nearly two thirds of a year s income in reserve dow says the search for dividend resilient companies takes it to denmark pharmaceutical giant novo nordisk brazil b3 owner of the brazilian stock exchange and invariably the united states procter gamble the key he says is not to chase bumper payouts we do not buy companies which provide the highest dividend yield on their shares he explains we prefer businesses that offer a lower yield but which are able to deliver dividends through thick and thin novo nordisk says dow is a classic scottish american holding it offers a low dividend equivalent to just over one per cent but the potential for strong dividend growth over the next five years on the back of the success of the appetite suppressants it has developed to combat obesity although the trust is somewhat overshadowed by the 19 6billion global fund scottish mortgage that baillie gifford also runs dow is not intimidated we offer a vehicle whose share price is less volatile than scottish mortgage s he argues we re steadier and we provide a solid income stream scottish american has enjoyed five year returns of 91 per cent these are modest when set against those achieved by scottish mortgage 332 per cent but better than many global equity income rivals such as securities trust of scotland 66 per cent and invesco global equity income 57 per cent the trust s stock market identification code is 0787369 and its ticker is sain the annual charges total 0 7 per cent
scattered across an isolated flat plain in shaanxi province near the ancient capital of xi an lie dozens of spectacular pyramid mounds that are little known outside of china mixed in with the reality of these impressive tombs is a legend of an enormous 1 000 foot white jewel capped pyramid that would outshine even the great pyramid of giza while some researchers believe that aerial sightings of the white pyramid of xi an correspond with the maoling pyramid tomb of emperor wu of han others maintain that the legendary pyramid has yet to be found pyramids also called trapezoidal burial mounds near xi an china hartwig hausdorf first sighting of the white pyramid of xian fred meyer schroder 1912 reported sightings of an enormous white pyramid in china date back more than a century to the diary entries of american travel agent and trader fred meyer schroder who spotted a set of pyramids in the distance while walking with a buddhist monk guide in shaanxi province in 1912 meyer scroder reported seeing one giant pyramid along with smaller pyramids surrounding it it was even more uncanny than if we had found it in the wilderness he wrote but those were to some extent exposed to the eyes of the world but still totally unknown in the western world schroder estimated that the main pyramid was at least 300 meters high roughly 1 000 feet with a 500 meter 1 640 ft side such dimensions would give the structure a volume ten times greater than that of the great pyramid in egypt which measures 140 meters 450 ft in height schroder s mongolian guide bogdo informed him that the pyramids are at least 3 000 years old and that information about them is recorded in ancient monastic documents and is well known in local legend google image of a pyramid near the xian city in china on 34 22 north and 108 41 east public domain second sighting of the white pyramid of xian james gaussman 1945 the second and most famous sighting of the white pyramid of xi an came from united states army air corps pilot named james gaussman who was flying from china to assam in india in the spring of 1945 when he reportedly saw a huge white jewel capped pyramid to the southwest of xi an he later wrote i flew around a mountain and then we came to a valley directly below us was a gigantic white pyramid it looked as if it were from a fairy tale the pyramid was draped in shimmering white it could have been metal or some other form of stone it was white on all sides what was most curious about it was its capstone a large piece of precious gem like material i was deeply moved by the colossal size of the thing maurice sheahan claimed to have spotted a giant white pyramid while flying over the qin ling mountains in china jamguo cc by sa 1 0 third sighting of the white pyramid of xian colonel maurice sheahan 1947 just two years after gaussman s supposed sighting of a white jewel capped pyramid colonel maurice sheahan far eastern director of trans world airlines was flying over a valley near the qin ling mountains in china approximately 64 kilometers 40 mi southwest of xi an in shaanxi province when he saw a giant pyramid in the landscape below sheahan s encounter was reported in the march 28 edition of the new york times under the headline u s flier reports huge chinese pyramid in isolated mountains southwest of sian in the article sheehan is reported as having said that the pyramid was around 1 000 ft high and 1 500 ft wide and seemed to dwarf those of egypt two days after the report the new york times published a photo of the supposed pyramid which was later attributed to gaussman meanwhile chinese archaeologists were denying that any such pyramid existed the photograph was somewhat disappointing it was not pure white nor was it jewel capped and it did not appear to be 1 000 ft high begging questions as to whether the photo was merely a filler added by the newspaper and not taken by gaussman at all the photograph was later identified as the well known maoling burial mound the tomb of emperor wu of han 156 87 bce located in xingping shaanxi province china about 40 km 25 mi to the northwest of the provincial capital of xi an photograph published in new york times may 30 1947 supposedly taken by james gaussman which was later identified to be the maoling burial mound in xingping the maoling mausoleum maoling is the largest of the western han dynasty pyramids or trapezoidal burial mounds constructed as imperial mausoleums over 2 000 years ago but is still significantly smaller than the reported size of the white pyramid of xi an the tumulus is built with rammed earth and clay with a rectangular base of approximately 220 x 220 meters 720 x 720 ft and a height of 50 meters 155 ft construction of the tomb started in the second year of emperor wu s reign 139 bc and was completed upon his death some 53 years later the tomb was filled precious grave goods many of which are now on display at a nearby museum surround maoling are a series of smaller tombs that belong to emperor wu s favorite concubine lady li the military strategist hao qubing and other members of the royal court traditional portrait of emperor wu of han said to have been buried in the maoling burial mound public domain does the white pyramid of xian really exist many researchers who have explored both the legend and the sightings of the white pyramid of xi an do not believe that it corresponds to the maoling burial mound as evidence they cite the fact that the sightings placed the white pyramid near the qin ling mountains while maoling lies in an isolated flat plain model of the mausoleum pyramid of han yang ling near xi an model of pyramid in han yang ling museum public domain on the one hand the descriptions do not match up furthermore maoling lies to the northwest of xi an while gaussman and sheahan placed the pyramid to the southwest on the other sheahan described the white pyramid as having a perfect pyramidal form which contrasts to the real world flat topped appearance of the maoling mausoleum is it possible that the new york times simply used a photo of maoling as a stock photo to represent a pyramid in china leaving open the possibility that a real white pyramid is still out there waiting to be discovered or were schroder gaussman and sheahan all mistaken in their descriptions and size estimations and their sightings really were of maoling some believe that the white pyramid may lie within the rugged terrain of the qin ling mountains difficult to spot among the towering mountains and deep gorges numerous researchers and explorers have pursued the white pyramid of xi an but none to date have been successful top image does the fabled 1 000 ft white pyramid of xian in china really exist source evgeniybobrov adobe stock

washington d c the commerce department has reported that during the third quarter of 2021 the u s economy grew by 2 3 percent slightly higher than last month s estimate of a 2 1 percent growth but prospects for a future recovery has been put in doubt by the rapid spread of the omicron variant of covid 19 the higher than expected growth is due mainly to stronger consumer spending than what was previously expected as well as businesses restoring their inventories faster than initial estimates predicted economic growth soared to 6 3 percent in the first quarter and 6 7 percent in the second quarter of 2021 but the emergence of the delta variant in the summer is blamed for the third quarter slowdown the appearance of omicron in addition to high inflation and lingering supply chain issues caused concerns that growth in 2022 could be stifled and cause the stock market to fluctuate however new optimism that omicron will be manageable sent the dow jones industrial average rising 560 points this week and another 261 points on december 23 meanwhile president joe biden convened a meeting of his supply chain disruptions task force in washington which discussed the bottlenecks at ports and other issues that created shortages of goods and contributed to higher prices for consumers packages are moving gifts are being delivered shelves are not empty biden said however sung won sohn economics and business professor at loyola marymount university in los angeles said history is repeating itself with the covid 19 virus suddenly reappearing and dampening economic growth prospects as reported by abc news
if you re planning the ultimate getaway why not look to the heavens according to astrology discovers lucy holden we each have a place in the world where love success and happiness are guaranteed kimberly dewhirst i wasn t looking for love in hong kong but venus had other ideas my life is on track to reach a personal and professional zenith next year if i move to mauritius this is according to kimberly dewhirst an astrocartographer who has studied my birth chart projected it on to a world map and knows where i should and shouldn t go to get the most from the planetary influences in my life your saturn line is bang on mauritius she explains and so it would be a really good place to understand your responsibility authority and how hard you ve worked to get where you are astrocartography a relatively new form of astrology is experiencing a hike in trendiness thanks to viral tiktok videos that attempt to explain how different places hold different planetary influences for us based on where and when we were born when astrocartographers draw up a natal map your birth chart they look at where the planets were in the sky at the time you were born and are presented with lines that correspond with the movement of major celestial bodies such as planets the sun and the moon these lines are different for everyone and are thought to bring out a different quality in you when you re in a place near that line everything that happens on earth is in the stars also known as relocation astrology astrocartography was invented in the 1970s by jim lewis an astrologer who noticed that his car broke down in the same spot in the nevada desert every time he drove through it it turned out he had a mars line running right through that location which equates to anger and accidents and cars explains kimberly typically the people interested in astrocartography are looking for guidance adds 37 year old kimberly who studied at the london school of astrology lsa in 2013 after completing a degree in english and marketing in leeds during a pandemic in which lives have been turned upside down it makes sense that more of us are asking where should i go to improve my life astrocartography doesn t just show us where we should go but also with whom and even what we should buy there and while she would never tell someone to say put their money in stocks in a place with favourable planetary influences kimberly can advise on whether conducting business purchasing a home or making an investment might be better in one part of the world compared to another after attending a conference at the lsa on this unique branch of stargazing kimberly became fascinated realising she wanted to delve deeper she hatched a plan i went to the conference just before i was setting off on a grown up backpacking trip so i decided to travel to my energy lines which were in australia china japan thailand and miami to see how each place affected me having visited hong kong china and then hopped back to hong kong she was two weeks into her stay when she went on a tinder date i wasn t looking for love but it made total sense because my venus line is in hong kong for kimberly the position of venus the planet of love sex desire flirtation and pleasure meant she was presented with people that could make me happy seven years later she still lives on her venus line in hong kong with the man she met on tinder who s now her husband it is also where she writes horoscopes for spotify and helps people understand astrocartography and now it s my turn after asking me to send her the date time and location of my birth as well as specifics about significant cities or countries she reads my stars and tells me i had a powerful cluster of planets in capricorn when i was born it s what we call a stellium she says because the moon venus saturn and mars rising were so close together it meant you were born with a lot of presence there s an emphasis on you a long awaited child she asks people look to you for entertainment a lot comes back to you and your initiating qualities having established that my best life could be lived in mauritius we look at my past before we meet kimberly asked me to send her a list of places where significant events had happened to me from the stars and my planet lines she claims she can give me some reasons amsterdam where i ve had several relationships and which crops up repeatedly in my life has the same energy as lisbon and paris according to my charts and is led by my moon ascendent but also affected by the position of neptune uranus mars and venus which tells her that those cities were amid the romance places of waywardness sensitivity and self sabotage the chart suggests you learned lessons and had experiences that were problematic she tells me having been on romantic breaks to paris and lisbon that instead involved a lot of alcohol and soul searching about what we were doing together her analysis seems quite accurate your star destinations for 2022 astrologer kimberly dewhirst picks the best getaways for your aries take it easy with a meditative holiday in bali that gives you an opportunity to switch off completely taurus you re pulled towards your peers so head to thailand and connect with like minded people doing something charitable or altruistic gemini your horoscope wants you to be seen so jet to new york city where you might get noticed cancer it s time to broaden your outlook and your horizons why not take your work on the road try hot desking in barcelona leo face your fears in switzerland from a helicopter ride to tightrope walking or white water rafting do something that scares you virgo if a special person has made themselves known suggest a fun trip somewhere new to you both singles might meet their match in italy libra a spa that gets you back on your feet needn t be a dream book a heavenly break in costa rica to bring you back to a perfect equilibrium scorpio indulge in a fun romantic trip through california and don t miss the love motels sagittarius it s time to reconnect with a place from the past or to anchor yourself with a trip that nourishes your roots mykonos is all the inspiration you need capricorn venture out with friends for a few nights closer to home a visit to a spa in bath would be ideal aquarius head to places that inspire you like berlin perhaps you re scoping out a future home a place to retire or looking for an investment pisces it s time to break out of your comfort zone so why not go big in japan say yes to opportunities advertisement we move on to cuba where i once went on an are we going to do this or not romantically questioning holiday kimberly tells me that the country is on my sun line which symbolises ego men kings rulers and flags we were born to raise i didn t choose cuba as the destination but rather an egotistical man who thought he was a king of several things did so i appreciate her analysis when you were maybe eating a pineapple were you able to acknowledge what was coming up for you in the relationship at the time she asks as i try to remember if i ate any pineapples but think it was mainly fish in torrential rain the sun figuring in my birth chart also suggests to kimberly that there were money issues which there were with both of us worrying about finances at the time and the eagerness to get back to the job is accurate too given that i d been out of work for months and was about to start job hunting on our return as a natural cynic i wonder whether there s an element of self fulfilling prophecy about all of this if kimberly tells me i ll excel politically and professionally in mauritius will i therefore have the confidence and ambition to do that perhaps unsurprisingly she doesn t think so it depends more on the ability of the astrologer to translate your birth charts because everything that happens on earth is in the stars from incarceration to the death of a child she says some astrocartographers say people should go nowhere near certain planet lines ones that symbolise gruelling hard work for example but those can work very well for some people it depends totally on the person you re reading for and what they re looking to achieve the great news for anyone not feeling flush enough to move to mauritius is that according to kimberly energies can be part absorbed through culturally relevant activities in other words you can benefit from astrocartography without jumping on a plane you could watch a film located there or walk the streets on google maps she says if you love pictures of the eiffel tower you might have an ascending moon in paris and so owning artwork or buying a lamp in the style of design popular there can bring you the same energy if anyone knows a good place to buy mauritian lamps will you let me know check out kimberly s horoscopes blog and astrocartography adventures at starsignstyle com and follow her on instagram and twitter at

editor s note this article is rich in valuable facts and we share the same viewpoints in almost everything it states we think most of the authors predictions will come to pass for starters no social democrat or pseudo leftist was ever able or willing to neutralize the right and the organized bourgeoisie the case of greece s syriza is perhaps the most eloquent example in recent memory that the international bourgeoisie already took boric s full measure as another tsipras can be seen in the way the us media is treating him with unusual courtesy and respect for a supposed leftist firebrand it s worth remembering the capitalist media have a great and near infallible nose to detect real from phony leftists and real leftists are always demonized from the start in this regard boric s confusing and at times objectively pro imperialist attacks on longstanding anti imperialist nations like cuba or venezuela under washington s regime change pressure seem less than encouraging his only clearly progressive stance is toward israel which he strongly criticices as an apartheid state 1 unfortunately despite its strengths the piece suffers being a trotskyist analysis from some twists innuendoes and interpretations that mar some of its impact pg c elebrations erupted across chile beginning on sunday night as it became clear that gabriel boric the pseudo left former student protest leader and candidate of the frente amplio electoral coalition had defeated the far right candidate josé antonio kast of the christian social front by a wide margin with 99 9 percent of the ballots counted 4 62 million or 55 8 percent went to boric the highest number of votes cast for any candidate since the return to civilian rule in 1990 he placed first in 11 of the country s 16 districts in the working class communes of santiago like la pintana puento alto san ramon la granja the vote for boric surpassed 70 percent of the electorate the fascistic josé antonio kast of the christian social front received 3 65 million votes or 44 15 percent participation of eligible voters increased by 1 2 million compared to the first round ballot in november when kast placed first and boric second sunday s second round election established another record with the largest number of ballots cast in the republic s history 8 63 million or 55 65 percent of all eligible voters the masses of people who streamed into la alameda the main avenue of santiago and the hundreds of thousands who took to the streets across the country were celebrating what they perceive as a victory against fascism and an advance for the struggle against social inequality poverty and repression that gave rise to demonstrations of millions in 2019 crowds chanted el pueblo unido jamás será vencido the people united shall never be defeated the anthem of salvador allende s popular unity government brought to power in 1970 as part of an international revolutionary wave of the working class and toppled by the us backed coup of september 11 1973 the tragic experience of chile exposed the lie of that slogan the people meaning chileans of all social classes could not then and cannot now be united because of the objective existence of irreconcilable class interests under capitalism that dangerous myth was a cornerstone of the national reformist allende government which used the term people as a means of burying the interests of the working class the stalinist communist party was most vociferous in advancing the idea the armed forces and the carabineros were the people in uniform privileged layers of the middle class and even the so called progressive bourgeoisie were part of the people this reactionary theory was connected to that of a two stage revolution and the bankrupt concept of a peaceful parliamentary road to socialism through popular fronts the fact that this idea was exploded with the fascist military coup that overthrew allende s popular unity government and led to the murder disappearance and torture of tens of thousands has not stopped the same forces from promoting these discredited and reactionary conceptions today far from unity social and class tensions will be raised to a fever pitch under a boric government the coming to power of the pseudo left frente amplio and the stalinist communist party has raised immense expectations among increasingly radicalized workers students and youth only two years ago beginning in october 2019 anti capitalist marches and demonstrations erupted across chile involving at one point half the country s population and lasting for months this transformative experience expressed the conscious attempt by the masses to articulate grievances accumulated over decades against entrenched social inequality poverty wages and starvation pensions a crippled public health and education system burgeoning student and household debt rampant police and military violence criminalization of social protests suppression of indigenous demands and nepotism corruption and graft at all levels of the state popular expectations will be quickly dispelled by the incoming government boric had already shifted the axis of his platform to the right during the campaign picking up talking points on security and other issues from the playbook of his fascistic opponent moreover corporate and financial capital will make the economy scream if any measures come into conflict with their stronghold over chile already the upper echelons of society are transferring their personal wealth overseas more than 50bn has been moved out of chile since october 2019 as the wealthy shift assets abroad according to a central bank official reported the financial times last thursday bond issuance on local markets has all but dried up after the pension withdrawals and boric s pledge to dismantle the private pension system making chile one of the biggest latin american debt issuers on international markets this year the santiago stock market closed 6 8 percent down on sunday while the dollar rose to record levels the us based investment bank jpmorgan responded to the election by declaring that the market will need rapid signals of real moderation in order to minimize risk similarly the wall street ratings agency moody s declared that government policies that improve the confidence of businesses and investors will be fundamental to supporting solid growth backed by solid private investment while predicting that boric will have to lower the tone of his spending proposals to preserve fiscal stability to appease the financial markets and the transnational corporations boric will have to quickly drop any pretense of implementing social measures that require a substantial commitment of resources and to proceed with a pro business program he will inevitably be compelled to unleash repression when his government s program clashes with the unfulfilled expectations of the masses a move that can only embolden the extreme right he made his right wing course explicitly clear in his first address as president elect before a mass rally in santiago sunday night the future of chile needs all of us on the side of the people and i hope that we have the maturity to count on ideas and proposals to start my government he told his audience i know that beyond the differences we have in particular with josé antonio kast we know how to build bridges so that our compatriots can live better boric s mention of the name of his opponent the far right defender of the crimes of pinochet s 17 year fascist military dictatorship and the son of an ex nazi wehrmacht officer provoked loud booing from the crowd to which he responded yes josé antonio kast too to build democracy he had held a private meeting with the extreme rightist that same evening in a santiago hotel room he emphasized his commitment to work with the right which means both an invitation and an obligation to dialogue i honestly see it as an opportunity to meet again to unite in great deeds for the good of our country to achieve broad and lasting agreements any changes he said would have to be step by step gradual boric has a proven record of defending private property relations and upholding the capitalist market a radical university student leader in the 2011 education protests he has since 2014 sat in the lower house of the chilean congress lending at critical moments support to the government of the day in 2019 he infamously entered into national unity talks with the right wing government of billionaire president sebastian piñera to head off the massive anti capitalist demonstrations he then proceeded to support in general draconian and anti democratic laws that have permitted the criminalization of all forms of protest the outgoing piñera was not about to return the favor sunday s election was marred by heavy handed attempts by the piñera government to disenfranchise large swathes of working class communities early in the day independent media reported that the government was operating the public transport system at only 50 percent capacity citizens from across the metropolitan region with its close to 9 million inhabitants turned to social media to denounce the government for disrupting the election as dozens of working class communes across the country had to mobilize their own means to get to the polls and an untold number weren t able to exercise their right to vote minister of transport and telecommunications gloria hutt denied government intervention but bus drivers revealed to the media that the private commercial bus companies were operating on a sunday timetable with 50 percent or less the number of vehicles for a usual workday the pseudo left frente amplio and the stalinist communist party the political tendencies directly impacted by this thoroughly anti democratic intervention into the election process limited themselves to criticizing the government izkia siches who left the presidency of the medical association to head boric s campaign tweeted before the operation of gobiernodechile to limit public transport in favor of its candidate we call to organize cabs buses and shared cars to transport voters they then buried what was a significant attack on the democratic right to vote as it became clear within half an hour of the polls closing that boric had won by a sweeping majority boric s government will be modeled in large measure on spain s podemos spanish socialist workers party psoe coalition composed of thoroughly corrupt pro capitalist stooges who are willing to downplay the threat of a military coup just to keep the working class politically demobilized just this last week they unleashed riot police against striking metalworkers in cádiz like the chilean coalition podemos with which boric maintains intimate political ties is promoted as left but there is absolutely nothing left wing about it rather it is a pseudo left outfit that speaks for self obsessed upper middle class layers who wish only for a greater distribution of the wealth within the top 10 percent along with positions of authority and political power for themselves the honeymoon with boric will be short lived the chilean working class will increasingly come into conflict with his right wing policies from the moment he enters the la moneda palace notes 1 boric has said that the democratic left should not have a double standard on human rights or use the principle of self determination to justify human rights violations he said that just as the left must condemn the violation of human rights in chile during the dictatorship and also today for example with the criminalization of the mapuche people or with the treatment that the current government is giving part of the migrant population the white coups in brazil honduras and paraguay the israeli occupation of palestine or the interventionism of the united states we must from the left with the same force condemn the permanent restriction of freedoms in cuba the repressive government of ortega in nicaragua the dictatorship in china and the weakening of the basic conditions of democracy in venezuela during his 2021 presidential campaign he said that the 2021 nicaraguan general election was fraudulent and called on the communist party of chile one of his allies to rescind its original statement supporting daniel ortega s government regarding bolivia boric has mentioned his intentions to re establish diplomatic relations between both countries after they were severed in 1978 he has supported argentina s position regarding the falkland islands regarding the israeli occupation of palestine boric has supported the state of palestine on several occasions in 2019 after he received a gift from the jewish community in chile he called for israel to return the occupied palestinian territories in a tweet he called israel a genocidal and murderous state which was violating international treaties and said that no matter how powerful a country is we must defend international principles and human rights boric has denied accusations of antisemitism and said that he rejects any kind of discrimination he described the israeli occupation of territories outside the 1967 borders as a violation of international law in october 2021 boric and other deputies presented a bill to forbid the import of products made in israeli settlements which are considered illegal by the international community the bill based on recommendations by human rights watch was described by the american jewish committee as a danger to the chilean jewish community and to israel
help enlighten your fellows be sure to pass this on survival depends on it imperialism is only capitalism in its final monopoly phase eric zuesse i ndia like the usa that used to be was born out of a revolution in 1776 in u s in 1947 in india against imperialism in fact against british imperialism the very same master i e enemy as the american public had and ever since 1945 still has though this time in the form of a united uk u s deep state aristocracy who control the u s government behind the scenes the world is now splitting up into two one side is the pro imperialist or neocon side the conquerors of iraq libya ukraine guatemala and many other countries which includes all of the axis powers during ww ii germany italy and japan plus almost all of the other eu nations plus israel plus almost all of the western hemisphere countries it s headed behind the scenes by the u s and uk billionaires on the opposite side are the nations that the imperialist nations the united fascist billionaires target they are china russia iran and their allies all of which targeted nations are ideologically committed anti imperialist nations hadn t yet buckled to them that the aggressiveness of the imperialist nations is just a historical fact about the world during the years after 1944 and it is now driving the remaining targeted nations principally china russia and iran toward closer and closer cooperation amongst themselves so that if ww iii happens then it will be between the imperialist nations on the one side versus the anti imperialist nations on the other it would be a nuclear war updated version of the ww ii axis pro imperialist nations versus the allied anti imperialist ones churchill was imperialist but he was forced by fdr to suppress his imperialism during ww ii therefore virtually all wars and coups after ww ii have been wars and coups by the u s and its allies to conquer take control over additional nations nations thatbuckled to them that the aggressiveness of the imperialist nations is just a historical fact about the world during the years after 1944 and it is now driving thetargeted nations principally china russia and iran toward closer and closer cooperation amongst themselves so thatww iii happens then it will be it would be a nuclear war updated version of the ww ii axis pro imperialist nations versus the allied anti imperialist ones churchill was imperialist but he was forced by fdr to suppress his imperialism during ww ii truman instead adopted churchill s imperialism all of the former axis powers germany italy and japan would then be led by the rhodesist uk u s israel team reality india has recently been tending to get off the ideological fence that it has been sitting on ever since 1947 to side increasingly with its fellow anti imperialist nations if it finally decisively does so then that would become the most momentous blow yet against the rhodesist uk u s zionist joint global empire ever since the uk itself lost india on against the imperialist powers including finally at long last against the uk which was india s former master given this india has recently been tending to get off the ideological fence that it has been sitting on ever since 1947 to side increasingly with its fellow imperialist nations if it finally decisively so then that would become the most momentous blow yet against the rhodesist uk u s zionist joint global empire ever since the uk itself lost india on 15 august 1947 india would then no longer be neutralist it would instead become an additional enemy of the imperialist powers it would become allied with china russia and iran the imperialist powers including finally at long last the uk which was for a long time i was hesitating to say that india seems likely to go with the anti imperialists because the indications that india was trending in this direction concerned only recent decisions by its government not anything that s rooted deeply in indian public opinion which would separately indicate deep seated cultural support ideological indian cultural support for any such radically new commitment by its government a geostrategic earthquake in the making in the world s second most populous nation but finally i believe that i have found that ideological cultural support to exist in india and will describe here the evidence for it respect their government respect for the government is a sine qua non essential in order for any public health system to be able to function effectively without it the public won t trust their government s public health requirements such as masking vaccinations etc to protect them against a pandemic but as things have subsequently turned out the indian people do trust their government almost as much as the people in china do i should start by noting that i had wrongly predicted on 1 august 2020 that india and brazil are now the global worst coronavirus nations and i had based that false forecast for india upon regarding covid policy effectiveness the key isn t so much the healthcare system as it is the public health system and that s quite evidently poor in all three of the worst performing countries india brazil and u s however unlike the u s and brazil india has turned out to have a far better public health system than i knew that s because india has a population who respect for the government is a essential in order for any public health system to be able to function effectively without it the public won t trust their government s public health requirements such as masking vaccinations etc to protect them against a pandemic but as things have subsequently turned out the indian people do trust their government almost as much as the people in china do china and india had the highest percentages of willing the lowest percentage who said that they are unwilling to be vaccinated in all of the 15 surveyed countries earlier morning consult had headlined on 15 july 2021 highest 20 were unwilling and 43 had been vaccinated in america the second worst performer on this factor 19 were unwilling 19 times higher than china s 1 and 67 had been vaccinated in the 15 july polling report 30 of russians had said they were unwilling and 19 of americans did 2 did in each of china and india the opponents to vaccination seem to be the most solidly implacable anywhere 19 in both pollings in america on 9 december 2021 morning consult polls headlined the u s has a lower vaccination rate than any other country tracked besides russia china and india had the highest percentages of willing the lowest percentage who said that they are unwilling to be vaccinated in all of the 15 surveyed countries earlier morning consult had headlined on 15 july 2021 the u s has a higher rate of vaccine opposition than any country tracked besides russia the questions had been identical in both surveys china and india turned out to have the highest vaccination rates each polling had surveyed 75 000 nationally representative samples of adults in india the sample is representative of the literate population illiterates are especially difficult to survey anywhere the 9 december polling showed only 1 each in china and india to be unwilling to be vaccinated and it found 87 of chinese having already been vaccinated and 86 of indians having been vaccinated in russia where the vaccination opposition was the 20 were unwilling and 43 had been vaccinated in america the second worst performer on this factor 19 were unwilling 19 times higher than china s 1 and 67 had been vaccinated in the 15 july polling report 30 of russians had said they were unwilling and 19 of americans did 2 did in each of china and india previous polls have shown that whereas russia s president putin is highly trusted russia s government is not so russia is a mixed bag partly like america and partly like china where both the leader xi and the government are enormously trusted russia has turned out to have been performing on both disease cases and disease deaths better than u s but not nearly as well as either china or india vladimir putin came into power in russia in 2000 committed to undoing the americanization of his country as much as possible but he never undid its libertarianism and therefore russia s covid performance is turning out to be nearer to u s than to china in this sense india which has also become much americanized might actually now be moving away from america at a faster clip now than is russia this would put india closer to the anti imperialist bloc what is important in those polls is that they display a deeper rooted socialism in india than in russia america is rather extremely toward the libertarian neoliberal pole of ideology which is opposite to socialism almost all developed countries are more socialistic than is america perhaps russia s having once had an empire whereas india did not is the reason why india is now moving more clearly now toward the anti imperialist bloc which is being led by china russia and iran additionally confirming those hypotheses is the edelman trust barometer 2021 which surveyed in 27 nations one subhead in it is a trust reckoning for china and the u s it showed that the highest 3 nations on overall trust in the country s various institutions in both 2020 and 2021 were india china and indonesia all at 72 to 82 u s scored in the bottom 30 of nations 19 in 2020 at 47 and 21 in 2021 at 48 japan was in the bottom 10 at 25 42 in 2020 and 26 40 in 2021 the edelman rankings also showed that the highest 4 nations in the 74 80 range on willing to vaccinate were in order from the top india brazil mexico and china u s was 20 at 59 japan was 24 at 54 russia was 27 last at 40 the global average on this was 64 specifically trust in the government in those 27 nations was the highest in s 1 and 2 tied being china and saudi arabia 82 3 uae 80 and 4 india 79 u s was 19 42 japan was 22 37 russia was 24 34 south africa was 27 and at 27 though russia has become anti imperialist due to america s increasing attempt along with its nato to conquer it india is increasingly becoming anti imperialist russians and chinese are anti imperialist by urgent necessity in order to protect their nationhood or sovereignty over their own territory which the imperialists covet however india is becoming anti imperialist now because of the uk u s rhodesist empire now forcing the world to choose up sides this is happening in regard to the imperialists trying to break taiwan off from china and trying to force donbass back into ukraine fence sitting won t any longer be allowed by the imperialists they demand a commitment or a stronger commitment to the imperialist bloc financial express headlined against the global aggressors but things seem to be drifting that way anyway however and whenever india s government might happen to make that decision it would be a wrenching break away from the deep cultural roots that england s empire had planted in indian culture ever since the big barrier to india s decisively joining the anti imperialist side including china is a 2009 india china border conflict in a mutually contested region arunachal pradesh however on 2 december 2019 theheadlined exercise hand in hand 2019 troops from india china to conduct joint drill this week and reported that throughout the following decade the two countries had been increasing their mutual trust in addition to this the still contested region has only around a million population and isn t of geostrategic significance so if it were to stand in the way of india s government decisively joining the anti imperialist side then china s government would be foolish not to simply tell india s fine that s part of your territory with that minor concession china could effectively win india as being a member of their team but things seem to be drifting that way anyway however and whenever india s government might happen to make that decision it would be a wrenching break away from the deep cultural roots that england s empire had planted in indian culture ever since 1614 when the world s first stock company which had been formed in 1600 the british east india company started to take control over india which ultimately meant also to train india s aristocracy in the english language and customs so as to make them representatives of the british monarch this would be the final divorce of india from britain s aristocracy and of course china already went through that divorce when mao beat out chiang kai shek for control over china in 1949 which was a huge defeat against the rhodesists the stark covid policy differences between on the one hand china and india versus on the other america and its nato and japanese and australian allies might be the canary in the coal mine indicator of which way geostrategic fence sitters such as india will go independent countries where the population trust their government will tend to go with the anti imperialists while independent countries that don t such as ukraine will tend to side as ukraine did in 2014 due to obama s coup with the fascists who after hitler are and have been solidly in the rhodesist camp the views expressed herein are solely those of the author and may or may not reflect those of the greanville post however we do think they are important enough to be transmitted to a wider audience if you find the above useful pass it on become an influence multiplier the battle against the big lie killing the world will not be won

washington d c the commerce department has reported that during the third quarter of 2021 the u s economy grew by 2 3 percent slightly higher than last month s estimate of a 2 1 percent growth but prospects for a future recovery has been put in doubt by the rapid spread of the omicron variant of covid 19 the higher than expected growth is due mainly to stronger consumer spending than what was previously expected as well as businesses restoring their inventories faster than initial estimates predicted economic growth soared to 6 3 percent in the first quarter and 6 7 percent in the second quarter of 2021 but the emergence of the delta variant in the summer is blamed for the third quarter slowdown the appearance of omicron in addition to high inflation and lingering supply chain issues caused concerns that growth in 2022 could be stifled and cause the stock market to fluctuate however new optimism that omicron will be manageable sent the dow jones industrial average rising 560 points this week and another 261 points on december 23 meanwhile president joe biden convened a meeting of his supply chain disruptions task force in washington which discussed the bottlenecks at ports and other issues that created shortages of goods and contributed to higher prices for consumers packages are moving gifts are being delivered shelves are not empty biden said however sung won sohn economics and business professor at loyola marymount university in los angeles said history is repeating itself with the covid 19 virus suddenly reappearing and dampening economic growth prospects as reported by abc news
although it s not quite new year our financial thoughts will soon be heading towards 2022 there will be self assessment tax returns to be completed and tax bills to pay many readers will also take the opportunity to review their investments for example those held in a tax friendly isa or pension to see whether they remain on track with this in mind the mail on sunday asked a mix of investment experts as well as an avid reader and yours truly where they would be investing any spare cash in the months ahead as the end of the tax year looms and isa allowances and pension contribution limits need to be used or lost india did well us is pricey so i m sticking to home turf jason hollands tilney investment management my rule is to hold no more than 20 funds in my investment portfolio if i m thinking about adding a new fund it forces me to review my existing holdings and decide if one of them needs to be replaced in favour of the new idea jason hollands otherwise my approach is to top up existing holdings to keep my asset allocation the split between different markets in line with where i think it should be for the long run the composition of my investment portfolio naturally drifts over time as stock markets don t all move in tandem with my pension fund up against the lifetime allowance limit my investment focus is now on my isa i m willing to take quite a lot of risk as my investment time horizon is long term so my portfolio is firmly focused on equity based investment funds my holdings in india did incredibly well this year and have become a bigger part of my overall portfolio so next year i ll be focused on topping up my funds in developed markets us equity valuations are too expensive indeed i think the us market s exposure to technology companies which have powered great investment returns in recent years might now come under pressure as a result of higher inflation and increasing interest rates i will therefore be topping up my uk equity holdings as the uk stock market remains undervalued compared to other developed markets it has an abundance of exposure to financials and commodities sectors that typically benefit from rising rates and higher inflation i also think the frenzy of overseas bids we ve seen this year for uk companies will continue which will create investment opportunities i therefore plan to top up my existing holding in investment fund fidelity special situations and add to a more recently established position in artemis uk select both focus on companies that the managers believe are undervalued it s a style of investing that spent a few years in the wilderness but has started to work well again over the past year three way split europe asia and renewables ben yearsley shore financial planning ben yearsley unusually for me i haven t invested any new money in my isa this tax year but i have been buying and selling shares within my account taking advantage of price volatility in some of the holdings aged 45 i m still a long term equity investor and three investment themes are beckoning me to invest europe asia and renewable energy europe has been unloved as an investment area for a long time yet company profits are rising although omicron might put a spanner in the works three funds i especially like are investment trust european opportunities run by star manager alexander darwall at devon equity management martin currie european unconstrained and stock market listed montanaro european smaller companies i m always positive on asia as an investment opportunity and i like fund matthews asia innovative growth the fund invests in those companies benefiting from the region s emerging middle classes with money to spend asia s consumer market is expected to become bigger than those of the united states and europe combined by 2030 that s some statistic which is why funds such as matthews asia innovative growth should thrive although many renewable assets look expensive i m happy to be a decade long investor this investment story isn t going away in a hurry and i will get exposure to it via schroder global energy transition finally i will not invest all my isa money in one go but drip my money in between now and the end of the tax year on april 5 trust in nick train and the good old british pub edward browne retired reader from manchester i will continue to invest in investment trust finsbury growth income run by longstanding manager nick train the 2billion trust has some quality holdings the likes of drinks companies diageo and remy cointreau upmarket fashion business burberry and uk consumer products giant unilever hopefully when the world economy throws off the straitjacket of coronavirus these consumer focused businesses will flourish train is an outstanding manager and you get the benefit of his expertise via the trust at a bargain 0 6 per cent a year i will also continue to add to my holding in pub operator marston s although its recent results were disappointing annual losses for the year to october of 170 million and it has decided not to pay a dividend for the second year running i see it as an economic recovery stock you also can t rule out an overseas bidder given the interest shown in it earlier this year from american private equity company platinum invest in the uk japan and the environment juliet schooling latter chelsea financial services juliet schooling latter most of my spare money this year has been spent on a new kitchen so i don t have much left over to invest but what i do have i ll be investing monthly primarily because things are so opaque at the moment we ve got a new coronavirus variant omicron causing problems and unsettling the stock market this is after the market ignored the interest rate rise ten days ago as a result it s really hard to see how things are going to pan out over the next few months my pension contributions are invested in funds liontrust uk smaller companies and marlborough uk micro cap growth the uk stock market is cheap meaning investors are undervaluing it and long term i think these two funds will do well i also have a lot of my pension invested in india a market that has done really well this year i m not ready yet to take profits i invested in the country about ten years ago and i will leave things alone for the time being for my isa the japanese market looks relatively cheap and it s had a bad year baillie gifford japanese is the fund i have my eye on i also like asi global smaller companies i ve recently invested in ninety one global environment as i really like the long term investment trend of decarbonisation as you can see i invest for the long term and take quite a bit of risk but i tend to stick to funds rather than shares as they are more my area of expertise i did buy some shares in sainsbury s and tesco during the pandemic as i thought they would be winners but i sold them to help pay for my kitchen we re value hotspot of the world brian dennehy fundexpert the uk remains the value hotspot of the world cash rich global investors will continue to make bids for cheap uk businesses next year in this environment i am happy to buy investment fund johcm uk equity income it has delivered a return of 21 per cent over the past year and is chock full of great value stocks the likes of aviva barclays legal general and tesco dividend increases should see the fund deliver investors an income of around five per cent next year brian dennehy fundexpert with his canny canine cassie but my clever dog is sniffing around japan cassie dennehy s canny canine my dog cassie is an unusually clever companion so every year i like to pick a fund inspired by her part border collie part boxer for most of the time she longs to roam the cumbrian hills but for a bit of fun i engage her collie brain for some shepherding of shares japan might appeal i thought if i sound her out with a call japan and a toot on the dog whistle their smaller companies are cheap and the japanese love dogs good choice judging by her happily wagging tail japanese smaller companies are undervalued and overlooked normally shares in such businesses stand at a 25 per cent discount to their larger listed counterparts but that discount is now 45 per cent the largest in more than 20 years no one is paying attention to this opportunity apart from cassie three quarters of smaller companies in japan are covered by no more than one analyst by contrast in the us 73 per cent of smaller companies are covered by three or more analysts i sniff an opportunity buy m g japan smaller companies
this is not the time for young people to rack up giant debts buying their home ex hsbc boss s stark warning as the bank of england eases mortgage rules the city grandee 66 is warning that households should once again be wary of racking up giant debts to buy a home just as interest rates begin to rise flint s intervention comes just days after the bank of england increased interest rates from a record low 0 1 per cent to 0 25 per cent economists now expect further increases to bank base rate in 2022 to curb surging inflation sir douglas flint has first hand experience of meltdowns in the mortgage market the former chairman of hsbc steered the british lender back on track after the global financial crisis left it reeling in 2008 the crash in us sub prime mortgages hit hsbc particularly hard as it owned a 118billion book of american loans now the city grandee 66 is warning that households should once again be wary of racking up giant debts to buy a home just as interest rates begin to rise i personally don t think this is the time to encourage people to over leverage in the housing market he told the mail on sunday house prices as a multiple of average income are at an all time high flint s intervention comes just days after the bank of england increased interest rates from a record low 0 1 per cent to 0 25 per cent economists now expect further increases to bank base rate in 2022 to curb surging inflation and it also comes just as the bank relaxes mortgage rules that were imposed after the financial crisis to stop borrowers taking on unaffordable sums the central bank plans to remove a requirement that means borrowers can only be approved for a mortgage if their finances show they could afford a three percentage point rise in interest rates ending the interest rate rule would help young people borrow more money to climb on to the housing ladder as house prices soar it s a message that clearly makes flint extremely nervous after his experiences in the last

by sumir meghani u s seasonal job postings reached a record of almost u s seasonal job postings reached a record of almost 1 million as major retailers scramble to stock shelves and brace for the demands of an american public that is increasingly willing to conduct their holiday shopping in store some of our nation s largest retailers are looking for short term fixes by offering bonuses and increased hourly rates while these measures may work for the holidays come 2022 if retailers and all industries that rely on hourly staff do not reevaluate their approach to hiring and retaining these workers then the job shortage will continue about 82 3 million americans or 58 percent of the entire country s wage and salary workforce are paid at hourly rates they serve as mall santas or delivery drivers during christmas and beyond that they serve us food clean our airports wash our dishes and pack and ship our e commerce purchases they have kept us safe and supplied during the pandemic and now they are using their collective power to disrupt the way businesses think about staffing challenges for businesses that rely on skilled hourly workers the hourly work sector has undoubtedly seen an increase in both job growth and opportunities as the united states comes out of the pandemic higher vaccination rates an increase in hourly pay and a reduction in covid level unemployment benefits are just a few of the common reasons cited for this growth yet despite the opportunities and seemingly available labor force many of these jobs go unfilled the bureau of labor recently found that there are related quality leadership in the great resignation era the hourly work sector has undoubtedly seen an increase in both job growth and opportunities as the united states comes out of the pandemic higher vaccination rates an increase in hourly pay and a reduction in covid level unemployment benefits are just a few of the common reasons cited for this growth yet despite the opportunities and seemingly available labor force many of these jobs go unfilled the bureau of labor recently found that there are 3 5 million fewer people in the workforce today than there were in february 2020 the hospitality industry for example was ravaged by covid 19 events were canceled travel curtailed and restaurants were shuttered this put 2 7 million americans out of work as of august 2020 and yet with the unemployment rate in this industry dropping from 21 percent to 9 1 percent in just 12 months there remains a massive shortage of people filling these jobs while another 6 percent of hospitality staff voluntarily leave the industry every month the future of skilled hourly work the fluid nature of today s workforce requires training as many shift from one job sector to another according to the on the other end of the spectrum light industrial jobs such as warehousing and meal delivery services have grown exponentially during the pandemic jobs in warehousing and transportation grew 229 percent from 278 000 to 639 000 in 2020 and yet the industry is still forecasting a labor shortfall of more than 2 million jobs by 2030 the fluid nature of today s workforce requires training as many shift from one job sector to another according to the national skills coalition 52 percent of jobs in the united states require skills training beyond high school but less than a four year degree however only 43 percent of american workers have access to the adequate training necessary to fill these in demand positions if we are to continue with a swift and strong economic recovery employers labor organizations the government and staffing firms will all need to step in to fill this skills gap with effective and accessible training programs flexibility is paramount the pandemic has proven that not all work needs to be done on premise hourly workers have witnessed their counterparts in traditional office jobs succeed in remote and hybrid environments and are looking to achieve the same levels of flexibility historically these options have not been possible for hourly professionals since the majority of their work doesn t occur behind a computer screen and requires them to be on site but today s hourly workforce is clear and vocal about their needs and flexibility is at the top of their list they see the ability to work from home as akin to having the option to schedule work around the rest of their lives a traditional workweek is no longer suitable for all employees and that s a significant change in mindset that employers must accommodate to successfully staff their workforce in a post covid 19 environment fortunately nearly nine out of 10 employers agree that hourly workers deserve flexibility in their work schedules more importantly they also agree that it is possible to achieve flexibility and remain productive and successful when workers need to be physically present to perform their job moving forward it s paramount for employers to provide flexible work solutions that appeal to their workforce enabling them to attract and maintain good people technology based staffing platforms and digital job marketplaces can help to facilitate unmatched levels of flexibility and work life balance for the hourly workforce empowering workers to build schedules that fit their lifestyle while connecting businesses with experienced and reliable staff flexible staffing solutions make it possible for hourly workers to fill roles best suited to their skill set during the shifts that work best for them the challenges faced by employers across industries from hospitality food and beverage and retail don t end by offering their workforce more flexible schedules to ensure the future of work in the united states remains bright employers and lawmakers need to recognize that skilled hourly workers represent the majority of the workforce and are the backbone of our economic recovery accommodating the forgotten 58 percent with a flexible schedule and proper training is key to post pandemic prosperity for our workers employers and the economic security of our nation

in 2022 to curb surging inflation and it also comes just as the bank relaxes mortgage rules that were imposed after the financial crisis to stop borrowers taking on unaffordable sums the central bank plans to remove a requirement that means borrowers can only be approved for a mortgage if their finances show they could afford a three percentage point rise in interest rates ending the interest rate rule would help young people borrow more money to climb on to the housing ladder as house prices soar it s a message that clearly makes flint extremely nervous after his experiences in the last

the top 2022 risks in politics and policy outlined over 20 risks in politics and policy and the daily caller news foundation identified eight of the most significant concerns covid the fourth wave looking forward to the risks covid 19 poses heading into 2022 mehlman believes the virus won t suddenly disappear but also won t wipe out humanity he explained to the dcnf i am not an epidemiologist but it feels to me that this is the best example where all expectations are either 1 or 11 you hear it either a common cold or that we will all get sick and die mehlman told the dcnf instead mehlman sees an endemic situation comparing it to a bad flu strain that will have a new flavor each year he explained to the dcnf related doctor says covid cases have started dropping in south african province where omicron first hit at some point we need to get to accepting that it will never go away and that it is not going to kill everybody mehlman told the dcnf the risks are overhyped and the preventions are under embraced he told the dcnf adding that those preventions include mass vaccinations and wearing masks when bad outbreaks occur in south africa we re thankfully seeing a striking decoupling between new covid cases and icu admissions and deaths whether omicron is inherently less virulent whether this hopeful finding is result of baseline immunity in infected or a combination of both is still unclear pic twitter com xtmcsdpcnc scott gottlieb md scottgottliebmd december 19 2021 covid 19 cases continue to soar throughout the country and globe after the emergence of the omicron variant over 90 countries have reported omicron cases forcing some to implement new lockdown rules cases in the u s increased to over 156 000 on friday with the new variant now reported in 43 u s states according to the centers for disease control and prevention the cdc said monday the omicron variant has become the dominant strain in the u s making up 73 of reported cases while cases continue to surge deaths have not increased at the same rate as some believe the new variant is less dangerous than previous strains extreme weather disasters in 2021 we saw an influx in extreme weather disasters increasing costs challenging supply chains and driving policy mehlman explained to the dcnf so far these policies have disfavored fossil fuels reducing investments and inventories causing severe energy inflation mehlman told the dcnf increased severe weather disasters pose a serious risk to insurers mehlman added insurers use historical data to price risk we are increasingly seeing 500 year record floods and other disasters that are out of proportion to what was witnessed in the past mehlman told the dcnf related highest points in two states could get 8 feet of snow from multiday storm atmospheric river these insurers are now being asked to cover things that you didn t think would be insuring things that would be this bad because historically they haven t been mehlman told the dcnf they are now covering people who didn t use to be in harm s way but as a result of changing weather disasters they are now at risk mehlman added pointing to the recent winter freeze in texas a massive ice storm hit texas in february leaving millions without power as the state s power grid became ineffective after it was coated with ice the estimated cost was over 18 million in damages making it one of the most expensive storms for insurers on record manufacturers supply chains there are short term medium term and long term problems facing supply chains entering 2022 mehlman told the dcnf the short term risk is the global employee semi conductor and energy shortages exacerbated by politics medium term challenges for supply chains are the rising theme of economic nationalism mehlman told the dcnf headwinds that made global supply chains so efficient from 1989 through 2019 are fading posing the greatest long term risks u s and chinese economies used to be tied together now they are splitting apart technology used to encourage greater cross border data flows but now regulators are attempting to shut them down mehlman told the dcnf consumer inflation continued inflation will continue to challenge the biden administration s agenda mehlman told the dcnf soaring prices will determine how the federal reserve pursues its monetary policy heading into 2022 how much money the government will try and spend on safety nets and infrastructure and if the administration will continue its antitrust competition reviews mehlman added the companies the administration plans to go after are also probably some of the most productive companies in the economy he told the dcnf inflation has soared to its highest level in 39 years with the consumer price index jumping 0 9 in november bringing the key inflation indicator s year over year increase to 6 8 the producer price index which measures inflation at the wholesale level surged 9 6 year over year as of november growing at the fastest rate ever measured growing inflation along with falling unemployment triggered the federal reserve to accelerate its asset purchasing stimulus while also forecasting three interest rate hikes in 2022 according to cnbc markets irrational exuberance the biggest threat stock markets face in 2022 is potential financial bubbles that would persist as the fed tightens its monetary policy according to mehlman s report the market is clearly out of all its historic wack mehlman told the dcnf the fact that in the last year we saw as much money invested in equities as the last prior 19 years is not normal the fact that so many stocks are down but the biggest five to 10 are off the charts up is also very unusual he added mehlman identified elements of a robust stock market with justified profits but also noticed characteristics of a bubble he told the dcnf related the fed can end inflation but experts say wall street would hate it stock markets tumbled monday as the spread of the omicron variant triggered lockdowns in european countries the dow jones industrial average dipped 433 28 points at the end of the trading day monday while the s p 500 fell 1 1 and the nasdaq declined 1 2 according to cnbc biden perceived softness president joe biden s perceived softness will serve his political risk entering 2022 according to the report mehlman pointed to biden s softness on the border economy crime and foreign policy as his approval rating continues to plummet and more americans see growing failures and weakness in the respective categories biden and the democrats will have a harder time passing legislation mehlman explained to the dcnf a president with high approval is more feared and followed legislatively it will be harder for him to get people to do what he wants and will also be dangerous news for down the ballot democrats mehlman told the dcnf marist poll do you approve disapprove of joe biden overall 41 55 dems 87 11 indie 29 66 gop 4 95 white 40 56

disapproving biden s disapproval rating surged once again on monday reaching 55 according to an npr pbs news hour marist poll multinationals u s china decoupling looking at the future of u s china relations mehlman saw a steady decoupling between the two world powers but people shouldn t assume everything will catch on fire he told the dcnf related patel unwinding america s catastrophic china mistake both leaders will balance assertiveness and accommodation mehlman wrote in the report businesses should plan for neither detente nor war but stead decoupling with tightening restrictions both nations need to show that they are tough but they both want to avoid a war and a recession both want to challenge big tech but they also want to remain as an innovation powerhouse mehlman told the dcnf brands employee activism business leaders have seen increasing employee activism after the trump administration and george floyd s murder to urge businesses to become engaged in non traditional

looking for some fireworks to light up your portfolio here s where the experts say they will be investing their money in 2022 british banks green energy firms and bargains in japan are tipped to soar we have asked a mix of investment experts as well as an avid reader although it s not quite new year our financial thoughts will soon be heading towards 2022 there will be self assessment tax returns to be completed and tax bills to pay many readers will also take the opportunity to review their investments for example those held in a tax friendly isa or pension to see whether they remain on track with this in mind the mail on sunday asked a mix of investment experts as well as an avid reader and yours truly where they would be investing any spare cash in the months ahead as the end of the tax year looms and isa allowances and pension contribution limits need to be used or lost india did well us is pricey so i m sticking to home turf jason hollands tilney investment management my rule is to hold no more than 20 funds in my investment portfolio if i m thinking about adding a new fund it forces me to review my existing holdings and decide if one of them needs to be replaced in favour of the new idea jason hollands otherwise my approach is to top up existing holdings to keep my asset allocation the split between different markets in line with where i think it should be for the long run the composition of my investment portfolio naturally drifts over time as stock markets don t all move in tandem with my pension fund up against the lifetime allowance limit my investment focus is now on my isa i m willing to take quite a lot of risk as my investment time horizon is long term so my portfolio is firmly focused on equity based investment funds my holdings in india did incredibly well this year and have become a bigger part of my overall portfolio so next year i ll be focused on topping up my funds in developed markets us equity valuations are too expensive indeed i think the us market s exposure to technology companies which have powered great investment returns in recent years might now come under pressure as a result of higher inflation and increasing interest rates i will therefore be topping up my uk equity holdings as the uk stock market remains undervalued compared to other developed markets it has an abundance of exposure to financials and commodities sectors that typically benefit from rising rates and higher inflation i also think the frenzy of overseas bids we ve seen this year for uk companies will continue which will create investment opportunities i therefore plan to top up my existing holding in investment fund fidelity special situations and add to a more recently established position in artemis uk select both focus on companies that the managers believe are undervalued it s a style of investing that spent a few years in the wilderness but has started to work well again over the past year three way split europe asia and renewables ben yearsley shore financial planning ben yearsley unusually for me i haven t invested any new money in my isa this tax year but i have been buying and selling shares within my account taking advantage of price volatility in some of the holdings aged 45 i m still a long term equity investor and three investment themes are beckoning me to invest europe asia and renewable energy europe has been unloved as an investment area for a long time yet company profits are rising although omicron might put a spanner in the works three funds i especially like are investment trust european opportunities run by star manager alexander darwall at devon equity management martin currie european unconstrained and stock market listed montanaro european smaller companies i m always positive on asia as an investment opportunity and i like fund matthews asia innovative growth the fund invests in those companies benefiting from the region s emerging middle classes with money to spend asia s consumer market is expected to become bigger than those of the united states and europe combined by 2030 that s some statistic which is why funds such as matthews asia innovative growth should thrive although many renewable assets look expensive i m happy to be a decade long investor this investment story isn t going away in a hurry and i will get exposure to it via schroder global energy transition finally i will not invest all my isa money in one go but drip my money in between now and the end of the tax year on april 5 trust in nick train and the good old british pub edward browne retired reader from manchester i will continue to invest in investment trust finsbury growth income run by longstanding manager nick train the 2billion trust has some quality holdings the likes of drinks companies diageo and remy cointreau upmarket fashion business burberry and uk consumer products giant unilever hopefully when the world economy throws off the straitjacket of coronavirus these consumer focused businesses will flourish train is an outstanding manager and you get the benefit of his expertise via the trust at a bargain 0 6 per cent a year i will also continue to add to my holding in pub operator marston s although its recent results were disappointing annual losses for the year to october of 170 million and it has decided not to pay a dividend for the second year running i see it as an economic recovery stock you also can t rule out an overseas bidder given the interest shown in it earlier this year from american private equity company platinum invest in the uk japan and the environment juliet schooling latter chelsea financial services juliet schooling latter most of my spare money this year has been spent on a new kitchen so i don t have much left over to invest but what i do have i ll be investing monthly primarily because things are so opaque at the moment we ve got a new coronavirus variant omicron causing problems and unsettling the stock market this is after the market ignored the interest rate rise ten days ago as a result it s really hard to see how things are going to pan out over the next few months my pension contributions are invested in funds liontrust uk smaller companies and marlborough uk micro cap growth the uk stock market is cheap meaning investors are undervaluing it and long term i think these two funds will do well i also have a lot of my pension invested in india a market that has done really well this year i m not ready yet to take profits i invested in the country about ten years ago and i will leave things alone for the time being for my isa the japanese market looks relatively cheap and it s had a bad year baillie gifford japanese is the fund i have my eye on i also like asi global smaller companies i ve recently invested in ninety one global environment as i really like the long term investment trend of decarbonisation as you can see i invest for the long term and take quite a bit of risk but i tend to stick to funds rather than shares as they are more my area of expertise i did buy some shares in sainsbury s and tesco during the pandemic as i thought they would be winners but i sold them to help pay for my kitchen we re value hotspot of the world brian dennehy fundexpert the uk remains the value hotspot of the world cash rich global investors will continue to make bids for cheap uk businesses next year in this environment i am happy to buy investment fund johcm uk equity income it has delivered a return of 21 per cent over the past year and is chock full of great value stocks the likes of aviva barclays legal general and tesco dividend increases should see the fund deliver investors an income of around five per cent next year cassie dennehy s canny canine brian dennehy fundexpert but my clever dog is sniffing around japan cassie dennehy s canny canine my dog cassie is an unusually clever companion so every year i like to pick a fund inspired by her part border collie part boxer for most of the time she longs to roam the cumbrian hills but for a bit of fun i engage her collie brain for some shepherding of shares japan might appeal i thought if i sound her out with a call japan and a toot on the dog whistle their smaller companies are cheap and the japanese love dogs good choice judging by her happily wagging tail japanese smaller companies are undervalued and overlooked normally shares in such businesses stand at a 25 per cent discount to their larger listed counterparts but that discount is now 45 per cent the largest in more than 20 years no one is paying attention to this opportunity apart from cassie three quarters of smaller companies in japan are covered by no more than one analyst by contrast in the us 73 per cent of smaller companies are covered by three or more analysts i sniff an opportunity buy m g japan smaller companies

doubt the pandemic pushed the hospitality industry to the brink untold numbers of businesses were forced to close their doors and furlough staff while others were limited to just providing a takeaway service but now the darkest days of biggest public health crisis in living memory are behind us and restrictions have been lifted we can all enjoy eating out again and there can be no doubt that the foodies in leicestershire are almost spoiled for choice but sometimes it can be hard to decide where to go and while it s often fun to somewhere new that you ve never been before venturing into a untested eatery can also carry its risks as you don t necessarily know what you re going to get read more tim hortons coffee chain announces first drive thru leicestershire restaurant so with that in mind we ve delved through all the food reviews we carried out in 2021 to compile the list below which is our pick of places to try here s the rundown jb kitchen thurcaston image becky jones jb kitchen which has just opened its first restaurant in birstall was set up in april 2020 by professional chef jordan brady who had been furloughed from his role as executive chef at a local company the business aimed to provide restaurant quality food made using local seasonal ingredients delivered to people s doors we decided to try the sunday roast which was a finish at home roast dinner the sunday menu included a choice of fennel roasted english pork loin 12 belvoir castle lamb shoulder 13 30 day dry aged sirloin of beef 12 vegetable nut roast with apricot and goats cheese 12 and trio of meats 16 they all came with roast potatoes tri coloured carrots thurcaston honey roasted parsnips savoy cabbage leeks peas sausage stuffing gravy and a proper yorkie children s dinners were available for 6 and seniors dinners for 7 50 we ordered one lamb one beef and two children s pork roast dinners and treated ourselves to a couple of desserts to share those being a salted caramel and pecan brownie and a sticky toffee pudding there were two large brown bags containing various dishes of food plus cooking instructions individually tailored according to what you ve ordered first into the oven were the roast potatoes for 20 mins then the veg and stuffing followed by the lamb and pork and then the beef the gravy needed to be heated in the microwave or saucepan and the yorkies warmed in the oven the instructions were all easy to follow and the meal was on our table by 1pm there was certainly a good amount of food and it all looked and smelled very good the meats were all tender and flavoursome with the beautiful melt in the mouth lamb being our favourite we enjoyed the stuffing which was a bit different to the norm being a sausage stuffing and served in a slice the large yorkshire puddings looked impressive and they tasted good too with a sprinkling of sage on top with crispy exteriors and fluffy centres the roast potatoes were superb and the flavour was enhanced by garlic and rosemary we were impressed by the vegetable selection which comprised fresh tasting tri coloured carrots parsnips with a lovely sweetness from the thurcaston honey in which they had been cooked plus savoy cabbage peas and leeks the mild onion flavour of the leeks being a welcome addition and one you don t get that often on a roast dinner the homemade gravy was rich and flavoursome and as with the rest of the components we had plenty of it desserts were seriously good with a light moist sponge covered in rich toffee sauce the sticky toffee pudding was a hit with all of us but especially my eldest son who polished off most of it featuring pecan pieces and thick salted caramel sauce the chocolate brownie looked impressive and it tasted superb with a perfectly fudgy texture the surprise addition of a few brownie chunks and a rich chocolate flavour we said this was an excellent meal which i cannot fault you can taste the quality of the ingredients and the flavour and texture of the food was wonderful from the crispy garlic and rosemary potatoes to the fudgy rich chocolate brownie yes you have to warm up the meal yourself but it really is simple to do and as mentioned above the fact that is comes chilled means you can enjoy a jb kitchen roast wherever you are in leicestershire the price of our meal came to 45 which given the amount of food and the superb quality i think offered good value for money read the full review here peppervine tapas stoney stanton image becky jones peppervine offers an array of mediterranean tapas with influences including spanish greek and italian we thought the menu which you can find on the facebook page sounded good plus we reckoned a taste of the mediterranean was just what we needed on a dark january evening peppervine recommends three dishes per person but as we were ordering for two adults and two children we felt that nine dishes would be about right for our collective appetites there s 17 options on the main tapas section of the menu alone so you re sure to find something to suit we went for spanish tapas favourites of patatas bravas 4 albondigas 5 and spanish tortilla 3 50 as well as king prawns in parsley lemon and garlic butter 5 50 we also decided to try the truffle mushroom arancini 4 50 honey chilli chicken wings 5 halloumi and prosciutto 5 and a greek salad 4 i couldn t resist adding on the seafood linguine 7 from the specials menu as this is one of my favourite dishes i ordered over the phone and paid online in the afternoon and requested a delivery at about 5 30pm happily it arrived at about 5 25pm so it was on the table by half past and looked like a very tasty tea the king prawns were a big hit with all of us especially myself and my eldest son the meaty rich tasting king prawns were perfectly cooked and had a lovely flavour from the parsley lemon and garlic butter with just the right level of heat for us the generously sized albondigas meatballs were very enjoyable served in a tomato sauce and topped with parmesan the pork and beef meatballs were clearly made with good quality meat and the flavour of the dish was superb the boys reckoned the patatas bravas was delicious although they did only have a small amount of the spicy tomato sauce and aioli so i think they were judging the fried potatoes more than anything the crispy potatoes certainly were good but they were even better with a generous topping of sauce and aioli containing caramelised onion and potato the delightfully thick wedge of spanish tortilla was tasty with a rather more delicate flavour that most of the dishes we picked the honey chilli chicken wings were marinated in a sriracha spice and glazed in honey which gave them a moreish sweet and spicy taste and although there may not be much meat on a wing there were 10 wings included in the portion which was plenty i suspected the halloumi and prosciutto dish would go down a storm with my boys and i was right it was quite a simple dish with pieces of halloumi wrapped in crispy prosciutto but it really did taste very good the arancini risotto balls were excellent with a rich creamy filling a gooey mozzarella centre and a golden crispy exterior the seafood linguine tasted delicious and featured an impressive amount of seafood including more of those delicious king prawns mussels which i love squid which i don t but i just avoided those bits and pieces of salmon the greek salad was a fresh tasting and colourful addition to the meal and included olives feta red onion tomatoes cucumber and rocket leaves we said this was a superb meal made up of lots of different dishes full of fresh ingredients and delicious flavours it really did give us a taste of the mediterranean and brighten up a dark january evening we spent a total of 43 50 which i initially thought sounded quite a lot however this worked out as less than 11 for each of us and for such a tasty meal i reckon that is pretty good value read the full review here pomelo and rocket scraptoft image becky jones launched by miranda booth formerly one half of vegan pop up the mystery booth pomelo and rocket started as a cafe at the mill in leicester s frog island in 2019 it remained there serving up an array of plant based meals until the start of the pandemic in 2020 then it shifted to delivering plant based finish at home meals across the county each friday and saturday with a weekly changing menu giving diners the chance to experience food from around the world with a peruvian night on the agenda i quickly booked my spot a completely new menu which had seen miranda take traditional dishes and make them plant based it featured a starter of avocado mango plantain and cucumber ceviche a main course of andean pork and broad bean stew with quinoa and cumin rice this was served with a side dish of heart of palm olive and spinach salad dessert was sweet potato yes really doughnuts with spiced syrup you can have one course for 9 two courses for 12 or three courses for 16 50 delivery charges depend on your location i wanted to get the full peruvian experience so ordered three courses for both myself and my husband deliveries are made between 5 30pm and 7 30pm and our food arrived at 5 30pm which was ideal for us having followed the simple instructions our meal was ready in about 10 minutes the ceviche a vegan version of the traditional seafood dish was colourful fresh and zingy with juicy pieces of mango avocado and plantain together with cucumber onion and a sprinkle of coriander there was also some fresh chilli which provided a subtle heat i thought the hearty andean stew was wonderful my tastebuds immediately detected some chipotle which lent a delicious smoky spicy taste to the dish the texture was nice and thick with lots of beans and chunks of potato as well as the pork made from meat free sausages combined with a blend of spices i thoroughly enjoyed the combination of cumin rice and quinoa with which the stew was served and the fresh salad made up of spinach and lettuce leaves tomatoes olives and heart of palm made a light refreshing accompaniment the sweet potato doughnuts were an excellent end to a delicious meal the only draw back we found was that there was five doughnuts so you can either argue over the last one or as we did cut it in half we said this was a superb meal which looked good and tasted incredible and gave me the opportunity to try foods that i d not had before i felt that the price at 16 50 for three courses was very reasonable if you re unsure whether you d like vegan food just give pomelo and rocket a try and i m sure you ll be convinced flippin pancakes leicester image becky jones flippin pancakes was started in october 2019 by sister and brother duo ruby ghag and sab sangha according to ruby they had developed a love of american pancakes during family holidays in the states and were disappointed that they couldn t find anything that came close in leicester so they started to make their own they decided to launch a delivery service via their instagram page where people could find the menu and then send a message with their order details and since the service began over a year ago it has proved popular we decided to give the pancakes a try one saturday morning and ordered a five stack totally biscoff 6 50 plus a three stack eton mess 5 and a three stack totally bananas 5 to share between the four of us they arrived as arranged at 9 30am on saturday morning in white card boxes which had been kept in an insulated bag so they were still warm when we received them the pancakes themselves were beautifully light fluffy and tasty the totally biscoff stack was the favourite of myself and my eldest son thanks to lashings of biscoff spread crumbled biscoff biscuits plus a whole biscuit on top and chocolate sauce the eton mess was my husband s top pick and featured lots of strawberry jam whipped cream meringue pieces as well as a whole mini meringue on top and slices of strawberry it was a very good combination and made me wonder why i d never tried putting jam on a pancake before my youngest son who s a fan of anything which involves chocolate enjoyed the totally bananas pancakes there was plenty of chocolate sauce and chunks of fresh banana plus caramelised banana on top all pancakes come with a pot of maple syrup and although i did try a bit with the banana and chocolate stack i don t think these pancakes really needed it as they ve already got plenty of flavour we said what a weekend treat we were really impressed by the look and taste of the flippin pancakes and being large american style pancakes they are also filling so you feel like you are getting your money s worth the service was excellent from the quick response to our initial message to the reminder the night before delivery and the pancakes arriving exactly on time read the full review here the pickled mushroom market bosworth image becky jones now based in leicester the pickled mushroom was started by chef phil collard in september 2020 according to phil he was keen to take the techniques he d learned working in kitchens across the world from leicestershire to new york many of which were at michelin starred restaurants and apply them to simple food sold at a price that s fair to the customer lured by the yorkshire pudding waffles we were keen to try the sunday roast priced at 10 for adults 6 for children all meals were available for collection only so having placed by order via facebook i headed over at my collection time of 12pm and picked up a brown bag full of delicious smelling food overall there was a good amount of food but i did notice that there was only a very small amount of the creamed potato which we later discovered was really tasty so we would definitely have liked more of it we enjoyed all three of the meats the boys were impressed with their chicken which was nice and moist and had a lovely flavour from the honey and thyme with which it had been roasted the pork belly was beautifully succulent and the crackling was just the right level of crispiness so there was no danger of any tooth breaking served pink the beef was flavoursome having been roasted with garlic and rosemary although it was slightly chewy in places the thyme and garlic roast potatoes tasted delicious as did the honey and thyme roasted carrots orange and purple varieties and parsnips the sausage sage and onion stuffing was tasty as was the rich stock gravy the green beans added colour to the plate and retained a nice bit of bite as for the yorkshire pudding waffle it was a definite hit it tasted much the same as a traditional yorkshire pudding with a good blend of crispiness and chewiness but it also had an added quirky fun factor the desserts were excellent the banoffee pie was rich and creamy with fresh banana pieces and thick toffee sauce topped with cream and chocolate sauce in a buttery crisp pastry case and the brownie wow that was definitely one of the best brownies i ve eaten and i ve bought and made a lot of them the texture was perfectly fudgy dotted with pieces of milk and white chocolate and topped with marshmallows it was finished with cream and a sprinkle of biscuit crumbs we said this was a delicious and slightly different sunday lunch the quirky yorkshire pudding waffles were certainly popular with all of us in fact the whole meal was from the main courses to the puddings i think the meal offered good value for money given the quality of the food and the portion sizes although an extra spoonful of creamed potato would have been welcomed and the service was prompt and friendly read the full review here tree house cafe south wigston image becky jones following the relaxation of lockdown restrictions in april many of us enjoyed a spot of al fresco dining from beer gardens to courtyards there were some lovely outdoor spots but one which caught my eye was the zen pen at the tree house cafe in south wigston the cafe is in the centre of south wigston and from the front you probably wouldn t guess there was a lovely outdoor area at the rear it s a fairly small area with seven tables but it s been beautifully styled with lots of plants dotted around some in pots on the floor some hanging from the walls and some entwined around the wooden beams alongside the festoon lighting there s a really good selection on the breakfast menu with savoury and sweet options choices include a big breakfast 8 50 small breakfast 6 50 vegan breakfast 6 50 eggs benedict 6 50 eggs florentine 5 50 and eggs new york 6 75 smoked salmon and avocado 6 00 plus a breakfast duo comprising two slices of sourdough toast one topped with balsamic chopped tomatoes and one topped with smashed avocado 5 00 for those wanting something sweet there s american style pancakes topped with maple and bacon maple blueberries and pecans or nutella strawberries and cream 6 00 each or cinnamon french toast with maple syrup and fresh fruit i wanted to try the traditional breakfast and decided that the small version would be enough to satisfy my appetite simon fancied something different and was torn between the eggs florentine and the vegan breakfast eventually deciding on the latter there was a generous amount of food and it tasted excellent my breakfast included a tasty good quality sausage a rasher of thick slightly crispy bacon and a very good hash brown which was just as it should be nice and crisp on the outside fluffy on the inside the beans and tomato halves which were well seasoned were good as were the buttery mushroom slices the fried egg was spot on the yolk being lovely and runny as i cut into it and i enjoyed the toast made from fresh bread rather than a sliced loaf simon was really impressed by his vegan breakfast which included some similar items to the traditional breakfast those being tomato halves mushroom slices toast and hash browns it also included two vegan sausages which were very tasty i tried them just to be sure ripe fresh slices of avocado and some really good chilli beans which had a nice little kick of heat from the chilli and a sprinkling of coriander leaves we said i m very glad we discovered the tree house cafe its zen pen is beautifully styled and has a lovely atmosphere which makes you feel like you could be miles away from wigston perhaps even on holiday somewhere exotic when the sun is shining the staff were friendly and efficient the food was excellent and we felt the prices represented very good value for money it all added up to a faultless breakfast experience read the full review here sonrisa leicester image becky jones in the grade ii listed building formerly occupied by deli delilah fine foods sonrisa gives diners the chance to be transported to buenos aires for an evening of argentinian food and drink there s a relaxed atmosphere about the place and with the argentinian vibe enhanced by the music playing in the background i felt like we could have been away on holiday especially as the sun made an appearance on the evening of our visit sonrisa has a comprehensive drinks menu including cocktails beers ciders and wines many of which are from argentina as well as elsewhere in south america the menu comprises a whole host of small plates plus a few larger dishes such as a ribeye steak sirloin on the bone to share a fillet tail steak and sea bass for two there were a lot of dishes that we thought we d like to try but after seeking the advice of our waitress we whittled it down to 12 dishes to share between us we were recommended to go for three to four dishes each depending on how hungry we were and thinking about our combined appetite felt this would be enough the dishes come out as and when they are ready as is the buenos aires way so we started with the big juicy gordal olives 3 50 which were soon joined by the red pepper empanada 3 95 though not the crescent shape i was expecting the empanada comprised lovely crisp pastry filled with a soft flavoursome mixture of potato roasted peppers and herbs and served with a delicious apricot chimichurri which offered a nice level of heat and a sweetness from the fruit the wild prawns 6 50 were up next and proved popular the dish included lovely plump prawns which had a wonderful flavour from the combination of garlic red chilli and parsley served on toasted galician bread the remaining dishes then arrived in quick succession and soon filled up our table the rich succulent duroc pork belly 5 95 was mouth wateringly good and the accompanying potato terrine was not only delicious but was visually appealing with its neat layers bursts of beautiful flavours and colours were added to the dish courtesy of the apricot chimichurri garlic aioli and vibrant pink pickled shallots the excellent buttery potato terrine also appeared with our marucha flat iron steak we opted for the smaller size 150g 9 50 but it was bigger than we expected so there was plenty to share i think i actually had more than my fair share though as this was a stunning dish certainly in my top three of the night having been asked by the waitress how we d like it cooked i said we d go with how the chef recommends it which she advised was medium rare it was a wise decision as it tasted superb being so juicy and tender it was complemented by the other components on the plate tangy pickled shallots aioli and picante chimichurri the chicken arroz 6 50 offered an enjoyable combination of tender pieces of grilled chicken and a flavoursome bomba rice dotted with peppers and mixture of herbs while the tasty grilled lamb cutlet 11 25 worked well with its accompaniments of a lovely fresh mint chimichurri and a rich hearty butter bean ribollita the spiced prawn spaghetti 7 95 with more lovely plump prawns was a particular hit with myself and my eldest son with both of us really enjoying the kick of chilli from the arrabiata sauce and chimichurri butter broccoli with garlic and red chilli 4 50 is an accompaniment i often choose when dining out and this was an excellent version with lots of fiery chilli as well as garlic and parsley butter the grilled sweetheart cabbage 3 50 was a dish that hubby was keen to try and despite my initial reservation it was very good thanks to the flavours brought to the dish by the chimichurri butter and romesco sauce the boys really liked the garlic and parsley fries 2 95 which were nice and crisp and had plenty of flavour and our other potato dish the potato fry 3 50 amused them as it looked like a jenga tower made of potato it also tasted great with the indulgent fried potato chunks being topped with black pepper parmesan and truffle oil nicely full but with a bit of room for something sweet we turned our attention to the dessert or postres section of the menu the muscavado pudding 5 50 immediately appealed to my sweet toothed sons and i was intrigued by the orange polenta cake 6 50 other desserts available include cereal panna cotta chocolate fondant and affogato the boys quickly ate up the majority of the muscovado pudding which is described as sticky toffee sonrisa style and seemed to be a bit less sticky than other toffee puddings we ve tried the hearty dish with its warming flavours rich toffee sauce and creamy vanilla ice cream was very much enjoyed the prize for number one dessert though has to go to the orange polenta cake i loved the slightly crumbly texture of the polenta cake and its sweet flavour enhanced by the zingy orange curd orange segments and the beautiful blood orange sorbet we said this was a wonderful meal clearly a lot of consideration has gone into the creation of the dishes from the big bold flavours to the excellent presentation the staff were very efficient friendly and extremely knowledgeable when questioned about items on the menu and asked for advice about the food and drink options available importantly those recommendations turned out to be very good the restaurant itself is a beautiful relaxing place to spend time my only reservation is the price food for the four of us came to 81 55 which i acknowledge is a lot to spend on a family meal however when you consider the cost of each dish and the obvious quality of the food i do think that the prices are fair and when the dining experience is faultless it really doesn t deserve anything less than full marks read the full review here mortons bistro gilmorton image becky jones formerly the red lion pub mortons initially opened at the start of october 2020 before having to close due to the lockdown which started a few weeks later it then opened to offer outdoor dining in april before welcoming customers indoors from monday may 17 it focuses on the daytime trade and is open from 9am for breakfast brunch running through to lunch and early evening meals options on the breakfast menu include a freshly baked croissant with salted butter and berry jam toasted banana bread with fresh berries and mascarpone and a buttermilk pancake stack with either fresh berries maple syrup and natural yoghurt or nutella sliced banana and hazelnuts there are two varieties of homemade granola porridge with baked peach amaretto biscuit and caramel sauce and a smoothie bowl available other dishes include smashed avocado on toasted sourdough to which you can add a poached egg scottish smoked salmon or smoked streaky bacon and shakshuka with or without chorizo for those yearning for a full english the mortons grill includes all the usual suspects and is available in both a mini version and a veggie version i plumped for the standard size mortons grill 12 whilst simon chose the pancakes with berries 6 50 both the grill and the pancakes looked beautifully presented and we had a feeling we were going to enjoy our breakfasts we weren t wrong the two fried eggs on my breakfast were nicely seasoned and cooked just to my liking the rich golden yolk oozing out as i cut into them the joseph morris pork sausages were a delight clearly having a high meat content and containing a good dose of black pepper the smoked bacon rashers though streaky had a good amount of meat on them and i enjoyed the buttery portobello mushroom and the sweet tasting confit tomato the potato and sage rosti was like no other rosti i ve tried before in a good way this was partly due to its triangular shape which added visual interest to the dish and partly due to the texture which was more crunchy than most i really enjoyed the texture and the taste which was rich and buttery with an earthiness from the sage the baked beans were certainly picante as described and for me this was a welcome addition to the dish and a nice change from the usual spice free baked beans the toast made from sourdough bread was excellent the final element of the dish was the black pudding and i surprised myself by actually quite enjoying it usually this is the one part of a full english that i just cannot abide but mortons version almost won me over i think this was largely due to the texture which was more the consistency of stuffing rather than the rigid slices that you often get on a breakfast simon was equally happy with his pancakes of which there were four they were light and fluffy in texture and had a lovely taste especially when combined with the fresh berries which included strawberries raspberries blueberries and blackberries maple syrup and natural yoghurt if i m not mistaken there was also the surprise addition of sweetened mascarpone on the plate which though wasn t on the description really added to the flavour we said we thoroughly enjoyed our visit to mortons the terrace is a lovely place to sit and relax and enjoy food and drink with friends or your other half the food we tried was excellent and the service we experienced was prompt and friendly when it comes to the price 12 for a full english is at the upper end of what you would pay locally but it is also at the upper end in terms of quality the fact that the black pudding was so good that it almost converted me says it all read the full review here mmacaron ashby image becky jones mmacaron was launched by former leading aerospace engineer mark mcintosh who previously worked for rolls royce for 19 years before deciding to follow his dream and open a patisserie café with freshly baked menu items from croissants to fraisiers and of course macarons i didn t need much tempting to head over to the market town and give the new eatery a try you can pop in and enjoy any of the exquisite looking cakes in the counter along with a cup of tea or coffee or if you re keen to try a wide selection of mmacaron goodies you could treat yourself to a sharing platter there s a breakfast platter or an afternoon tea and the latter 35 for two people is what myself and my mum decided to try the description on the menu is rather mysterious simply saying it includes a feast of pastries and cakes to indulge the tastebuds along with tea or coffee as you ll notice there s so sandwiches mentioned which i must admit initially made me feel slightly concerned after all how can you have afternoon tea without sandwiches even though the cakes probably are the best bit my worries were soon alleviated when we arrived at the cafe and owner mark described the array of food which would be included in our afternoon tea including savoury filled croissants and cheese scones i was pleased to hear there would be a savoury element involved and as mark explained he and emily chose to offer these baked goods rather than sandwiches as they didn t want to divert their attention away from the main product and lose focus which makes perfect sense the afternoon tea arrived on a circular platter and looked wonderful my eye was caught by the particularly elegant looking chocolate creations the opera cake and the bouche which had a very impressive mirror glaze we began with the croissant half of which was filled with smoked salmon lemon dill and cream cheese whilst the other half was filled with the same minus the smoked salmon as mum isn t a fan it isn t something i would usually order either but i was keen to try the croissant as it is intended to be eaten and was pleasantly surprised i found that when combined with the cream cheese the smoked salmon worked well and didn t have the slimy texture that generally puts me off baked earlier that morning the croissant itself was wonderfully fresh and light with a lovely buttery taste the other savoury element the cheese scone was equally delightful the scones were large but light in texture and contained a generous amount of red leicester cheese it was served with a balsamic onion chutney which was very tasty but to be honest i preferred eating it with just a sliver of butter so that i could enjoy the flavour of the scone itself the pretty fruit tart had an evenly baked sweet pastry base filled with a lovely thick vanilla flavoured creme patisserie and topped with fresh fruit including strawberries raspberries and blueberries i was very excited to try the opera cake and it without a doubt exceeded my expectations comprising layers of almond sponge soaked in coffee syrup coffee buttercream and chocolate ganache topped with a chocolate glaze and edible gold leaf this was a stunning combination of flavours and textures and was a gift for someone who loves coffee and chocolate as much as i do we followed this with the bucknall bouche named after pastry chef emily who created it again it offered an excellent combination of tastes and textures with a crisp praline base topped with a light chocolate mousse which gave way to a rich centre of caramel and dates this was one deliciously decadent dessert the chocolate mirror glaze finished with edible gold leaf was also impressive particularly as it had been applied to a mousse which is surely no easy feat the afternoon tea also included four macarons how could it not given the cafés name unfortunately we were just too full to manage them there and then so i had them boxed up to take home my chocolate mad son managed to devour the dark chocolate one before i got a look in he assured me it was delicious the other three the white chocolate and raspberry pistachio and lemon were light and slightly chewy and tasted superb i can see why mmacaron is selling hundreds a day already we said what a wonderful experience this was if you live in or near ashby then you re very lucky to have this place on your doorstep the food was superb the place is delightful and the staff were attentive and knowledgeable it was lovely to see mark enthusiastically chatting to all his customers and i enjoyed speaking to him about his vision despite my initial concern about the lack of sandwiches the filled croissant and cheese scone were an ideal in fact preferable replacement as for the sweet treats quite simply wow given the quality of the food together with the service and the surroundings i think the price is very fair read the full review here jaga market harborough image becky jones beats and brunch was launched on july 17 by new market harborough organic cafe jaga which first opened in april this year it s available on saturdays from 9am until 12pm and booking is advised diners can enjoy house music eclectic soul and jazz and lounge beats while eating their morning meal with a rare football free saturday morning i decided to book myself and my boys in for a weekend treat with a difference customers are able to enjoy a range of freshly prepared organic food made from scratch by the chef using what is described as the finest organic ingredients there s small plates including smashed avocado lime chilli and poached egg on sourdough toast lincolnshire sausage on brioche bun or sourdough and pancakes with berry compote and cream big plates include the jaga full english jaga big veggie and jaga big vegan as well as a steak sandwich and three burgers including a vegan burger handmade from scratch by the chef i was tempted by both the full english and the big veggie as was my hubby so we decided to order one of each 12 each with the promise to share them between us my youngest son was happy to try the organic brunch 6 from the kids menu and my eldest who doesn t eat meat opted for the pancakes with berry compote and cream 6 50 the drink selection at jaga is as big as the food selection there s organic smoothies and juices organic teas as well as hot chocolates and coffees including adaptogen coffee or hot chocolate i opted for the collagen matcha frappe although it did cost 5 not only did it sound interesting the benefits of matcha are said to include boosting energy and concentration and boosting your immune system and the benefits of collagen are said to include helping to plump the appearance and elasticity of your skin and aiding better sleep all of which sounded pretty positive to me my eldest was pleased with the look and taste of his pancakes which were large light and fluffy and topped with a mixture of berries including raspberries strawberries blackberries and blackcurrants along with a generous dollop of cream and a sprinkling of icing sugar my youngest happily tucked into his brunch and particularly enjoyed the fried egg and the homemade sausage patty which was also a highlight for me it made a nice change from the standard sausages you usually get and had a welcome hint of spiciness to it along with the sausage patty the full english also included rashers of smoked bacon which were nice and crispy how i like them a tomato half and chunks of mushrooms and some lovely crispy jaga potatoes which had a definite flavour of rosemary which i enjoyed simon and i both liked the smokiness of the boston baked beans and i appreciated the fact they were served in a ramekin so their juices didn t spread out across the plate the sourdough toast which i think had been topped with olive oil rather than butter was delicious as was the fried egg with its lovely runny yolk the full english also included black pudding and although i m not a big fan of this product i did give it a go and thought the slightly crumbly texture meant it was one of the better examples i ve tried the big veggie was a big hit with both myself and my husband there was chunky slices of delicious halloumi and well seasoned wilted spinach along with two fried eggs which again were cooked just right for my taste with runny yolks as with the meaty breakfast there were mushrooms a tomato half boston baked beans and lovely crisp sourdough toast something i didn t notice straight away was that although the menu said this dish included avocado we didn t have any i do like avocado a lot so i was a bit miffed when i realised but the mixture of roasted butternut squash and red onions which i presume was a temporary replacement was enjoyable we said what a great start to the weekend this was the food was very good with the quality of the produce being obvious and i enjoyed my first collagen matcha frappe i think the prices of the meals are fair given the amount and quality of the food especially as it is all organic produce many of the drinks are slightly higher priced than the norm but this is understandable due to the nutritional supplements that are added the staff did a great job of making us feel welcome and providing a prompt service and the bright contemporary surroundings made it an enjoyable place to spend time this is definitely enhanced by the upbeat live music from the dj which cannot fail to lift your mood read the full review here mithaas leiceste image becky jones this family run restaurant underwent a big refurbishment so we paid a visit to check out the new look and the food particularly the 6 99 thali this meal includes your choice of two curries from the daily selection along with with dal rice roti pakora pickle poppadum and a sweet dish the curries of the day are in the deli counter at the front of the shop so you can take a look and see which ones you fancy trying the choices on the evening of our visit were aloo gobi chana masala veg methi tawa fry mutter paneer and a special aubergine and potato curry the two dishes that stood out to me were the mutter paneer and the aloo gobi so i ordered those whilst simon decided to try the veg methi tawa fry and the aubergine and potato curry given the price tag we were surprised with the amount of food we received and as we soon discovered it was good quality food too there was a tasty onion pakora three soft roti and a portion of light fluffy rice together with a pot of dal although i only had a small amount of this as it was too salty for my taste i was pleased with my choice of curries which each tasted very good in their own right and also formed a good contrast as part of the meal the mutter paneer with peas and plentiful chunks of lovely paneer was mild and creamy whilst the aloo gobi potato and cauliflower had a drier texture with a spicier taste simon s two curries the mild vegetable curry and the spicy aubergine and potato curry also worked well together and he reckoned the latter was his favourite part of the entire meal served in a basket we also had a poppadum each plus a particularly spicy pickle the poppadums were very good being light and crisp in texture with no hint of grease the final part of the meal was a coconut jamun which i thought was wonderful i guess it s no surprise when mithaas is so well known for its sweets we said this was a very good meal containing a generous amount of food which was full of flavour for less than 7 i think the thali is a cracking deal especially when you can enjoy this in the evening as well as at lunchtimes even including the drinks we spent less than 10 a head the service on a busy evening was friendly and efficient and the simple surroundings were pleasant six hills cafe thrussington image becky jones a roadside cafe on the a46 may not seem the obvious place to enjoy some authentic italian cuisine but for the past nine years six hills cafe has been impressing customers with its food from pizzas to patisserie i visited the cafe a couple of years ago and thoroughly enjoyed a pizza night there so with six hills now offering a monthly sicilian sunday lunch i was keen to pay a return visit and give it a try the idea is that diners can enjoy sharing a tasting menu at 35 per person that is plentiful and traditional using carmelo s family recipes and sicilian products such as peppers and aubergines sheep ricotta and pistachios which have a protected designation of origin from bronte a little village on mount etna you can take a look at the menu online before you book so you know exactly what you re going to get you can also take your pick between two sittings at 12 30pm and 3pm and we chose the earlier one a basket of homemade bread appeared on our table and got the meal off to a good start the bread which is made with 100 per cent sicilian durum wheat had a lovely soft centre and a crunchy crust and i enjoyed dipping it into some extra virgin olive oil bottles of which can be found on each of the tables an impressive looking starter selection soon followed this was made up of a pammiciana di mulinciani aubergines parmigiana i pipi ammuddicati peppers capers and breadcrumbs i rocculi affucati broccoli in red wine cavuluciuri n pastedda cauliflower in batter and a nsalata d aranci orange and onion salad both myself and my mum really enjoyed the hearty oven baked aubergine parmigiana which comprised layers of potato egg and aubergine in passata and i was particularly taken by the pepper dish with slices of roasted sweet peppers mixed with breadcrumbs salty capers garlic and a glug of lovely olive oil broccoli and cauliflower those sunday lunch favourites made an appearance but cooked very differently to how they would be for an english roast dinner here we had broccoli cooked or rather drowned according to the name of the dish in a rich red wine and battered florets of cauliflower the latter being our favourite of the two i don t think i ve had orange and onion in the same mouthful before but the orange and onion salad which also included sultanas offered a refreshing contrast to the heavier dishes the starter selection was followed by a pasta dish of beef cannelloni which was my favourite part of the meal the pasta was beautifully cooked retaining a bit of bite the slow cooked chunks of beef were wonderfully succulent and the ragu made using carmelo s grandmother s recipe had a lovely flavour perhaps partly due to the dash of brandy i later discovered it contained acording to the chef this was historically used to keep the meat fresh before refrigerators were invented we then had a main course of i cutuletti di pollo chicken paillard marinated in vinegar and breadcrumbs after being marinated in white wine vinegar for 24 hours the chicken had been coated in breadcrumbs parsley garlic and pecorino cheese which gave it a delicious flavour the accompanying salad was lovely and fresh made up of lettuce leaves cucumber tomato and red onion dressed with olive oil and oregano dessert was a nguantera an array of miniature desserts this included cannoncini crisp buttery puff pastry horns filled with a pistachio cream cannoli tubes of fried pastry dough filled with sweet ricotta and rum baba little cakes soaked in rum syrup and topped with cream and a piece of strawberry we also had a surprise addition of homemade sicilian ice cream in vanilla and pistachio varieties although we weren t quite quick enough to eat it all before it melted due to a lack of additives we were told the bit we tried was good especially the vanilla we thought i really enjoyed the moist rum soaked rum baba and mum was impressed by the cannoncini but by this point we were too full to eat any more it wasn t a problem though as we were able to get the remaining desserts boxed up to take home a couple of hours later i enjoyed the sweet ricotta filled cannoli and my boys polished off the rest we said this was a lovely way to spend a few hours on a sunday and involved some delicious food of which there was certainly a lot as much as i love a roast dinner this sicilian feast made a nice change the owners and the other member of staff were all very friendly and efficient and it was nice that the chef came out and spoke to all of his customers though you can t fully forget the cars zooming by along the busy a46 once you re inside this roadside cafe there is a nice relaxing environment the price is the bit i struggled with as 35 per person on food alone is rather a lot to spend although i do appreciate there was a generous amount of good quality food much of which had been sourced from sicily read the full review here the navigation inn barrow upon soar image becky jones offering customers the opportunity to gaze out across the rippling water as they enjoy a drink or meal waterside venues have a unique appeal and we re lucky to have a number of such places in leicestershire this includes the navigation inn at barrow upon soar which overlooks the grand union canal having walked by and admired the pub on a previous visit to the village i took a look at the menu and saw that it offers a three course sunday lunch for 19 well in my opinion that definitely made it worth a visit walking into the pub we received a warm welcome from a member of staff behind the bar who told us they d reserved us a table inside but as the rain was holding off we asked if we could dine al fresco which wasn t a problem we were keen to make the most of the view and the good thing is the pub has covered areas outside so we didn t need to worry even if the rain started the sunday lunch menu changes each week and diners can have one course for 13 two courses for 16 or three courses for 19 simon and i decided we would try the three course deal and that we would order two courses for the boys with a promise to share our starters we picked the fishcake and the portobello mushroom starters followed by the roast beef for me and roast lamb for simon my youngest was keen to have the honey roasted gammon and my eldest who doesn t eat meat decided he d give the vegetable sausages a whirl as the accompanying charred asparagus and spring onion mash didn t really appeal to him i asked if he could have the roast dinner accompaniments instead and the friendly waitress was happy to oblige the starters soon appeared and looked promising with colourful side salads adding to the aesthetic appeal the fishcake starter was quite a bit larger than the portabello mushroom a second mushroom would have been appreciated but both tasted excellent the mushroom was topped with spinach then stilton which appeared to have been mixed with onions and finished with breadcrumbs this was mainly eaten by myself and my hubby whilst the boys got stuck into the fishcake they really enjoyed it and i did too well the small amount i was allowed there was plenty of fresh tasting salmon mixed with dill and the coating was nice and crisp the zingy lemon mayonnaise was a pleasing accompaniment our roast dinners looked good and we noticed that the children s portions were not much smaller than the adult s the cauliflower cheese plus carrots and tenderstem broccoli arrived in separate dishes so we helped ourselves there was a good quantity of meat and the roast beef and leg of lamb were flavoursome but simon and i agreed they were also both a bit chewy the honey roast gammon on the other hand was beautifully tender as well as being deliciously sweet and was enjoyed very much by my youngest son the cauliflower cheese carrots and broccoli all retained a bit of bite which we liked and we enjoyed the parsnips which had been coated in wholegrain mustard the roast potatoes were well seasoned and were lovely and crisp on the outside and fluffy in the centre the mash was creamy and flavoursome too with a hearty sprinkling of pepper having been added which i particularly liked clearly homemade the yorkshire puddings were a pleasing blend of crispiness and chewiness although my eldest generally prefers vegetarian ie soya protein sausages rather than vegetable sausages he was full of compliments for the navigation s sausages which contained roasted vegetables with the puddings the children s portions looked pretty much the same size as the adult s portions so they were very happy especially my chocolate mad younger son who had picked the chocolate fudge cake my eldest son was very happy with his sorbets and particularly enjoyed the orange and raspberry flavours but he found the wild berry version a bit sour so we helped finished that off simon enjoyed his peach melba which contained peach slices raspberry sauce and ice cream topped with cream and almonds creamy and fruity in equal parts i really enjoyed my raspberry fizz posset i also enjoyed the cheeky shot of prosecco a pretty good way to round off a sunday dinner i reckon we said we really enjoyed our visit to the navigation inn the food was very good as was the friendly and efficient service and i appreciated the fact they were able to adapt the main meal for my son when it comes to location it s hard to beat being able to look out across the water and see the canal boats and ducks passing by as you re eating your roast definitively adds to the appeal of the pub overall at 9 50 for the children s two course meal and 19 for the adult s three course meal i think the sunday lunch here was good value for money read the full review here maison rose market bosworth image becky jones in the beautiful village of market bosworth this pink hued eatery was opened in mid august by local professional chefs leanne piper and sam matson who set out to offer what they describe as delicious globally inspired food in beautiful instagrammable surroundings you can t fail to be impressed by the look of this place from the floral displays inside and outside the venue to the sleek furniture and the stylish pink and gold colour scheme we were there for brunch and feeling hungry the cooked breakfast 10 50 with grilled back bacon pork sausages eggs any style sauteed mushrooms baked beans and grilled tomato served on a potato waffle stood out to me mum went for the avocado and eggs smashed avocado chilli and coriander poached burford brown eggs potato waffle and hollandaise sauce 8 50 to drink mum ordered a cappuccino 3 25 and i couldn t resist trying the delicious sounding spanish rose latte 4 it was served in two parts a tall glass containing the rose water rose syrup and milk topped with rose petals and a cup containing the coffee having marvelled at the pretty pink colour of the milk i mixed the two parts together and was wowed by the taste which reminded me of turkish delight which i love one thing that makes maison rose s breakfasts different to others is that they come with a potato waffle rather than toast or a muffin with a slightly crisp exterior and fluffy centre we enjoyed the waffles and i think it s always good when an eatery gives a dish its own unique twist i had two lovely thick rashers of unsmoked bacon and two lightly herbed sausages which were obviously good quality with a high meat content i d chosen poached eggs scrambled or fried are also available and the one i received was spot on with a yolk that was lovely and runny when i cut into it i was just disappointed that there was only one egg the tomato half was well seasoned the sauteed chunks of mushroom were tasty and i felt that there was just the right amount of baked beans plus they were served in a ramekin which i appreciated as this meant that the sauce didn t run across the plate mum was pleased with her smashed avocado and egg and enjoyed the kick of the chilli powder as with my breakfast the eggs were perfectly poached resulting in runny yolks there was also plenty of creamy smashed avocado and rich hollandaise sauce although she enjoyed the potato waffle there was a lot of topping so she felt the need to order a portion of toast 1 50 with which to finish it off we said we thoroughly enjoyed our visit to maison rose the dishes we tried were well presented and tasted very good with the use of high quality ingredients evident in my opinion the prices are fair taking into account the quality of the food and the environment the staff were friendly and were doing a good job given how busy it was i think perhaps taking payment from dine in customers at their tables rather than them needing to go up to the counter where takeaway customers are also queuing would help the popularity of this new venue just goes to show in my opinion that it is the ideal addition to market bosworth offering lovely food in beautiful surroundings read the full review here wok indo leicester image becky jones this family run indo chinese brand launched its new branch on september 13 and proved to be a popular spot briefly running out of ingredients due to the amount of diners on the opening day and remaining busy with customers ever since so we decided to go and see what all the fuss was about we visited at lunchtime and tried the new wok boxes which give you the opportunity to create your own meal by following a four step process there s three box sizes available and we plumped for the middle one 7 simon began with the veg hakka noodles and fancied trying the veg manchurian balls with the recommended accompaniment of manchurian sauce topped with indo chinese chips i opted for egg fried rice with chicken sweet n sour sauce and a topping of chilli paneer both boxes were generously filled and offered a great combination of flavours which obviously is partly down to the choices you make but is also due to the fact that wok indo have clearly used good quality ingredients which have been well cooked and seasoned and according to the owners everything is freshly made each morning which is good to know i really enjoyed the tender pieces of chicken coated in batter which worked well with the sweet n sauce sauce which included chunks of pepper and onion the light fluffy egg fried rice was good and the cubes of paneer had a lovely crisp exterior and a welcome hit of chilli simon enjoyed the soft veg hakka noodles which were dotted with red cabbage onion and pepper the spicy vegetable balls went down well perfectly partnered with the rich manchurian sauce and topped with tasty saucy indo chinese chips we said we thoroughly enjoyed our lunchtime trip to wok indo i think the wok box concept is an excellent one offering tasty freshly prepared food at a very reasonable price the location of the restaurant is ideal for shoppers and workers alike to pop in for a quick lunch although we didn t experience any table service from the staff we were warmly welcomed and the member of staff who took our order was friendly and efficient the surroundings are bright and modern and provide a pleasant environment to sit and enjoy a meal read the full review here cocoa by ali leicester image becky jones great british bake off star ali imdad opened his tearoom and patisserie in august it offered an enticing menu with the likes of brioche baked toast and fiery korean chicken and waffles along with drinks including a pink and blue mermaid latte and a golden rumplestiltskin latte inside the eatery there s an eye catching flower wall on the left hand side and a feather wall on the right hand side the venue feels light and spacious with a grand staircase leading to the upper floor we were seated downstairs although there are further tables upstairs where a blossom tree is a dominant feature i wanted to try the brioche baked toast and there are two varieties to choose from the first is the brioche baked toast which is also served in the birmingham branch and comes with either a chocolate hazelnut kinder bueno or biscoff sauce the second is a leicester exclusive 8 and comes with a purple ube and tiramisu sauce i decided this was the one for me simon fancied something savoury and keen to try one of the specials he opted for the beef tacos 9 when it came to drinks i was eager to sample a mermaid latte 4 50 a pink and blue raspberry latte with whipped cream and a shot of espresso whilst simon liked the sound of the candy crush 3 50 described as candyfloss and bubblegum on ice after snapping away we tried our drinks which tasted very good mine with a rich creamy texture and raspberry flavour and simon s tasting like liquid candyfloss the tacos were next to arrive and i was pleasantly surprised at their size the three warm soft tacos were well filled with a superb combination of lean tasty beef mince salsa guacamole lettuce onions plus mozzarella cheese and sour cream the tacos tasted delicious as they were but the accompanying beef broth gave them a welcome spicy kick which both of us enjoyed the baked brioche was excellent with a light soft centre and a slightly crisp exterior boasting a sweet taste with a subtle hint of cinnamon given that it is described as being filled with cream cheese i was surprised there was only a light smear of it inside the brioche which didn t really add much to the flavour in my opinion the purple ube and tiramisu sauce provided in a miniature jug for you to pour on yourself definitely added an interesting colour to the plate the accompanying vanilla gelato was a perfect partner to the warm brioche and was clearly of good quality i enjoyed the addition of the fruit including strawberry halves raspberries and blueberries we said we enjoyed our visit to cocoa by ali with its lovely pink floral surroundings in terms of both presentation and taste the food and drink we tried was very good and the menu provides many dishes that to my knowledge are not available elsewhere in the city although the young waiting staff seemed slightly nervous they provided friendly and efficient service our bill for two dishes and two drinks came to 25 which i think given the standard of the food and the surroundings is a reasonable price read the full review here st martin s coffee shop leicester image becky jones this city centre coffee shop has long been a popular place whether for a coffee and a spot of brunch or lunch during the day or for a towering burger at its alter ego crafty in the evening the food menu became even more enticing at the start of october with the launch of a full english breakfast menu and i just had to give it a try there s a full meaty breakfast comprising cumberland sausages bury black pudding unsmoked back bacon roasted tomato mushrooms hash browns a fried egg heinz beans and toast there s a full veggie which includes vegan sausages roasted tomato mushrooms hash browns fried egg heinz beans and toast and a full vegan with vegan sausages roasted tomato mushrooms hash browns scrambled tofu heinz beans and toast all of the breakfast are 10 each i decided to opt for the full meaty promising myself that i d come back another day to try the tasty sounding vegan version what a plateful it was there was a generous amount of food and it had been well presented when it came to the taste i was impressed straight away the hash browns were wonderfully crisp on the outside and fluffy in the centre the roasted tomato halves were well seasoned as were the chunks of mushrooms which had been given a particularly good sprinking of pepper which suited me the baked beans which were heinz were good and although they weren t served in a ramekin as they sometimes are in other establishments the bacon rashers made an efficient breakwater preventing the tomato sauce from soaking into the toast or hash browns the bacon rashers were unsmoked and thick cut and in my opinion had just the right level of crispiness the two chunky cumberland sausages had an enjoyable lightly herbed flavour and clearly had a high meat content good quality bread had been used for the toast which was nice and buttery and was topped with a fried egg which had a perfectly runny yolk when i cut into it as i ve previously mentioned in other breakfast reviews i m not a big fan of black pudding but i always like to try a dish as it s intended so i gave it a whirl it was one of the better examples i ve tried but this particular breakfast component isn t really for me we said well this was definitely a great way to start the day i thought it was an incredible breakfast which was as filling as it was delicious the black pudding was the only part i wouldn t rush to eat again but that is down to personal taste and given how much i enjoyed every other bit of the breakfast it wouldn t be fair to mark it down for that i received friendly prompt service from the team and enjoyed spending time in the lovely surroundings in my opinion 10 for a breakfast of this size and quality offers good value for money read the full review here taste restaurant leicester college leicester image becky jones hidden away on the second floor of leicester college s freemen s park campus taste restaurant came to my attention in september when it re opened following an 18 month closure due to covid it is fully catered and staffed by leicester college food and hospitality students under the supervision of industry experienced teachers the restaurant is open on wednesday thursday and friday lunchtimes offering two courses for 10 or three courses for 12 a fine dining menu is available in the evenings on wednesdays and thursdays at 20 for three courses and this is what we were there to try the choice of starters on the evening of our visit included soup of the day tomato and basil mackerel tomato and samphire salad chicken and black pudding terrine and roasted vegetable bruschetta mains were pan fried chicken pork belly lightly salted cod smoked aubergine and sous vide carrot and tofu i was drawn to the mackerel starter and the salted cod main and though i deliberated over whether to have two fish courses i decided to throw caution to the wind and go with it mum meanwhile opted for the tomato and basil soup followed by the pan fried chicken after a few mouthfuls of our bread rolls which were clearly homemade and tasted beautifully fresh our starters arrived i thought my mackerel dish looked particularly well presented and it offered a pleasing combination of ingredients the full flavoured mackerel was lovely and fresh and worked well with the crisp salty samphire of which i am a huge fan and the creamy mayonnaise dressing it was a nice surprise when i lifted up the fish to discover the tricolour tomato slices underneath which added colour and freshness to the plate mum was happy with her tomato and basil soup which she felt had an enjoyably thick texture and well balanced flavour soon after our starter plates had been cleared our equally aesthetically pleasing main courses were on the table i was impressed with the cod which had a tender moist texture and its mild flavour was enhanced by the wonderful crab and curry sauce the cauliflower puree was also up there as one of my favourite parts of the dish the crispy chunks of potato carrots green beans and broad beans which had been double podded completed the dish nicely mum was impressed by the succulent and flavoursome chicken and the buttery soft fondant potato she was less keen on the charred leek but mum isn t really a leek fan she enjoyed the other vegetables which were the same as on the cod dish our waiter cleared away our plates and the remaining bread and butter before moving the dessert cutlery into place the attention to detail displayed throughout the meal was very good he gave us the dessert menu which offered a five strong selection my attention was grabbed by the first item which was a tropical entremet the taste signature dessert created by young pastry chef of the year 2021 as judged by the chef s forum competition in june unaissa hussein i ordered this and mum ordered the white and dark chocolate mille feuille however a few minutes later faisal returned to tell me the unfortunate news that the award winning pud had all gone it was no surprise really that it was the one that most people had picked i quickly considered the remaining sweet dishes a lemon posset sticky toffee pudding and fruit platter and went for the former as with the previous two courses the desserts swiftly arrived are were well presented i particularly liked the lines of chocolate created on mum s plate beneath the mille feuille my dessert was served in a glass with a layer of creamy lemon posset at the bottom topped by raspberry couli with a lovely vanilla shortbread and a strawberry on top it was tasty although as i was eating it i realised it was devoid of two of the elements mentioned on the menu the italian meringue and mint compote i mentioned it to the waiter who having asked the kitchen team told me they didn t have any meringue or mint it was a shame for the dish to be missing those parts but i still enjoyed it and mum was happy with her decadent pastry and chocolate treat we said this was an enjoyable dining experience in a venue that many people probably don t even know exists though it is hidden away at the heart of a college the restaurant is an elegant venue with a lovely atmosphere we received efficient service and the food was well presented and tasted excellent at 20 for three courses i think it offers very good value for money and i would happily visit again if this is the future of hospitality we re in safe hands read the full review here istanbul bbq kitchen market bosworth image becky jones this new family run eatery was opened in market bosworth in december and being fans of turkish food we were keen to give it a try you can dine in or opt for a takeaway and we tried the latter ordering the set meal for two the istanbul special 17 50 this includes a skewer of adana lamb shish chicken shish and chicken beyti along with rice salad and warm bread having placed the order with a friendly member of staff at the counter you can also call to order in advance our food was ready in just 10 minutes which got things off to an impressive start the food was still piping hot when we got it home and everything looked very appealing it also smelled delicious the shish kebabs made up of cubes of meat were very good the chicken was moist and had a lovely mildly spiced flavour lamb is always a good test of a place as it can often be chewy and sinewy but these chunks of lamb were superb lean tender and flavoursome we really enjoyed the adana made with minced lamb which had been seasoned with herbs and spices and we appreciated the mild kick of chilli my favourite part of the meaty medley though had to be the chicken beyti made with minced chicken seasoned with garlic and parsley the meat was deliciously succulent and had a wonderful flavour with the garlic being particularly prominent the accompanying rice was very tasty having taken on the flavours of the meat under which it had been served we enjoyed the warm bread which was served with a couple of dips one a mild yoghurt based dip and the other a rather fiery chilli dip the salad which comprised cucumber carrot red onion red cabbage lettuce and cherry tomatoes was fresh tasting and colourful we couldn t resist ordering a portion of baklava to finish off our meal and this was up there as one of the best examples i ve tried we said this was a tasty treat of a takeaway that we both thoroughly enjoyed from the succulent beautifully flavoured kebabs to the rich syrupy baklava it was a very satisfying meal at 21 60 for both the set meal and dessert i think it was very good value for money one thing that s worth noting though is that it is cash only if you re a fan of turkish food or simply fancy trying something a bit different i d recommend a visit to istanbul bbq kitchen read the full review here keep up with the latest news with our email alerts directly to

boston staff absences for covid 19 tripled this month in london s hospitals and nearly 10 percent of the city s firefighters called out sick in new york about 2 700 police officers were absent earlier this week twice the number who are ill on an average day and on cape cod in massachusetts grocery worker judy snarsky says she s stretched to her limit working 50 hours a week and doing extra tasks because her supermarket has around 100 workers when it should have closer to 150 we don t have enough hands everybody is working as much as they physically and mentally can the 59 year old in mashpee said some of us have been going like a freight train the worldwide surge in coronavirus cases driven by the new omicron variant is the latest blow to hospitals police departments supermarkets and other critical operations struggling to maintain a full contingent of front line workers as the pandemic enters its third year governments have taken steps to stem the bleeding across a range of jobs considered essential for society from truckers and janitors to child care providers and train conductors but nurses and other workers worry that continued staffing woes will put the public at greater risk and increase burnout and fatigue among their ranks seattle officer mike solan who leads his city s police union said his department is down about 300 officers from its usual force of 1 350 it s difficult for our community because they re waiting for that call for help he said and then we re at risk because we don t have the proper safe numbers to have a safe working environment when we answer that call for help michelle gonzalez a nurse at new york s montefiore medical center in the bronx said she and her intensive care unit colleagues never truly had a break from covid 19 and the arrival of omicron has only reawakened her post traumatic stress prior to work i get really bad anxiety she said if i ve been off for two days i will come back in a panic because i don t know what i m walking into countries including spain and the u k have reduced the length of covid 19 quarantines to ease staffing shortages by letting people return to work sooner after testing positive or being exposed to the virus the u s did similar for health care workers only meanwhile in the u s states such as massachusetts have called in hundreds of national guard members to help fill the gaps in hospitals and nursing homes where they serve meals transport patients and do other nonclinical work in seattle mayor jenny durkan has promised to veto legislation repealing a 4 an hour hazard pay raise for grocery workers which has been in place for nearly a year in some major west coast cities including los angeles and berkeley and long beach california now is not the time to roll back the pay for these critical front line workers the democratic mayor said earlier this week unions representing health care workers gripe that far too many hospitals failed to fill staff vacancies or to retain pandemic weary staff for example there are 1 500 nursing vacancies in new york s three largest hospitals alone or about double the number at the onset of the pandemic said carl ginsberg a spokesman for the 42 000 member new york state nurses association there are not enough nurses to do the job right and so there are situations where the units have dangerous conditions where patients are in jeopardy he said in london the u k s omicron epicenter a wave of staff absences is hitting hospitals just as covid 19 admissions have doubled in three weeks the latest surge will probably persist until mid january officials said it wouldn t take much to cause a crisis said david oliver a consultant physician at a hospital in southeast england the operators of u s nursing homes which were crippled by some of the deadliest covid 19 outbreaks early in the pandemic are among those pleading for officials to do more while cases in long term care facilities have not risen sharply yet the industry is bracing for omicron with 15 percent fewer workers today than when the pandemic began said rachel reeves a spokesperson for the american health care association and the national center for assisted living an industry trade group nursing homes historically struggle to compete with other health care operators because their pay rates are effectively fixed by the government she said so providers hope president joe biden s administration can boost medicaid funding and create staff recruitment and retention programs caregivers are burned out reeves said not only have many experienced tremendous loss it has been exhausting physically and emotionally battling this virus day in and day out biden s 1 9 trillion coronavirus relief plan provides 350 billion for state and local governments to provide premium pay to essential workers states are also using other buckets of pandemic funds to bolster their workforce in west virginia gov jim justice said tuesday that his administration will use 48 million of the state s remaining cares act money on recruiting and training nurses to meet a goal of adding more than 2 000 new nurses over the next four years but it s not just health care systems warning of dire consequences and seeking more support ed bastian ceo of delta air lines was among those who have called on the biden administration to cut recommended covid 19

there are still 54 500 fewer workers on tennessee payrolls than there were prior to the pandemic mostly in the leisure and hospitality education and health services sectors according to a new report from the university of tennessee the slowdown in the labor market recovery is complicated according to larry kessler the project director for the report from the university of tennessee s boyd center for business and economic research but the bright side is that tennessee s labor market is much closer to a full recovery than most other states according to the report employment in tennessee is projected to reach pre pandemic levels by the second quarter of 2022 a full quarter ahead of the nation s projected labor market recovery the economic recovery has been incredibly strong so far and the tennessee economy seems to be on solid footing kessler said real gross domestic product has already recovered to pre pandemic levels due to a strong surge in consumer spending employment in the state has been a little slower to recover but we expect job levels to recover by the first half of 2022 gov bill lee on thursday praised tennesseans resilience for restoring unemployment levels to ones seen before the pandemic this significant milestone is a testament to our fiscally responsible approach and commitment to meaningful work while we continue strengthening our workforce tennessee families and businesses will enter the new year in a new hopeful chapter for our state s economy he said the pandemic is still causing labor shortages there are three main reasons for the slow labor market recovery after layoffs and furloughs caused by the pandemic finding jobs and hiring staff became more time consuming the pandemic accelerated the rate of retirement emerging covid 19 variants continue to bring employment uncertainties other factors potentially contributing to the slowdown include workplace safety concerns child care issues and people leaving the workforce teachers and health care professionals across the nation have been feeling the burnout of the pandemic and the job levels in tennessee show it there are 23 300 fewer workers in the education and health services sectors than there were in february 2020 according to the report schools are struggling to replace teachers who left feeling overworked fearing spreading or contracting covid 19 and not wanting to face backlash of covid 19 protocols are just a few reasons why those in the education field opted out according to the report health care workers are also feeling burned out and underpaid which may be why that job area has been slow to recover the leisure and hospitality sector is slow to recover in october there were still 36 700 fewer workers in the leisure and hospitality sector than there were in february 2020 according to the report nashville in davidson county has been hit hard given its reliance on large entertainment events some of which have yet to return to pre pandemic crowds despite the slow recovery in some job sectors others have rebounded professional and business services and trade transportation and utilities jobs have all fully recovered to prepandemic employment levels according to the report tennessee s unemployment rate has fallen dramatically since the pandemic it spiked at 15 8 percent in april 2020 but is already back down to 4 2 percent as of october 2021 the state economy has proven to be incredibly resilient and we project strong economic growth in the near term kessler said more money for tennesseans to spend while the labor market has slowed tennesseans are spending money again thanks to vaccines allowing then to venture out stimulus checks coming in and other covid 19 relief measures in place the state s real gpd has recovered to prepandemic levels and is anticipated to grow 4 2 in 2022 we saw consumer spending just surge in the first half of the year and that helps for an incredible strong economic recovery for 2021 kessler said this spending surge shocked some businesses that had to downsize or close at the beginning of the pandemic some were unable to keep enough product in stock and others weren t able to hire enough employees to meet demand these are largely temporary issues but in the interim we have seen a pretty dramatic surge in prices on a lot of goods and services and that may have prevented the economy from growing even faster in 2021 kessler said tennesseans have been putting more money in their pockets through 2021 with personal incomes growing 7 7 in 2021 this increase has come from both stimulus checks and a rise in wages and salaries but tennesseans personal income is still behind the national average in the second quarter of 2021 per capita income was roughly 53 000 in the state this was slightly below the southeast average of 54 399 and well below the national average of 62 215 about the report the report includes a deep dive into the employment recovery in tennessee and examines how the recovery differs by age race gender marital status and education as well as by industrial sectors and geographic area it also dives into the long term economic outlook for tennessee as well as the results of the 2020 census the boyd center for business and economic research has provided tennessee s governor with this report annually since 1975

the u s has the most sophisticated financial markets in the world yet its financial reporters and financial policymakers are anything but sophisticated in a recent wall street journal article dec 19 reporters jeffrey ball and karen lundegaard confused depreciation a business expense with a reduction in the price of a consumer product business owners the journalists reported could get up to 21 560 off the price of a big sport utility vehicle failing to realize that depreciation of equipment is neither a tax break nor a reduction in price the reporters went on to complain that fuel inefficient suvs received larger tax breaks than fuel efficient hybrid gas and electric cars again repeating their confusion of a business expense depreciation with a tax incentive before laughing at the wall street journal s financial sophistication or lack thereof save a hearty guffaw for your government in washington did you know that the treasury s office of tax policy and congress joint committee on taxation are filled with experts who cannot calculate the impacts that changes in tax policy have on tax revenues saving consumption and economic growth ask the experts who occupy these important policy positions what relative prices and thereby incentives change when marginal income tax rates are raised or lowered and you will draw a blank stare the economic policy of the united states is calculated on the back of an envelope with the assumption that changes in taxation do not change economic behavior the experts maintain that if tax rates rise the same amount of income is taxed more thus revenues rise if tax rates are lowered the same amount of income is taxed less thus revenues are lost it is a disgrace that these static estimates are still in use twenty years after the successful supply side revolution ushered in by president reagan a recently published cato institute policy analysis reforming the federal tax policy process by david r burton urges that dynamic estimation replace the ancient static analysis that severely handicaps the performance of our economy under present practice it is impossible for policymakers to acknowledge what helps and what hurts the economy indeed there is a bias toward higher tax rates inherent in static analysis the assumption that higher taxes do not negatively impact economic behavior permits policymakers to claim that higher taxes benefit the economy by lowering the budget deficit or public debt and reducing interest rates dynamic estimates are being held hostage by class warfare dynamic estimates would show that raising taxes on the rich impair the job opportunities and income growth of the nonrich once this is made clear soaking the rich loses its political appeal and the propagandistic basis of the redistributionist welfare state collapses the political left is too heavily invested in propaganda and redistribution to permit modern economic calculation to enter the offices of treasury s office of tax policy and congress joint tax committee consequently the u s economy hobbles along impaired by static estimation every 20 years or so the government suspends the static logic and renews the economy with a supply side tax cut thus reaping the economic benefits that static estimation denies it would make far more sense and produce a happier polity to adopt dynamic analysis and open the calculations to oversight and public debate it would do wonders for the economics profession as well dynamic analysis would do more for the pursuit of happiness than removing saddam hussein as secular ruler of iraq indeed the u s can buy hussein as an ally for much less money than will be spent on invading iraq president bush would win more kudos from the electorate from turning the economy around than he will from getting american sons husbands and fathers killed in an iraqi desert the risk of american forces becoming a permanent fixture in the middle east is real and the tax burden of that will make the economy static paul craig roberts is the author with lawrence m stratton of the tyranny of good intentions how prosecutors and bureaucrats are trampling the constitution in the name of justice click here for peter brimelow s forbes magazine interview with roberts about the recent epidemic of prosecutorial misconduct copyright creators syndicate inc
park city utah this mountain community which comes alive during the winter ski season and annual sundance film festival is home to the park city hospital which has 460 employees as in countless hospitals across the country the demands of covid 19 at times overwhelmed the facility and dramatically changed the way caregivers interact with patients the last year and a half has taken a toll on us said jodie connelly nurse manager of the intensive care unit at the hospital which is part of the intermountain healthcare system based in salt lake city nurses have pretty thick skins but the pandemic has tested us in ways we ve never really been tested before the community the hospital serves noticed that strain and came up with a novel idea to help the hospital s workers park city s residents raised enough money through contributions from more than a dozen residents and two large seed donors to fund a pop up grocery store out of a room in the hospital that had been a private dining area the hospital uses about 10 000 of the donations each month to stock the store and all goods are free to any hospital employee at first the store offered ready made pasta chicken and mashed potatoes and other meals including vegetarian options that caregivers could take home or eat during their shift later grocery basics such as milk and eggs were added for employees to stock their fridge today the park city hospital store has expanded to include nonperishable items such as cereal sugar oatmeal and pasta plus a variety of fresh produce options connelly said she especially appreciates convenient access to fresh fruits and vegetables while i keep my pantry at home full of nonperishables i would have to stop at the grocery store more often if i wasn t able to take fresh produce home with me she said selene macotela garcia a food service supervisor at the hospital who stocks the store said she tries to find a variety of items to offer everyone gets excited when we bring in new items she said she recently added lemons eggplant beets and cabbage to the mix having sweet potatoes before thanksgiving was especially popular she said macotela garcia explained that some employees pick up enough ready made food to bring home a precooked meal for each family member instead of having to prepare something once they arrive the store allows the hospital s staff to avoid public places where the risk of covid 19 transmission is high such as grocery stores and helps them save money finances have been tight some of us need help more than people may realize said gregoria taboada a food service worker at the hospital who frequents the store but the store has been useful in helping the hospital s caregivers save on a commodity in especially short supply these days time it means so much to me that after a 13 hour shift i don t have to stop at a grocery store to pick up the basics connelly said work life balance is hard to maintain as the toll from pandemic care has driven some employees to quit and those remaining are often asked to pick up the slack i started taking on extra shifts each week to help out said katie peabody a nurse in the hospital s intensive care unit i frequently work 50 plus hours a week doing work that has become so physically emotionally and mentally taxing she said grueling labor conditions are among many factors noted in a recent mayo clinic study showing why nurses have suicidal thoughts more frequently than people in other professions sometimes there are only two nurses in the icu with no techs or secretaries to field phone calls or help out peabody said while utah is among the bottom half of fully vaccinated states park city s summit county is the most vaccinated in the state with 80 of its residents fully vaccinated because of the city s high number of tourists however the county s current transmission level is still rated in the highest category the store is also a boost to morale workers said especially as they cope with another change of late patients who no longer trust or appreciate them none of us are looking to be a hero connelly said but we used to have a great relationship with our patients and their families that has changed in many cases during the pandemic she noted that almost all the covid 19 patients she s treated this year are unvaccinated and most have very strong feelings about preventive measures such as the use of masks and vaccines she said many patients believe what they see on social media over the treatment options the hospital staff recommends some don t believe they have covid while we re treating them for the disease she lamented some refuse to even wear their oxygen they argue with us about everything some people are downright mean although such patients may be the exception negative interactions take a toll that staff members said the store helps make up for the hospital store is evidence that we are valued peabody added even when some patients tell us otherwise every time i visit the store i m reminded that there are people out there who appreciate me and are trying to take care of me just like i m trying to take care of others

paya nihari and aaloo puri to an eclectic mix of euro anglo american food including paté de foie gras waffles scrambled eggs and several salads in the centre of the table there would be a cake prepared by my mother jahanara habibullah 1915 2003 for example devil s food cake or christmas cake in winter cake making was my mother s contribution to household cooking sometimes she would make a pickle or chutney to supplement those created more frequently by my father my mother was very particular about every household detail in our home at every meal the dining table of gleaming dark wood would be laid with placemats matching table napkins good cutlery and china all our meals were served by a bearer or two in white livery the food was almost always discussed while it was being eaten each dish was expected to be exactly right this was invariably followed by a postmortem a comment on this or that ingredient which my parents would discuss with their incomparable cook maqbool he was pivotal to our household and its culinary traditions maqbool joined us as a young man two or three years after partition by then my younger sister naushaba had been born and we lived in karachi in a block of company flats a colonial building of yellow gizri stone on clifton road in our breezy apartment with its arches and verandahs and patterned floor tiles the back verandah ran past the dining room and led off at a right angle towards the pantry and a traditional kitchen the latter was equipped with a chula built into the far wall with holes on top for cooking and another underneath where burning coals glistened a dark sooty chimney rose up overhead going away in the mid 1950s the company replaced this colonial building with a modern block of nine spacious flats we lived on the top floor there was an enclosed verandah with big windows but the remaining area hall drawing room and dining room were open plan divided by the angle and structure of walls the dining room however had a side door which opened into the pantry from which another door led into the kitchen with a modern gas cooker and possibly a metallic sink my memories of maqbool preparing our meals and indeed those of my parents brunches date back to this era i associate maqbool with the modern rather than the old fashioned kitchen always dressed in an apron while preparing food by this time both naushaba and i had been sent to boarding school in england as my father and his brothers had been a generation earlier this was the norm in our anglicised milieu in karachi though mostly for sons with due foreign exchange permissions i was nine when i left and naushaba joined me when she was eight we came home for good a full ten and nine years later respectively muneeza and naushaba in the 1950s credit muneeza shamsie my parents visited london every other year in the summer holidays to spend time with us naushaba and i came to karachi in the alternative summers and would also visit our widowed grandmothers in rampur and lucknow all this provided a huge contrast to our lives in england and of course the food we ate there we had inherited our father s genes and were plump little girls devoted to food to the despair of our slim elegant and restrained mother in 1961 my father was appointed chairman and managing director of pakistan tobacco company and became the first pakistani to head a major multinational corporation in the country we moved into the chairman s house next door a two storey colonial building with a white exterior sloping red tiled roof and windows with green wooden louvres to filter the summer sunlight in the chairman s house we inherited rahim an exacting super efficient majordomo he was well acquainted with the social demands of a chairman s life as well as the british company directors who came from london on official visits they stayed with us as was the norm on these occasions daily meals were very formal with cut glasses the finest cutlery and chinaware and three courses of english or european food followed by coffee ladies only events this was the house where as a child i had attended christmas parties santa claus and all once my parents moved in the rituals of eid and ramazan became the major festivals in this house at the former we ate mince pies christmas cake and sandwiches for eid we were served traditional fare including samosas seviyan and halwa rahim also supervised the ladies only events held by my mother coffee mornings bridge and mahjong parties as well as milads where two or three women with beautiful voices would sing or chant verses celebrating the life of the prophet at these milads guests would sit against bolsters scattered on white cloths spread over the drawing room carpet before enjoying a sumptuous tea after my father s retirement as chairman of ptc we moved into our own home the modern house my parents built in the then comparatively new defence housing society maqbool and his family came with us as did rahim this new house was divided by a central courtyard with patterned floor tiles and edged with potted plants and a small fountain in one corner the kitchen was long and rectangular and had a small storeroom at the far end for crockery and glassware there was no pantry the gas cookers and sinks were located near the wide windows opposite smaller windows were created higher up for cross ventilation but most of that wall was lined with cabinets at upper and lower levels a sliding serving hatch opened out onto the adjoining polished wooden cabinets in the dining room my father s kitchen utensils bought on his trips to england special kitchen knives different thermometers and cutters together with the various beaters processors and cake tins that my mother used were stored in this section of the kitchen the gas cooker my parents used stood nearby my father now had more time to spare despite many distinguished appointments in the corporate sector and would prepare food for his friends children and grandchildren i particularly remember the soup or stock he would leave to cook on the stove for hours on end the gas cooker that maqbool used daily was further down in the same row throughout this time maqbool held his own producing the finest food he managed this whether he had to cater just for the family and later naushaba s little children and mine or on a grander scale for the formal and informal dinners my parents hosted at these there were both pakistani and visiting mostly british guests as well as diplomats and public figures the latter were often old family friends my parents were aware of the traditional culinary world of both lucknow and rampur to which they belonged maqbool also came from rampur he had clearly revealed his talent early because he had worked in the royal kitchens of khasbagh palace albeit in a junior capacity when he was very young he understood the careful melding of spices which my mother often declared to be the essence of good cooking this was considered one of the great attributes of rampuri food and included the restrained use of chillies in karachi maqbool was trained further by my father who greatly valued maqbool s culinary skills maqbool s repertoire was vast and paid great attention to detail the koftas and shami kababs he made were stuffed with a very fine chopped mixture of green coriander green chillies and onions the qiwami seviyan were cooked in such a way that each seviyan strand plumped by the sugar syrup it had absorbed glistened with the sheen then there was the crisp toffee he shaped into baskets with curving handles above one basket per serving filled with fruit salad in thick cream the koftas and shami kababs prepared by the author s family cook maqbool were stuffed with a fine chopped mixture of green coriander green chillies and onions credit adhishb at english wikipedia cc by sa 3 0 there was one speciality that i have never seen elsewhere a pudding made of a large swiss roll covered with thick white cream and dots of yellow coloured cream to resemble a corn cob and with green leaves made of marzipan on either side once in my early twenties before i was married i asked him if he would teach me to cook he said arrey aap aap ko kiya seekhaoon ga aap to khansama rakhein gi what you what can i teach you you will keep a cook in my parents homes in karachi spicy desi food was usually a special treat two or three times a week most days we ate angrezi food which included those everyday dishes so popular in the subcontinent and which i never encountered during my years at boarding school in england potato mince cutlets cock rolls and crumb chops then there were the usual soups roasts spaghetti salads baked fish and fried fish sometimes we had soufflé or lobster thermidor or crab au gratin maqbool also made the lightest pastry imaginable flaky pastry for vol au vents and mille feuille and shortcrust pastry for quiches jam tarts and other puddings maqbool died of a massive heart attack in the late 1970s both my daughters saman and kamila were very little at the time but both remember maqbool with great affection their grandparents loved to have them over and each time the two little girls would be asked beforehand what would you like to eat they adored all maqbool s food but their absolute favourite was lemon meringue pie this dish is made in our house to this day by saman she became an enthusiastic pastry maker aged eight or nine and lemon meringue pie was an early thing she learnt from her first cookery book kamila s culinary skills developed much later after she settled in london she became a rather inventive cook as was her grandfather but in her second novel salt and saffron a description of iftar of breaking the daylong fast during ramazan recreates for me the delicacies my parents would have served she writes we started with the requisite date of course to symbolize fidelity to the first muslims in the deserts of arabia but then on to gluttony curly shaped jalaibees hot and gooey that trickled thick sweet syrup down your chin when you bit into them diced potatoes drowned in yogurt sprinkled in spices triangles of fried samosas the smaller ones filled with mince meat the larger ones filled with potatoes and green chillies shami kebabs with sweet sour imli sauce spinach leaves fried in chick pea batter maqbool lives on in family memory my parents did not find a cook equal to him again by the time he died it was rare indeed to find one with his repertoire particularly when it came to european food puddings pastries and halwa their subsequent cooks and other staff came from different regions of pakistan but there was another rampuri cook vital to my parents household after maqbool was there no more this was the elderly amjad he used to work for my mother s cousin whose daughters were my childhood friends i seem to have known him forever he was certainly a household name in my maternal family he was reserved and very polite and i always associate him with the churidar pyjama dark sherwani and dark cap he always wore i have no memory of him in the kitchen per se he gave up his full time job eventually and started to cook freelance for us and a few of our relatives preparing specific dishes such as that rampur speciality adrak ka halwa or his amazing dahi bara on important occasions saleem and muneeza shamsie with their daughters saman and kamila credit muneeza shamsie there was also sabir who was of rampuri origin too he had a rather chequered career and from time to time would just vanish from our lives he worked for my parents a couple of times decades apart as a bearer and once for me in between he was a factory worker and trade unionist occasionally he cooked specific dishes for my parents in the post maqbool era he had a shock of dark hair wore shalwar kameez and moved around with great agility then at some point he disappeared entirely in all these years i took my mother s knowledge of food for granted it never occurred to me to question how or why she came by her information since she didn t cook any of these dishes after she passed away i was astonished to find that she had left behind four whole exercise books scribbled with recipes some in english mostly in urdu plus little envelopes with recipes folded inside among these papers i found she had one recipe for sheer khurma but three different recipes for qiwami seviyan in three different books one is marked qiwami seviyan tarkeeb sultana masood namely the method given to her by her friend and relative sultana masood there are three recipes for another rampur speciality adrak ka halwa including one attributed to amjad and sabir though i have no recollection of sabir s version other traditional desserts include loki ka halwa shahi turkey kheer firni plus two versions including amjad s of gajar ka halwa and anday ka halwa she has also written down three recipes for kichra a main course usually associated with ashura the tenth day of moharrum and distributed as niaz among other main courses i discovered an unusual salan hara dhania alongside amjad s murgh musallam sabir s qorma and sabir s aaloo ki katliyan the latter is so easy that i was surprised to find it there until i came across several other straightforward recipes even one for an omelette tables laid for outdoor dining in karachi at the author s 25th wedding anniversary credit muneeza shamsie i soon realised that these recipes along with those of the usual meat vegetable combinations such as saag gosht provided that essential knowledge which ensured everyday fare for the family throughout this extensive and varied collection there are recipes attributed to friends or relatives including one each by naushaba and me as well as tamatar ka hyderabadi cut az sorayya mazari baigan ki sabzi az gaiti tarkeeb machli az bajia tuba s biryani and lime pickle by begum amjad ali there are two more lime pickle recipes one typed in english the other handwritten in urdu and a wide range of pickles and chutneys from achar shaljam khatta achar aam and prawn achar to nauratan aur am chutney tamatar chutney and imli ki chutney there are no recipes by maqbool i can only assume that my mother wrote most of these methods down after he passed away to instruct future cooks one exercise book has a solitary date november 1975 very much in maqbool s lifetime however it refers to my mother s culinary speciality christmas cake with an added note the recipe is not quite right in an envelope i found a letter dated 1976 written on the official letterhead of the british deputy high commission karachi and signed nellie eaden with a recipe for plum pudding attached there is another plum pudding recipe and one for crème suisse both seemingly written by british visitors to pakistan the list of recipes is endless scones walnut bread coffee cake brownies swedish tea ring two for cake icing and a detailed description of how to make mango ice cream in a special ice cream machine given by another friend yusuf bhabha muneeza shamsie credit ayesha vellani then there are recipes for chinese dishes so popular in pakistan and a slew of angrezi dishes including mulligatawny soup plucked partridges and parsley potatoes roast duck and lots of patés including one by my father made of kidneys added to this are some basic essentials white sauce chicken stock and apple pectin for me these recipes are an extraordinary walk down memory lane both the recipes and the people my mother mentions evoke so many images of a bygone past i also see how my mother kept herself informed about different dishes and their ingredients and the constant possibilities for improving every dish i believe this work was common to many women from her generation i learnt to cook gradually and only after i married from some recipes given to me by my father and some from cookery books recommended by him over a period of time the only recipe i inherited from my mother was her christmas cake which i make almost every year the recipe was originally given to saman my teenage daughter and family pastry maker i ventured into trying this a year or two later and it worked perfectly i had been rather intimidated by its intricacies at first i was never told either by my parents or my husband saleem shamsie what i should or should not cook somehow i seem to have collected recipes and made kheer andey ka halwa gajar ka halwa sheer khurma and qiwami seviyan long before i can still see my father sitting there at the end of his dining table sometimes flicking through a cookery book or two or sometime just giving me the details straight from memory experience pausing to ponder a little as he dictated these recipes to me one such recipe is the qiwami seviyan below a traditional dish that my parents always served at eid as i do in the old days it used to be decorated with finely beaten silver foil chandi ka varq alongside the almonds and pistachios but these days i don t risk it unless i can be sure it really is silver and not some unhealthy metal made to resemble varq qiwami seviyan ingredients 2 lb sugar 1 pint water ½ tsp saffron threads 2 tbsp kewra 8 oz seviyan 8 oz butter 2 tins evaporated milk about 400 ml each 1 packet 200 ml cream or use 6 oz fresh cream chopped pistachios or almonds skinned

voters from both parties encouraged to contact congress and urge audit by mark anderson as this newspaper announced in issue no 49 50 in 2015 united states senator randal howard rand paul r ky is still floating legislation to audit the federal reserve system we asked readers to contact capitol hill and urge a vote and it appears our efforts with other fed foes have paid off a senate fed audit vote has been scheduled for january 12 the most viable of paul s two audit bills introduced in 2015 is s 2232 the federal reserve transparency act of 2015 one year ago in january 2015 he introduced s 264 which carries the same name but that bill according to the library of congress never left the senate banking committee paul who s also a republican presidential candidate announced on his facebook page i ve been told that when the senate returns on january 12th we will vote on auditing the fed i ve been fighting for years to get this vote this is a huge victory for us but it s still an uphill battle from here to get full transparency from the fed let s gear up and let s really fight to make this important change the house on several occasions has passed fed audit bills over the last few years though the secretive privately owned and controlled fed is supremely adept at sidetracking such moves federal reserve bank of richmond president jeffrey m lacker showing how jealously the fed guards its century long racket has called the idea of an audit high frequency harassment of our decision making process our monetary policy decision making process among the 24 all gop official co sponsors according to the library of congress as of december 26 are paul s rival republican presidential candidates senators marco antonio rubio fla and rafael edward ted cruz texas it s apparently unheard of for three presidential hopefuls to call for legislation targeting the fed be it an audit or anything else cruz s fellow texan senator john cornyn iii r also is on board the other states with both senators aboard are idaho republicans michael dean mike crapo and james elroy jim risch and georgia republicans david alfred perdue jr and john hardy johnny isakson on a video accompanying his facebook announcement regarding who s on board for this vote paul noted we don t have all the republicans yet much less all the democrats the s 2232 text states that its purpose is to require a full audit of the board of governors of the federal reserve system and the federal reserve banks by the comptroller general of the united states and for other purposes if the bill becomes law an audit would be required within 12 months after enactment a report on the audit s results would be required within 90 days after the audit is done voters from either major party should call capitol hill and get more senators on board independent voters should do the same unity across party lines is possible an audit may be a worthwhile way to help break the federal reserve s stranglehold on the nation s monetary policy and on the greater economy because a proper in depth audit could reveal fed manipulations that would shock more lawmakers and citizens out of their complacency toward the central bank however ending the fed must remain our goal when private bankers steal the critically important sovereign function of creating money and then are allowed to regulate the banking system on top of that drastic restorative measures are needed to divorce the fed terminate its debt based money system and publicly re issue interest free united states notes much like president andrew jackson did when he terminated the private second bank of the united states in 1836 and moved money creation back to the sovereign government paul noted on his presidential campaign website the federal reserve was created by congress and is supposed to be overseen by congress the fed is now in every nook and cranny of banking with unprecedented regulatory powers and no congressional oversight i believe the regulatory power should be placed back under the control of congress notably there was little evidence at press time of senate democrats publicly supporting this legislation when the earlier bill s 264 first came up even so called banking watchdog senator elizabeth ann warren d mass did not support it while pathetically parroting the fed s official line that any monetary policy oversight by congress would politicize the fed s decisions typical codespeak the fed uses to deflect deeper oversight warren would simply allow the already required basic audit of the fed s balance sheets to continue without a deeper look at the all important monetary policy to ask for any senate or house member by name call capitol hill s switchboard at 202 224 3121 or 225 3121 standard mail can be addressed name of legislator followed by senate office building washington d c 20510 or name of legislator house office building washington d c 20515 mark anderson covers the annual bilderberg meetings and is chairman of afp s new america first action committee designed to involve afp readers in focusing intensely on congress to enact key changes including monetary reform and a pullback of the warfare state he and his wife angie often work together on news projects we really don t need the federal reserve secretive central bank s ability to manipulate money supply must be restricted by former representative ron paul stocks rose on wednesday december 16 following the federal reserve s announcement of the first interest rate increase since 2006 however stocks fell just two days later one reason the positive reaction to the fed s announcement did not last long is that the fed seems to lack confidence in the economy and is unsure what policies it should adopt in the future at her wednesday press conference federal reserve chair janet yellen acknowledged continuing cyclical weakness in the job market she also suggested that future rate increases are likely to be as small or even smaller than wednesday s however she also expressed concerns over increasing inflation which suggests the fed may be open to bigger rate increases many investors and those who rely on interest from savings for a substantial part of their income cheered the increase however others expressed concern that even this small rate increase will weaken the already fragile job market these critics echo the claims of many economists and economic historians who blame past economic crises including the great depression on ill timed money tightening by the fed while the federal reserve is responsible for our boom bust economy recessions and depressions are not caused by tight monetary policy instead the real cause of economic crisis is the loose money policies that precede the fed s tightening when the fed floods the market with artificially created money it lowers the interest rates which are the price of money as the price of money interest rates send signals to businesses and investors regarding the wisdom of making certain types of investments when the rates are artificially lowered by the fed instead of naturally lowered by the market businesses and investors receive distorted signals the result is over investment in certain sectors of the economy such as housing this creates the temporary illusion of prosperity however since the boom is rooted in the fed s manipulation of the interest rates eventually the bubble will burst and the economy will slide into recession while the federal reserve may tighten the money supply before an economic downturn the tightening is simply a futile attempt to control the inflation resulting from the fed s earlier increases in the money supply after the bubble inevitably bursts the federal reserve will inevitability try to revive the economy via new money creation which starts the whole boom bust cycle all over again the only way to avoid future crashes is for the fed to stop creating inflation and bubbles some economists and policy makers claim that the way to stop the federal reserve from causing economic chaos is not to end the fed but to force the fed to adopt a rules based monetary policy adopting rules based monetary policy may seem like an improvement but because it still allows a secretive central bank to manipulate the money supply it will still result in fed created booms and busts the only way to restore economic stability and avoid a major economic crisis is to end the fed or at least allow americans to use alternative currencies fortunately more americans than ever are working to change our monetary system thanks to the efforts of this growing anti fed movement audit the fed had twice passed the house of representatives and the senate is scheduled to vote on it on january 12 auditing the fed so the american people can finally learn the full truth about the fed s operations is an important first step in restoring a sound monetary policy hopefully the senate will take that step and pass audit the fed in january ron paul a former u s representative from texas and medical doctor continues to write his column texas straight talk for the foundation for rational economics and education

loves yhis highly recommend my father in law and i both dislike american lasagne with all the ricotta and mozzarella cheese but we love love love this the dough does seem dry when you re working it but it works at the end if you let it rest i add a little olive oil to add moisture if needed sarah forked river nj this recipe is always delicious although i think i would skip boiling the fresh lasagna noodles because i thought mine came out too soft i made the noodles from scratch and they were thin enough to just skip the step liz farmingdale ny i have made this recipe or some derivation thereof many times now i consider this to be an all time classic recipe from bon appetit and will continue to make this for special dinners with friends making your own pasta and challenging yourself to make as many layers as possible is fun enjoy stefan chicago il i was drawn to this recipe because the usual heavy ricotta version while delicious has way too much dairy for my lactose intolerant self while the amount of time it takes to make is daunting it s well worth it its the best lasagna i ve ever made i do make a few concessions and short cuts which don t affect the end result in my opinion first pancetta its not readily available where i live so i substitute bacon second i use barilla no boil noodles because they are dry the do need extra liquid and i typically add some extra stock to compensate i also don t wait the 12 hours to rest the bolognese i do let it cool down a couple hours but make the lasagna same day i also sometimes stretch the bolognese to two lasagnas and double the bechamel and parmesan and noodles in the layers missing the bolognese i add sautéed vegetables like mushrooms zucchini and swiss chard rebecca c central maine best lasagna ever not a ricotta fan so i was drawn to this recipe first the bolognese sauce is so good fortunately i had a little leftover for another pasta night i ve made this recipe 5 or 6 times before with fresh store bought lasagna sheets it was great then but decided to try making the sheets per the recipe and it went from great to awesome like some reviewers i was concerned with what appeared to be dryness in the dough after kneading but went with it and made no changes the end result was a silky lasagna that melted in your mouth i followed the recipe completely including tin foil cover for the last 20 minutes of baking and it turned out perfectly it was a 3 day process but well worth it pd richmond va my dough was way too dry i added an extra egg and probably 2 tsp olive oil maybe my eggs were too small i also added ricotta to a few layers per my husband s request it worked great just dolloped on but definitely made some of the layers thicker between the ricotta and probably being a little heavy handed on the bolognese and béchamel i got 6 7 layers instead of the 8 mentioned here and had some pasta leftover worth it alex this lasagna saved my marriage lexi california this bolognese is the best it is not a traditional meat sauce ragu you should not add oregano and basil and you do not need extra tomato the milk is very important i use ground pork veal and beef equal parts at the end i add a touch of cream to make it even richer and do add the extra stock following the directions it is rich and velvety i think it s better than most italian restaurants lynne canton mi i adore this project recipe we call it blizzard lasagna because everytime we have a blizzard or other appropriate excuse i make this very comfy and tasty dish i increade it to 12 layers and increaae the batch by 50 the noodles i make are paper thin use the thinnest setting on kitchen aide to the point i can read the recipe through the noodle folks that have issues with dry noodles make sure you rest the dough long enough dry sauce make sure you are adding the last cup of broth as called for you can also add water along the way as mentioned in the recipe good luck and enjoy bon phillipé love this recipe i m a bit lazy so i use trader joe s no cook lasagna noodles still turns out great i also make sure to cook the sauce at least a day before the lasagna i usually end up with some extra sauce which i just eat with pasta it s kinda dry compared to other lasagna but i think it s way better i always cook the onion and beef longer than it says but this is my favorite lasagna ever highly recommend fleur atlanta ga this recipe is amazing i ve made it about 50 times and feel like i have to spread the word on what a special dish it is as many of the other reviewers wrote it s a lot of work but totally worth it it is my family s favorite meal and what i make for all special occasions because they love it so much i highly highly recommend it anonymous
menafn dailyfx spiking inflation has been a hot button topic in 2021 but u s treasury yields have actually declined in recent weeks suggesting there may be more to this story than meets the eye this story ran in june 2021 and may have dated references but it remains relevant and a fascinating read for traders like an ominous scene from a classic horror movie rising inflation in 2021 was expected to be the boogeyman that killed the everything rally in 2021 but with the s p 500 up 15 year to date that massacre has yet to arrive last year many pundits predicted that inflation would pick up steam in 2021 as the global economy rebounded from the covid 19 pandemic and while global economic activity has undoubtedly increased in recent months some key interest rate i e inflation metrics have moderated particularly u s treasury yields treasury yields represent the return on u s government debt and frequently serve as the canary in the coal mine for the underlying economy for example the yield on the u s treasury note was trading above 3 back in the fall of 2018 before plummeting to an all time intraday low of 0 318 during the height of the march 2020 meltdown in the financial markets that same yield has staged an impressive rally in the time since bringing the 10 year treasury all the way back to 1 78 this march as a result of that move many market participants feared that the yield on the 10 year treasury could rise as high as 2 50 by the summer but summer has officially arrived and treasury yields have actually moved in the opposite direction as of june 14 the yield on the u s 10 year treasury note was trading right around 1 50 roughly 14 lower than the 52 week high more importantly that s a full point lower than the worst case boogeyman scenario considering the global economy is recovering and that widespread vaccination programs are being conducted across the world it makes one wonder why yields have dropped recently instead of continuing their move higher that s not necessarily an easy question to answer but at its core the downdraft in yields likely reflects moderating expectations for the strength of the post covid economic rebound or at minimum the sustainability of said rebound one factor tempering expectations may be the fact that while vaccination levels in the united states are high 50 of the population the rest of the world remains far behind at this time it s estimated that about 20 of the total human population has received at least one dose of an approved covid 19 vaccine while that s no small feat the reality is that more people will need to be vaccinated before many countries reopen their borders to foreign travelers the u s included and while tourism isn t the most important industry on the planet it has long been a critical indicator of global prosperity the graphic below highlights how much of the world may not be vaccinated until well into 2022 reflecting these harsh vaccination realities china recently announced that it doesn t plan to open its borders to foreign travelers anytime soon and that s despite the fact that china has administered more than 900 million doses of vaccine within its borders to date considering that covid 19 supposedly originated in china one would expect that the reopening of that country s borders will be an important step in symbolizing the conclusion of the pandemic this is especially important given china s critical manufacturing role in the global economy based on anecdotal evidence it seems that many other countries in asia won t be opening up to outside travelers anytime soon either vietnam which was a big winner from the recent u s china trade war probably won t reopen its borders to foreign travelers until 2022 and importantly it s not just tourists that have been affected as existing international travel restrictions often impact business people as well the reality is that fewer business travelers undoubtedly equates to less business further illustrating the destruction wrought by the pandemic consider that hong kong was the most visited city on the planet in 2019 with more than 27 million unique arrivals during 2020 that number dropped to 3 5 million the lowest annual total on record outside of the travel indicator there s been evidence from other markets that expectations for the covid 19 economic rebound may be tempering

financial expenses net taxes depreciation and amortization and adjusted ffo is calculated by deducting tax expenses and interest expenses on bank loans debentures and others from the adjusted ebitda the company uses the terms adjusted ebitda and adjusted ffo to highlight the fact that in the calculation of these non ifrs financial measures the company presents the revenues from the talmei yosef

financial results of talasol for the period prior to achievement of pac that were not recognized in the profit and loss statement based on accounting rules the company presents these measures in order to enhance the understanding of the company s operating performance and to enable comparability between periods while the company considers these non ifrs measures to be important measures of comparative operating performance these non ifrs measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net income or other statement of operations or cash flow data prepared in accordance with ifrs as a measure of profitability or liquidity these non ifrs measures do not take into account the company s commitments including capital expenditures and restricted cash and accordingly are not necessarily indicative of amounts that may be available for discretionary uses in addition adjusted ffo does not represent and is not an alternative to cash flow from operations as defined by ifrs and is not an indication of cash available to fund all cash flow needs including the ability to make distributions not all companies calculate ebitda adjusted ebitda or adjusted ffo in the same manner and the measures as presented may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies the company s ebitda adjusted ebitda and adjusted ffo may not be indicative of the company s historic operating results nor is it meant to be predictive of potential future results the company uses these measures internally as performance measures and believes that when these measures are combined with ifrs measures they add useful information concerning the company s operating performance a reconciliation between results on an ifrs and non ifrs basis is

the climate crisis has been one of the focal points of 2021 both within political discourse and the architectural field accompanied by a newfound acknowledgement of the issue s severity over the past year the ipcc report revealed the severe consequences of inaction while cop26 and g7 summit resulted in an insufficient commitment to immediate and palpable measures the aec sector responsible for a staggering 39 of global greenhouse gases can bring a significant contribution to curbing climate change and the following looks at the decarbonization efforts of 2021 that target this industry 2 since the 2015 paris agreement mitigating climate change has been established as a common world encompassing goal however decarbonization efforts have not been on track earlier this year the ipcc report revealed intensifying climate change sparking widespread discussion over insufficient action the intergovernmental panel on climate change the un s body for assessing the science related to climate change has published a comprehensive report documenting the extent of global warming providing new time estimates for crossing the 1 5 degrees celsius threshold and urging immediate and large scale action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions according to a world meteorological organization report published in may there is a 40 chance that the 1 5 degrees threshold will be exceeded for at least one year by 2025 in june g7 leaders pledged to raise their contributions to help less developed countries cut carbon emissions support the shift to renewable energy and deal with the effects of climate change however a similar pledge was made in 2009 and was for the most part unmet while this year no firm commitments have been made the industry s response leading architecture organizations and figures attended the 26th un climate change conference of the parties cop 26 in glasgow to show the aec s industry s commitment to reduce carbon emissions and urge decision makers to implement clear targets to achieve global climate goals ahead of the event sixty of the world largest architecture engineering and construction firms together with some of the most important architectural organizations have signed the 1 5oc cop26 communiqué an open letter to governments demonstrating their commitment to meet the paris agreement goals and calling on governments to do the same the communique was supported by union internationale des architectes uia american institute of architects aia riba and big arup perkins will som studio gang gensler are among the firms who signed the open letter energy and building operations building operations are responsible for 28 of annual global carbon emissions which links the decarbonization of the aec sector with the pace of renewable energy implementation this year california mandated solar panels and battery storage for new buildings in a move towards establishing a 100 clean energy grid the measure proposed by california energy commission in august was included this month in the state s 2022 build energy efficiency standards a standard revised every three years to shift the state s building stock towards clean energy and carbon neutrality just this month the new york city council has officially voted to eliminate natural gas connections to new buildings as part of the city s efforts to become carbon neutral by 2050 materials concrete steel and aluminium account for 23 of total global emissions therefore the decarbonization efforts within the aec industry depend heavily on material innovation and changing material practices the global cement and concrete association gcca announced its commitment to cut carbon emissions by 25 by 2030 and reach carbon neutrality by 2050 the gcca comprising leading cement and concrete manufactures that make up 80 of the concrete market outside china and some chinese manufacturers has revealed a detailed roadmap for achieving its goals which includes finding alternatives to clinker using renewable energy and capturing carbon at the same time numerous innovative sustainable materials have been developed of which some have significant chances of entering common usage the architectural field has also shown its endorsement of new material practices by granting the golden lion for best national participation at the 2021 venice biennale to uae s wetland participation which showcased an environmentally friendly alternative to portland cement made of recycled industrial waste brine development strategies as the construction process can amount to half of a building s lifetime carbon emissions the adaptive reuse and retrofit of existing buildings are critical strategies in reducing embodied carbon not only are resources conserved by recycling spaces but the lifespan of structures whose fabrication generated large quantities of carbon dioxide is extended in recent years the profession moved away from the idea of architectural expendability and adaptive reuse entered common practice with the trend becoming more widespread over the last year in architecture media and practice this article is part of the archdaily topic year in review every

tickford racing team principal tim edwards says cameron waters development is proof supercars drivers should compete outside the championship to improve themselves waters is well known to dabble in dirt speedway in recent years delving into the v8 powered sprintcar scene a far cry from the world of supercars the sprintcars offer waters an accelerated experience of track development while a supercars circuit might develop over days and hours the dirt speedways change in a matter of minutes as the clay surface changes waters enjoyed a strong 2020 his best season to date in which he was runner up to djr team penske s scott mclaughlin in that campaign he claimed his first solo supercars win and was runner up with will davison to triple eight race engineering s shane van gisbergen and garth tander in the bathurst 1000 it marked a significant step forward which he continued into the first half of 2021 waters was van gisbergen s nearest rival initially finishing second in three of the first four races however he would fall off in the latter half as the team struggled with the four part sydney swing the monster energy backed pilot eventually dropping from a season high third to fifth in the drivers championship speaking with speedcafe com edwards said he s seen continual development from waters which he attributes in part to his speedway activities i think it hasn t just happened in the last 12 months he s been growing year on year for the last five years said edwards he s just got a bit better and a bit better and i think he s maturing and he s learning more even things like he made a conscious decision to race that sprintcar this year not just because he wanted to have a bit of fun in a sprintcar it s because he thought it d actually help him develop more as a driver all those things they say you get older and wiser well he s learning all the time and the result of him learning all the time is just getting incrementally better as he s getting older he s not just sitting on his hands going oh yeah i m going to race again in two weeks and because i m cam waters i ll just be better than i was last week he s doing everything he can to improve you can spend a lot of time just working on pumping weights and getting fit but you ve got to improve yourself mentally you ve got to improve your race craft i think that s something he s really thought sprintcars might help him you go out in a sprintcar and by the end of a 20 or 30 lap race the track is completely different to the track that you started on you can t stop and say oh change the bump and rebound springs or whatever it is to improve the balance of the car you ve got to adapt as a driver to a different track he s thought you know what that ll help me race in a supercar because apart from an anti roll bar adjuster you can t do much else in the race you ve got to adapt as the track changes as the tyres wear as the fuel load comes off he s thinking all the time about how he improves as a driver and you re just seeing the result of it over the last 12 or so months in the past tickford racing s drivers haven t shied away from competing outside of supercars either domestically or internationally during his time at the campbellfield outfit mark winterbottom ventured to south america where he raced in stock car brazil the country s equivalent of supercars similarly chaz mostert made regular cameos in gt3 racing having been a factory bmw driver for several years even after his time at tickford racing mostert has continued competing elsewhere including the supercheap auto tcr australia series and fanatec gt world challenge powered by aws i ve always encouraged my drivers to do that said edwards even frosty he would go off and race in brazilian stock cars chaz when he was driving for us he didn t just race high end stuff he raced the bathurst 6 hour in production cars just racing something more often than 12 or 15 times a year in supercars you need to keep yourself fresh you can do a little bit of that on a simulator but you ve also got to be careful you don t get bad habits from a simulator it s not real world it s good for some things but the simulators we have here aren t as advanced as formula 1 and a lot of those high end simulators where it s a lot like the real thing ours really aren t a lot like the real thing winterbottom and mostert aren t the only supercars drivers to frequent other categories shane van gisbergen is perhaps the most prolific of all delving into endurance gt3 events drifting rally and briefly dirt speedway i certainly think it s a positive edwards said of racing outside of supercars it s a little different if you re racing in nascar and are racing every single weekend of the year you probably don t need to do too much else although a lot of them do a lot go off and race speedway as well i definitely think it s certainly worked for cam and it s certainly worked for chaz as well three test days a year doesn t give you much opportunity between races

equity gain using the equity method and includes the financial results of talasol for the period prior to achievement of pac that were not recognized in the profit and loss statement based on accounting rules the company presents these measures in order to enhance the understanding of the company s operating performance and to enable comparability between periods while the company considers these non ifrs measures to be important measures of comparative operating performance these non ifrs measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net income or other statement of operations or cash flow data prepared in accordance with ifrs as a measure of profitability or liquidity these non ifrs measures do not take into account the company s commitments including capital expenditures and restricted cash and accordingly are not necessarily indicative of amounts that may be available for discretionary uses in addition adjusted ffo does not represent and is not an alternative to cash flow from operations as defined by ifrs and is not an indication of cash available to fund all cash flow needs including the ability to make distributions not all companies calculate ebitda adjusted ebitda or adjusted ffo in the same manner and the measures as presented may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies the company s ebitda adjusted ebitda and adjusted ffo may not be indicative of the company s historic operating results nor is it meant to be predictive of potential future results the company uses these measures

accept that covid 19 will be a perpetual endemic like the flu with vaccinations face masks and social distancing as the remedy furthermore the freedom to vote act and john lewis voting rights advancement act must be approved so all 50 states will operate under the same voting rules permitting democracy to survive voter suppression and electoral manipulation shelved and prevent another insurrection attempt in 2022 and 2024 americans must recognize that russia china iran and north korea are the new axis of evil and will go to any extreme to advance their military and economic interests at our expense additionally congress must approve equal rights amendment to bring women s rights on par with men during 2022 instead of far right wing politicians continuing to downplay and disregard america s true history they need to focus on eradicating ignorance finally registered voters need to pressure legislators of all political stripes to work together to solve problems just like elementary students work side by side regardless of their peers identity is that too much to ask of our legislators to demonstrate their loyalty to america instead of a political party

financial results of talasol for the period prior to achievement of pac that were not recognized in the profit and loss statement based on accounting rules the company presents these measures in order to enhance the understanding of the company s operating performance and to enable comparability between periods while the company considers these non ifrs measures to be important measures of comparative operating performance these non ifrs measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net income or other statement of operations or cash flow data prepared in accordance with ifrs as a measure of profitability or liquidity these non ifrs measures do not take into account the company s commitments including capital expenditures and restricted cash and accordingly are not necessarily indicative of amounts that may be available for discretionary uses in addition adjusted ffo does not represent and is not an alternative to cash flow from operations as defined by ifrs and is not an indication of cash available to fund all cash flow needs including the ability to make distributions not all companies calculate ebitda adjusted ebitda or adjusted ffo in the same manner and the measures as presented may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies the company s ebitda adjusted ebitda and adjusted ffo may not be indicative of the company s historic operating results nor is it meant to be predictive of potential future results the company uses these measures internally as performance measures and believes that

spiking inflation has been a hot button topic in 2021 but u s treasury yields have actually declined in recent weeks suggesting there may be more to this story than meets the eye this story ran in june 2021 and may have dated references but it remains relevant and a fascinating read for traders like an ominous scene from a classic horror movie rising inflation in 2021 was expected to be the boogeyman that killed the everything rally in 2021 but with the s p 500 up 15 year to date that massacre has yet to arrive last year many pundits predicted that inflation would pick up steam in 2021 as the global economy rebounded from the covid 19 pandemic and while global economic activity has undoubtedly increased in recent months some key interest rate i e inflation metrics have moderated particularly u s treasury yields treasury yields represent the return on u s government debt and frequently serve as the canary in the coal mine for the underlying economy for example the yield on the u s treasury note was trading above 3 back in the fall of 2018 before plummeting to an all time intraday low of 0 318 during the height of the march 2020 meltdown in the financial markets that same yield has staged an impressive rally in the time since bringing the 10 year treasury all the way back to 1 78 this march as a result of that move many market participants feared that the yield on the 10 year treasury could rise as high as 2 50 by the summer but summer has officially arrived and treasury yields have actually moved in the opposite direction as of june 14 the yield on the u s 10 year treasury note was trading right around 1 50 roughly 14 lower than the 52 week high more importantly that s a full point lower than the worst case boogeyman scenario considering the global economy is recovering and that widespread vaccination programs are being conducted across the world it makes one wonder why yields have dropped recently instead of continuing their move higher that s not necessarily an easy question to answer but at its core the downdraft in yields likely reflects moderating expectations for the strength of the post covid economic rebound or at minimum the sustainability of said rebound one factor tempering expectations may be the fact that while vaccination levels in the united states are high 50 of the population the rest of the world remains far behind at this time it s estimated that about 20 of the total human population has received at least one dose of an approved covid 19 vaccine while that s no small feat the reality is that more people will need to be vaccinated before many countries reopen their borders to foreign travelers the u s included and while tourism isn t the most important industry on the planet it has long been a critical indicator of global prosperity the graphic below highlights how much of the world may not be vaccinated until well into 2022 reflecting these harsh vaccination realities china recently announced that it doesn t plan to open its borders to foreign travelers anytime soon and that s despite the fact that china has administered more than 900 million doses of vaccine within its borders to date considering that covid 19 supposedly originated in china one would expect that the reopening of that country s borders will be an important step in symbolizing the conclusion of the pandemic this is especially important given china s critical manufacturing role in the global economy based on anecdotal evidence it seems that many other countries in asia won t be opening up to outside travelers anytime soon either vietnam which was a big winner from the recent u s china trade war probably won t reopen its borders to foreign travelers until 2022 and importantly it s not just tourists that have been affected as existing international travel restrictions often impact business people as well the reality is that fewer business travelers undoubtedly equates to less business further illustrating the destruction wrought by the pandemic consider that hong kong was the most visited city on the planet in 2019 with more than 27 million unique arrivals during 2020 that number dropped to 3 5 million the lowest annual total on record outside of the travel indicator there s been evidence from other markets that expectations for the covid 19 economic rebound may be tempering lumber prices which skyrocketed in the last nine months are now down 22 since may 10 housing starts in the u s which had also been strong in 2020 similarly experienced a big drop recently declining 13 4 from march to april and just the other day consumer data collected during the month of may indicated that retail sales in the u s dropped last month that same trend was observed in china where retail sales were also a disappointment in may these moderating economic indicators may help illustrate why the u s federal reserve has been so consistent not to mention confident when referring to 2021 inflationary pressures as transitory i e temporary importantly an update from the u s central bank is due on june 16 when the nation s top bankers break from a two day policy meeting just a couple months ago leaders at the fed reiterated their intention to leave interest rates unchanged in the u s i e near zero through 2023 investors and traders will undoubtedly be watching closely this

zanzibari women are learning how to swim and farm natural sponges that can withstand climate shocks and protect their income warming seas rising salinity impact seaweed farms charity trains women to swim and farm natural sponges sponges are climate resilient and fetch good prices by kim harrisberg jambiani zanzibar aug 4 thomson reuters foundation nasir hassan haji never thought of herself as a farmer or a swimmer but as she waded into zanzibar s blue waters with goggles pulled over her headscarf to examine her floating sponge farm she realised she had surprised herself by becoming both alongside 12 other women in jambiani village on the indian ocean coast haji has come to rely on the climate resilient natural sponges bobbing on thick ropes where they grow for months before the women harvest clean and sell them to shops and tourists i learned to swim and to farm sponges so i could be free and not depend on any man haji said later sitting on the floor in her home on the tanzanian island before farming sponges which resemble a white textured rock but are actually simple multicellular animals haji cultivated seaweed until increasing ocean temperatures fuelled by global warming made it difficult to grow her cash crop haji and other women dependent on the ocean for their livelihoods from seaweed farming to fishing and tourism have seen warmer rising seas threaten their work but they are adapting by finding ways to diversify what they do to get by local conservationists say this has become even more urgent as covid 19 travel restrictions around the world have stalled the flow of tourists to the tropical holiday destination forcing islanders to look to nature to eke out a living we are seeing people who relied on tourism now turning to fishing or cutting wood from the forests it is a tug of war between economics and the environment said mohamed okala a conservationist and tour guide from jambiani locals say they have already seen fish stocks depleting over the past year but for women like haji sponge farming has acted as a buffer against both the climate and economic shocks the island has endured i am building my own house and educating my children said the single mother of four aged 46 as she went to stir a pot on a nearby fire women were left behind before but now that is changing sea as a friend research by the state university of zanzibar shows that more than 90 of seaweed farmers on the island are women and that they have seen changing water temperatures rainfall patterns and ocean salinity hit production in recent years using data that shows zanzibar warming over the past 40 years a 2012 study from the global climate adaptation partnership and britain s former department for international development projected the island s average maximum monthly temperature would rise by 1 5 to 2 degrees celsius by the 2050s the women seaweed farmers typically sell their produce to middlemen who export it to countries like denmark vietnam france and the united states where it is used as an emulsifying agent in creams soaps and foods haji had farmed seaweed since she was a young girl until six years ago when a friend told her the environmental charity marinecultures org was teaching women to swim and farm sponges that could be used for cleaning and bathing since 2009 christian and connie vaterlaus the charity s swiss founders have collected sponge particles from around the island to grow in their nursery which became the launch pad for burgeoning sponge farms i met someone in micronesia who was sponge farming and i saw the benefits of bringing this idea to zanzibar said christian vaterlaus as he looked out at the ocean from his jambiani office noting there are only a few sponge farms in the world the sponges he said are more resilient to a shifting climate than seaweed need less maintenance and sell at higher prices to hotels and tourists offering an eco friendly alternative to synthetic sponges the sponges also filter and feed on particles in the water and provide an alternative to overfishing easing strain on the coastal ecosystem the 13 women farming with the help of marincultures org are growing about 1 500 sponges and the charity trains about four additional women each year in a good month the farmers can sell 10 to 20 sponges for up to 20 each said vaterlaus and in the process he has seen some of the women become conservationists when people realise that farming the sea is more sustainable than overfishing it the sea is seen as a friend that provides you with a living and it is important to protect it he said but maintaining demand has been tricky he added especially when covid 19 hit slashing the number of tourists to the island the sponges are only sold locally for now to minimise costs and push a larger share of the revenue to the women farmers said vaterlaus rebalancing ecosystems a walk through jambiani s shallow ocean water during low tide reveals ubiquitous dark spiky sea urchins which feed off coral algae speckling the ocean floor these are over populating as our fish species which eat and control the urchins become more threatened said okala the local conservationist carefully watching his step to avoid standing on one of the prickly invertebrates in small numbers the urchins are essential to coral health in excess they can inhibit coral growth he explained the balance has been upset if we keep fishing to feed our stomachs today we will have nothing left tomorrow he said aware of this looming risk marinecultures org is also focusing on coral reef rehabilitation and efforts to regulate fishing zones and use techniques that give certain species like octopus a chance to recover but such initiatives only work in the right conditions the sponges for example do not grow in the south of the island possibly because sea temperatures there are cooler vaterlaus said but his charity is expanding sponge farming into environments similar to jambiani in both madagascar and tunisia we don t really understand what is coming when it comes to climatic changes but we have to be optimistic and we need to try to adapt now while we still have a chance he

senior officials in charge of foreign policy in the biden administration have spent 2021 seeking to return america to activism in multilateral institutions and to restore its global reputation as a leader and its image as both competent and reliable after the hapless chest thumping of the previous administration unhappily the first year has not been kind to their efforts or their president i say this as someone who was a colleague of many of these officials when i chaired the national intelligence council during the obama administration and who admires them they had bad luck with afghanistan not least inheriting the trump agreement with the taliban in 2020 promising a complete withdrawal of u s troops it was little more than a fig leaf covering surrender advertisement but the u s also had bad execution the administration was pressured by the afghan government to avoid taking action that would bespeak departure yet the u s still should have done much more than it did to prepare for the withdrawal by the end of august especially to get out the afghans who had worked with us the military usually excels at quickly moving people but in this case it did not if we were given a do over we might have kept the bagram air base open in afghanistan even if it meant temporarily deploying more troops to defend it i was also surprised after we saw the iraqi army evaporate in the fall of mosul in 2014 that my former colleagues in intelligence didn t at least warn of the strong possibility that the endgame in afghanistan might play out in days or weeks not months or years my years in intelligence have left me skeptical of assessments that are too convenient such as the one suggesting the afghan regime could hold on for months the biden team is experienced and able and that is a welcome relief yet they are also card carrying members of the foreign policy establishment what ben rhodes who was a deputy national security advisor to president obama calls the blob and which probably also includes me i sometimes have the impression they think this is still 1992 when the u s was having a unipolar moment as the global superpower the world has changed this is not a time when we should be lecturing chinese diplomats as secretary of state antony j blinken did in march in anchorage no matter how much they deserve it or respond in kind with lectures of their own nor can u s leadership be assumed it has to be earned issue by issue and decision by decision on that score conniving with london to sell australia british nuclear submarines rather than the french models they had ordered and to do so with no prior warning to france was a gaffe which neither a president biden apology nor a visit to paris in early november by vice president kamala harris could erase traditional allies are bound to hedge their bets having witnessed the america first trumpism once they know our politics well enough to know it could happen again advertisement there is more foreign policy continuity between biden and former president trump than i expected biden reversed two of three trump withdrawals taking the country back into the paris climate agreement and the world health organization but what is more arresting is that he did not rejoin the trans pacific partnership that should have been a natural for it is the perfect vehicle for doing what the trump administration sought but failed to do make progress in curbing the various ways china appropriates intellectual property which includes requiring foreign businesses to share their technology in exchange for market access and many reports of outright theft the first rounds of trump tariffs may have gotten china s attention but the follow up was negative rather than rallying countries in europe and elsewhere that share the same grievance against china the trump administration levied tariffs on those would be partners as well apparently for reasons unconnected to china yet the fact that the biden administration has made nary a peep about rejoining the trans pacific partnership underscores the constraints now that trade agreements have become dirty words across the political spectrum russia s massing of troops on ukraine s border which began in november will test the administration it stands in testimony to the fact that a declining power can still be locally preeminent militarily and to the risk that the biden administration could simultaneously face crises in europe and asia never mind that if the foreign policy establishmentarians seem to think it s still 1992 russian president vladimir putin seems to think it s still 900 by harking back to kievan rus a medieval state that some say was the precursor to the modern states of ukraine russia and belarus putin is asserting that russians and ukrainians are one people it may be an acceptable historical reference but it is an unwise strategy for it only offends ukrainians and drives them further toward the european union and the north atlantic treaty organization china plainly is the center of american foreign policy and on that score too there seems more continuity than strategy the biden administration did not move to rescind the trump tariffs but applied punitive measures of its own such as delisting chinese companies from u s stock exchanges and not sending officials to the olympics in china advertisement while the administration obviously understands that if humanity is to survive we must cooperate with china in addressing the climate crisis otherwise the new cold war mentality that appears to grip washington seems to include the administration as well that is a very unhelpful frame more 1962 than 2022 for not only does it narrow the scope for cooperation with china it also downplays the economic importance of the two countries to each other political calculations may suggest hyping the china threat to sell measures for renewal at home that we should do even if china didn t exist such as spending more on basic research and development on critical technologies just as president eisenhower used the cold war in the 1950s to justify the national highway defense act which built the u s interstate system so that in the event of a nuclear attack people could easily evacuate cities but slogans are not strategy and on the biden administration s first year report card its approach toward china earns it an incomplete in foreign policy gregory f treverton chairman of the u s national intelligence council from 2014 to 2017 is a professor of international relations at usc and chairman of the global technopolitics forum
some commentators thought that joe biden as president would mean a keynesian turn in the us the same hopes and illusions had developed in the early days of barack obama s presidency in 2009 in both cases the election occurred when the us was going through a major crisis that might have led the government to take strong measures and depart from decades of neo liberal policies the barack obama administration could have applied measures to contain big capital including big banks and big investment funds largely responsible for the enormous crisis which had exploded in 2007 2008 moreover barack obama had promised a profound reform of the health system social security pensions and the implementation of a tax reform targetting the most affluent starting with the richest 1 pay a little more tax this did not happen joe biden had announced that he would request big corporations and the richest to pay more taxes he had promised progressive measures around health coverage and social protection as well as statutory minimum wages of 15 dollars per hour such promises made it possible for him to mobilize part of the voters who no longer cared to vote and a large section of the youth at the beginning of his mandate he nominated bernie sanders chairman of the senate budget committee which some perceived as a token of his determination to actually implement progressive measures while others including me saw in this move a way of cornering bernie sanders empty promises after almost a year of mandate we can definitely assert that the promises of a progressive turn towards more social justice have not been kept the minimum hourly wage of 15 dollars was soon abandoned it is still fixed at 7 25 dollars no measure was taken to levy new taxes on corporations and on the richest even worse the biden administration has introduced an additional measure that is favourable to wealthy households which made it possible for republican delegates to expose the measure s injustice and deviousness it increases from 10 000 to 80 000 the amount taxpayers can deduct from their federal taxes for the payment of local taxes either municipal or state taxes according to an analysis by both the non partisan tax policy center and the fiscally hawkish center for a responsible federal budget think tank 94 per cent of the benefits of increasing the salt cap to 80 000 would go to the top quintile of earners nationwide who make at least 175 000 a year with 70 per cent going to the top five per cent the loss of revenues for the treasury would amount to 275 billion per year the military budget was increased to 720 billion with the support of the republicans this is the highest military budget since the second world war in spite of the disengagement in afghanistan in terms of public works the biden administration with the republicans support voted a budget conducive to big construction companies let us not forget that the coronavirus pandemic has resulted in the highest number of dead in absolute figures in the us over 834 000 dead on 23 december 2021 yet in spite of the gravity of the crisis joe biden has so far not taken any measure that could run against the interests of pharmaceutical corporations while the government holds the main patent for the production of rnam vaccines it is not inclined to use it or allow the public sector in the us or elsewhere to use it too see the box biden protects the interests of big pharma at the expense of people s health in the north as in the south all the production is left to big pharma and the patents held by private companies are not lifted the biden administration has not offered the patent it holds to countries that might have benefited from it and are able to produce vaccines if allowed either whereas in may 2021 joe biden claimed that his administration wanted the wto to lift patents as requested by over 100 countries of the south he has not done anything to support this measure box biden protects the interests of big pharma at the expense of people s health in the north as in the south 3 the mrna vaccines sold by pfizer us biontech germany and by moderna us which were released within less than a year partly rely on former patents among which a 2005 patent for a technology devised by the university of pennsylvania to produce a mrna that is harmless to the organism the innovative technique of stabilizing the spike protein is also a product of publicly financed research indeed the specific patent filed by the us government patent number 10 960 070 better known as the 070 patent relates to the way in which the spike protein is stabilized in the vaccine a technique that was developed by the vaccine research centre of the national institutes of health nih a us government agency according to public citizen in washington thanks to owning patent 070 the us could and can if it wanted to produce its own mrna vaccines it could also allow other countries to produce and use the patent to protect their own populations and as a goodwill gesture extend the facility to other populations in need see this extract from a public citizen press release in mid november 2020 concerning the announcement that mrna 1273 will be produced by moderna statement moderna vaccine is produced by the people this is the people s vaccine the nih s vaccine it is not merely moderna s vaccine federal scientists helped invent it and taxpayers are funding its development we have all played a role it should belong to humanity both the current administration and president elect biden have the opportunity to make this vaccine a public good that is free and available to all and help scale up global manufacturing in order to prevent medical rationing that could become a form of global vaccine apartheid 1 in this case the patent would not be infringed and the technology would be generally available in not complying with this request that comes from numerous organizations like public citizen joe biden demonstrates his support for big pharma according to public citizen public authorities starting with the governments of the richest countries could easily produce billions of doses of vaccines at a much lower cost than the payments that are being made to big pharma according to a very serious study published in may 2021 by public citizen public authorities starting with the governments of the richest countries could easily produce billions of doses of vaccines at a much lower cost than the payments that are being made to big pharma the study based on research by the imperial college london convincingly shows that the global community could set up regional hubs capable of producing eight billion mrna vaccine doses by may 2022 this would be enough to cover 80 of the population how much would it cost 9 4 billion for a pfizer biontech vaccine 5 plants 17 production lines and 1386 employees a figure to be compared with the dozens and dozens of billions of tax dollars handed out to big pharma by the states resulting only in vaccinating affluent country s populations and paying out to shareholders 1 a third vaccine dose in the north and vaccinal apartheid like the west european countries the us is organizing massive injections of a third vaccine dose a fourth one is even on its way as in the state of israel and the vaccination of children whereas the who demands that priority be given to the vaccination of the populations in countries of the south that have so far had limited access to vaccines nothing has been done either regarding the financial regulation aiming at enforcing some discipline upon big banks and other big financial companies on the contrary laxity has increased to clearly signal his orientation towards financial markets and big capital biden nominated trump appointed jerome powell for a second term as fed chair he also appointed former fed chair janet yellen as united states secretary of the treasury these are clear signs in favour of capital in early december 2021 saule omarova was supposed to take over banking regulation at the head of the office of the comptroller of the currency she had to resign after a destabilization campaign launched by wall street and the republicans we read in the financial times she faced a backlash from republicans and the banking industry with critics focusing on her upbringing and her career as an academic with proposals including a state run bank account system what wall street banks worry about is that i am going to be an independent strong minded regulator who is not one of them who is not beholden to them she told the ft actually next to predictable attacks from republicans she was also battered by some democrat delegates who are just as closely tied to capital as their colleagues biden had promised to have an ambitious programme of expenditure adopted towards more social justice and the protection of the environment called build back better or bbb the programme should have been adopted along with the big plan for spending in public works big capital is fond of but eventually biden and nancy pelosi speaker of the us house of representatives let the two votes be dissociated a separation that was not accepted by the left wing of the democratic party the public works plan was adopted with the support of the republicans and in spite of the opposition of six left wing democrats including alexandria ocasio cortez on the other hand the build back better programme has been sabotaged by the right wing of the democratic party and will most likely be abandoned this jilting of the build back better programme shows the true nature of the biden administration s policy which is at large in economic and social terms a continuation of that of republican presidents whether g w bush or d trump back in 1891 friedrich engels in his postscript to karl marx s texts on the paris commune de paris had accurately described the political system in the us as dominated by the democratic and republican parties that take turns in power and stand up for the capitalist order see box below friedrich engels on the political system in the us nowhere do politicians form a more separate and powerful section of the nation than precisely in north america there each of the two major parties which alternately succeed each other in power is itself in turn controlled by people who make a business of politics who speculate on seats in the legislative assemblies of the union as well as of the separate states or who make a living by carrying on agitation for their party and on its victory are rewarded with positions it is well known how the americans have been trying for thirty years to shake off this yoke which has become intolerable and how in spite of it all they continue to sink ever deeper in this swamp of corruption it is precisely in america that we see best how there takes place this process of the state power making itself independent in relation to society whose mere instrument it was originally intended to be here there exists no dynasty no nobility no standing army beyond the few men keeping watch on the indians no bureaucracy with permanent posts or the right to pensions and nevertheless we find here two great gangs of political speculators who alternately take possession of the state power and exploit it by the most corrupt means and for the most corrupt ends and the nation is powerless against these two great cartels of politicians who are ostensibly its servants but in reality dominate and plunder it source postscript to karl marx the civil war in france 1871 1891 in spite of all its well intentioned discourse the biden administration has not taken any real measure to control access to firearms either while the number of homicides is rising sharply 30 increase by 2021 400 million firearms are in circulation in the us the biden administration has not taken any measure to defend the federal legislation that decriminalizes abortion in spite of states like texas adopting very repressive laws against abortion it merely expressed its disagreement while some states including once again texas decided to change election laws to limit the exercise of voting rights by the working classes and especially their racialized layers the biden administration did nothing the biden administration does not fare any better than that of donald trump as far as migrants rights and the reception of refugees are concerned in september 2021 daniel foote the us envoy for haiti resigned to protest against inhuman deportations by the united states of thousands of haitian migrants his resignation was a hard blow for joe biden his policy of massive extradition of haitian migrants back to their country is publicly exposed by his own envoy in terms of international politics the current administration continues and confirms trump s policies on central issues such as total support of the israeli government and an aggressive stance towards cuba and venezuela a new york times report recently revealed that the use of drones in syria iraq and afghanistan had officially killed over 1 400 civilians the actual figure is likely to be much higher in this respect the biden administration merely continues trump s policy at the end of august 2021 10 civilians were killed in kabul by a drone strike but it had been decided in the bombing did not violate the laws of war and was not caused by the misconduct or criminal negligence defense department chief spokesman john f kirby explained the biden administration also supports marshall al sisi s military regime as it provides around 1 3 billion in foreign assistance annually similarly biden maintains friendly relationships with the saudi ultra reactionary regime the us re joining the paris climate agreement and resuming negotiations about nuclear production in iran do not pen on to strong measures on the contrary biden recently increased subsidies for oil and gas mining in the us to ensure higher volumes of extraction as the us does not concede anything substantial to iran the situation can only deteriorate how can the absence of a keynesian turn be accounted for the key to any significant turn is the state of the class struggle popular classes and salaried workers in particular have failed to increase their level of organization and their capacity to act this is a major difference with the 1930s when the workers movement was expanding with a wave of strikes and factory occupations especially in the car industry radical unions and socialist ideas enjoyed wide support the ussr was a pole of attraction since its planning and public control of the means of production was perceived as a better solution than laissez faire capitalism to complete the picture it should be added that in 2020 2021 the government whether trump s or biden s has massively oiled the wheels by paying large indemnities to the working classes and by deferring the payment of a significant part of the debts mortgage debts student debts rent debts poverty has regressed in 2020 and in 2021 thanks to various kinds of social aids this has played a real role as a social buffer the working classes have not been forced into action certainly some sectors have mobilized and in some cases have won but this is far from representing a groundswell the social measures taken by trump and then by biden are not structural they do not offer new rights and they are not long term measures the adoption of build back better programme could have generated the impression of some social progress but clearly even in the best of cases it would be very limited this shows that we have not entered a new keynesian cycle in which the government and the capitalist class would be forced to make significant concessions to the popular classes who in turn would register an improvement in their social rights and a significant increase in their salaries the capitalist class is still getting richer even if the rate of profit has seen better days and if a large part of the accumulated capital is fictive and could collapse like a house of cards in case of another financial crisis inequalities further increase with a greater concentration of wealth in the hands of the top 1 the debt issue in the third term of 2021 the us public debt was 28 000 billion or 125 of the country s gdp whether post 2008 in order to face the financial crisis or from 2020 faced with the crisis resulting from the coronavirus pandemic the us leaders resorted to adding on to their public debt there was no crisis tax levied on big capital so far the increase in public debt has not really been noticed because interest rates are close to zero the current interest rate on public debt is actually even negative since inflation is over 5 the fed will gradually increase interest rates but there will be no serious problems in the short or medium term in the us the volume of public debt will further increase without resulting in any strong disturbance household debts among the popular classes have increased over the last ten years but social aids in the form of cheques sent by the government in 2020 2021 have temporarily relieved the burden of repayment moreover both the trump and the biden administrations temporarily suspended the repayment of a number of debts some mortgages student debts some rent debts too not forgetting the debts owed by small enterprises but these measures will come to an end and the situation will become tense some deadlines are known may 2022 for student debts which amount to more than 1 600 billion bernie sanders and alexandria ocasio cortez demand total cancellation movements claiming cancellation are currently multiplying the unfair claim of debts from the popular classes will become more significant in the coming years with regard to students debts barack obama had achieved some partial cancellations the cost of which was borne by taxpayers and not by creditors it is possible that biden will do as much it will depend on mobilizations the developments need to be followed the debt owed by big private companies sharply increased over the past years in case of an increase in interest rates some might go bankrupt and another financial crisis might break out conclusions beyond its announcements and unfulfilled promises the policy of the biden administration mostly extends the offensive of capital against the working classes no social turn has actually started which could break with 40 years of neo liberal policies no left minded citizen will ever regret trump but we should not entertain illusions about biden either there are serious limitations biden and the democratic party have disappointed the members of the popular classes who had supported them against trump and the republican candidates in the fall of 2020 in the course of 2021 in several by elections this disenchantment was expressed at the ballot boxes and the republicans strengthened their position the october 2022 mid term elections are likely to result in the democrats losing their majority in parliament and the senate which will strengthen the trend making possible a republican victory in the 2024 presidential election will the left wing of the democratic party and the left outside of it be able to find the way to get stronger and break away from the bipartisan system described by engels 130 years ago this is a big historical question will the popular movement in the us which has experienced strong moments such as black lives matter or feminist mobilizations be able to consolidate will labour counter capital will the youth fight in other struggles after black lives matter on the environment debts answers to such questions are wide open and of the utmost significance for the world 24 december 2021 translated by christine pagnoulle for cadtm
the year started with an attack on the u s capitol that was influenced by a falsehood that joe biden had stolen the presidential election from former president donald trump from there fact checkers for politifact north carolina followed the comments of elected officials incumbents and newcomers on everything from the insurrection and the biden administration to covid 19 and newly approved vaccines in a year that started and ended in a pandemic it may be no surprise that claims related to health and healthcare account for most of politifact north carolina s top stories of the year let s count down the five fact checks that generated the most interest on wral com 5 hudson s claim about the afghanistan pullout president biden s decision to pull u s troops out of afghanistan in august prompted almost immediate backlash from republicans who claimed the withdrawal was too hasty u s rep richard hudson r nc 8th district is among biden s critics he posted an image to facebook on sept 1 that said the taliban s new arsenal included 33 black hawk helicopters the caption added thanks to president biden the taliban now has more black hawk helicopters than 85 of countries in the world hudson s claim about the taliban s new arsenal was based on a report published before the last troops left afghanistan on aug 30 his claim about the taliban s stock of black hawks compared to other countries appears to be accurate however he left out the context that only 29 of the world s 195 nations have a black hawk helicopters at all we rated his claim half true 4 jackson s claim about north carolina hospitals state sen jeff jackson d mecklenburg says he traveled to each of north carolina s 100 counties as part of his now discontinued campaign for u s senate jackson recently ended his campaign before he dropped out he participated in a forum for democratic u s senate candidates in greensboro and said the five most endangered hospitals in the country are all in our state a firm that analyzes hospital data found in 2020 that six north carolina hospitals were among 216 of the nation s most vulnerable financially speaking however the report didn t rank the hospital in terms of most endangered and politifact nc found no data suggesting north carolina s rural hospitals were in worse condition than those in other states jackson acknowledged that he misspoke and we rated his claim mostly false 3 nickel s claim about medical marijuana when state lawmakers were in raleigh this summer for the recent legislative session some pushed for a bill that would allow physicians to prescribe marijuana for some medical issues ahead of a committee meeting about the bill state sen wiley nickel d wake claimed that most north carolinians support medicinal marijuana nickel who s now running for congress in the newly drawn 6th congressional district tweeted even though over 75 of the state supports medical marijuana we still have an uphill battle for final passage in the republican controlled legislature we found nickel s claim to be exaggerated support for medical marijuana surpassed 75 in only one of the four polls we found dating back to 2015 that said each of the four polls showed support for medicinal marijuana around 70 or higher so he wasn t too far off we rated his claim half true 2 cooper s claim about north carolina covid 19 stats before the delta and omicron variants caused covid 19 cases to surge in north carolina gov roy cooper said his state had done an exceptional job of preventing deaths and job losses during the pandemic during an aug 4 press conference cooper said several months ago an analysis showed that in states across the country north carolina during this pandemic had among the lowest covid related deaths as well as job losses per capita a study published in april analyzed statistics from the u s centers for disease control and prevention and the u s department of labor to compare job losses and covid 19 deaths in each state north carolina was indeed one of only a few states where both death and job loss rates were well below the national average more recent data published closer to the date cooper spoke in august found north carolina s death and job loss stats weren t among the absolute lowest but were still relatively low we rated cooper s claim mostly true 1 walker s claim about biden and epi pens biden had been in the oval office for less than three days when former north carolina u s rep mark walker in a tweet accused the president of raising the prices of insulin and epipens on those with high costs and the uninsured walker is running for burr s u s senate seat and is in a competitive race with former gov pat mccrory and u s rep ted budd r nc in his tweet on jan 22 walker was referring to the biden administration s decision to freeze president trump s executive order requiring community health centers specifically to give the lowest price possible for insulin and injectable epinephrine to their low income and uninsured patients experts said the health centers were already providing the discounts and the u s health resources and services administration said trump s order would have

chris flook special to the star press i love a good holiday such observances do much to mark the passage of time like some perennial metronome ticking away the years gone by holidays also transcend generations i don t always know how my ancestors celebrated christmas but i m confident many did in some peculiar way knowing this links me to the strangers that fill my family tree americans have long loved the idea of progress always rolling forward into something new but a lasting holiday at least for me fastens us down onto the great wheel of time some holiday traditions change over the years while others remain timeless if we were say transported back to the christmas of 1929 we d find many munsonians preparing for the day in familiar ways then as now gift giving was a major part of the christmas season in the weeks leading up to the holiday merchants filled the local newspapers with gift ads for example anspach s the bargain spot of muncie at 116 s walnut st offered deep discounts for last minute shoppers including 1 men s outing pajamas and 1 19 ladies gift slippers the doll that little sister has been asking santa to bring her would cost a whopping 4 95 while an air rifle would set the jolly elf back 79 cents the meyer s drug store at the corner of jackson and walnut advertised several gift suggestions including 200 cigarettes for 1 19 and a five pound box of chocolate for 1 98 just like today munsonians made a concerted effort to feast on christmas day the city s grocers happily provided the season s accoutrement the kroger grocery at 309 e main was selling dressed turkeys for 37 cents a pound and geese for 30 cents a pound the ideal fish market at 106 w charles was open late on christmas eve offering fresh oysters and plenty of rabbits for the more adventurous yuletide eaters at the delaware county jail a pig was carefully prepared with an apple in his mouth and ready to be roasted for those behind bars munsonians were also charitable that holiday though the depths of the great depression were still some years away the previous october s stock market crash had set off a chain of events leading to layoffs the muncie evening press reported on christmas day that even though the volume of business has not been great this year due to the fact that so many factory employees have been out of work recently muncie s citizenry has responded to the call of the poor the muncie fire department delivered 75 baskets of food to the needy while the salvation army delivered 200 across the magic city muncie s social service bureau gave the names of 150 impoverished families to generous citizens who wish to provide baskets of food and other gifts more bygone muncie the murder of elmer hamilton the local newspapers also reported an increase in crime that season on christmas eve an armed bandit held up several motorists on burlington drive absconding with about 20 on the same day someone named victor peanut templin was found guilty of violating the volstead act apparently peanut was arrested the previous july for selling a large quantity of canadian beer and other brews at a stand near inlow springs his accomplice was i swear i m not making these names up luke ribs wilmuth for the faithful st john s universalist st lawrence catholic and first presbyterian offered services on christmas eve at calvary baptist a special vigil program was held featuring a cantata entitled mrs santa claus and the christmas dolls for those seeking a more secular way to celebrate the holiday the city s theaters offered an assortment of entertainment the rivoli screened two films pointed heels and joan crawford s untamed the vaudelle offered munsonians the drag while the wysor grand featured shanghai lady and song of love the liberty then known more for vaudeville featured a live act of dancing black bears unimaginatively titled captain andrews troupe of four performing bears muncie was also undergoing a political transformation that holiday season the municipal election in november saw an epic turnout of munsonians who voted out republicans i m guessing this was a response to the crash the democratic sweep of city government certainly foreshadowed the landslide national elections of 1930 and 1932 george dale beat robert barnes for mayor with 8 727 votes barnes polled 7 378 the democrats also won the city clerk office city judge and the majority of the city council seats the outgoing mayor john hampton apparently phoned dale the day before christmas eve to discuss the transition of administrations hampton caught the mayor elect with a bad headache and joked i don t wonder you have a headache george about this time four years ago i developed a rather annoying headache myself because so many persons were after me for jobs i want to tell you however that i am not asking you for a job despite the realities of political and economic life munsonians woke to a white christmas in 1929 in the week leading up to the festive day successive storms had buried much of east central indiana under a heavy blanket of snow two days before christmas the muncie morning star reported that auto traffic over the roads and downtown streets was progressing with difficulty there has been no effort made to clear the streets a day later the skies dumped several more inches causing 16 car accidents around the city on the afternoon of christmas eve 100 workers armed with snow shovels began the task of removing snow and ice from streets in the uptown district drifting snow had also wrecked train and interurban schedules causing widespread travel and shipping delays emory niday muncie s assistant postmaster reported that the christmas mail season this year was perhaps the largest in the history of the city the waylaid trains delayed the delivery of many parcels until after christmas ninety two years later we find ourselves again celebrating another christmas season under a cloud of uncertainty though our problems in 2021 vastly differ from those faced by our forebears in 1929 we can perhaps take solace in the fact that good food gift giving family charity and faith remain steadfast traditions of the christmas season i hope our successors in 2113 will look back at the holidays of our own age and recognize the same for those that celebrate have a merry christmas chris flook is a board member of the delaware

these growth stocks are now a bargain new year new you new portfolio additions as we get ready to turn the page on 2021 i can t help but note how we ve witnessed a pretty substantial market bifurcation in stocks over the past couple of quarters even though the broad market indexes have hit all time highs many growth stocks and small cap plays have entered bear market territory in other words plenty of opportunity abounds even with the major indexes near a record high a number of stocks on my watch list that i ve not owned before are getting awfully close to levels where i may not be able to resist buying below are four stocks that i believe are likely to find their way into my portfolio in 2022 nio a year ago i was completely against electric vehicle ev manufacturer nio nio 7 85 the idea that an unproven automaker kicking out around 20 000 evs annually could command a 90 billion market cap was so ludicrous that i never thought i d consider buying it and yet here we are roughly one year later i can say that i am thoroughly impressed with the way nio s management has ramped up production in the wake of pandemic supply issues and higher inflation i believe the company s innovation will drive market share gains in china for years to come in terms of production nio delivered close to 10 900 evs in november which puts it on an extrapolated run rate pace of 130 000 evs a year by the end of next year the company anticipates an annual run rate of 600 000 evs with nio introducing three new evs next year as well as organically growing sales for its existing lineup of suvs and its crossover ev it could put tesla motors ramp up to shame i m particularly impressed with nio s battery as a service baas program with baas buyers receive a discount on the initial purchase price of their vehicles and are able to charge swap and upgrade their batteries over time the benefit for nio is improved customer loyalty to the brand and high margin fee revenue for years after purchase if there s a pure play ev maker that has my full and undivided attention it s nio cresco labs in a market where most growth stocks are still valued at substantive premiums some of the best deals can be found in the cannabis space marijuana stock cresco labs crlbf 6 98 is one such name that i believe i ll pull the trigger on in 2022 to address the elephant in the room anytime pot stocks are discussed federal legalization would be nice but it isn t necessary for weed stocks to thrive with 36 states having legalized cannabis in some capacity and the federal government allowing individual states to regulate their industries there s a sizable path for marijuana stocks like cresco labs to succeed like virtually all multi state operators cresco labs is working on building up its retail presence recently opening its 45th location nationwide however it s primarily focused on pushing into big dollar limited license markets such as illinois and ohio markets where regulators purposely limit the number of retail licenses issued ensure that cresco has a fair shot at building up its brand s and garnering a loyal following but the best thing about cresco labs is its industry leading wholesale segment wall street often writes off wholesale cannabis for its poor margins but when we re talking about a company like cresco which holds a cannabis distribution license in california the biggest pot market in the world volume makes up for any margin concerns novavax another high growth company i m eyeing that i expect to add to my portfolio at some point in 2022 is biotech stock novavax nvax 0 47 somewhat similar to nio i was of the opinion that chasing covid 19 vaccine stocks at the beginning of 2021 would be a poor move in many instances i felt covid 19 stocks were grossly overpriced especially not knowing enough about the disease and its variants after another year of digesting data i m ready to crown novavax as the most attractive covid 19 play as some of you might already know novavax absolutely dazzled with its clinical trial data for nvx cov2373 a march released u k study and a june announced u s mexico trial demonstrated respective vaccine efficacy ve of 89 7 and 90 4 this makes novavax one of three covid 19 vaccine producers to hit a 90 ve level which should allow it to become a key player globally the only reason novavax s share price didn t blast off into the heavens has been its delays in filing for emergency use authorization in key markets and production delays thankfully these issues are being pushed into the rearview mirror and countries are beginning to give novavax a green light what s more variants of the disease make it likely that covid 19 becomes endemic this suggests novavax could be a winner from initial inoculations booster shots and possibly even combination vaccines with influenza which the company is developing and testing ping identity holdings the fourth and final new stock that i ll likely add to my portfolio in 2022 is cybersecurity play ping identity ping there are no shortage of double digit growth trends investors can put their money to work in right now but i believe the safest double digit growth trend throughout the decade is going to be cybersecurity it s evolved into a basic need service and more businesses than ever are moving their data and that of their customers into the cloud that s a recipe for success for third party solution providers like ping like most high performing security offerings ping s cloud based platform is leaning on artificial intelligence it s effectively becoming smarter at recognizing and responding to threats over time where ping identity can provide the greatest value is being layered atop on premises solutions ping s infrastructure fills the gaps where on premises security fails by providing continuous user monitoring verification and authorization ping identity is also making headway in its push to shift clients away from term based subscriptions to software as a service saas subscriptions the latter should result in higher long term margins and improved retention rates keep in mind that subscription gross margin is already hovering around a juicy 85 whereas most cybersecurity stocks are still valued at nosebleed sales multiples ping is profitable and can be scooped up for about six times wall street s estimated sales for 2022 that s a heck of a bargain for what should be a long term cybersecurity winner

the consumer electronics giant has an impressive history but what about its growth potential best buy bby 2 51 has one of the most impressive histories of any brick and mortar retailer when it comes to adapting its business to thrive in an e commerce world however in this fool live video clip recorded on dec 13 fool com contributor matt frankel discusses whether he d buy the stock now or not 10 stocks we like better than best buy when our award winning analyst team has a stock tip it can pay to listen after all the newsletter they have run for over a decade motley fool stock advisor has tripled the market they just revealed what they believe are the ten best stocks for investors to buy right now and best buy wasn t one of them that s right they think these 10 stocks are even better buys see the 10 stocks stock advisor returns as of december 16 2021 matt frankel this was best buy about 10 years ago best buy did one of the most successful business pivots of any retailer i ve seen they nailed the pivot to omnichannel they completely nailed it i don t think anyone would disagree on that remember just going to best buy over 10 years ago and how much of the floor space was taken up by dvds wasted space all over their stores they really did a great job of reducing their square footage utilizing their store better getting people in the door getting people to buy their products there with price matching guarantees because if you remember for a long time the big problem was people would go to best buy to look at things and then buy them on amazon amzn 1 54 or somewhere online where it was cheaper they really solved that problem well there are a bunch of opportunities going forward there is for example the same day delivery i live in columbia south carolina we can t get same day anything out here i had a router delivered same day delivery from my local best buy their same day delivery volume is up 400 year over year they offer twice as many products same day as they did a year ago that s a big expansion opportunity going forward which they seem to be getting right they are suffering from supply chain issues their growth recently because of that and because they were an early beneficiary of the pandemic i feel like a lot of people pre loaded their electronic spending people needed a laptop for work they bought one last year when they had to work at home they needed to upgrade their wireless infrastructure when let s just say your company starts a livestreaming platform like this one like i did they re going to get it last year best buy s sales were essentially flat year over year in the most recent quarter they are suffering from supply chain disruptions too they re having issues getting inventory i don t see this holiday quarter as being as great and they ve already warned that margins are going to drop next year as supply chain issues work out and the economy normalizes the pricing power that they have it s going to deteriorate a little bit as well they warned that they re going to have more discounts and things like that next year out of all these i see the risk reward from here not being as a great i think their pivot to omnichannel was fantastic a lot of other retailers can learn a lot of lessons from best buy
ethan pines w hat a year it s been for elon musk when the world rang in a socially distanced 2021 musk the the chief executive of both tesla and rocket company spacex was worth roughly 155 billion now almost a year later his fortune has reached unfathomable heights as of december 17 the 50 year old was worth 245 1 billion a 90 billion gain since january 1 within two years musk s fortune has jumped by 200 billion over the course of 2020 he gained more than 110 billion setting the record for the biggest one year gain of any billionaire forbes has ever tracked the primary reason tesla s stock price criticized by some for already being too high kept climbing shares are up 32 year to date through december 17 in early november musk first jumped above the previously untouched 300 billion mark making him the richest person to ever walk the planet the stock has since sunk by nearly 24 since its peak on november 4 as musk has unloaded millions of shares and tweeted with abandon about possibly quitting his job and more this was a fork in the road year for tesla with competition coming from all angles a chip shortage and stock coming off of a historic year says dan ives managing director and senior equity analyst at wedbush despite the odds tesla was able to come out smelling like roses it was a historic year at spacex too this fall the aerospace firm launched the world s first all civilian crew into orbit shares of the private company also traded hands in the secondary market at a valuation north of 100 billion up from 74 billion in february musk s stake in spacex is worth an estimated 32 million then there s everything else from selling six california mansions and moving to a 400 square foot home in texas to reportedly breaking up with his popstar partner grimes to trolling markets with outlandish tweets take a look back at some of musk s highlights from a wild 2021 regulatory trouble with china tension between musk and chinese regulators hung over tesla s stock for the first half of the year according to ives china where tesla has a factory is a lucrative market for the company accounting for about one quarter of total revenue for the first nine months of 2021 according to the company s third quarter earnings report but as beijing cracked down on domestic tech players this year it enacted strict regulations on the collection of automotive data and the ability to transfer that data out of the country that threatened to hinder tesla s r d efforts since the carmaker collects extensive user data from cameras and sensors on its vehicles to refine its self driving systems tesla also faced scrutiny after a protester at the shanghai auto show in april reportedly climbed atop a model3 and criticized a braking issue with the vehicles a turning point came in september when musk spoke at china s annual world internet conference reassuring government leaders that tesla was committed to expanding in the country we are working with regulators on finding the best solution for data security musk said at the conference pointing to a new data center that tesla set up in china to locally store personally identifiable information without transferring it across the border ives take if musk didn t play nice in the sandbox with china and turn that around he wouldn t be sitting in a position of strength nor would tesla be where it is today musk s virtual appearance at the 2021 world internet conference in china this fall marked a turning point for tesla photo by ding hongfa xinhua via getty images xinhua news agency via getty images chip shortage semiconductors are a key part in new cars powering things like infotainment systems engine management and power braking and steering supply chain woes created a shortage of these chips in 2021 hitting car makers like general motors and ford hard but ives said tesla navigated the shortage largely unscathed that s because tesla has produced its chips in house for years made with a new material technology called silicon carbide that reduces reliance on pure silicon as a result the shortage didn t hinder tesla s vehicle output goals though the company s factory in fremont california did halt production for two days in february because of what musk vaguely identified as parts shortages tesla soars above 1 trillion valuation tesla stock got a boost in october when car rental giant hertz announced it was buying 100 000 tesla vehicles to add to its rental car fleet reportedly agreeing to spend about 4 2 billion to do so following the news tesla s market capitalization smashed through 1 trillion for the first time and musk s net worth soared above 300 billion making him the richest person ever as of december 17 he s worth an estimated 245 1 billion and is still the world s richest person trailed by amazon founder jeff bezos french fashion mogul bernard arnault and microsoft founder bill gates spacex makes history as musk s wealth soared to new heights so too did his intergalactic endeavors in mid september spacex launched the world s first all civilian crew into orbit further opening the door to the fledgling space tourism industry the four person crew which included fintech billionaire jared isaacson spent three days circling the planet it was a key installment in the billionaire space race between musk jeff bezos and british billionaire richard branson though musk did not personally jet off to space this year his rivals did bezos was aboard a blueorigin rocket that launched into orbit in july about a week after branson joined a similar voyage operated by his space tourism company virgin galactic musk has also booked a ride on a future virgin galactic space jaunt though it s unclear when exactly he ll blast off in mid september spacex flew four private citizens into space on a three day mission photo by joe raedle getty images getty images stock sale bonanza on november 6 musk sent shock waves through the business world with a twitter poll flippantly asking followers if he should sell 10 of his tesla shares musk had previously sold tesla stock on only two occasions in 2010 and in 2016 two days later musk began selling shares and exercising stock options set to expire in august 2022 by december 13 he had sold nearly 13 billion worth of tesla shares forbes estimates that he could pay 8 3 billion in taxes as a result of those sales possibly making him the biggest taxpayer in the u s musk claimed on twitter that he will pay more taxes than any american in history this year it was also of course a pr move ives says of musk s twitter poll if he just started selling stock out of nowhere then the stock would ve cratered forbes calculates that musk has accumulated an estimated 4 4 billion in cash after taxes from the stock sales through december 13 betting on texas musk went all in on the lone star state in 2021 as of june he had sold six of his seven california mansions and his last remaining home was on the market his primary digs these days a roughly 400 square foot foldable prefabricated dwelling about the size of a studio apartment set up in boca chica texas where spacex produces its starship rockets after spats with california lawmakers about covid 19 safety regulations at tesla s fremont factory beginning in 2020 the billionaire announced plans to move tesla s headquarters from palo alto to austin texas at the annual shareholder s meeting in october 2021 musk took a more diplomatic approach at the meeting citing california s sky high housing costs and long commute times as the primary reasons driving the relocation the move was completed in early december though it s unclear how many tesla employees will transfer to austin or how many new jobs might be created another billionaire breakup musk s personal life took some turns as well in late september he reportedly split up with grimes the edgy grunge musician who he dated for about three years just a few weeks after they attended the star studded met gala together the couple welcomed a son named x æ a xii musk into the world in may 2020 musk and his pop star partner grimes reportedly split this year photo by theo wargo getty images for huffington post getty images for huffington post new year s resolutions the holiday season typically begets billionaire philanthropy but giving doesn t seem to be a priority for the world s richest person this year musk signed the giving pledge a promise to donate at least half his fortune to charitable causes nearly a decade ago forbes estimates that so far musk has donated less than 1 of his fortune to charitable causes ives predicts that 2022 will bring further electric vehicle adoption and heightened competition so tesla will be laser focused on ramping up production capacity at its key berlin and austin texas factories tesla could ramp up overall output to two million cars per year up from about one million currently ives asserts as a comparison toyota gm and ford each sell more than four million vehicles annually though just a fraction are electric vehicles we re really seeing an arms race play out says ives tesla is years ahead from a battery technology perspective but there s a target on tesla s back that should make 2022 another interesting year for musk if he doesn t cash in his chips on december 9 he tweeted that he was thinking of quitting jobs becoming an influencer full time of course the world s richest person has billions of reasons to stick around besides his passion for changing the world musk s tesla pay package includes another 36 million options worth nearly 32 billion if he can keep the company s investors happy and the stock price up amid forces greater than he can control

the end of the year provides a good opportunity for reflection the past 12 months brought plenty of opportunities to make financial strides and plenty of potholes and challenges a lot of americans struggled with money issues but others flourished whether your final ledger for 2021 puts you in the plus or minus column these practices and behaviors can help going forward especially if resurfacing pandemic pressures pose new money obstacles in the new year 1 build up that emergency fund it s a fairly straightforward tip but many americans still haven t achieved it amass enough money in reserve to meet unexpected job or other financial demands in a recent survey by the transamerica center for retirement studies 43 of respondents said they suffered one or more negative employment jolts such as a job loss furlough reduced hours reduced pay or unexpectedly early retirement all that s in addition to nonwork financial stresses ranging from an air conditioner breakdown or an unexpected hospitalization to someone stealing the catalytic converter off your car consequences of not having an emergency fund can include reliance on expensive short term check cashing services or needing to make premature withdrawals from retirement accounts if you have had difficulty saving before it might be better to focus on simply getting started and not worrying about how much you ultimately need to amass like a journey of 1 000 miles starting with that first step the initial goal here is to begin with the first dollar 50 or 100 and to keep adding to it over time ultimately you will want to compile enough money to cover at least three months of routine expenses though a six month reserve would put you on sounder footing your reserve should be stashed in a liquid vehicle such as a bank savings account or money market mutual fund not an investment account that could trigger transaction fees or taxable gains if you needed to access it frequently higher mortgage rates are coming what could it mean for homebuyers 2 stay ahead of student loan debt the federal student loan deferment period was set to end jan 31 but recently was extended to may 1 whenever it ends plenty of borrowers might need to take action to stave off financial problems in a new report by bankrate com and bestcolleges com 69 of borrowers anticipated needing to take action to afford the monthly payment also 75 said the resumption of payments in february will negatively affect their finances actions borrowers said they might need to take include cutting back on spending cited by 32 finding a higher paying primary job 26 taking on a second job or side hustle 25 selling personal belongings 19 finding cheaper living arrangements 15 and borrowing elsewhere such as from family members or friends 13 consequences could include having less money to save or less money to spend along with increased difficulty in paying other debts just 36 of respondents said they continued to repay their student loan debts during the deferment period and many of these people said they paid less than normal profit during inflation these 5 tips could help investors beat rising prices 3 take advantage of tax incentives it goes without saying that everyone wants to minimize taxes but do investors take advantage of tax sheltered strategies and vehicles to the extent possible no for reasons ranging from a lack of funds to a lack of knowledge many people don t use available incentives for example most workers don t max out contributions to workplace 401 k plans and many don t even contribute enough to receive full employer matches as for individual retirement accounts only about 1 in 10 account holders contributes money in a given year even though many more are eligible health savings accounts typically offered as a workplace benefit are another example these accounts potentially offer three tax advantages contributions go in on a tax sheltered basis account earnings grow tax deferred and the money comes out tax free if used to pay for any of a multitude of qualifying medical expenses to use an hsa optimally account holders should maximize their contributions invest in stock funds or other growth investments rather than cash and avoid withdrawing prematurely as much as possible according to the employee benefit research institute but the group contends relatively few people follow all three suggestions it has called on employers to explain hsa benefits more effectively so workers can better take advantage of them buying a home in 2022 after a year of bidding wars and record high prices here s what s changing 4 keep things in balance the past two years were anything but routine for stock market investors early 2020 was marked by one of the sharpest but shortest declines ever followed by a steady powerful rebound now the market is struggling again it s a good time to focus on sticking to a long term investment plan and rebalancing can help that is the idea of making gradual adjustments to keep a portfolio roughly in line with how you set it up and want it to stay suppose your long term goal is to hold 60 of your assets in stocks stock funds and the rest in bonds cash now after a stretch of mostly strong gains for stocks and sluggish fixed income results suppose the mix is 70 30 if so you can rebalance by trimming your stock positions and investing the proceeds in bonds or cash to get back to a 60 40 mix you can also make other rebalancing changes such as diverting some u s stock holdings into foreign markets rebalancing can help keep your portfolio from becoming too risky after long rallies and it forces you to buy back in after slumps it s thus a way to buy low and sell high there s no set formula for rebalancing you can do it once a year or after your portfolio mix moves out of alignment by perhaps five percentage points it s easier to do in tax sheltered vehicles such as workplace 401 k plans in unsheltered accounts rebalancing can trigger taxable gains or losses while rebalancing makes sense many investors are reluctant to do it when stocks or other assets are surging greed sets in and many people don t like to take profits when stocks are sliding investors grow fearful of committing more cash but as it s difficult to predict market turning points especially with emotions in the way rebalancing is a discipline that can keep you on track save better spend better money tips and advice delivered right to your inbox sign up here reach the reporter at russ wiles arizonarepublic com
on the 27th june 1969 as part of its policy of raiding and closing gay bars the new york police arrived at the stonewall inn to rough up the customers and make a few arrests new york s finest encountered black and white drag queens gay men and lesbians sick of police brutality and who on being physically provoked fought back the fighting spread out of the doors and onto the streets and as police reinforcements were called in became a riot that spread throughout the west village and continued for three nights in a row on the 4th july lesbians and gay men from the matachine society new york in response to the riots staged a walk out and moved to the alternative university in greenwich village where they founded what became the gay liberation front aubrey walter and bob mellor founded the gay liberation front in london on 13th october 1970 at the l s e where bob was a student aubrey and bob had independently been hanging out in new york glf that summer and met for the first time at the revolutionary peoples constitutional convention in philadelphia called by the black panther party not only did liberationists go to philadelphia to show solidarity with the black movement but it was there that huey newton as leader of the panthers first gave clear support of the gay cause saying that homosexuals were maybe the most oppressed people of american society and could well be the most revolutionary aubrey also visited san francisco where i met konstantin berlandt who had dragged up in a red sequin dress and long blonde wig to disrupt the american psychiatrists convention and i stayed in his commune the stuff around the convention was seminal and it s important to remember that most of the ideology of glf came from the west coast groups not from new york on 13th november glf made the first ever public demonstration in the uk by lesbians and gay men at highbury fields islington to protest the use of pretty policemen agent provocateurs used by the police to entrap gay men into attempting acts of gross indecency a standard police practice and an easy way for them to increase the figures for crime detection and prosecution a media group was established which produced the glf newspaper come together which ran to sixteen editions an anti psychiatry group focused on analysing and attacking the psychiatric establishments wholesale acceptance of judeo christian prejudice biblical authority and the use of electric shock emetic drug programmes on gays and lesbians who did not fit in or who were found guilty of breaking the law also formed were a women s group a street theatre group a communes group the youth group for the under 21s fighting for a reduction in the age of consent an action group organising public glf dances held in local town halls and later the gay days in the parks an office collective and the steering group later the co ordinating committee to run the wednesday night general meetings in december the glf demands principles were agreed on and in october of 71 the publication of the glf manifesto gay shows the way in some ways we are already outside the family and we have already in part at least rejected the masculine or feminine role society has designed for us in a society dominated by the sexist culture it is very difficult if not impossible for heterosexual men and women to escape their rigid gender role structuring and the roles of oppressor and oppressed but gay men don t need to oppress women in order to fulfil their own psycho sexual needs and gay women don t have to relate sexually to the male oppressor so that at this moment in time the freest and most equal relationships are most likely to be between homosexuals in all about a hundred gay men and lesbians were active in the various glf groups while by mid january 71 there were up to five hundred people a week attending the general meeting which suggests that many thousands of gay men and lesbians passed through the doors think ins the first of which was held in january established the structure or deliberate lack of structure and the aims of the movement there were three rules made 1 no one could serve on the steering committee for more than two months 2 heterosexuals could not serve on the steering committee 3 no one could serve on the office collective for more than three months glf marched with the protest against the industrial relations bill and later with the anti internment in northern ireland demos relegated by trade unionists and the straight left to the back of the marches the women demonstrated against the anti gay lib policy of the gateways club and red lesbians attacked the stock exchange there was a long campaign against pan books publishers of dr david reuben s book everything you wanted to know about sex but were afraid to ask which claimed to tell candid facts whilst avoiding moral judgement and in the sections on gays and lesbians contained references to light bulbs cucumbers and the use of wire coat hangers for abortions another major campaign resulted in the defeat of the fundamentalist christian group the festival of light which disbanded after its inaugural rally was completely disrupted with the help of the counter culture readers of the underground press led and organised by glf when glf moved to all saints church hall notting hill police warned pub landlords in the area not to serve anyone wearing a glf badge this led to confrontations with the police and a successful campaign of sit ins involving the police having to individually read people their rights before individually lifting them up and depositing them outside the public house the police ceased their harassment in august there was a gay day in hyde park followed by a march to trafalgar square led by the ginger baker band and organised by the youth group in july 72 the first gay pride march left trafalgar square and marched to hyde park for the gay pride party with over a thousand in attendance and accompanied by two thousand police consistent demonstrations against the psychiatric establishment and raids on their conferences where glf took over the agenda eventually lead to the overthrow of the idea that homosexuality was a medical condition the women s group after many attempts and rebuffs in trying to join women s liberation in october 71 attended the women s liberation national co ordinating conference in skegness the glf lesbians were told by the male dominated wing of women s lib that they were a bourgeois deviation the glf women seized the microphone and led a grass roots revolt that transformed the whole conference and finally placed lesbianism on the agenda of feminists at the end of 71 serious splits were occurring between the men who saw coming out as only the first step in the transformation of gay men and the second the confrontation with the social ideals of masculinity and sexism whilst following the manifesto aim of moving toward communal living they had also turned up the volume by appearing in drag as men in frock and being unmistakably gay opposing them were the men who ignored the manifesto refused to acknowledge their heterosexist qualities were learning to campaign on single issues but needed as straight men do an organised structure in which to operate one that gay lib was deliberately designed not to provide these gay men were not interested in communal works but in promoting their individual selves on the back of issues and campaigns that glf either pursued or generated in its opponents they were known as the straight gays in november 71 camden glf was formed in response to the large unwieldy numbers and the cruising going on at the wednesday meetings and also as a process of localising glf and bringing awareness into the local community as a whole this new trend produced east london south london and notting hill glf groups in february 72 the women formally split from gay lib overwhelmed in numbers and ignored by gay men generally they decided to work separately this event led to the movement becoming polarised between the two male factions in june came the first issue of gay news published by a group containing many straight gays from the glf action group and immediately laid down a format for saving the nation from the screaming red queens and faggots of gay lib the situation dominated the all london weekly general meetings to the exclusion of much else so it was changed to a monthly affair which petered out into an empty sentimental attempt to regain its former glory the office collective had been neglected and had turned into an administration by supporters of gay news and those who liked to be near the exchanges of information and money some of its members had never been to a general meeting didn t think that was of any importance nobody could obtain the date location or the correct telephone number of the weekly office collective meeting either to give out information or obtain it in october 73 the drag queens of the bethnal rouge bookshop collective put a stop to that by raiding the office and taking the files to their own premises gay news responded with lies and vitriol based on the commonplace that drag queens equals violence at the last glf think in at sussex in november 73 bethnal rouge was exonerated by glf manchester and glf leeds for putting an end to the rule of the office collective by the end of the year glf had collapsed identified and stereotyped nationally by gay news bethnal rouge in february 74 appeared by invitation at goldsmith college gay soc to give a pre disco talk they were dressed for the occasion in their best disco diva drag whilst enjoying a pre talk drink they were attacked by group 4 total security and badly beaten up whilst lewisham police were called and told by the same security guards that bethnal rouge had come to the disco to cause trouble one queen needed hospital treatment another who was head butted lost two front teeth one was arrested and later that night thrown through a glass door in the police station the rest escaped out of london glf came fahr paris and through mario mieli fuori in italy from the anti psychiatry group came icebreakers there was gay switchboard bethnal rouge the brixton faeries gay men s press from the media group and the world renowned theatre troupe bloolips from the street theatre group the campaigning groups stonewall and outrage developed from the same root one of the great legacies of glf was that when hiv aids was identified there already existed groups and networks of individuals who had been part of or been touched by the forever ongoing sexual revolution begun by the gay liberation front by the example of glf the new activists in hiv aids were able to immediately challenge the attitudes towards gays of the medical orthodoxy and quickly took over the entire culture surrounding the pandemic stuart feather footnotes

dear earthtalk has anyone figured out how to build wind farms that don t negatively impact birds bats and other wildlife does building them off shore help mary b hyannis ma as the u s tackles the issues of climate change the biden administration is investing in wind power as a key strategy for sustainably meeting the country s energy needs federal officials estimate that the u s coastline could host 30 000 megawatts of wind energy by 2030 which would be enough energy to power as many as 10 million american homes wind power is a necessary tool for fighting climate change but it can a threat to birds a 2013 study by the smithsonian conservation biology institute found wind turbines to be responsible for killing up to 328 000 birds annually in the u s alone bats another species playing a vital role in ecosystems are also seeing negative impacts by wind farms research has shown that larger migratory bats are at the greatest risk in response to these problems the federal government has allocated 13 5 million specifically earmarked to addressing the impact of windfarms on birds bats and marine species scientists are focusing their efforts on site analysis species monitoring and wildlife deterrents large birds of prey are the bird species most at risk in response some wind farm developments are incorporating new technology that can recognize eagles hawks and other raptors as they approach in enough time to pause any turbines in the flight path this tool called identiflight can detect 5 62 times more bird flights than human observers alone and with an accuracy rate of 94 percent developing the best strategies for protecting bats is a bit more of a challenge but the u s geological survey usgs is investigating migratory bat behavior with an interdisciplinary approach that will analyze migratory movements mating and feeding behaviors to determine if they can find patterns that play a role in turbine collisions locating wind farms offshore has been identified as a potential solution to species loss caused by on land wind turbines but as with any man made structure it is important to subject this potential solution to environmental impact assessments to have a clear understanding of the risks and possible benefits one study in the united kingdom found evidence that offshore wind farms could actually increase biodiversity if siting and timing of construction are chosen carefully the study describes the structures acting as artificial reefs mimicking natural habitat that can then be colonized by a diverse set of species indeed as we move towards utilizing more renewable energy efforts to mitigate impacts on wildlife and surrounding ecosystems will take on increased importance to optimize the overall benefit to humanity and the environment we depend up on to sustain us contacts bat conservation international batcon org is it possible to build wildlife friendly windfarms bbc com future article 20200302 how do wind farms affect bats birds and other wildlife white house announces plans for massive expansion of offshore wind farms huffpost com entry white house offshore wind farms_n_6167846fe4b0f26084f0178b the habit creation potential of offshore windfarms onlinelibrary wiley com doi epdf 10 1002 we 324 bat fatalities at wind turbines investigating the causes and consequences usgs gov centers fort collins science center science bat fatalities wind turbines investigating causes and earthtalk is produced by roddy scheer doug moss for the 501 c 3 nonprofit earthtalk see more at emagazine com to donate visit earthtalk org send questions to
