go to culver s right now and you can still get butterburgers crinkle cut fries and all the custard you desire but you probably can t get one popular item buffalo chicken tenders outside many culver s taped to doors and on speakers at the drive thru menu are signs that say the popular spicy item probably won t be on the menu again until the fall it s the result of a limited supply of chicken nationwide the scarcity is caused by more than just a couple factors some pandemic related some not for one there were significant die offs of chickens in texas in february during unprecedented fatal ice storms that pushed temperatures in some places far below freezing and knocked out power grids that powered heating systems due to the recent market conditions with the chicken category we are temporarily out of the buffalo tenders our team members are happy to help guests find another delicious item on our extensive menu to enjoy we sincerely apologize for the inconvenience culver s restaurants culvers june 13 2021 that reduced supply nationwide since texas has the sixth most chickens of any u s state buckets pub 2031 lathrop ave racine people gather to watch the ncaa men s basketball tournament at buckets pub on march 25 2005 on top of that labor shortages due to too low wages or too high unemployment benefits or people choosing not to work due to safety concerns related to covid 19 depending on whom you ask have led to some factories producing below expectations prices are up 55 or 60 said chuck brandt owner of buckets pub 2031 lathrop ave a restaurant that has won several best of racine contests for its chicken wings one supplier brandt said told him that an entire shift of workers at a chicken factory walked off citing covid 19 concerns as an example of the wide ranging supply chain disruptions siblings jake and alisa haman who run the family owned culver s along highway 20 near interstate 94 in yorkville and are on course to open their own co owned culver s at 4542 douglas ave caledonia before the year is out couldn t point to a clear reason why they re out of stock of buffalo chicken that comes from corporate and it happens with a range of different items jake haman said it s the distributors whatever they re going through industry leaders have been careful to not call the lack of chicken a shortage a spokesman for the national chicken council told usa today last month that there is a very tight supply but short of a shortage culver s is saying the same thing according to culver s corporate office since all chicken is in short supply right now the company decided to stop offering buffalo chicken tenders while still keeping regular chicken tenders on the menu the nation s supply of chickens is currently tight but not to the point that it could be labeled a shortage the tight supply chain includes all chicken which means wings tenders and breasts all are affected which in turn is affecting restaurants and grocery stores alike eric skrum director of public relations and communications for culver s said in an email there are a variety of factors contributing to the nationwide tightened supply including increased product demand and heavy winter storms in chicken growing areas like texas culver s continuously monitors our supply chain to ensure we meet the expectations of our guests in delivering high quality food made with the best ingredients as part of our proactive approach to supply chain management we have shifted our chicken tender supplies to meet the higher guest demand for our regular chicken tenders like brandt alisa haman said she could point the limited supply to either issues of labor shortages or distribution difficulties since the pandemic we ve had this left and right jake haman said referring to all the shortages that have occurred in the past 16 months right now it s the buffalo tenders he continued but if you go to any restaurant right now it s just a shortage added brandt it s a trickle down effect out of the coop off of menus some restaurants across the u s are taking chicken items off the menu altogether while others are raising their prices the owner of an upstate new york restaurant told fox business this week that chicken prices are up almost 100 while the cost of fryer oil is up more than 120 there are also a couple minor causes over the past few years there s been a widespread spike in demand for fried chicken sandwiches partially blamed on the boom of the chick fil a s restaurant chain it went from 500 locations in the u s in 1993 to 1 000 in 2001 and now more than 2 600 leading to competitors such as burger king and mcdonald s offering their own imitator chicken sandwiches more recently the wildly popular social media platform tiktok was used to launch a trend that caused demand for nashville hot chicken sauce from kfc and other hot sauces to skyrocket thus lowering supply of the common chicken accompaniment in photos 10 places to get wings

rebounding biodiesel demand from the european union and soaring sales to china are expected to keep prices high oilseed and vegetable oil markets are expected to remain tight in 2021 22 and that means continued high prices say international analysts the canola rapeseed market is no exception said jacob dehoust senior market analyst with archer daniels midland in germany the expectation is that rapeseed gets tighter looking ahead into 2021 22 he told delegates attending the international grains council s grains conference 2021 crusher demand from the european union is forecast to remain steady at 23 7 million tonnes he is forecasting 17 9 million tonnes of eu rapeseed production up from 17 2 million tonnes last year advertisement read also flax acres down amid hope for renewed eu interest saskatoon canadian flax growers could regain some of the market share they have lost in the european union in the weather in the eu is very favourable for rapeseed production said dehoust that means the region s canola imports will shrink somewhat to six million tonnes down from 6 4 million tonnes in 2020 21 canada supplied one third of the current year s imports however he noted that crusher demand could be much higher than forecast if eu biodiesel use returns to normal and china keeps buying huge volumes of rapeseed oil from the region eu biodiesel demand fell about 500 000 tonnes in 2020 due to covid restrictions that is one million tonnes in lost seed sales advertisement he thinks demand will fully recover in 2021 although it was off to a slow start for the first few months of the year in the meantime an entirely new source of demand suddenly emerged for eu rapeseed oil with china purchasing 450 000 tonnes of the commodity in 2020 21 up from basically nothing a couple of years ago china needs to buy oil because it is not importing nearly as much seed due to a political dispute with canada china s total canola seed imports were 3 08 million tonnes in 2020 21 down from 4 47 million tonnes two years ago if china continues to buy that much oil from the eu and biodiesel demand rebounds as anticipated then eu carryout stocks will get uncomfortably tight advertisement dehoust is also forecasting extremely tight supplies in canada for 2021 22 gustavo idigoras president of the argentine edible oil association expects continued bullish conditions in the soybean market as well driven primarily by rapidly expanding renewable diesel demand in the united states renewable diesel demand is expected to rise by 41 percent in the u s in 2021 22 and that is just the start of what is expected to be an overwhelming new source of soybean oil demand for years to come that is going to restrict u s soybean oil exports in the coming years but argentina should be able to pick up the slack the argentine government is about to implement new biofuel regulations that will result in a strong reduction in the use of vegetable oil for biodiesel production over the next 10 years advertisement that means argentina which is already by far the world s leading exporter of soybean oil supplying about half of global exports should have even more to offer starting in 2021 22 brazil is also implementing new biofuel regulations but the outcome is expected to be the polar opposite with mandates either staying the same or rising darren cooper senior economist with the international grains council said food demand for soybean oil has remained relatively stable over the past decade averaging six to 6 5 million tonnes per year advertisement however industrial demand for the commodity has been absolutely exploding and is expected to grow another 26 percent in 2021 22 largely because of the emerging u s renewable diesel demand industrial demand for the oil is expected to reach 5 5 million tonnes in 2021 22 up from about two million tonnes 10 years ago industrial demand is rapidly approaching food levels for the commodity u s soy oil exports are expected to fall to about 650 000 tonnes in 2021 22 down from double that amount a couple of years ago as well the u s will likely start importing larger volumes of the commodity the one oilseed that may experience a cooling off in prices is sunflower seeds black sea production fell by about five million tonnes in 2020 21 because of drought conditions that led to export restrictions in russia and ukraine which resulted in a doubling of sunflower oil prices production is expected to fully rebound in 2021 22 easing supply concerns andrii paladii head of vegetable oil trading with kernel company in ukraine said the country planted 17 million acres of the crop and russia more than 22 million acres this year advertisement that s a big supply he said paladii expects that to result in a big price discount for sunflower oil versus soybean and other oils he anticipates increased demand because of the reduced price svitlana synkovska regional communications manager with cotecna inspection in switzerland said ukraine and russia account for three quarters of world sunflower exports she agrees that acreage is up in the black sea region but planting was seriously delayed by cold and wet weather synkovska said summer weather will determine production levels so it is too early to start talking about a larger crop in addition she thinks black sea export restrictions could be in place

oil prices are signalling the need for an urgent increase in production from opec and u s shale companies as the global economy and oil demand recover more rapidly than expected from the pandemic futures markets are sending a strong and unambiguous message that petroleum inventories are already tight and expected to shrink further in the second half of the year and into 2022 opec countries are still restricting liquids production by more than 3 0 million barrels per day bpd compared with the pre epidemic levels to cut inventories and raise prices and u s liquids output is also down by more than 1 5 million bpd according to estimates by the u s energy information administration short term energy outlook eia june 8 u s shale producers have so far reacted cautiously to the rise in prices returning earnings to shareholders and cutting debt rather than increasing drilling and production shale producers are adding extra rigs more slowly than in previous recoveries and the total number of active rigs 365 is less than half the number 844 869 the last time wti prices clc1 were at similar levels in 2018 but the continued rise in prices is signalling the urgent need for more production from one or more of opec iran once u s sanctions are lifted u s shale firms and the non opec non shale producers uncertainty about the timing and extent of sanctions relief on iran helps explain why opec has taken a cautious approach to lifting production so far despite signs of a much faster recovery in oil consumption intense pressure on the industry as a result of last year s pandemic and associated price slump received widespread sympathy from consumers and an understanding that prices had fallen unsustainably low and needed to rise but prices are now relatively high if they continue climbing while producers hold down output the lack of a production response is likely to draw more critical scrutiny from consumers into the market s operation with non energy commodity prices rising at the fastest rate since the 1970s and central banks becoming alert to the threat of faster inflation rising oil prices will soon start to attract more political attention price indicators front month brent futures prices as a result brent futures prices have climbed to their highest level since 2018 before the intensifying trade war between the united states and china hit the global economy in real terms the price of the front month brent contract has risen to the 67th percentile for all months since 1990 confirming the industry is now well into the expansion phase of the cycle brent s six month calendar spread has surged into a backwardation of more than 3 60 per barrel the 93rd percentile for all trading days since 1990 underscoring that the market is expected to become very tight flat prices and spreads are both reacting to the persistent under production of petroleum over the last year and decline in inventories of both crude and refined products commercial petroleum stocks in the countries of the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd have already fallen by 300 million barrels or 10 since june 2020 oecd inventories are now more than 1 below the pre epidemic five year average for 2015 2019 and the deficit is expected to persist throughout the remainder of 2021 and 2022 position building by hedge funds and other portfolio investors has accelerated and magnified the increase in futures prices as investors anticipate an increasingly tight market towards the end of the year physical markets are not yet as tight as their futures counterparts there are sufficient stocks for now but availability is expected to deteriorate later in the year dated brent s five week spread is trading in a small backwardation of 35 cents per barrel which lies in the 65th percentile since 2010 but the oil market is now well into the upswing phase of the price cycle when more production will be needed to satisfy rapidly recovering consumption the longer opec and shale producers wait before responding the greater the likelihood prices will climb too high creating conditions for the next downturn just as delays in responding to price rises in 2013 14 and 2017 18 created conditions for price slumps in 2014 15 and again in 2019 2020 source reuters by john kemp

exmouth market in 1982 before the town hall s intervention living amid a seemingly never ending construction boom it s hard to believe what london was like in 1980 a city whose air of general shabbiness suggested post war rather than brave new world this was especially true of islington nowadays one of the most fashionable places in the capital but then a borough on its uppers islington was like a desert with lots of empty buildings and vacant sites says alec forshaw who joined the council in 1975 to begin a more than 30 year stretch as a town planner there was a great spiral of dereliction traditional industries were moving out a lot of local shops were disappearing and the population was falling it was even thought of as too poor to have a supermarket sainsbury s only came in on condition it could have a car park as it believed that most of its customers would be driving in from more affluent parts of london his book 1980s london the latest in a long line he has written about the capital over the years details what happened next as the seismic changes heralded by the thatcher govern ment combined with progressive policies at a local level transformed islington and other parts of the capital forever part memoir and part social commentary alec uses islington as a spring board for his survey of the places and events that are now part of history writing with the enthusi asm of someone whose passion for the job led him eventually to become the council s conservation chief it is partly down to his efforts that upper street became known as supper st as it went from drab to fab in just a few years and historic clerkenwell was finally put on the tourist map the main problem facing him and his colleagues in 1980 was how to attract people and businesses into a borough which had been further blighted by a bonkers scheme to drive an eight lane motorway through the borough and another to build an old street style roundabout at the angel once these threats had been lifted planners had to battle against thoughtless architecture and property owners whose first instinct was to demolish anything old not least the medieval smithfield meat market islington s biggest trump card was its historical environment and central location which needed to be protected and promoted he says we had to get our policy act together we designated conservation areas and more than doubled the number of listed buildings i learned that you have to trust your judgment and that things take a long time it was alec s good fortune to be working under the auspices of what he calls the socialist republic of islington where labour leader margaret hodge in defiance of mrs thatcher s cuts and privatisation agenda pressed on with an ambitious social hous ing programme as part of efforts to regenerate the borough and this encour aged more enlightened town planning the revival of exmouth market in finsbury which by the 1980s had just a few stalls in operation showed what could be done through a mixture of persuasion landscaping and changes in planning rules we paved it offered virtually free licences to encourage stall holders to set up pitches and allowed restaurants to operate on the ground floor he explains we gave grants to property owners debenhams to refurbish the upper floors of buildings that were largely empty or just used for storage at first they were very reluctant their vision was to flatten the whole lot and build a shopping mall the market became an early purveyor of street food and its improvement led to the refurbishment of spa fields park nearby making it an attractive place to hang out in at the beginning of the decade there was little indication that islington would one day become a property hotspot few people chose to live in central london and when janet street porter com missioned a new house in clerkenwell it was thought extraordinary says alec who lived in holloway at the time then came the big bang the deregula tion of the london stock exchange in 1986 that led to an influx of foreign banks into the square mile and bankers eyeing up homes in islington s elegant georgian terraces and squares just up the road soon estate agents were jostling for space in upper street he describes how the big bang sparked a massive wave of office development in the city where the ever increasing demand for large trading floors saw miles and miles of derelict dockland turned into london s new financial district as the private sector surged forward like a juggernaut coin street a parcel of land behind the south bank designated for office development represented one of the greater london council s final up yours moments when it handed it over to community activists for social housing shortly before being abol ished by mrs thatcher alec retired from the council in 2007 just as plans for a series of 30 storey luxury apartments in city road were rolled out just as i predicted we have ended up with a desert even on the nicest day you never see anyone round there he says rue fully the private sector really took off in the 1980s and things got out of control we are still living with the consequences of that having completed the book before last year s first lockdown he is struck by the similarities between 1980 and now london is once again facing radical change we have empty high streets empty office blocks and we need to get more people living in the mid dle of london the only real solution is local or government intervention 1980s london making the best of it by alec forshaw brown dog books 15

the pandemic has brought to a boil an issue that has been simmering for years affecting all americans but none more than residential real estate professionals every week the lament is louder there just aren t enough homes for sale the shortage creates frustration for those who work tirelessly to help people find suitable homes who are unfortunately being priced out of the market a study by the rosen consulting group commissioned by the national association of realtors concludes that today s shortage is a result of decades of underbuilding in the nation s housing stock creating an enormous demand supply gap the study suggests that filling the gap will require a national commitment to build more housing of all types by expanding resources addressing barriers to new development and making new housing construction an integral part of the nation s infrastructure strategy for at least the next 10 to 20 years the report s good news however is that such a response would unleash significant economic growth create jobs and increase affordability the study housing is critical infrastructure social and economic benefits of building more housing analyzes the shortage using two methods the first compares the number of completed housing units over the past 20 years with the long term average completions from 1968 to 2020 this measure shows a cumulative shortage of more than 5 5 million housing units over the past two decades two million of which are single family homes the second approach compares housing production to household formation while considering the number of residences lost to destruction demolition or obsolescence this method suggests a gap of 6 8 million units from an economic perspective this vast underbuilding has cost the u s economy an estimated 4 4 trillion of economic activity moreover it has resulted in a rapidly aging housing infrastructure underbuilding has directly strained the for sale housing market taking it into crisis territory from 1996 through 2016 the u s enjoyed an average monthly inventory of 2 5 million homes available for sale but by january 2021 this level had plunged to 1 million homes just 40 of the historical average and the lowest level since tracking began in 1999 and it is almost certainly worse today the lack of homes for sale has naturally driven up prices from 2012 through 2019 housing affordability decreased in 45 states the pandemic has exacerbated the problem especially for millennials and communities of color just as with rebuilding other types of infrastructure closing the housing gap offers huge benefits in fact the study shows the economic multiplier effects of spending on new single family home construction to be even larger than spending on highways building an additional 550 000 new homes annually the rate at which we could close the gap in 10 years would create 2 8 million jobs and add over 400 billion each year to the gdp even more important a commitment to closing the gap would increase home affordability and put the american dream of homeownership within the reach of millions more for more information on housing inventory and to access the paper visit nar realtor evan liddiard is the director of federal tax policy for the national association of realtors

in 2018 native oregonian and local hemp and vegetable farmer billy toshef sensed that his home state was on the precipice of a unique opportunity for positive transformative growth through cannabis could he leverage the crop in a way that improved the health and wellbeing of the people and farming community supporting independent farm ownership while also providing new jobs and income for farmers and workers the hemp industry needed a home port in oregon and toshef felt that he had the vision and the means to spearhead the initiative his partner jacob crabtree agreed and so the duo launched columbia hemp trading co to put their plan into motion the startup posed some initial challenges while tosheff and his new colleagues had ample experience in organic farming and processing they quickly realized that the characteristics of cannabis posed distinctive logistical problems from a harvesting and distribution standpoint if they had any hope of ramping up production and achieving their mission of bringing the benefits of hemp and cbd to a global community they needed to first address the challenges specific to cannabis drying and processing in an environment that lacked industry background and experience to lean on as their volumes increased in tandem with their understanding of the complexities of hemp and cannabis drying chtc turned to a longtime processing partner abm equipment of vancouver wa for help for the venture to have a fighting chance of taking off in what was quickly becoming a competitive business landscape it was critical that they equipped themselves with an integrated system capable of higher quality output faster throughput and massive cost reductions the call led to a unique three way partnership between chtc abm and kason corp of millburn nj a well known screening and processing equipment manufacturer with decades of success at demanding food and pharmaceutical grade applications the collaboration led to the development of an innovative biomass processing system that features unique patent pending dual stage drying technology thanks to abm and kason s built to spec solution the integrated continuous processing system has provided chtc dramatic performance and cost advantages while finally giving the company a platform to scale to full acreage crop volumes the innovative system has reduced production costs by more than 50 while preserving the terpene content color and aroma of the processed plant the biomass processing equipment has also provided much needed consistency in the drying process targeting a 10 moisture content of the processed biomass at ambient temperature challenges physical characteristics compared to other biomass products its inherent stickiness and toughness makes cannabis more challenging to process variability crops vary widely based on strain soil conditions weather and other factors each crop may require different settings for processing rapid throughput when crops are ready to be harvested it must be dried within a week of harvesting otherwise processors run the risk of having the biomass begin to decompose harvests come in at specific times of year and cannot be spaced over time cannabinoid preservation the cannabis drying process must retain crops cbd and thc content aesthetic quality product should look and smell like cannabis heat only dryers cause a slight browning which reduces market value sudden unpredictable peaks weather conditions have a significant impact on harvest volumes if it rains all farmers need to take in their crop simultaneously and rapidly prices biomass prices for cannabis have gone down from premium to commodity or liquidity pricing dropping by 90 in just 3 years cannabis processing overcoming challenges together suffice to say hemp is unlike any other biomass product its unique properties require delicate yet efficient separation and processing to avoid degradation or decomposition we decided to do what seems like the most difficult processing job there is take truckloads of hemp that often come in all at once by inventing new systems that don t tend to damage the crop the way existing equipment seemed to be doing said jacob crabtree ceo of columbia hemp trading company many systems being used in the field were struggling he said because while they may have been successful when developed for other industries the tough cannabis and hemp crop presented new drying and handling problems they were not engineered to solve if the plant is over heated he said the product instantly becomes worthless in 2019 we had a million and a half pounds of biomass rejected because it fell way below the threshold for extraction says crabtree chtc initially used batch style drying equipment but that presented three challenges that needed to be eliminated to scale up production first the process was labor intensive which is difficult enough in a high margin market but clearly not sustainable in a market where prices have dropped 90 secondly the moisture content rose when they moved out of the machine back to ambient temperature finally the extreme temperatures used in drum or tumbler dryers were actually burning the product causing a discoloration of the cannabis the target we re going for is a 10 moisture content still green in color and retention of cannabinoids what that means is that if it comes in at 8 it s leaving at let s say 7 8 cbd content with our other systems we re getting some browning of the material now with the new continuous 2 stage kason drying system it s coming out looking as green and natural as when it came in with that retention of cannabinoids said crabtree kason filed for patent protection on the newly engineered system engineered by abm equipment in 2020 based around the 2 stage drying methodology rather than using extreme heat that is destructive to the hemp product itself the patent outlines the use of a high throughput fluid bed dryer kason s vibro bed system that eliminates the common problem of burning of cannabis and hemp found with drum or tumbler based systems the new drying system utilizes various technologies for conveyance particle size reduction and sorting of the hemp biomass in addition to a fluid bed drying technology by controlling the entire process the abm equipment kason solution achieves results that are superior to belt or tumbler dryers the patent pending system yields biomass output at a consistent 4 12 moisture content for safe year round storage retains a beautiful green product color and preserves the original hemp smell consumers prefer the process has already been proven in the field with customers at volumes of up to 8 000 pounds per hour of biomass per unit why abm high expertise low risk early on when the chtc team recognized the specific difficulties they were facing with a hemp crop they turned to abm equipment because of its combination of high quality equipment biomass processing expertise and its integration experience in customizing an end to end solution and tweak it until the results met columbia s standards the biggest learning i had was understanding how organic material dries said crabtree when i mentioned to jeff walling of abm our objective of getting from 75 moisture content down to 10 and the problems we d had he knew intuitively what we were trying to accomplish i think abm has seen this along a lot of food products over the years so they knew how to design a cannabis purposed drying and separation system the abm team together with chtc alongside several farmers tested the system on a variety of crop variations to perfect the system the entire industry is so new that the growers weren t consistent in how they had been harvesting and drying recalled tosheff they were asking me how to tell when the cannabis plant was ready to harvest and nobody was coming in the same way twice that quickly demonstrated the inefficiency and unpredictability of the process if tosheff s mission was to help the farmers get the most yield from their crops amid rapidly dropping cannabis prices and increased competition he knew it was critical to work with an integrator like abm to bring the company decades of processing and biomass experience we led the industry developing something new that was more efficient and not choking ourselves by making big capital equipment mistakes said billy tosheff founder columbia hemp trading company the abm and kason combination enabled chtc to realize lower start up and operating costs with the ability to grow incrementally as volumes increased reducing risk in the cannabis industry is essential as the learning curve and the rapid changes within the marketplace can lead to changing requirements with each harvest growers become savvier and the crops can change the demands and developments in the medicinal and consumer markets also impact processing output requirements with a more flexible modular system like the abm kason approach tosheff said it has become easier to stay relevant and make changes with improvements in the process as the industry matures and progresses technical solution the abm solution includes conveyance model abt 36 trough belt conveyor whole plant or loose product is fed into shredder multiple styles leveling weirs product dependent belt speed varies particle size reduction model ahs 3631 shredder capacity is 8 000 pph with a particle size of 1 minus consistent particle size provides the ability to use a fluid bed dryer and ensures consistently thoroughly dried product drying kason vibro bed fluid bed dryer the fluid bed dryer dries primarily by creating a fluidized bed of particles and using a relatively low heat to move the moisture out of the bed fluid bed drying ensures drying of the surface area of every single particle resulting in a consistent output rapidly and without the need to elevate the temperature to a level that might damage the product sorting kason centri sifter the high throughput centrifugal sifter separates flowers from stalks and stems the active materials can be stored while the stock biomass can go on to secondary markets packing model abbp 2000 unit can be supplied with or without scaling package and comes standard with inflatable spout for positive seal around bulk bag neck packing is fully integrated into the continuous process avoiding spillage or any type of loss of output from the sifter and ensuring safe storage of the dried product for year round preservation benefits moisture content consistent 10 moisture content in every batch at ambient temperature terpene yields evidence of terpene yields as high as a 97 5 crop integrity gentle drying preserves the verdant green color and aroma of product high throughput throughput as high as 8 000 pounds per hour per machine cost reductions over a 50 reduction in production costs totally integrated system all five elements are engineered to work in tandem conveying shredding separation drying and packaging the kason vibro bed circular vibratory fluid bed dryer uses heat as an accelerant rather than a primary driver for evaporation preserving cbd at a higher yield than alternative technologies fluid bed dryers are an improvement over belt or tumbler drying methods as the fluid bed pushes air up through the product while it is being constantly shifted with vibration this fluidizes and maximizes exposure to air speeding the drying process while maintaining product integrity because the product is suspended over the airstreams this method increases the surface area of the product being exposed to dry air for greater efficiency and drying consistency belt dryers in contrast pull air from above via vacuum which creates concentrated or localized air streams that require higher temperatures and or more time to remove inevitable wet spots that occur throughout the biomass cannabis processors are also able to use the kason vibro bed fluid bed dryer to capture and return lost trichomes to each batch kason and abm equipment together developed the patent pending 2 stage drying approach for cannabis processing to address the technical shortcomings of single stage units single stage units use flash drying or extreme heat temperatures that attempt to reduce moisture content completely in one operation the much higher temperatures lead to uneven drying and or burning that damages the product and removes cbds kason s 2 stage approach uses controlled temperatures throughout the process which not only yields a better end product but also leads to lower energy costs the first stage removes up to 30 moisture content while the second stage completes the process achieving the final output of 4 12 moisture content we had significant contact on our platform and i think we survived a lot of risk in the beginning tosheff said finding a reliable continuous processing system that is not only more efficient but safer to operate was critical for us to move forward every farmer has different fields soils conditions growing environments and equipment we ve found a way to conquer that variability and produce a consistent premium product in a processing platform that can grow alongside our industry about columbia hemp trading co columbia hemp trading co is the regional leader in the industrial hemp marketplace having established a large scale operation hemp drying extraction and trading chtc was envisioned by co founder billy tosheff a local vegetable and hemp farmer unlike other commercial entrants into the emerging hemp industry chtc prioritized the most difficult segments of the supply chain beginning by solving the lack of critical infrastructure available to stabilize the biomass with an initial objective of supporting oregon s farmers chtc has established drying facilities in corvallis and molalla or providing reliable channels for oregon s farmers to sell and process their crops and be assured of high quality output chtc is committed to defining and improving upon best practices for the industrial hemp supply chain from genetics to bulk formulations and everything in between chtc believes that supply chain control quality and transparency are the critical ingredients to bringing the benefits of hemp to the world

in this photo taken sept 10 2019 a detainee works in a kitchen area at the geo groups immigration jail in tacoma wash during a media tour after nearly four years of litigation and pandemic related delays a federal jury on tuesday june 15 2021 began deliberating whether the geo group must pay minimum wage to detainees who perform cooking cleaning and other tasks at the facility instead of the 1 per day they typically receive ap photo ted s warren seattle a trial over whether the geo group must pay minimum wage instead of 1 a day to immigration detainees who perform tasks like cooking and cleaning at its for profit detention center in washington state has ended with a hung jury u s district judge robert bryan in tacoma declared a mistrial thursday after the nine person jury indicated they could not reach unanimous agreement following a two week trial and about two days of deliberation recommended videos nobody s happy but nobody lost bryan told the attorneys afterward democratic washington attorney general bob ferguson sued the florida based geo group in 2017 saying the company had unjustly profited by running the northwest detention center in tacoma now known as the northwest ice processing center on the backs of captive workers a separate lawsuit filed on behalf of detainees was also filed that year seeking back pay the judge who rejected several attempts by geo to dismiss the lawsuits consolidated the cases for trial which he conducted via zoom because of the pandemic the judge said he expected that the cases would be set for a new trial geo a multi billion dollar for profit prison corporation that is publicly traded on the new york stock exchange pays workers 1 a day or less to perform essential services necessary to maintain the northwest ice processing center ferguson said in a written statement thursday a hung jury allows us to re try the claim again in front of a new jury geo maintained that the detainees were not employees under the washington minimum wage act even if they were the company said it would be unlawfully discriminatory for washington to require geo to pay them minimum wage now 13 69 an hour when the state doesn t pay minimum wage to inmates who work at its own prisons or other detention facilities the jury indicated it could not reach agreement on either question before it whether the detainees were employed by geo and if they were employed if the law discriminated against the company the definition of employee in washington s minimum wage law is broad it includes anyone who is permitted to work by an employer without regard to immigration or legal work status the law says residents of a state county or municipal detention facility are not entitled to minimum wage for work they perform the detention center didn t fit that exemption because it s a private for profit facility not a state county or municipal one attorneys for the state and for the detainees argued at one point in their deliberations the jurors sent a question to the judge asking if municipal meant the same thing as federal the judge responded that no municipal referred to a city or town not the federal government the northwest detention center houses people who are in custody while the federal government seeks to deport them or reviews their immigration status it can hold up to 1 575 detainees making it one of the nation s largest immigration jails though as of early this month its population was just 216 largely due to the pandemic u s immigration and customs enforcement requires the company to operate a voluntary work program in part to keep the detainees occupied it requires them to be paid at least 1 per day for work that includes cleaning bathrooms showers and industrial kitchens washing and folding laundry sweeping and buffing floors preparing and serving food and cutting hair geo acknowledged it could pay detainees more if it wanted in 2018 the company made 18 6 million in profits from the facility it would have cost 3 4 million to pay the minimum wage to detainees despite the broad definition of employee in the law the case is complex geo s contract with ice requires it to comply with applicable state and local law which the state says includes the washington minimum wage act but other provisions forbid geo from hiring anyone who doesn t have legal status in the u s the contract spells it out the detainees are not employees geo attorney joan mell said they can t be in her closing argument mell accused the state and detainee advocates of using the lawsuits to attack the immigration detention system without ever having to go to congress geo has operated the detainee work program for more than a decade and the state made no effort to get the company to pay the minimum wage until 2017 amid a flurry of lawsuits ferguson filed against the trump administration washington appears to be the only state suing a private detention contractor for not paying minimum wage to immigration detainees but similar lawsuits have been brought on behalf of immigration detainees in other states including new mexico colorado and california seeking to force geo and another major private detention company corecivic to pay minimum wage to detainees there the colorado and california cases are pending but a federal judge rejected the lawsuit brought by former detainees of corecivic s cibola detention center in new mexico a decision upheld by a federal appeals court panel in march persons in custodial detention such as appellants are not in an employer employee relationship but in a detainer detainee relationship the panel wrote in a separate effort washington is trying to close the detention center entirely this spring gov jay inslee signed a law that would ban for profit detention centers in the state geo has sued to block it
new york new york the dollar took center stage on u s markets on thursday rising sharply against a broad range of currencies equity markets were mixed the nasdaq shot higher the standard and poor s 500 was flat while the dow jones tumbled investors and traders clearly had divided opinions on which way markets were headed following the federal reserve s announcement the previous day that interest rates would head higher in around two years time the pace of tightening is still uncertain how large of an inflation overshoot is allowed before liftoff will also be important in gauging the pace of tightening moody s analytics said in a paper published on thursday if the fed allows a larger overshoot then the pace of tightening will likely be similar to a traditional tightening cycle 25 basis points per quarter because inflation should continue to accelerate even after the first rate hike if the fed doesnt allow too much of an overshoot then the tightening cycle will be less aggressive the first hike for the target range for the fed funds rate occurs in early 2023 and the pace of tightening is expected to be similar to historical norms the moody s paper said at the close on thursday the dow jones index was down 210 22 points or 0 62 percent at 33 823 45 the nasdaq composite added 121 67 points or 0 87 percent to 14 161 35 the standard and poor s 500 slipped 1 84 points or 0 04 percent to 4 221 86 on foreign currency markets almost all currencies buckled under the renewed strength of the u s dollar the japanese yen was the only currency to take on the greenback finishing ahead approaching the new york close last quoted at 110 27 the euro fell sharply to 1 1901 the british pound tumbled to 1 3023 the swiss franc was easier at 0 9178 the commodities bloc fell sharply with the canadian dollar falling to 1 2358 the australian dollar was sold off to 0 7549 while the new zealand dollar dropped like a stone to 0 6999 stock markets in europe rose with the paris based cac 40 climbing 0 20 percent in germany the dax appreciated by 0 11 percent in the uk the ftse 100 declined 0 44 percent on asian markets tokyo s nikkei 225 shed 272 68 points or 0 93 percent to close thursday at 29 018 33 china s shanghai composite gained 7 38 points or 0 21 percent to 3 525 60 the australian all ordinaries lost 32 90 points or 0 43 percent to 7 600 50 the hang seng in hong kong finished 121 75 points or 0 43 percent in front at 28 558 59
by desmond lachman john maynard keynes famously said when the facts change i change my mind what do you do sir evidently the federal reserve led by chairman jerome powell does not seem to subscribe to keynes s view about how one should adapt one s thinking to material new information even though the u s economic and financial market facts are changing in a major way the fed remains doggedly committed to its zero interest rate policy and to its expansive bond buying program past experience with inflationary episodes and with the bursting of asset price bubbles strongly suggest that the powell fed s policy approach will not have a happy ending a clear indication of the fed not adapting to changing facts was its non reaction to the january 2021 georgia senate run off election that paved the way for the 1 9 trillion america rescue plan continue reading here
in late 2020 eric airrack decker known for his adventure seeking vlogs and outlandish pranks and challenge videos like breaking 100 laws in 24 hours crossed the 1 million subscriber threshold on youtube it was a staggering feat that decker accomplished in less than a year s time goaded on at the final hour by a stunt concocted alongside creator startup stir in which the 24 year old vowed to remain stranded on a desert island until reaching the milestone the ultimatum ultimately turned out to be a success today decker today counts 1 54 million subscribers 10 million monthly views and is continuing a trajectory of steady growth create now now it s precisely this kind of tenacity and out sized thinking that decker is looking to inspire among fellow creators via a new educational venture called creator now subscribe for daily tubefilter top stories subscribe the six week community based online learning program priced at 250 per attendee challenges participants to create a total of six videos over the course of one session at the same time participants will gain access to workshops hosted by video industry professionals receive feedback from their fellow classmates and even have the chance to take home pricey prizes it can feel very lonely to try to become a creator by yourself or by just buying some stupid course off the internet that doesn t really teach you anything decker tells tubefilter what we ve done is take the most important parts of what i ve learned and condense that into a community driven habit building program decker and creator now co founder zack honarvar who is also decker s manager at one day entertainment purposefully sought to keep each cohort small enough to foster a productive feedback loop each six week creator now session is capped at 300 participants who are then divided into 30 teams of 10 creators the purpose of the teams honarvar says is to stoke competition in terms of posting consistency and furnishing feedback in addition to tutelage from decker whose presence will predominantly comprise roasting participants videos in group live streams creator now will also feature breakouts taught by fellow luminaries like logan paul s esteemed video editor hayden hillier smith samir chaudry of the branded content production and filmmaking duo colin and samir influencer marketing specialist ian borthwick of seatgeek fame and the gen z fandom focused entrepreneur and venture capitalist tiffany zhong and already the program is garnering interest from established creators as well as newcomers there s a lot of people within the community at 50 000 or 100 000 subscribers honarvar says as much as they re there to grow and learn from people like eric they re also becoming teachers for the newer members too so it s like this dynamic where everyone s a teacher and everyone s also a student a waitlist 12 000 people long the first creator now session kicked off on may 1 and sold out within roughly 12 hours honarvar says subsequently garnering a waiting list 12 000 people long for the second session which is set to begin in in early july the creator now website is currently accepting sign ups for the session with 83 spots of 300 currently remaining right now the plan is to do six week sessions indefinitely decker and honarvar say with two weeks breaks between each new cohort sponsors including stock image and audio service storyblocks music licensing platforms musicbed and epidemic sound and tech giant sony are predominantly providing free products for participants as well as larger tier prizes given the program s gamified elements select brands are also sponsoring their own workshops honarvar says including epidemic which share actionable insights while also plugging their products a total of 15 prizes will be dispersed throughout each cohort at both the team and individual levels each session s mvp will win a collaboration with decker while the most improved participant who started with less than 1 000 subscribers and achieved the most growth will take home a 4 000 camera package from sony the best performing team will win a workshop with decker and his management squad as well as a one year premium subscription to epidemic sound winners will be selected by the creator now team who will be looking at both consistency of posts participation in terms of providing feedback to fellow teammates and subscriber growth participants in the program will link their youtube channels to their creator now accounts so the team can pull analytics directly finally a branded content challenge in collaboration with arizona beverages will see one winner who most creatively and thoughtfully integrates the iced tea into their video concept receive a 5 000 production budget the ability of community to galvanize inspiration decker traces his passion for video all the way back to the fifth grade when he first discovered youtube and promptly spent the entire next day filming a music video for flo rida s hit track low having caught the bug early on decker ended up dropping out of college to start a wedding video production company where he worked for four years before pursuing youtube full time of course he s not the first creator to segue his own success into video education and decker acknowledges that certain predecessors have cast the space in a bad light by producing cheap products that come off as quick cash grabs in 2018 for instance jake paul launched edfluence a creator education venture that soon shuttered after many participants on social media felt they had been scammed honarvar explains that decker s astronomic success makes him uniquely qualified to speak to what it takes to be a top creator today and the duo say they sought to pack as much discernible value into creator now so that participants would immediately know what they re getting brand partnerships will enable participants to automatically receive certain perks like a pro subscription to workplace app notion and they are also emphasizing the involvement of decker and other workshop leaders as well as the myriad prizes but at the end of the day decker says the true value of creator now lies in the ability of community to galvanize inspiration i think one of the biggest value propositions to what we ve built is literally just aggregating people who have the same ambition decker says we re giving away a 4 000 camera set up we re giving away a brand deal with arizona but the thing that people are most fired up about is just the idea that they re working together it s as simple as that you can check out a video compiled by members of the first creator now class as a surprise for decker below

new york ap janet malcolm the inquisitive and boldly subjective author and reporter known for her challenging critiques of everything from murder cases and art to journalism itself has died she was 86 malcolm died wednesday at new york presbyterian hospital according to her daughter anne malcolm the cause was lung cancer a longtime new yorker staff writer and the author of several books the prague native practiced a kind of post modern style in which she often called attention to her own role in the narrative questioning whether even the most conscientious observer could be trusted every journalist who is not too stupid or too full of himself to notice what is going on knows that what he does is morally indefensible was how she began the journalist and the murderer the 1990 book assailed joe mcginniss true crime classic fatal vision as a prime case of the author tricking his subject convicted killer jeffrey macdonald who had asked mcginniss to write a book about him only to have the author conclude he was a sociopath it was one of many works by malcolm that set off debates about her profession and compelled even those who disliked her to keep reading reviewing a 2013 anthology of her work forty one false starts for the new york times adam kirsch praised malcolm for a powerfully distinctive and very entertaining literary experience most of the pieces in the book find malcolm observing artists and writers either present david salle thomas struth or past julia margaret cameron edith wharton kirsch wrote but what the reader remembers is janet malcolm her cool intelligence her psychoanalytic knack for noticing and her talent for withdrawing in order to let her subjects hang themselves with their own words on thursday new yorker editor david remnick praised malcolm as a master of nonfiction writing and cited her willingness to take on her peers journalists can be among the most thin skinned and self satisfied of tribes and janet had the nerve to question what we do sometimes remnick told the associated press malcolm s words and those she attributed to others brought her esteem scorn and prolonged litigation in 1983 she reported on a former director of the london based sigmund freud archives psychoanalyst jeffrey moussaieff masson she contended that masson had called himself an intellectual gigolo had vowed he would be known as the greatest analyst who ever lived and that he would turn freud s old home into a place of sex women fun her reporting appeared in the new yorker and was the basis for the 1984 book in the freud archives masson alleging that five quotations had been fabricated and ruined his reputation sued for 7 million the case lasted for years with the u s supreme court allowing it go to trial and malcolm testifying to much skepticism that she could not find a notebook in which she wrote down some of his remarks in 1994 a federal court jury in san francisco cleared her of libel even though it decided she made up two quotations the jury found that the quotations were false and one potentially libelous but that masson failed to prove she acted deliberately or recklessly a year later to a new round of skepticism malcolm announced that she had found the missing notebook while playing with her granddaughter i don t believe it masson said at the time this is the adult version of the dog ate my homework except in this case the dog is regurgitating the notes after 12 years malcolm s honors included a pen award for biography in 2008 for two lives gertrude and alice and a nomination in 2014 from the national book critics circle for forty one false starts in 1999 the modern library ranked the journalist and the murderer which mcginniss would allege was filled with omissions distortions and outright misstatements of fact no 97 on its list of the 100 best nonfiction releases of the 20th century her other books most of them edited by her second husband gardner botsford included the silent woman sylvia plath and ted hughes in part a critique of biography and the charade of evenhandedness and psychoanalysis the impossible profession malcolm ironically was the daughter of a psychiatrist her mother was a lawyer and would liken journalists and analysts as experts on the small unregarded motions of life donald malcolm her first husband died in 1975 botsford died in 2004 she was born jana wienerová in 1934 and emigrated with her family to the u s five years later after the nazis annexed czechoslovakia her parents settled in new york city changed their last name to winn and said little about their jewish background even sending malcolm and her sister marie to a lutheran sunday school finally one day after one of us proudly brought home an anti semitic slur learned from a classmate they decided it was time to tell us that we were jewish malcolm wrote in six glimpses of the past a photo essay published in the new yorker in 2018 it was a bit late we had internalized the anti semitism in the culture and were shocked and mortified to learn that we were not on the good side of the equation many years later i came to acknowledge and treasure my jewishness but during childhood and adolescence i hated and resented and hid it she remembered herself as a bookish child drawn early to such 19th century authors as jane austen and charles dickens but her dreams of writing fiction ended at the university of michigan when she received a c in a creative writing course acknowledging she was better at observing than inventing she wrote for the school newspaper the michigan daily around the same time she also met her first husband later a writer for the new republic and the new yorker they married in 1959 and moved east janet malcolm published occasional film criticism in the new republic and a poem in the new yorker but otherwise dedicated several years to raising her daughter her professional breakthrough came in 1966 when she wrote a piece on children s books for the new yorker that so impressed editor william shawn he eventually gave her a column about furniture she soon expanded her subject matter and evolved in how she approached it when i first started doing long fact pieces as they were called at the new yorker i modeled my i on the stock civilized and humane figure that was the new yorker i but as i went along i began to tinker with her and make changes in her personality she told the paris review in 2011 yes i gave her flaws and vanities and perhaps most significantly strong opinions i had her take sides i was influenced by this thing that was in the air called deconstruction she added the idea i took from it was precisely the idea that there is no such thing as a dispassionate observer that every narrative is inflected by the narrator s bias she was open about her feelings in a new yorker piece on the magazine artforum she interviewed the historian and artforum contributor rosalind krauss and turned her subject s precisely furnished apartment into a most discerning character writing no one can leave this loft without feeling a little rebuked one s own house suddenly seems cluttered inchoate banal in the book iphigenia in forest hills malcolm s account of a murder trial in new york city she meets with the defense attorney after the verdict and agrees with his lament that the press had taken the prosecution s side journalism is an enterprise of reassurance she wrote we do not wring our hands or rend our clothes over the senseless crimes and disasters that give us our subject we explain and blame we are connoisseurs of

the hung jury means the judge expects the cases to go up against a new jury example video title will go here for this video example video title will go here for this video seattle a trial over whether the geo group must pay minimum wage instead of 1 a day to immigration detainees who perform tasks like cooking and cleaning at its for profit detention center in washington state has ended with a hung jury u s district judge robert bryan in tacoma declared a mistrial thursday after the nine person jury indicated they could not reach unanimous agreement following a two week trial and about two days of deliberation nobody s happy but nobody lost bryan told the attorneys afterward democratic washington attorney general bob ferguson sued the florida based geo group in 2017 saying the company had unjustly profited by running the northwest detention center in tacoma now known as the northwest ice processing center on the backs of captive workers a separate lawsuit filed on behalf of detainees was also filed that year seeking back pay the judge who rejected several attempts by geo to dismiss the lawsuits consolidated the cases for trial which he conducted via zoom because of the pandemic the judge said he expected that the cases would be set for a new trial geo a multi billion dollar for profit prison corporation that is publicly traded on the new york stock exchange pays workers 1 a day or less to perform essential services necessary to maintain the northwest ice processing center ferguson said in a written statement thursday a hung jury allows us to re try the claim again in front of a new jury geo maintained that the detainees were not employees under the washington minimum wage act even if they were the company said it would be unlawfully discriminatory for washington to require geo to pay them minimum wage now 13 69 an hour when the state doesn t pay minimum wage to inmates who work at its own prisons or other detention facilities the jury indicated it could not reach agreement on either question before it whether the detainees were employed by geo and if they were employed if the law discriminated against the company the definition of employee in washington s minimum wage law is broad it includes anyone who is permitted to work by an employer without regard to immigration or legal work status the law says residents of a state county or municipal detention facility are not entitled to minimum wage for work they perform the detention center didn t fit that exemption because it s a private for profit facility not a state county or municipal one attorneys for the state and for the detainees argued at one point in their deliberations the jurors sent a question to the judge asking if municipal meant the same thing as federal the judge responded that no municipal referred to a city or town not the federal government the northwest detention center houses people who are in custody while the federal government seeks to deport them or reviews their immigration status it can hold up to 1 575 detainees making it one of the nation s largest immigration jails though as of early this month its population was just 216 largely due to the pandemic u s immigration and customs enforcement requires the company to operate a voluntary work program in part to keep the detainees occupied it requires them to be paid at least 1 per day for work that includes cleaning bathrooms showers and industrial kitchens washing and folding laundry sweeping and buffing floors preparing and serving food and cutting hair geo acknowledged it could pay detainees more if it wanted in 2018 the company made 18 6 million in profits from the facility it would have cost 3 4 million to pay the minimum wage to detainees despite the broad definition of employee in the law the case is complex geo s contract with ice requires it to comply with applicable state and local law which the state says includes the washington minimum wage act but other provisions forbid geo from hiring anyone who doesn t have legal status in the u s the contract spells it out the detainees are not employees geo attorney joan mell said they can t be in her closing argument mell accused the state and detainee advocates of using the lawsuits to attack the immigration detention system without ever having to go to congress geo has operated the detainee work program for more than a decade and the state made no effort to get the company to pay the minimum wage until 2017 amid a flurry of lawsuits ferguson filed against the trump administration washington appears to be the only state suing a private detention contractor for not paying minimum wage to immigration detainees but similar lawsuits have been brought on behalf of immigration detainees in other states including new mexico colorado and california seeking to force geo and another major private detention company corecivic to pay minimum wage to detainees there the colorado and california cases are pending but a federal judge rejected the lawsuit brought by former detainees of corecivic s cibola detention center in new mexico a decision upheld by a federal appeals court panel in march persons in custodial detention such as appellants are not in an employer employee relationship but in a detainer detainee relationship the panel wrote in a separate effort washington is trying to close the detention center entirely this spring gov jay inslee signed a law that would ban for profit detention centers in the state geo has sued to block it

will see its first post covid rate rise yesterday he said simply it is some way off this vagueness added to a wild odd session on the asx which began well before the open as markets tried to interpret the fed statement and press conference the statement was hawkish in regards fomc member rate rise expectations but the fed chair was more dovish in his press conference responses us stocks markets rocked and rolled but what was definitive was a one percent gain in the us dollar index while this was countered with a one percent fall in the aussie it was clear commodity prices which had been driven by an increasingly crowded trade would suffer gold was the clear and present victim and it fell 2 5 the london metals exchange had closed by that time and while still open after hours oil markets were also effectively closed so we had to wait until tonight to see base metal and oil prices all fall heavily this was anticipated in a 1 8 fall for the materials sector yesterday and 1 9 for energy but central bank speak was not all that was impacting the market yesterday the asx200 opened down 44 points and by lunchtime was back to square in between came a rather astonishing jobs report australia added 115 000 jobs in may when forecasts were for 30 000 of that figure 97 000 were full time jobs the unemployment rate plunged to a pre pandemic 5 1 from 5 5 when 5 4 was forecast even as the participation rate increased hours worked rose and underemployment fell to 7 4 from 7 8 irrespective of central bank rhetoric the may numbers suggest the rba s target of 4 5 unemployment which is one half of the trigger for a rate rise seems now a lot closer than 2024 the australian ten year yield rose 9 basis points to 1 63 while defensive sectors have been to date beneficiaries of the inflation trade in particular reits investment has been based on the assumption inflation will rise but actual rate rises will still be some way off well they re still some way off according to dr lowe but yesterday no one was mucking about property fell 1 5 telcos 1 9 utilities 1 1 and staples 1 5 these are the steady dividend paying sectors along these days with materials as bond rates rise those dividends are less attractive the big fall in staples was nonetheless largely attributable to a 4 5 plunge for coles col after management attempted to wow pun intended the crowd with its new smarter selling program but made the mistake of revealing how much it would cost having peaked out post jobs report the asx200 then slid through the afternoon to be down 27 at the close it could have been a lot worse but for the fact the one sector that specifically likes inflation and rate rises are the banks they offset with a 0 8 gain the tech sector did its bit as well in rising 1 3 with all that was going on one can appreciate why it was a volatile day but adding to the volatility was the fact it was asx derivatives expiry day and what might today bring wall street has seen fresh rotation into growth as the us ten year yield fell back by 6 of the 7 basis points it jumped the night before gold is down another 2 as the us dollar is up another 1 but the aussie is down another 0 8 put it together futures up 38 points who to believe jerome powell has also been holding on to a 2024 expectation for the first fed rate rise but wednesday night s dot plots showed a majority of fomc members tipping 2023 and a handful even 2022 but then powell told the gathered press one should take the dot plots with a grain of salt i noted yesterday one should always wait to the day after a fed policy release to learn the true wall street reaction with most steering clear of the initial late afternoon volatility on the day if inflation really is a threat and now that the fed is going to start talking about tapering one would expect growth stocks to lose out over value stocks and bond prices to fall last night the nasdaq rallied 0 9 the dow fell 0 6 and the us ten year yield fell back 6bps to 1 51 the only consistent element from wednesday night was a further 1 rally in the us dollar and subsequent 2 additional fall in gold the biggest sector falls in the s p500 last night were booked by banks energy and materials while the tech heavy sectors countered to leave the s p yet again flat those three sectors had become the most crowded trades being the best performers year to date the other point to consider of course is why is inflation rising to which the answer is because the economy is recovering and a strong economy is a good thing the australian economy is recovering well if yesterday s jobs numbers are anything to go by and so is the us economy although it s proving to be a bit of a bumpy ride us jobs numbers have fallen short of expectations over the past two months the weekly new jobless claims numbers have been trending down since february albeit with the occasional stumble last night s data showed a 37 000 increase to 412 000 the highest level in a month but at the same time job vacancies continue to rise and labour shortages impacting across many industries higher wages need to be offered to attract the right people which implies inflation if

the retired investor chlorine cars and the supply chain challenge supply chain shortages are showing up across the nation some items such as chlorine for america s pools and used cars just illustrate a lesson we need to learn the chlorine shortages illustrate why supply chains are so important and how fragile they can be when faced with something as devastating as the pandemic last year when lockdowns kept most americans hunkered in their homes an enormous home improvement wave swept through the country demand for home offices on the inside and new recreational improvements on the outside skyrocketed gazebos firepits and swimming pools were just some of the items that consumers decided would make life bearable under a lockdown new pool construction and upgrades were a savior to the pool industry which saw their sales jump 20 percent or more roughly 66 percent of the 5 2 million in ground residential pools in the u s use traditional chlorine systems the last thing new and old pool owners were expecting was a chlorine supply shortage all it took was a fire at one chemical plant in louisiana to drive prices of chlorine pool tablets into the stratosphere unfortunately this facility accounted for a large share of domestic chlorine pool tab production and there are few remaining sources of supply within the u s and as with so many other products in the global supply chain china is the only significant foreign supplier importing products from china is beset by a variety of problems ranging from bottlenecks in ports china s own virus outbreaks and the various economic sanctions and tariffs imposed by the u s we are paying a price and a steep one at that for our past and present policies of bashing china and other nations rather than investing in our own abilities to compete the scarcity of new and used automobiles in the u s is far a far more serious issue than chlorine but its cause is just another example of how supply chain disruptions can ultimately impact consumers in unexpected ways semiconductors for example are used in so many products that they are considered indispensable to the world s economic health as most readers are aware there is at present a global semiconductor shortage for today s gadget filled automobile that has posed a real problem the pandemic is once again the culprit behind the shortages demand by shut in consumers seeking electronic equipment for home offices and for chip heavy gadgets for home entertainment exploded the companies that build and sell these devices reacted by sending a wave of semiconductor orders through the supply chain all at once at the same time many of these global chip makers were being forced to shut down due to their own coronavirus threat as a result those u s orders quickly overwhelmed the few chip foundries that manufacture most of the world s computer chips automobile manufacturers were caught flat footed by the semiconductor shortage the electronic goods manufacturers had quickly gobbled up most of the relatively lean worldwide inventory of chips by the time they got around to realizing there was a shortage it was too late the production of many new models had to be halted since many models just couldn t be completed without vital semiconductor components new car production became a trade off and dealerships found that their supply of new cars was being rationed at the same time consumer demand began picking up one reason is that the u s passenger auto stock is aging the average age of america s vehicles is now approaching 13 years old consumers shopping for new cars realize there are few to be had and the waiting list is in months not weeks long the result has been a growing shortage of new cars that has led to a record increase in used car prices the subsequent rise in used and new auto prices was so strong that it accounted for one third of april s overall rise in consumer prices cars and chlorine are just two examples of the present supply change imbalances there are lessons to be learned from this predicament for one the world s economies are a lot more vulnerable to catastrophes than anyone imagined second global supply chains are just that global whether we like it or not we need and depend on the products other nations sell us and they need ours the next calamity may be weather related or another virus like the bird flu resurgence in china today who knows whatever it is we are dependent on each other if we hope to survive it the sooner we wake up to that fact the better off we will be
china s way with a divided inert asean the asean china foreign ministers meeting held in chongqing china from 6 8 june was the first in person meeting between foreign ministers of both sides since covid 19 crisis began photo thailand s ministry of foreign affairs the recent asean china foreign ministers meeting early this month in chongqing was crucial for its timing and circumstances co chaired by chinese foreign minister wang yi and philippine foreign secretary teodoro locsin it was the first in person meeting among foreign ministers of both sides since the covid 19 period began early last year meetings in the flesh are critical to asean s inner workings as a diplomatic community because the strengths of southeast asia s 10 member regional organisation lie in informality and interaction at social gatherings in the event the chongqing meeting provided strategic and symbolic benefits for beijing and reassurances to asean enabling china to peddle its geostrategic interests and agenda while keeping its belt and road initiative grand strategy on track among the highlights mr wang noted the regional comprehensive economic partnership the code of conduct on the south china sea a proposed asean china comprehensive strategic partnership and asian values were most salient conspicuously absent in the chinese statement was the myanmar crisis which was the most pressing concern between the two sides for asean the key issues were covid 19 and pandemic recovery south china sea and myanmar the meeting ended on an optimistic and forward looking note china felt confident that its agenda was intact and in progress while asean foreign ministers had an opportunity to air their collective concerns broadly there is a sense among regional think tank analysts and commentators that china is making steady progress in stamping its regional role and agenda the united states may have more stock from its entrenched role and influence since world war ii but the flow of china s expansionist manoeuvres as a rising superpower in southeast asia is inexorable and indispensable as a regional economic locomotive part of it has to do with geography china is a giant resident neighbour that cannot be denied the us by contrast is not only a faraway superpower with domestic divisions but it has fallen behind in soft power and the fight for hearts and minds in southeast asia as widely noted it took the administration of president joe biden five months to send a senior official namely deputy secretary of state wendy sherman to visit southeast asia stopping by jakarta phnom penh and bangkok the follow up virtual conference between her boss secretary of state anthony blinken with asean counterparts did not materialise due to technical difficulties meanwhile mr blinken visited the middle east and president biden toured europe for the g7 meeting in moves that made asean leaders question us priorities leaving china as the necessary alternative superpower to deal with all eyes will be on washington s role and level of representation at the asean centred summits later this year for china the three main priorities that drove the chongqing agenda were myanmar covid 19 and the south china sea on myanmar china has its own issues with the myanmar s armed forces known as the tatmadaw beijing counts on natural gas and cmec china myanmar economic corridor projects with geostrategic linkage from yunnan through myanmar to the indian ocean myanmar is a vital piece of china s geostrategic jigsaw puzzle senior chinese officials have expressed more than once their displeasure with the feb 1 coup yet china together with russia has protected myanmar s military regime at the united nations security council pre empting and diluting what otherwise would have been tough and damning resolutions but on the ground beijing is concerned about rising anti chinese sentiment including popular attacks and arson acts against chinese businesses in many ways the tatmadaw has china snookered not quite blackmailed but squeezed to the extent that china needs myanmar more than myanmar s tatmadaw needs china before the coup chinese top leadership had met and dealt cordially with now imprisoned opposition leader aung san suu kyi back then china had already figured out where myanmar fitted in beijing s bri and broader geostrategic mix the coup changed all that forcing beijing to rethink and refashion the china myanmar relationship this is why the chongqing meeting was an opportunity for china to prod asean to do something after the grouping held a special summit on myanmar on april 24 coming up with a five point consensus that has gone nowhere after nearly two months asean is still divided and undecided about its envoy structure and format on covid 19 china had an easier time it capitalised on earlier mask diplomacy to vaccine diplomacy most asean countries except myanmar and vietnam have used sinovac and sinopharm from donations and sales china also has gained credit for being first in and first out of the pandemic crisis keeping new infections to a minimum for such a large population in contrast to the us and europe here the us is trying to catch up with a recent 500 million dose donation to covax the international vaccine programme but the us s vaccine move is unfocused as opposed to china s targeted vaccine diplomacy to shore up its bri partners and global influence there is still time on the clock for the vaccine race but the us must move faster and smarter if it is to reach parity with china s post pandemic standing on the south china sea the meeting was more perfunctory according to the chinese ministry of foreign affairs mr wang urged to reach the coc at an early date repeating previous calls similarly the south china sea issues are between china and asean claimant states not to be interfered with by outside powers with asean s fragmented stand on myanmar and the south china sea the coc is likely to continue to idle while maritime tensions rise for washington amidst these dynamics there is a rising spectre of the quad among australia india japan and the us replacing the hub spokes alliance system in the us s dealing with china under mr biden in contrast to the barack obama administration when asean centrality was granted a leading role this is where mr obama and mr biden are fundamentally different despite obvious similarities and continuities hailing from the same democratic party and sharing policy experts mr obama was more accommodating and cooperative vis à vis beijing by the time mr biden came to the white house the bipartisan consensus in us policymaking circles had solidified fingering china as a geostrategic rival and competitor while washington has a clear view of china it is still fuzzy on what to do about it overall the recent asean china foreign ministers meeting is to reassure and ensure that bilateral relations are motoring ahead the 30th dialogue anniversary served as a timely occasion in view of the chinese communist party s centennial this year the us is in catch up mode in southeast asia its values agenda on rights freedoms and democracy must be better operationalised and resourced to be more effective other countries in the fray such as japan and australia must think long and hard about where to go and how to deal with beijing s regional clout while the us s footing under mr biden is not yet firm and the eu s indo pacific strategy is still inchoate while india has its hands full at home

sacramento calif california regulators on thursday approved revised workplace pandemic rules that allow employees who are fully vaccinated against the coronavirus the same freedoms as when they are off the job including ending most mask requirements the revised regulations approved by the governor appointed california occupational safety and health standards board come after weeks of confusion the rules adopted in a 5 1 vote now conform with general state guidelines that took effect tuesday by ending most mask rules for vaccinated people gov gavin newsom immediately issued an executive order waiving the usual 10 day legal review the new rules will take effect as soon as they are filed with the secretary of state i have a draft executive order ready to go immediately after they vote to make clarifications public and to provide more certainty the democratic governor said the rules apply in almost every workplace in the state including offices factories and retailers they are intended to ensure that workers are protected while businesses resume normal or near normal activity eric berg deputy chief of health for california s division of occupational safety and health known as cal osha told the board business groups had sought the changes arguing that rules for businesses should conform with state guidelines patterned after the latest federal centers for disease control and prevention recommendations board member laura stock an occupational safety expert who cast the lone opposition vote said that even though people are tired of restrictions the pandemic is not over this has real consequences that people can get sick and die due to exposure in the workplace stock said she said the rules go too far by eliminating physical distancing and workplace partitions and allowing workers to self report their vaccination status mitch steiger a legislative advocate for the california labor federation afl cio similarly objected that the measures essentially pretend that the pandemic is over the move comes after the board did a double twisting backflip in recent weeks when it first postponed then rejected then adopted then rescinded rules that would have allowed workers to forgo masks only if every employee in a room was fully vaccinated against the coronavirus fully vaccinated employees will not need to wear masks except in locations like mass transit and classrooms where they are required for everyone or in the event of outbreaks physical distancing also will end except for certain workers during major outbreaks vaccinated employees won t need to be tested or quarantine unless they show symptoms even if they have close contact with an infected person employers must document that workers who skip masks indoors are indeed fully vaccinated but employers have the choice of requiring workers to show proof of vaccination or allowing employees to self report their status with the employer keeping a record of who does the latter they also could decide to require everyone to remain masked vaccinated or not and vaccinated employees will still be able to wear masks if they choose without facing retaliation rob lapsley president of the california business roundtable said the rules don t fully conform to the state s other standards others argued that they still will cause confusion that s because of the requirement that employers provide masks and keep track of employees vaccination status record keeping that he and others said could create liability and privacy issues they do remain a significant barrier to fully reopening the economy lapsley said katie hansen senior legislative director for the california restaurant association said it is unrealistic to expect unvaccinated employees to remain masked until emergency work rules expire early next year while others generally drop their face coverings the california chamber of commerce took a milder approach thanking newsom for eliminating confusion by pledging to conform workplace rules with the state s loosened pandemic precautions that includes immediately ending social distancing obligations instead of waiting until july 31 as cal osha had initially proposed the chamber also praised a rule change that will require employers to provide the most effective n95 masks for free to unvaccinated employees upon request but others objected that the rule still will require employers to stockpile masks and compete with health care workers despite newsom s promise to provide a one month supply of the masks there were 700 california workplace outbreaks and more than 10 000 infections in the last 30 days cal osha s berg said but he said the n95s are the best alternative as other protections wane robert moutrie a chamber of commerce policy advocate called the latest proposal a measured step that opens too quickly for some businesses and not quickly enough for others but we do think that this is a good step in that direction moutrie said

because of its heavy investment in the sports gambling sector penn national gaming appeared an attractive bet before the covid 19 pandemic but the virus quickly dampened the mood as professional sports leagues shut down operations their future in serious doubt as america learned to manage the crisis penn stock received unprecedented support earlier this year penn had a triple digit price tag before shedding some enthusiasm nevertheless this could be a discounted opportunity for the contrarian investor one of the riches to rags back to riches tales among casino stocks caesars entertainment worked through some tough issues prior to the pandemic when the public health crisis hit though czr found itself threatening to become one of the best stocks under 5 it never got there but it was close since then czr benefitted from an almost miraculous comeback driving up into triple digit territory generating a corporate record in the process another titan in the desert oasis las vegas sands had a tougher route to recovery than other casino stocks with lvs still trading at a discount relative to its pre pandemic level in large part this is because of sin city s dependency on casinos according to information compiled by federal reserve economic data the unemployment rate in las vegas and nearby regions henderson and paradise shot up more than 33 in april 2020 far higher than the national unemployment rate of 14 8 therefore an improved economy should do wonders for lvs stock another sin city stalwart that suffered worrying losses in the price charts was wynn resorts typically sporting a 3 digit price tag wynn shares quickly found themselves in double digit territory as the pandemic made its way into the u s at its lowest intraday basis wynn appeared to be struggling to meet the best stocks under 20 threshold today shares find themselves up 24 year to date partially in anticipation of the return of entertainment and professional conference events one of the most iconic names among the best casino stocks mgm resorts international suffered a catastrophic and seemingly permanent loss of confidence between the 2nd half of february 2020 to a little over the halfway point in march becoming one of the best stocks under 10 for a brief moment shockingly its q2 2020 revenue slipped to 290 million reflecting a dearth in consumer confidence still mgm stock received contrarian investment support as speculators gambled on a full recovery a controversial sector due to the underlying gambling industry casino stocks represent a real time indicator of economic health naturally when people are enjoying the sentiment boost of a bull market they tend to be more open with their wallets subsequently the vaneck vectors gaming etf nasdaq bjk generally follows the ebb and flow of the major investment indices following the devastating covid 19 impact casino stocks bore the brunt of the damage but with the sector bouncing back it also represents the hope of a return to our normal daily routines quick look at the best casino stocks mgm resorts wynn resorts las vegas sands caesars entertainment penn national gaming overview historically the health of the consumer market has a fairly strong direct relationship with casino stocks specifically the university of michigan s consumer sentiment index shares a 64 9 correlation coefficient with the vaneck vectors gaming etf in other words as sentiment rises demand for casino and gaming activities generally rise as well the opposite is also true demand for gaming slips if the consumer economy weakens interestingly casino stocks also provide a real time indication of what people in general might be feeling regarding economic confidence the consumer sentiment index is a lagging indicator whereas casino stocks print their results every trading day on the charts for example the bjk etf began tumbling in 2018 as the u s china trade war heated up but began recovering in the back half of 2019 as relations improved of course the hammer came down in early 2020 when the sars cov 2 virus began spreading wildly back home one of the starkest images of the darkest days of the pandemic came out of las vegas a city that never sleeps looking completely barren because of nationwide lockdown measures and fears among the populace sin city looked like a scene from a post apocalyptic movie set fortunately the narrative of the pandemic didn t end there instead unprecedented government action and cooperation with international partners contributed to the development of vaccines in record breaking time now casino stocks have become emblematic of hope not despair while many challenges remain risk tolerant investors may want to consider adding gaming related investments to their portfolios best online brokers for casino stocks while parallels between stock market investing and casino gambling exist particularly in problematic behaviors found on the spectrum s extreme end it s also fair to point out clear distinctions between the two primarily casinos integrate certain advantages to ensure that in the long run the house always comes out the winner wall street s elite hedge funds have massive resource advantages over the little guys of the market but ultimately no one really knows for sure where stocks will go where public retail investors can tilt the balance in their favor is through education and information therefore your best online brokers for casino stocks may not just revolve around convenience or personal preference instead you should really look into platforms that provide educational literature on better trading tactics below are the best brokers for casino stocks features to look for in casino stocks market presence if you re in the casino business you can easily extract profits assuming you re running a visible well managed enterprise but as with anything in life money or the lure of it attracts substantial competition when circumstances cause an industry to lean out as they did during the pandemic only the best casino stocks survive therefore you should focus your gaming portfolio toward the biggest names in the industry financial resilience late last year the las vegas review journal wrote an insightful but blunt article about its home market s efforts to wean itself off casinos however such initiatives failed because tourism is such a major draw for sin city as a result this desert paradise faces extreme boom bust cycles amazing on the good days dreadful on the bad to handle such volatility consider casino stocks with robust financial stability diversification another important factor to assess regarding these stocks is diversification inevitably a majority of gaming companies are tied to las vegas however the covid 19 pandemic proved that it s never wise to have all your bets in one basket many gambling related businesses that fared relatively well had exposure to several key markets not just to vegas moving forward diversification likely will be a huge determiner for prospective investors rolling the dice on a full recovery you would be forgiven if you gave up entirely on casino stocks when the covid 19 crisis rudely made its entry into the u s in those dark days of 2020 few people needed convincing from their state authorities to hunker down many if not most just did it naturally sadly this created a brutal headwind for the las vegas economy in 2020 visitor volume to sin city totaled slightly over 19 million a staggeringly low number not seen since 1989 but the back half of last year has been much more robust with pent up demand justifying the speculative fervor in these stocks moving forward investors should carefully watch economic developments though many signs offer encouragement the overall situation remains delicate likely a controlled and disciplined approach to casino stocks will work out best in the long run frequently asked questions

vancouver bc accesswire june 17 2021 northern dynasty minerals ltd tsx ndm nyse american nak northern dynasty or the company said a majority decision by the us court of appeals for the ninth circuit announced today in relation to a lawsuit brought by trout unlimited and other environmental groups against the us environmental protection agency epa challenging the federal agency s july 2019 decision to withdraw its previously issued proposed determination with respect to alaska s pebble project means that the case must now be heard and judged on its merits by a federal district court in alaska in april 2020 us district court judge sharon l gleason granted epa s motion to dismiss the case without a hearing stating the plaintiffs had failed to state a claim upon which relief can be granted today s decision by the ninth circuit court of appeals reversed in part the lower court ruling and remanded it back to federal district court in alaska for additional proceedings to determine whether the withdrawal was arbitrary capricious an abuse of discretion or contrary to law one of the three judges on the ninth circuit panel that issued today s decision wrote a lengthy dissent opposing the majority decision the plaintiffs a collection of anti development activists led by trout unlimited challenged the epa s authority to withdraw its prior regulatory action under section 404 c of the clean water act initiated in 2014 by the obama administration which sought to preemptively veto the pebble project before a permit application had been filed or an environmental impact statement permitting process was undertaken northern dynasty president ceo ron thiessen said in his view the us federal government should prevail at the district court level and the epa s decision to withdraw its prior proposed determination should be upheld this case was summarily dismissed last year by a federal judge in alaska because the plaintiffs failed to state a cause of action that was reviewable by the courts he said today s split decision by the ninth circuit does not strengthen the plaintiffs case accordingly we believe the federal government should prevail when the case is

new york the s p 500 ended thursday barely changed after stocks sloshed around in mixed trading as investors make preparations for a future where the federal reserve is no longer doing everything it can to keep interest rates super low markets around the world were mixed but mostly calm after investors in asia and europe got their first chance to react to the federal reserve s signaling on wednesday that it may start raising short term interest rates by late 2023 the fed s chair also said it began discussing the possibility of slowing its bond buying program such support has been a key reason for the stock market s resurgence to records with the most recent coming monday the s p 500 slipped 1 84 points or less than 0 1 percent to 4 221 86 after earlier meandering from a 0 2 percent gain to a 0 7 percent loss most of the stocks in the index and across wall street were lower but gains for apple microsoft and a few other tech heavyweights helped offset the losses the dow jones industrial average dropped 210 22 or 0 6 percent to 33 823 45 while the nasdaq composite rose 121 67 or 0 9 percent to 14 161 35 lifted by the gains for tech and other high growth stocks in the bond market the yield on the 10 year treasury note gave back nearly all of its spurt from a day before it fell back to 1 51 percent from 1 57 percent late wednesday the two year yield which tends to move more with expectations for fed actions was steadier it rose to 0 22 percent from 0 21 percent advertisement the first action the fed is likely to take would be a slowdown in its 120 billion of monthly bond purchases which are helping to keep mortgages cheap but the fed s chair said such a tapering is still likely a ways away any easing up on the fed s aid for the economy would be a big change for markets which have feasted on easy conditions after the central bank slashed short term rates to zero and brought in other emergency programs while the economy still needs support the recovery is proving to be strong enough that it does not need the same emergency measures taken at the beginning of the pandemic said stephanie link chief investment strategist and portfolio manager at hightower we are going to get a taper she said they need to we do not need emergency stimulus at this point the economy has begun to explode out of its coma as more widespread vaccinations help the world get closer to normal at the same time jumps in prices for raw materials are forcing companies across the economy to raise their own prices for customers from fast food to used cars that s fueling concerns about inflation much of the concern is whether rising inflation will be temporary as the fed expects or more long lasting the reality could be more mixed the rise in commodity prices is likely tied to increases in demand as the economy recovers but rising wages will likely be longer lasting as employers increase pay in order to attract workers link said advertisement investors got a bit of disappointing economic news when the labor department said the number of americans who filed for unemployment benefits last week rose slightly the total of 412 000 workers filing for jobless benefits was worse than economists expected if it proves to be a trend rather than an aberration it could push the fed to hold the line longer on its support for the economy stocks of companies whose profits are most closely tied to the strength of the economy and to interest rates had some of the market s sharpest losses energy stocks in the s p 500 fell 3 5 percent after the price of crude oil sagged banks struggled after the drop in longer term yields hurt prospects for the profits they can make from lending bank of america fell 4 4 percent and jpmorgan chase lost 2 9 percent raw material producers were also weak with miner newmont down 7 percent after the price of gold fell 4 7 percent gold tends to struggle when the federal reserve is raising interest rates on the winning side were big tech oriented companies which have dominated the stock market for years as they ve continued to grow almost regardless of the economy s strength amazon rose 2 2 percent microsoft gained 1 4 percent and apple added 1 3 percent homebuilder lennar rose 3 6 percent after reporting second quarter profit and revenue that beat wall street forecasts in europe german and french stocks ticked modestly higher while the ftse 100 in london slipped 0 4 percent in asia japan s nikkei 225 fell 0 9 percent and south korea s kospi lost 0 4 percent but hong kong s hang seng rose 0 4 percent send questions comments to the editors

states across the country are scrambling to close their government offices friday after president joe biden signed legislation establishing juneteenth as a us federal holiday while june 19 which commemorates the end of slavery in the united states falls on a saturday this year governors across the country announced in quick succession a range of plans for their state offices friday the closest workday to the new holiday many states like maryland nebraska missouri west virginia and alabama will give most public employees the day off but government workers in other states like california will have to wait to feel the effect of the new law it is encouraging to see bipartisan efforts to recognize the importance of juneteenth a spokesperson for california gov gavin newsom s office said in a statement the governor issues a proclamation each year to celebrate this important day at the state level establishing a holiday usually requires legislation and collective bargaining similarly in washington dc many district employees will continue serving to maintain essential district operations according to a news release from mayor muriel bowser s office this includes walk up vaccination sites the department of motor vehicles and the department of parks and recreation and while the district s schools will be closed high school graduation ceremonies will commence the patchwork of responses underscores the rarity of a new federal holiday juneteenth is the first one to be established since martin luther king jr day in 1983 and becomes at least the eleventh federal holiday recognized by the us federal government on the federal level the us office of personnel management announced in a memo that most federal employees would have friday off agencies should direct such employees to not report to work on friday unless the agency determines that their services are required if employees are required to work during qualifying holiday hours they will earn holiday premium pay the memo said a meeting of vaccine advisers to the us centers for disease control and prevention that was scheduled for friday was also rescheduled because of the juneteenth holiday while private businesses aren t bound by federal holidays like government agencies many major corporations are celebrating juneteenth in a similar way us corporate employees at apple will have friday off as will employees of lyft and peloton other companies like google struck a middle ground eliminating meetings on friday in honor of the holiday the new york stock exchange will also be open friday juneteenth commemorates june 19 1865 when union maj gen gordon granger announced the end of slavery in galveston texas in accordance with president abraham lincoln s 1863 emancipation proclamation the legislation which was passed by the house on wednesday gained momentum following black lives matter protests sparked by the police killing of george floyd last year it passed the senate on tuesday after wisconsin republican sen ron johnson who blocked the legislation in 2020 dropped his objection
china s economic success is the result of the cpc s competent leadership and carefully thought out development model ma xuejing china daily the communist party of china is celebrating its 100th anniversary this year the cpc has come a long way to establish itself as a leading force promoting the cause of national revival in 1949 when the people s republic of china was founded it was a less developed country with hundreds of millions of people living in poverty and illiteracy after passing through a series of critical tests and crises the cpc has become even stronger and more confident in leading the chinese people on the path to the country s great rejuvenation in 1978 the party led and supported the discussion that practice is the only test of truth which has been of great importance in lifting the country out of chaos and turning the country into the world s second largest economy especially since the cpc initiated the policy of reform and opening up in 1978 which enabled china to lift more than 800 million people out of abject poverty according to the world bank s international poverty standard united nations secretary general antonio guterres praised this feat saying china is the country that has made the greatest contribution to reducing poverty in the world as it accounted for more than 70 percent of the global population lifted out of poverty over the same time period while previously most people in china did not have access to health insurance today more than 96 percent of the population is covered by it as the world s largest developing country china s successful experience in poverty eradication and providing health insurance coverage has attracted worldwide attention achieving the goals and objectives in the state building of any country is impossible without a solid economic foundation from 1952 to 2019 the volume of chinese industrial production increased almost 1 000 times with an average annual growth rate of 11 percent per capita income has increased 70 times in addition in 1978 china s exports amounted to 10 billion which is less than 1 percent of world trade by the end of 2020 exports had increased to a record 2 49 trillion which made china the world s largest country trading in goods no other country in the world has ever experienced such dynamic development as a result of the ongoing reforms china s gdp per capita has grown from less than 200 four decades ago to more than 11 000 today over the past decades china s achievements have been notable not only because of their scale but also because of the global economic shocks that have recurred during this period the chinese leadership has coped with these very successfully and after each crisis the economy has become stronger and narrowed the gap with the biggest economy in the world the united states the 1997 98 asian crisis an event that set back a number of other asian economies for many years the bursting of the dot com bubble in financial markets in 2001 the devastating financial crisis of 2007 08 from which many economies and their societies may not have really recovered and of course the current covid 19 pandemic which has led to the largest economic downturn worldwide since the 1930s during the pandemic against the backdrop of a sharp decline in global transnational direct investment foreign direct investment in china in 2020 increased by 6 2 percent and reached about 1 trillion yuan 144 38 billion at the end of 2020 analysts at the british center for economic and business research said in a report that china s economy will become the largest economy in the world in 2028 five years earlier than previously predicted it must be recognized that china s outstanding economic success is the result of the cpc s competent leadership and a carefully thought out development model implemented through trial and error china s leaders are well educated and capable civil servants many of whom have postgraduate degrees from leading universities at home and abroad the chinese way of careful planning and review of the results of each five year plan is a good example of how to achieve high global development results in all areas of the country s socioeconomic life the competence of china s leaders is evidenced by their approach to economic development a pragmatic experimental gradual and strong leadership style the cpc has achieved overwhelming domestic recognition and approval polls from the harvard kennedy school show that more than 90 percent of chinese people trust the cpc led government a recent study published by york university in canada in may 2021 shows that the new coronavirus outbreak has further increased chinese citizens confidence in their governments 93 percent at the county level 94 percent at the city level and 95 percent at the provincial level in november last year president xi jinping said that by 2035 the size of the national economy and gdp per capita will double and the 14th five year plan 2021 25 will lead china toward becoming a high income country by the end of the 14th five year plan china aims to be one of the most innovative countries in the world and its longer term goal is to make significant breakthroughs in innovation by 2035 as part of the dual circulation development paradigm technological innovation will boost china s manufacturing industry and propel it up the

each of the 12 members of the cdc s acip committee has a significant influence on the health of nearly every member of the american population because they are responsible for adding to and or altering the national vaccine schedule it is of critical importance that they remain objective and unbiased before determining whether a new vaccination is appropriate for use particularly in the bodies of vulnerable young children unfortunately a significant number of acip committee members receive direct financial returns when more vaccinations are added to the current schedule many own vaccination related patent s and or stock shares of the pharmaceutical companies responsible for supplying new vaccines to the public we are primarily funded by readers please subscribe and donate to support us others receive research grant money funding for their academic departments or payments for the oversight of vaccine safety trials www lawfirms com resources environment environment health cdc members own more 50 patents connected vaccinations
the current vaccine crisis in the midst of a pandemic could be a tipping point for the current order of global governance the global policy response and vaccine rollout have proven too inept to counter the catastrophic moral failure of affluent countries vaccine hoarding the who director general s performative pleas for vaccine equity have done little to move an intransigent system of global governance to address an emergency of this scale what do these overlapping and related failures mean at national and international levels the covid 19 pandemic is different from the other recent pandemics sars mers caused by zoonotic coronaviruses covid 19 has spread beyond asia it has proliferated around the world devastating social political and economic activity the pandemic s impact on rights justice and entitlements has damaged not just physical health but also psycho social wellbeing and led to the unprecedented collapse of national health systems most visibly in affluent countries causing millions to succumb to the virus in response governments everywhere leaned on a combination of public health measures and social security supports while non pharmaceutical interventions lockdown as the prime example and test track care models proved effective in reducing infections and fatalities for example in new zealand south korea and vietnam many countries including affluent ones notably the usa under trump were reluctant to fully implement these public health measures because of short sighted economic concerns besides social security safety nets were inadequate to meet people s real needs in many countries such as india or south africa as income food child education and other basic needs went unaddressed people s trust in government already fragile in many countries was further eroded photo health checks in india credit gwydion m williams flickr cc by 2 0 the social link with vaccine nationalism in the absence of a cure or standard treatment protocols vaccines represent a new hope not only to prevent infection but also to restore general physical social and mental wellbeing the vaccine means social economic and even political liberation access to vaccines is not simply a matter of being able to receive a jab but a complex mix of social economic political and technological factors a sort of culture of cure more than a simple medicine to remedy or prevent a disease this new culture of cure can fix all the pandemic induced abnormalities in our daily lives the popular perception of the vaccine as a fix all has a profound impact on national level policy making since vaccine research began scientists have been engaged in the development of several vaccine candidates to prevent infection politics meanwhile has been scrambling to leverage leverage this is the ratio between funds borrowed for investment and the personal funds or equity that backs them up a company may have borrowed much more than its capitalized value in which case it is said to be highly leveraged the more highly a company is leveraged the higher the risk associated with lending to the company but higher also are the possible profits that it may realise as compared with its own value the same vaccine candidates potency as a social medicine to cure the social and economic ills brought about by the restrictions used to fight the pandemic dangling a cure for social ills has helped politicians and national leaders to breathe new life into the social contracts upon which they depend access to vaccines for their citizens means an escape from pandemic produced discontent with the state market society relationship thus vaccine nationalism has become a political programme particularly in affluent countries to regain lost trust of their citizens however such national level actions contaminate international vaccine collaboration profoundly as evidenced by the world wide distribution of vaccine doses of the 1 8 billion vaccine doses produced to 28 may 2021 85 per cent have gone to high and upper middle income countries and just 0 3 per cent to low income countries even in india where more than 60 per cent of the world s vaccines are produced barely three per cent of the populations was fully vaccinated at the end of may the misad venture of covax this scandalous inequity in vaccine distribution raises doubts about the efficacy of the global vaccine coordination framework covax covax was conceived as a vaccine pool for the world from which 190 countries could equally access vaccines with distribution calculated based on epidemiological risk and progressively covering entire populations in all countries free doses were also pledged to all 92 low income countries but in reality against the commitment of delivering two billion free doses to low income countries by the end of 2021 covax has so far delivered just 3 4 per cent of this target in the first five months of 2021 the problem with covax is not its stated intentions but the diverse interests of the multiple actors it involves it is a multistakeholder group where the who shares space with the bill and melinda gates foundation led coalition for epidemic preparedness innovations cepi and the gavi global vaccine alliance the role and involvement of the who in such initiatives is always questionable in covax who is just another partner providing technical and management assistance but not in charge of financial resource control and without independent decision making authority in the absence of an urgently needed un owned response the countries participating in covax are also allowed to separately purchase vaccines from pharmaceutical companies consequently governments and companies have struck bilateral deals approximately 56 by the first quarter of 2021 to procure vaccines outside the covax pool such deals are a win win for both companies and rich countries companies can charge higher prices because of the many contenders for the product and rich countries can ensure fast delivery of doses not only for their own population but also to leverage in diplomatic relations in reality countries like the usa or canada have already ordered more than four or five times as many vaccines as they need to protect their populations this has three significant consequences first covax has lost its monopsony power to fix or regulate the vaccine candidates prices worldwide which could otherwise have made all the candidates available at much cheaper rates second pharmaceutical companies are also giving priority to bilateral deals over covax to supply the doses since rich countries have chosen them instead of covax for advance orders of vaccines this ultimately leaves covax underfinanced and stuck waiting for doses to distribute among its members especially low income countries vaccine citizenship in the land of patented knowledge the success of a covax like initiative has been in doubt since its inception many of the covax donors and supporters such as the eu the uk germany canada japan and australia are blocking a trips waiver proposal at the world trade organisation wto world trade organisation the wto founded on 1st january 1995 replaced the general agreement on trade and tariffs gatt the main innovation is that the wto enjoys the status of an international organization its role is to ensure that no member states adopt any kind of protectionism whatsoever in order to accelerate the liberalization global trading and to facilitate the strategies of the multinationals it has an international court the dispute settlement body which judges any alleged violations of its founding text drawn up in marrakesh wto to protect covid 19 related patents moreover the bill and melinda gates foundation which incidentally is part of covax through gavi and cepi persuaded oxford university to retract its original assurance of a no patent vaccine and instead tied pharma giant astrazeneca into manufacturing a patented vaccine the vaccine shortage could be easily resolved by granting access to the necessary knowledge and technology to manufacturers around the world however pharmaceutical companies are fighting any such efforts to share share a unit of ownership interest in a corporation or financial asset representing one part of the total capital stock its owner a shareholder is entitled to receive an equal distribution of any profits distributed a dividend and to attend shareholder meetings vaccine know how with other manufacturers the same reason is also behind another failed attempt by the who to create a knowledge pool for access to covid 19 related technology c tap so far not a single pharmaceutical company has found enough motivation to join the c tap pool and voluntarily share knowledge treatments and technology it is a forbidding paradox that the invention of the most sought after vaccine candidate of this pandemic mrna research was the product of mostly publicly funded decades long knowledge collaboration among various scientists laboratories and various national institutes but the innovation of an mrna vaccine product development manufacturing and distribution is now shackled to knowledge protection for private profit profit the positive gain yielded from a company s activity net profit is profit after tax distributable profit is the part of the net profit which can be distributed to the shareholders the row over a trips waiver for covid 19 vaccine patent reflects the role of knowledge in capital formation as well as accumulation the primacy of knowledge protection as an intangible asset over human lives has instigated a new culture of counter politics which is not driven by national leaders as in the case of vaccine nationalism but ordinary people are questioning the practice of knowledge protection over human lives beyond the politics of a trips waiver this monopolistic knowledge is also instrumental in ideating a socially shared space of pandemic free territory where vaccinated people can feel they belong people deprived of vaccines across the world have reckoned with the fact that patented knowledge is the barrier to access to vaccines and thus access to pandemic free territory this undeniably triggers the current global outcry against big pharma and domestic public actions have followed the leading example may be india where the government had to halt vaccine exports risking diplomatic commitments after facing public ire in the aftermath of a second wave of corona and a nation wide vaccine shortage in global politics supporters of trips waivers earlier led by india and south africa and now co sponsored by 62 lower middle and low income countries knowing very well about the exclusivity of any pandemic free territory in the current order are in negotiation with the global governance actors especially the wto to win the right to manufacture vaccines in the form of a waiver this negotiation is nothing more than the seizure of vaccination rights from people residing in the global south this politics of vaccine entitlement is constructing globally a new social category vaccine citizenship unlike vaccine nationalism vaccine citizenship is neither limited to any boundary nor capable of making advance deals with the companies but a just society that transcends borders intends to break the capital knowledge chain and unites people to petition for access to vaccine photo airport ground crew load part of the first consignment of covid 19 vaccines for somalia onto a waiting truck at the aden abdulle international airport in mogadishu on 15 march 2021 credit amisom public information flickr public domain geo political governance and no more global governance the emerging category of vaccine citizenship is veiled behind the negotiation of a trips waiver the ills of global governance often lead to such groupings though usually on a much smaller scale and with limited reach all over the world the presence of various patient groups and networks are examples of global health governance injustices big pharma is not challenged by individual national laws thanks to the safeguard of trips provides or of late trips plus contributing to extreme commercialisation of care and treatment and leaving so many people either to die or go untreated the present structure of global health governance is responsible for this hapless situation where non state actors with conflicting interests pursue their goals while keeping multilaterals in confidence in the 1990s international health governance lapsed into global health governance bringing a sea change in the domain of health the reduced importance of inter governmental or multilateral actors over the decades primarily because of underfunding of the un system made non state actors more powerful in un decision making platforms it is increasingly difficult to find global health mechanisms that is not a global public private partnership in such partnerships private interests are protected while people s participation is crippled thus the accountability though always tainted of global health governance is left in doubt especially in the aftermath of a pandemic the decay of multilateralism has created a void in inter governmental collaborations which is otherwise the need of the hour countries are giving priority to more bilateral relations over multilateral alliances the global financial safety net gfsn tracker reveals that in the advent of covid 19 countries have used more bilateral channels disbursed 1 75 trillion than the international monetary fund imf international monetary fund along with the world bank the imf was founded on the day the bretton woods agreements were signed its first mission was to support the new system of standard exchange rates when the bretton wood fixed rates system came to an end in 1971 the main function of the imf became that of being both policeman and fireman for global capital it acts as policeman when it enforces its structural adjustment policies and as fireman when it steps in to help out governments in risk of defaulting on debt repayments as for the world bank a weighted voting system operates depending on the amount paid as contribution by each member state 85 of the votes is required to modify the imf charter which means that the usa with 17 68 of the votes has a de facto veto on any change the institution is dominated by five countries the united states 16 74 japan 6 23 germany 5 81 france 4 29 and the uk 4 29 the other 183 member countries are divided into groups led by one country the most important one 6 57 of the votes is led by belgium the least important group of countries 1 55 of the votes is led by gabon and brings together african countries disbursed 108 billion and regional financing arrangements disbursed 3 8 billion to access financial support as of march 2021 in the case of world bank world bank wb the world bank was founded as part of the new international monetary system set up at bretton woods in 1944 its capital is provided by member states contributions and loans on the international money markets it financed public and private projects in third world and east european countries it consists of several closely associated institutions among which 1 the international bank for reconstruction and development ibrd 189 members in 2017 which provides loans in productive sectors such as farming or energy 2 the international development association ida 159 members in 1997 which provides less advanced countries with long term loans 35 40 years at very low interest 1 3 the international finance corporation ifc which provides both loan and equity finance for business ventures in developing countries as third world debt gets worse the world bank along with the imf tends to adopt a macro economic perspective for instance it enforces adjustment policies that are intended to balance heavily indebted countries payments the world bank advises those countries that have to undergo the imf s therapy on such matters as how to reduce budget deficits round up savings enduce foreign investors to settle within their borders or free prices and exchange rates it seems the lending is not matching the covid 19 crisis the world bank disbursements in 2020 increased by just 0 3 per cent of gdp gdp gross domestic product gross domestic product is an aggregate measure of total production within a given territory equal to the sum of the gross values added the measure is notoriously incomplete for example it does not take into account any activity that does not enter into a commercial exchange the gdp takes into account both the production of goods and the production of services economic growth is defined as the variation of the gdp from one period to another whereas it predicts a gdp decline of 4 1 per cent between 2019 and 2020 in the median low income country the over dependency on bilateral swaps is undesirable as they are less transparent and accountable compared to multilateral lending these deals are usually run chiefly on the interests of economically powerful countries and often in competitive exchanges geo political interests trump inter governmental collaboration in vaccine donations too one study found that the majority of donations given by china india israel and russia were based on the countries strategic and economic interests apart from new zealand and france most countries prefer to donate their excess vaccines through diplomatic channels and not through covax hence vaccine diplomacy may address the shortage of vaccines in specific contexts and serve national interests too but it is unlikely to advance global vaccine equity equity the capital put into an enterprise by the shareholders not to be confused with hard capital or unsecured debt in this pandemic bilateral diplomacy is creating more competition than collaboration at the moment the usa and china are at loggerheads over vaccine diplomacy to expand or preserve their geo political influence the same is found in bilateral swaps where the us federal reserve fed federal reserve officially federal reserve system is the united states central bank created in 1913 by the federal reserve act also called the owen glass act after a series of banking crises particularly the bank panic of 1907 fed decentralized central bank us fed and the people s bank of china pboc are way ahead of others in offering financial aid hence the us which traditionally favours patent conditionalities support for a trips waiver is undeniably a good thing but it is also a counter to china s world wide vaccine diplomacy this pandemic is the foremost example of why the world needs a state actor owned and led international system of governance otherwise there will always be truncated forms of crisis management where transnational corporations multinational organisations and individual countries mostly economically dominant will try to prise benefits from governance systems that are not fit for purpose furthermore these multi stakeholder approaches fuel the rivalry between member states forging muscular nationalisms and risking global peace and prosperity internationalism the liberated immunity this pandemic is indeed a crisis but it is also a much awaited opportunity the pandemic has paved the way for the construction of a new socio cultural dimension of cure which is hitherto applicable only for the patients mostly from the lower rung of society suffering from poor diseases such as hiv tb malaria the path of access to treatment medicine or vaccines is a new qualifier in this regard current forms of global governance are unable to comprehend this culture of cure that has changed the utility function of vaccine from preventive medicine to social medicine what is more challenged by a pandemic global governance s chief development methodology global public private partnership is proving counterproductive access to vaccines is now a matter of competitive nationalism and thwarting global alliances likewise covax is causing disequilibrium in vaccine procurement and resulting in global public inequity against the backdrop of these complicated governance outcomes the debate over support for a trips waiver may appear as a typical north versus south fight but that is perversely counter intuitive gone is the unipolar world where a handful of affluent countries like the g7 monopolise governance space in this new multipolar world countries with different status both affluent and emerging economies such as the g20 g20 the group of twenty g20 or g 20 is a group made up of nineteen countries and the european union whose ministers central bank directors and heads of state meet regularly it was created in 1999 after the series of financial crises in the 1990s its aim is to encourage international consultation on the principle of broadening dialogue in keeping with the growing economic importance of a certain number of countries its members are argentina australia brazil canada china france germany italy india indonesia japan mexico russia saudi arabia south africa south korea turkey usa uk and the european union represented by the presidents of the council and of the european central bank share governing platforms with non state actors this multipolar world prioritises market friendly governance at the behest of the capital politics nexus all over the world thus global governance platforms are exclusive to economic giants only both state and non state actors but not to the world s majority of low and middle income countries and other international communities this dearth of inclusiveness constrains global governance from representing the people primarily this gaping void has now given rise to a global identity people who demand vaccine citizenship this demand cannot be addressed through geo political governance rather it will eventually redraw the atlas again into two or three worlds this crisis can be solved only by reviving faith in international governance and strengthening multilateral institutes neither transnational corporations nor bilateral deals can secure vaccines for all it is the multilaterals that can energise public procurement of vaccines in cash starved countries in this emergency the demand for vaccine citizenship is an opportune moment to create bonds between people across borders this is a time to shoot for progressive internationalism with a call for public vaccines using public finance for vaccine research development and manufacturing an alluring alternative to the incentivised patent protected profit churning private vaccines global solidarity networks and movements such as the people s health movement may align with progressive non violent agitations unions and associations of farmers students trade union workers employees gender rights groups and other voices at the national level domestic pressure for a global cause vaccination for all could forge international solidarity in these times of crisis the world is in need of a politics of solidarity the various grassroots based community initiatives active across the world are breaking the barriers of identities as well as challenging divisive capital politics linkages to embrace each other community collectives in india quarantine students youth network brazil favela based groups and many other countries are examples of how individuals from various walks of life can come together to help others during the course of the pandemic this is a lesson for larger politics to realise that people in need always come together on the basis of solidarity the pandemic has devastated the lives of people who have always been at the hard end of the global order of capital s systematic exploitation for ever exploited people vaccinations are no longer just an immunity from the virus but an inspiration of liberty from the pandemic related restrictions too vaccine equity is a programme of global liberation from the restraints of global public private partnership for international organisations vaccine internationalism is the politics of global justice and peoples solidarity

a teller counts and arranges dollar notes at an agricultural bank of china branch in qionghai hainan province an earlier than expected tightening of monetary conditions in the united states may disrupt global financial markets and increase risks in the second half of the year experts said on thursday after the us federal reserve released hawkish sounding statements fed officials signaled that the first rate hike in the us since the covid 19 pandemic outbreak may happen as early as 2023 an indication that the us central bank is tightening its monetary stance earlier than expected amid predictions of faster economic growth and sharply higher inflation this year the fed projections were released at the end of a two day policy meeting on wednesday soon after the meeting the s p 500 index declined by 0 54 percent while a huge sell off was seen in us government bonds with the yield on five year treasurys rising by 0 12 percentage point to 0 895 percent fed chairman jerome powell said after the policy meeting that the tapering process or reducing asset purchases would be orderly methodical and transparent and any adjustment would be communicated well in advance the fed s shift toward a more hawkish monetary policy stance also reflects its inflation concerns the tapering may start in the second half which depends on the us employment performance and whether the rate hike will happen earlier than what has been decided will depend on the sustainability of inflation in the coming years said zhu jianfang chief economist with citic securities we should keep an eye on the higher real rates and strengthened us dollar in the second half said zhu china s foreign exchange self disciplinary mechanism an organization of the people s bank of china the central bank said on wednesday that any withdrawal of the quantitative easing could put pressure on the chinese currency other factors that can fuel fluctuations in the foreign exchange market include the bursting of asset bubbles and the return of cross border capital flows to the us along with rising risk aversion the pboc has already normalized its monetary policy and used conventional policy tools it is unlikely to adjust benchmark interest rates neither hikes nor cuts to deal with the us monetary tightening but potential risks will be watched said freddy wong managing director and head of asia pacific of the fixed income department at invesco a us investment firm the pboc is expected to maintain a neutral policy stance while beijing may rely more on its fiscal policy to prevent economic downward risks in the july to december period experts said lu ting chief economist with nomura expects the chinese authorities to speed up government bond issuances and fine tune credit policies to avoid an economic slowdown with the year on year outstanding total social financing growth subsequently rebounding to above 11 percent thereafter us officials however consider the sharply rising inflation a reflection of transitory factors when economic activity and employment have strengthened amid the progress on vaccinations and strong policy support under the adjusted monetary policy framework the federal open market committee will aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time with inflation having run persistently below this longer run goal according to the meeting statement before achieving the goals of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation in the long run the fed has committed to maintain an accommodative monetary policy stance the fomc would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the committee s goals said the statement the us fed had pushed back aggressively on the market s attempt to reprice its path to raise interest rates as mentioned in its latest meeting its response aligned with similar messages from the european central bank the reserve bank of australia and the bank of canada has made it clear that monetary policy will remain exceptionally accommodative for the foreseeable future said wong from invesco central banks in developed markets have become more reactive and will likely need to see significantly higher and self sustaining inflation especially through wage increases before tightening financial conditions said wong who expected the overwhelming global monetary and fiscal policy response to the pandemic to continue

washington cnn most federal government employees across the country have friday off after president joe biden signed legislation establishing juneteenth as a us federal holiday but the introduction of a new federal holiday to commemorate the end of slavery in the united states has created a patchwork of responses leaving some government offices schools and businesses open while others close to observe the holiday agencies should direct such employees to not report to work on friday unless the agency determines that their services are required if employees are required to work during qualifying holiday hours they will earn holiday premium pay the us office of personnel management announced thursday in a memo a meeting of vaccine advisers to the us centers for disease control and prevention that was scheduled for friday was also rescheduled because of the juneteenth holiday states and schools closed while june 19 falls on a saturday this year governors across the country announced in quick succession a range of plans for their state offices friday the closest workday to the new holiday maryland nebraska missouri west virginia and alabama are giving most public employees the day off joining states like texas virginia new york massachusetts and washington which had already made juneteenth a paid state holiday some of the largest colleges and universities like ohio state and texas a m are closed and have canceled classes for the day several colleges including harvard university georgetown university virginia tech columbia university the university of

and making june 19 a federal holiday usps said it s not possible to cease the operations of the postal service to accommodate an observance over the next 24 48 hours and that closing without providing appropriate time would lead to service disruptions in washington dc many district employees will continue serving to maintain essential district operations according to a news release from mayor muriel bowser s office this includes walk up vaccination sites the department of motor vehicles and the department of parks and recreation and while the district s schools are closed high school graduation ceremonies will commence government workers in other states like california will have to wait to feel the effect of the new law it is encouraging to see bipartisan efforts to recognize the importance of juneteenth a spokesperson for california gov gavin newsom s office said in a statement the governor issues a proclamation each year to celebrate this important day at the state level establishing a holiday usually requires legislation and collective bargaining some public school districts are closed with many already on summer break in maryland for example montgomery county public schools which ended the school year wednesday and its offices are closed friday to observe juneteenth while baltimore county public schools remain open friday with their last day scheduled for next week cities and localities also differ as to whether they re observing the holiday boston st louis pittsburgh and portland oregon have closed most offices for the day san francisco mayor london breed announced that juneteenth would be observed friday but due to the short notice city hall will remain open with minimal staffing to continue providing services in new york city public schools and most government offices are open friday city employees do not have a paid holiday despite mayor bill de blasio s promise last year to make juneteenth an official city holiday during a radio interview on wnyc friday de blasio said his administration still has to negotiate with the city s unions about how to pay for the impact of the holiday but that schools will be closed on juneteenth when the holiday falls on a weekday private businesses while private businesses aren t bound by federal holidays the way that government agencies are many major corporations are celebrating juneteenth in a similar way us corporate employees at apple have friday off as do employees of lyft and peloton other companies like google struck a middle ground eliminating meetings on friday in honor of the

new york ap the s p 500 ended thursday barely changed after stocks sloshed around in mixed trading as investors make preparations for a future where the federal reserve is no longer doing everything it can to keep interest rates super low markets around the world were mixed but mostly calm after investors in asia and europe got their first chance to react to the federal reserve s signaling on wednesday that it may start raising short term interest rates by late 2023 the fed s chair also said it began discussing the possibility of slowing its bond buying program such support has been a key reason for the stock market s resurgence to records with the most recent coming monday the s p 500 slipped 1 84 points or less than 0 1 to 4 221 86 after earlier meandering from a 0 2 gain to a 0 7 loss most of the stocks in the index and across wall street were lower but gains for apple microsoft and a few other tech heavyweights helped offset the losses the dow jones industrial average dropped 210 22 or 0 6 to 33 823 45 while the nasdaq composite rose 121 67 or 0 9 to 14 161 35 lifted by the gains for tech and other high growth stocks in the bond market the yield on the 10 year treasury note gave back nearly all of its spurt from a day before it fell back to 1 51 from 1 57 late wednesday the two year yield which tends to move more with expectations for fed actions was steadier it rose to 0 22 from 0 21 brand connections the first action the fed is likely to take would be a slowdown in its 120 billion of monthly bond purchases which are helping to keep mortgages cheap but the fed s chair said such a tapering is still likely a ways away any easing up on the fed s aid for the economy would be a big change for markets which have feasted on easy conditions after the central bank slashed short term rates to zero and brought in other emergency programs while the economy still needs support the recovery is proving to be strong enough that it does not need the same emergency measures taken at the beginning of the pandemic said stephanie link chief investment strategist and portfolio manager at hightower we are going to get a taper she said they need to we do not need emergency stimulus at this point the economy has begun to explode out of its coma as more widespread vaccinations help the world get closer to normal at the same time jumps in prices for raw materials are forcing companies across the economy to raise their own prices for customers from fast food to used cars that s fueling concerns about inflation much of the concern is whether rising inflation will be temporary as the fed expects or more long lasting the reality could be more mixed the rise in commodity prices is likely tied to increases in demand as the economy recovers but rising wages will likely be longer lasting as employers increase pay in order to attract workers link said investors got a bit of disappointing economic news when the labor department said the number of americans who filed for unemployment benefits last week rose slightly the total of 412 000 workers filing for jobless benefits was worse than economists expected if it proves to be a trend rather than an aberration it could push the fed to hold the line longer on its support for the economy stocks of companies whose profits are most closely tied to the strength of the economy and to interest rates had some of the market s sharpest losses energy stocks in the s p 500 fell 3 5 after the price of crude oil sagged banks struggled after the drop in longer term yields hurt prospects for the profits they can make from lending bank of america fell 4 4 and jpmorgan chase lost 2 9 raw material producers were also weak with miner newmont down 7 after the price of gold fell 4 7 gold tends to struggle when the federal reserve is raising interest rates on the winning side were big tech oriented companies which have dominated the stock market for years as they ve continued to grow almost regardless of the economy s strength amazon rose 2 2 microsoft gained 1 4 and apple added 1 3 homebuilder lennar rose 3 6 after reporting second quarter profit and revenue that beat wall street forecasts in europe german and french stocks ticked modestly higher while the ftse 100 in london slipped 0 4 in asia japan s nikkei 225 fell 0 9 and south korea s kospi lost 0 4 but hong kong s hang seng rose 0 4

in this photo taken sept 10 2019 a detainee works in a kitchen area at the geo groups immigration jail in tacoma wash during a media tour after nearly four years of litigation and pandemic related delays a federal jury on tuesday june 15 2021 began deliberating whether the geo group must pay minimum wage to detainees who perform cooking cleaning and other tasks at the facility instead of the 1 per day they typically receive ap photo ted s warren seattle a trial over whether the geo group must pay minimum wage instead of 1 a day to immigration detainees who perform tasks like cooking and cleaning at its for profit detention center in washington state has ended with a hung jury u s district judge robert bryan in tacoma declared a mistrial thursday after the nine person jury indicated they could not reach unanimous agreement following a two week trial and about two days of deliberation recommended videos nobody s happy but nobody lost bryan told the attorneys afterward democratic washington attorney general bob ferguson sued the florida based geo group in 2017 saying the company had unjustly profited by running the northwest detention center in tacoma now known as the northwest ice processing center on the backs of captive workers a separate lawsuit filed on behalf of detainees was also filed that year seeking back pay the judge who rejected several attempts by geo to dismiss the lawsuits consolidated the cases for trial which he conducted via zoom because of the pandemic the judge said he expected that the cases would be set for a new trial geo a multi billion dollar for profit prison corporation that is publicly traded on the new york stock exchange pays workers 1 a day or less to perform essential services necessary to maintain the northwest ice processing center ferguson said in a written statement thursday a hung jury allows us to re try the claim again in front of a new jury geo maintained that the detainees were not employees under the washington minimum wage act even if they were the company said it would be unlawfully discriminatory for washington to require geo to pay them minimum wage now 13 69 an hour when the state doesn t pay minimum wage to inmates who work at its own prisons or other detention facilities the jury indicated it could not reach agreement on either question before it whether the detainees were employed by geo and if they were employed if the law discriminated against the company the definition of employee in washington s minimum wage law is broad it includes anyone who is permitted to work by an employer without regard to immigration or legal work status the law says residents of a state county or municipal detention facility are not entitled to minimum wage for work they perform the detention center didn t fit that exemption because it s a private for profit facility not a state county or municipal one attorneys for the state and for the detainees argued at one point in their deliberations the jurors sent a question to the judge asking if municipal meant the same thing as federal the judge responded that no municipal referred to a city or town not the federal government the northwest detention center houses people who are in custody while the federal government seeks to deport them or reviews their immigration status it can hold up to 1 575 detainees making it one of the nation s largest immigration jails though as of early this month its population was just 216 largely due to the pandemic u s immigration and customs enforcement requires the company to operate a voluntary work program in part to keep the detainees occupied it requires them to be paid at least 1 per day for work that includes cleaning bathrooms showers and industrial kitchens washing and folding laundry sweeping and buffing floors preparing and serving food and cutting hair geo acknowledged it could pay detainees more if it wanted in 2018 the company made 18 6 million in profits from the facility it would have cost 3 4 million to pay the minimum wage to detainees despite the broad definition of employee in the law the case is complex geo s contract with ice requires it to comply with applicable state and local law which the state says includes the washington minimum wage act but other provisions forbid geo from hiring anyone who doesn t have legal status in the u s the contract spells it out the detainees are not employees geo attorney joan mell said they can t be in her closing argument mell accused the state and detainee advocates of using the lawsuits to attack the immigration detention system without ever having to go to congress geo has operated the detainee work program for more than a decade and the state made no effort to get the company to pay the minimum wage until 2017 amid a flurry of lawsuits ferguson filed against the trump administration washington appears to be the only state suing a private detention contractor for not paying minimum wage to immigration detainees but similar lawsuits have been brought on behalf of immigration detainees in other states including new mexico colorado and california seeking to force geo and another major private detention company corecivic to pay minimum wage to detainees there the colorado and california cases are pending but a federal judge rejected the lawsuit brought by former detainees of corecivic s cibola detention center in new mexico a decision upheld by a federal appeals court panel in march persons in custodial detention such as appellants are not in an employer employee relationship but in a detainer detainee relationship the panel wrote in a separate effort washington is trying to close the detention center entirely this spring gov jay inslee signed a law that would ban for profit detention centers in the state geo has sued to block it

china s economic success is the result of the cpc s competent leadership and carefully thought out development model ma xuejing china daily the communist party of china is celebrating its 100th anniversary this year the cpc has come a long way to establish itself as a leading force promoting the cause of national revival in 1949 when the people s republic of china was founded it was a less developed country with hundreds of millions of people living in poverty and illiteracy after passing through a series of critical tests and crises the cpc has become even stronger and more confident in leading the chinese people on the path to the country s great rejuvenation in 1978 the party led and supported the discussion that practice is the only test of truth which has been of great importance in lifting the country out of chaos and turning the country into the world s second largest economy especially since the cpc initiated the policy of reform and opening up in 1978 which enabled china to lift more than 800 million people out of abject poverty according to the world bank s international poverty standard united nations secretary general antonio guterres praised this feat saying china is the country that has made the greatest contribution to reducing poverty in the world as it accounted for more than 70 percent of the global population lifted out of poverty over the same time period while previously most people in china did not have access to health insurance today more than 96 percent of the population is covered by it as the world s largest developing country china s successful experience in poverty eradication and providing health insurance coverage has attracted worldwide attention achieving the goals and objectives in the state building of any country is impossible without a solid economic foundation from 1952 to 2019 the volume of chinese industrial production increased almost 1 000 times with an average annual growth rate of 11 percent per capita income has increased 70 times in addition in 1978 china s exports amounted to 10 billion which is less than 1 percent of world trade by the end of 2020 exports had increased to a record 2 49 trillion which made china the world s largest country trading in goods no other country in the world has ever experienced such dynamic development as a result of the ongoing reforms china s gdp per capita has grown from less than 200 four decades ago to more than 11 000 today over the past decades china s achievements have been notable not only because of their scale but also because of the global economic shocks that have recurred during this period the chinese leadership has coped with these very successfully and after each crisis the economy has become stronger and narrowed the gap with the biggest economy in the world the united states the 1997 98 asian crisis an event that set back a number of other asian economies for many years the bursting of the dot com bubble in financial markets in 2001 the devastating financial crisis of 2007 08 from which many economies and their societies may not have really recovered and of course the current covid 19 pandemic which has led to the largest economic downturn worldwide since the 1930s during the pandemic against the backdrop of a sharp decline in global transnational direct investment foreign direct investment in china in 2020

will become the largest economy in the world in 2028 five years earlier than previously predicted it must be recognized that china s outstanding economic success is the result of the cpc s competent leadership and a carefully thought out development model implemented through trial and error china s leaders are well educated and capable civil servants many of whom have postgraduate degrees from leading universities at home and abroad the chinese way of careful planning and review of the results of each five year plan is a good example of how to achieve high global development results in all areas of the country s socioeconomic life the competence of china s leaders is evidenced by their approach to economic development a pragmatic experimental gradual and strong leadership style the cpc has achieved overwhelming domestic recognition and approval polls from the harvard kennedy school show that more than 90 percent of chinese people trust the cpc led government a recent study published by york university in canada in may 2021 shows that the new coronavirus outbreak has further increased chinese citizens confidence in their governments 93 percent at the county level 94 percent at the
