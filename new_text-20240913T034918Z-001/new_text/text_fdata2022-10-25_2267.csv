fell well short of official targets suggesting the measures are slamming the brakes on growth gdp grew by just 3 9 per cent in the third quarter of the year figures revealed yesterday well below the target of 5 5 per cent as shoppers are confined to their homes for extended periods in a speech opening a major party congress earlier this month president xi jinping claimed the zero covid strategy this followed anaemic growth of just 0 4 per cent in the second quarter as the country was battered by lockdowns in major cities despite this the country s ruling communist party appears intent on doubling down on the policy regardless of the economic damage in a speech opening a major party congress earlier this month president xi jinping claimed the zero covid strategy which has seen millions of citizens subject to strict and often abrupt lockdowns quarantines and testing regimes was an all out people s war to stop the spread of the virus a party spokesman added we all wish for a swift end to the pandemic but as things stand it is still lingering that is the reality the congress saw its nearly 2 300 delegates hand xi an unprecedented third five year term as leader of the party making him the most powerful chinese ruler since mao zedong it also means his strategy for battling covid will experience little resistance among the party s top ranks which following a reshuffle are almost entirely dominated by loyalists the harsh measures which have been in place at varying levels of severity since the first outbreaks of covid in the chinese city of wuhan in late 2019 have taken a heavy toll on china s economy open wide please covid testing on the street in beijing the woes of the world s second largest economy have rippled across the rest of the globe due to china s status as

slowdown in chinese demand was the biggest issue china under the zero covid policy is effectively in an economic coma green said adding that one of the major drivers of the global economy was now a drag rather than a contributor power grab hits stocks shares in major chinese firms tumbled on international stock markets as president xi jinping cemented his status as the country s most powerful

meanwhile online shopping site pinduoduo which is listed on the nasdaq in new york was down 25 per cent a wider sell off on chinese stock markets came amid fears xi s power grab will result in more crackdowns on china s business elite hong kong s hang seng sank 6 4 per cent hitting its lowest level in 13 years and the shanghai stock exchange s composite index slid 2 per cent he added that the situation would weigh heavily on commodities and tech products such as computer chips while for the european economy the slowdown would hit exports including german cars and luxury goods the comments echoed the world economic outlook published earlier this month by the international monetary fund imf which said frequent lockdowns due to zero covid had taken a toll on china it added that given the size of china s economy and its importance for global supply chains this would weigh heavily on global trade and activity companies operating in the country have also felt the weight of restrictions

washington october 24 ani the biden administration announced a dramatic expansion of controls on the export of us semiconductor technology to china making it illegal for any american company to trade semiconductor chips with chinese companies the step is being taken to bring a pause in the chinese tech sector and innovative ecosystems as the biden administration considers further advances in chinese semiconductor technology as counter to us national interests christopher miller a professor at fletcher school wrote in los angeles times if we look at the past several us administrators including donald trump tried to impose restrictions on telecommunications equipment maker huawei now president biden is taking on china s entire computing industry the limits aim to limit the transfer of cutting edge graphics processing units known as gpus a type of chip that is considered very crucial to running artificial intelligence applications in data centres for a decade the u s has failed to stop the flow of computing technology to the chinese military it is considered easy to limit technologies like missiles or radars when they solely have a military purpose miller said the u s had tried to stop certain chinese firms with military links from accessing advanced chips while letting tech flow to commercially oriented firms but that policy clearly left gaps after which the biden administration placed new controls not merely on specific chinese firms but on the whole country the reason of us being sceptical about allowing sales of chips even for civilian purposes is the fact that once chips enter china the u s has no control over where they end up miller further said but miller says that the us tech industry will also have to face the effect of the restrictions u s citizens have often been legally engaged with chinese chip firms servicing their machines selling them materials or in some cases even working as chief executive officers now americans will have to face legal penalties for conducting business with chinese firms just like they are sanctioned while conducting business with companies from iran or north korea per miller the us companies are also feeling the heat as several stock prices slumped after the us president announced although the company will be able to make revenue outside china still the lost revenue will hurt them besides that even the american buyers of chinese chips will also be hit and one of the prime examples of the case is apple inc earlier apple inc was planning to use chips from yangtze memory technologies a chinese government backed company at subsidized prices but now it will have no other option to buy chips from non chinese companies at market prices miller said however other than silicon valley china to is expected to be facing a blow after the decision it will take china s chip firms at least a decade to develop advanced chipmaking capabilities at home if they ever succeed she said the biden administration s new restrictions on china s chip sector may finally succeed in closing this loophole christopher miller wrote in la times ani

a growing number of cities and states are pushing for greater pay transparency in the hiring process to add to that growing list california and new york have both passed pay transparency laws in recent months leaving employers to modify how they seek out new talent however employers should keep in mind that not all pay transparency laws are the same and must take the proper steps to ensure they are fully complying with the laws of the states in which they are based and where their employees reside california california senate bill sb 1162 sb 1162 will take effect on january 1 2023 after governor gavin newsom signed it in september the law requires employers with 15 or more employees to disclose a pay scale in job postings which is the employer s reasonably expected salary or hourly wage range for the position additionally if requested employers must also provide the pay scale to an employee for the position in which they are currently employed further if an employer engages a third party to post publish or advertise a job posting that employer must provide the pay scale to the third party to include in the job posting in addition to job postings the bill requires employers to maintain job title and compensation records for each employee for the duration of their employment plus three years following the end of their employment unique to california the law also mandates a requirement in which employers with 100 or more employees must submit an annual pay data report to the state the report must disclose median and mean hourly rates for each of 10 specified job categories the report must also include the median and mean hourly rates for each combination of race ethnicity and sex within each job category additionally any private employer with 100 or more workers hired through labor contractors must submit a separate pay data report with the same requirements exclusively for these workers new york the new york city salary transparency act the city of new york passed its own transparency law on january 15 2022 that after being delayed and amended on may 12 2022 is slated to go into effect on november 1 2022 under the law new york city employers with four or more employees and at least one employee working new york city must state the minimum and maximum salary or hourly wage rate they are willing to pay for every open position the requirement applies regardless of whether the position is posted internally or externally if the work can or will be performed in whole or in part in new york city whether from an office in the field or remotely from the employee s home postings for full or part time employees interns domestic workers and independent contractors are covered by the law like california s sb 1162 the new york salary transparency act also applies to advertisements posted by third parties such as recruiting agencies employers are not required however to include information about other forms of compensation like bonuses commissions and health insurance but need only provide information as to the base pay the new york city salary transparency act imposes stiff consequences for violations an employer has 30 days from receipt of an initial complaint of non compliance to cure the employer s first violation of the law before facing a fine from the new york city commission on human rights the law also provides for a private right of action however only current employees may sue their employer for an alleged violation of the law new york state s salary transparency law senate bill s5598b the state of new york may also soon pass its own salary transparency law senate bill s5598b which would require employers to disclose compensation or a range of compensation for jobs that will or can be performed in the state of new york is currently pending in the new york state senate rules committee like the new york city law the bill would require most employers with four or more employees to post at least the minimum and a maximum annual salary or hourly range offered for a job promotion or transfer opportunity however unlike the new york city law the bill would also require disclosure of the job description if one exists and a general description of other forms of compensation offered such as bonuses stock options and commissions if applicable if passed as drafted employers should note that the law would not supersede or preempt the new york city salary transparency act meaning employers in the city of new york would have to comply with both laws the bill has not been passed by either house of the state legislature but if passed by both houses and signed into law by the governor the law would take effect 270 days after the governor s signature the new york state senate is not expected to take action on the bill before it returns to session in january 2023 what employers need to know although california new york city and new york state s salary transparency laws differ in key respects they all require covered employers to disclose the salary range for positions that will or can be performed in their respective jurisdictions pay transparency laws can pose several risks to employers and as always employers should brush up on the applicable laws for the states in which they employ individuals including the states where employees may also work remotely besides the patchwork of compliance issues these laws create they can also create retention and competitiveness concerns publicizing salary ranges for prospective hires may elicit resentment among current employees and cause upward pressure on compensation offered in high demand positions on the other hand these laws could also provide employers a leg up in determining the real market value for some positions which would allow employers to more accurately calibrate employee pay

china s zero covid strategy risks derailing a global economy already battered by inflation and an energy price crunch unleashed by the war in ukraine concerns intensified this week after china s gdp fell well short of official targets suggesting the measures are slamming the brakes on growth gdp grew by just 3 9 per cent in the third quarter of the year figures revealed yesterday well below the target of 5 5 per cent as shoppers are confined to their homes for extended periods in a speech opening a major party congress earlier this month president xi jinping claimed the zero covid strategy this followed anaemic growth of just 0 4 per cent in the second quarter as the country was battered by lockdowns in major cities despite this the country s ruling communist party appears intent on doubling down on the policy regardless of the economic damage in a speech opening a major party congress earlier this month president xi jinping claimed the zero covid strategy which has seen millions of citizens subject to strict and often abrupt lockdowns quarantines and testing regimes was an all out people s war to stop the spread of the virus a party spokesman added we all wish for a swift end to the pandemic but as things stand it is still lingering that is the reality the congress saw its nearly 2 300 delegates hand xi an unprecedented third five year term as leader of the party making him the most powerful chinese ruler since mao zedong it also means his strategy for battling covid will experience little resistance among the party s top ranks which following a reshuffle are almost entirely dominated by loyalists the harsh measures which have been in place at varying levels of severity since the first outbreaks of covid in the chinese city of wuhan in late 2019 have taken a heavy toll on china s economy open wide please covid testing on the street in beijing the woes of the world s second largest economy have rippled across the rest of the globe due to china s status as both a manufacturing hub and a large consumer of raw materials such as coal and iron ore rory green chief china economist at research firm ts lombard said among a plethora of economic woes the slowdown in chinese demand was the biggest issue china under the zero covid policy is effectively in an economic coma green said adding that one of the major drivers of the global economy was now a drag rather than a contributor power grab hits stocks shares in major chinese firms tumbled on international stock markets as president xi jinping cemented his status as the country s most powerful

crackdowns on china s business elite hong kong s hang seng sank 6 4 per cent hitting its lowest level in 13 years and the shanghai stock exchange s composite index slid 2 per cent he added that the situation would weigh heavily on commodities and tech products such as computer chips while for the european economy the slowdown would hit exports including german cars and luxury goods the comments echoed the world economic outlook published earlier this month by the international monetary fund imf which said frequent lockdowns due to zero covid had taken a toll on china it added that given the size of china s economy and its importance for global supply chains this would weigh heavily on global trade and activity companies operating in the country have also felt the weight of restrictions electric car maker tesla suffered a production hit at its shanghai factory when the city was shut down earlier this year in an earnings call last week tesla boss elon musk said china was experiencing a recession of sorts zero covid also has political implications the party s congress experienced a rare public protest when a mystery person strung banners across a bridge in beijing calling for an end to the policy and the overthrow of xi it follows protests and riots in shanghai earlier this year when lockdown measures were reintroduced as the government battled covid s omicron variant and as china s economy wilts under the weight of its pandemic response supply chains are also being disrupted again by the return of restrictions in key trade hubs including shanghai ningbo and tianjin meanwhile the nation s stricken property sector has the potential to send shockwaves across the global financial system with the imf warning the crisis could spill over to its domestic banking sector

by nadeen ebrahim and abbas al lawati cnn a top iranian military official issued a warning to saudi arabia last week as his government continued to face off against protesters at home you are involved in this matter and know that you are vulnerable it is better to be careful he said at the sidelines of a military drill major general hossein salami the head of the islamic revolutionary guard corps was referring to what state news outlets called a media war that they say is being waged against the iranian youth and nation by foreign conspirators seeking to create unrest in the country by supporting protesters there then on thursday iran again warned saudi arabia as well as the united states and the united kingdom to stop interfering in the country s internal affairs iran last week said it sanctioned a number of media outlets in the uk for supporting terrorism and inciting violence reported tasnim news agency the sanctioned entities include among others volant media global media and dma media as well as the anti iranian tv channels that the companies support such as iran international reported tasnim agency now in their sixth week protests have swept through the islamic republic following the death of 22 year old mahsa amini who died on september 16 after being detained by morality police and taken to a re education center allegedly for not abiding by the country s conservative dress code as the protests rage iran is turning up the heat on its adversaries mainly the united states and israel but last week saudi arabia found itself in the line of fire which risks further complicating attempts by the two regional rivals to mend ties riyadh hasn t publicly commented on the protests the kingdom s foreign minister refused to give his view when asked to during an interview with al arabiya news channel on october 12 saudi arabia has a fixed policy of non interference in the internal affairs of states he said surely we are following and we wish iran and its people the best iran and saudi arabia severed ties in 2016 and both parties have backed opposite sides in proxy conflicts across the middle east last year they began direct talks in an attempt to improve relations baghdad has hosted five rounds of talks so far the last of which was held in april at the heart of iran s most recent accusations against saudi arabia may be iran international a persian language news channel that broadcasts from london the channel has become one of the go to sources for many persian speakers looking for news on the protests it has been at the forefront of covering the demonstrations getting breaking news and exclusive footage of the events on the ground its twitter account has over a million followers founded in 2017 iran international has previously come under scrutiny by the iranian government some say it is due to their coverage of the protests at home which in recent weeks have rocked the islamic republic salami didn t name the channel in his warning but government backed iranian media last week accused saudi arabia of funding it saudi arabia has not addressed the allegations karim sa djadpour a senior fellow at the carnegie endowment for international peace think tank in washington dc said on twitter that iran has demanded the shuttering of the channel in talks with saudi arabia citing a senior gulf official in 2018 iran international released a statement denying connections to any government including saudi arabia or iran after the guardian reported that it was funded by a firm whose director has ties to saudi arabia s de facto ruler crown prince mohammed bin salman saudi arabia did not comment on the guardian report the saudi government did not respond to cnn s request for comment we have heard these accusations before most often promoted by those in whose interests it is to deny a free press a spokesperson for volant media told cnn iran international and its sister channel afghanistan international are editorially independent television channels owned by volant media a company based in london owned by a saudi arabian british citizen it has no state backing or affiliation added the spokesperson azadeh moaveni associate professor of journalism at new york university described the channel as one of the most pernicious and damaging forces to enter the iranian media sphere calling it an arm of saudi foreign policy i would not describe iran international as pro reform or organically iranian in any manner she told cnn mohammad marandi a professor at the university of tehran who was also an adviser to the iranian nuclear talks negotiating team said there s no doubt that iran international is funded by saudi arabia a prominent figure on state funded iranian outlets marandi added that iran international spreads rumors ethnic and sectarian strife and it tries to use misinformation to create fear chaos and promote violence saudi research and marketing group a media conglomerate with ties to the saudi ruling family has run the persian language website of the uk s independent newspaper since 2018 its account on instagram where many iranians get their news has over 600 000 followers cnn s parent company is warner bros discovery which has a partnership with saudi research and media group a saudi joint stock company saudi arabia has for years accused iran of doing the same with its own arabic language news channels targeting arab audiences with propaganda state run islamic republic of iran broadcasting runs al alam tv an arabic news channel that has interviewed saudi opposition figures and has been blocked by arab states iran backed hezbollah s al manar channel has also been blocked it s about time iran gets a taste of its own medicine said ali shihabi a saudi author and analyst iran has spent decades inciting and funding instability in the arab world so having them pay the price of such behavior themselves is certainly a source of satisfaction to a lot of people he told cnn the channel is making an impact on public behavior in iran and they are nervous about their domestic situation added shihabi analysts say that iran s tight grip on domestic media outlets and its lack of freedom of expression have created fertile ground for anti establishment platforms such as iran international to flourish it is not so much the broadcasters themselves but the situation in iran has provided the possibility for broadcasters outside of iran to gather a certain degree of popularity in the iranian context said gholam khiabany a reader in media and communications at goldsmiths university of london harun najafizada a former journalist at iran international who is now a director at the sister afghanistan international news channel said the parent company volant media is privately funded but i don t care as long as they do not influence my editorial take adding that shareholders never interfere in decision making iran international stood out from other western backed persian language news outlets by taking the side of the disenchanted oppressed voiceless people while competitor persian channels in the west were focused on bringing balance by giving the iranian government a voice he told cnn they have a vision of course they don t do it for god said najafizada referring to the shareholders that vision is democracy just two days after salami s first warning however ali akbar velayati a top adviser to iran s supreme leader was quoted saying that the two countries should reopen their embassies to facilitate a rapprochement according to the semi official iranian news agency isna we are neighbors of saudi arabia and we must coexist he was cited as saying by isna the embassies of the two countries should reopen in order to solve our problems in a better way iran protests business owners and factory workers in iran s kurdish region went on strike over the weekend as anti government protests continued video shared with cnn by pro reform activist outlet iranwire shows sanandaj the capital of the kurdish region quiet at the beginning of the work week as stores remain shut the norway based iranian rights group hengaw said shopkeepers were on strike in bukan sanandaj and saqez as well as marivan strikes and protests have become common in cities and towns across iran as people unite against the regime the nationwide protests are now in their fifth

agricultural soil is an important resource for communities all over the world not only because it provides humans with the majority of their food but because it also plays a major role in balancing the environment soil researchers have said investing in soil could help the world tap into an untold resource against environmental challenges brought on by unpredictable climatic conditions the degradation of soil resources has been occurring since the advent of agriculture some 10 000 years ago said the assoc head of colorado state university s department of soil and crop sciences prof francesca cotrufo and phd student sam leuthold from cotrufo s soil innovation laboratory cotrufo and leuthold said that the intensity of this degradation had increased sharply since the industrial revolution and the introduction of mechanized farming equipment which allowed for the expansion of agricultural lands into areas that were previously uncultivated as well as the expansion and industrialization of livestock agriculture transforming naturally vegetated ecosystems into crop or grazing lands changes the carbon balance of these systems the researchers said cotrufo and leuthold said that unlike soil carbon stocks in their natural state which tend to balance inputs and outputs agricultural soils tend to lose more carbon than they gain when converted this is because the growing season of annual crops is often shorter than that of natural perennial vegetation and in agricultural systems a significant portion of plant matter is removed by grazing or during harvest after a period of time agricultural soils may reach a new steady state but the new balance of inputs and outputs then exists at a lower level than prior to cultivation and as a result carbon is lost to the atmosphere they said soil degradation can lead to catastrophic consequences the most catastrophic example of this kind of degradation occurred across the north american plains in the 1930s after a prolonged drought combined with extensive amounts of intensive tillage brought about additionally intensive tillage and fallowing of croplands as well as intensive grazing by livestock can lead to markedly increased levels of erosion of the carbon and nutrient rich topsoil either via wind or water the most catastrophic example of this kind of degradation occurred across the north american plains in the 1930s after a prolonged drought combined with extensive amounts of intensive tillage brought about the dust bowl the worst drought in united states history not all soil degradation events have eras named after them though today thousands of hectares of coastal cropland are at risk of salinization due to rising sea levels and increasing storm intensities the researchers said inland soils face increased risk of desertification and loss of fertility due to overgrazing and expansion of agricultural lands into unsuitable conditions arid and semi arid regions such as sub saharan africa and the western united states are most vulnerable to this decline as the lack of rainfall makes plants more difficult to reestablish after they have been removed additionally soil scientists are still actively researching the impact that increasing climate variability has on different types of soil cotrufo and leuthold said that this knowledge gap increases the difficulty of creating universal solutions for degradation the dried and cracked soil in an irrigation ditch next to a cornfield on a farm is seen in fresno calif on july 24 2021 robyn beck afp via getty images the importance of soil healthy soil provides a list of ecosystem services natural processes that assist in protecting human health and wellbeing and the presence and extent of these services can vary depending on the ecosystem they include things like reducing flood risk lowering the number of nutrients lost to waterways and storing atmospheric carbon during their growth plants absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere most of this carbon is transformed into plant biomass with a small portion also routed directly into the soil as roots exude small carbon molecules cotrufo and leuthold said that assuming the biomass isn t removed through harvest or grazing and enters the soil system after these plants die much of the absorbed carbon will become food for microbial communities the carbon that is consumed by such communities will eventually re enter the atmosphere through microbial respiration however if not respired a portion of the absorbed carbon can become stabilized within the soil through bonding directly to soil minerals such as clay particles or by becoming protected within soil aggregates where microorganisms take time to reach it carbon can become sequestered the root exudates have a similar fate either being used as food by microbes or becoming stabilized through bonds with soil minerals this stable organic soil carbon can persist in the soil for decades to centuries even up to a millennium depending on the soil the climate and the land use practices they said dry cracked earth is visible along the banks of phoenix lake in ross calif on april 21 2021 justin sullivan getty images rewilding and regenerating degraded agricultural areas cotrufo and leuthold said that a multi faceted approach is required to ensure quality soil they said that the approach would need to be flexible enough to evolve as technologies climates and the needs of communities change preserving natural areas and rewilding low quality agricultural and industrial land present important first steps in regenerating our landscapes these are areas that tend to yield poorly when crops are grown either because they re too hilly too dry too rocky have some inherent nutrient deficiencies or any combination of these and other productivity factors cotrufo and leuthold said that although agricultural crops may yield poorly in such areas the areas can function very well as a natural ecosystem rebuilding their soil carbon stocks and providing important benefits to their surroundings cover cropping making use of cultural knowledge cotrufo and leuthold also highlighted that indigenous and smallholder farmers have been applying many of these regeneration practices as well as other creative conservation practices for a long time the researchers said that an important part of the path toward soil and landscape regeneration is regaining this cultural knowledge and empowering these farmers the researchers also noted that in productive cropland incentivizing the adoption of agricultural regeneration practices will help to increase the quality of some of the most degraded soils around the world these agricultural regeneration practices include reduced tillage crop livestock integration and increased crop diversity which can be accomplished by the use of legumes and perennials cotrufo and leuthold also highlighted that indigenous and smallholder farmers have been applying many of these regeneration practices as well as other creative conservation practices for a long time the researchers said that an important part of the path toward soil and landscape regeneration is regaining this cultural knowledge and empowering these farmers they said that such agricultural practices are now being demonstrated by science to increase the amount of carbon that enters soils and decrease the amount that leaves it this often leads to a net gain in overall soil organic carbon and a host of other benefits such as crop nutrition and water availability less erosion and increased biodiversity similarly a more focused approach on livestock management that incorporates an understanding of ecosystem dynamics can revitalize soils they said that it is important to note the impact that the transition from conventional agriculture systems to regenerative and more sustainable systems could have on farmers and ranchers it could leave agricultural producers exposed to outsized risk as they adapt their practices and equipment constructing policies that help to minimize the overall risk of adoption of these soil friendly practices can help to ensure soil quality as well they said in short ensuring prolonged soil quality requires all of us to be intentional in thinking about the land we receive our food and fibre from it requires a willingness to engage both with the individuals who hold this knowledge and the ones who work in these settings and to support policies and practices that emphasize a renewed focus on soil health cotrufo and leuthold said that soils have the potential to protect people s livelihoods from the worst outcomes of the changing climate and environment however to realize the potential of this critical resource people must invest in soil

washington october 24 ani the biden administration announced a dramatic expansion of controls on the export of us semiconductor technology to china making it illegal for any american company to trade semiconductor chips with chinese companies the step is being taken to bring a pause in the chinese tech sector and innovative ecosystems as the biden administration considers further advances in chinese semiconductor technology as counter to us national interests christopher miller a professor at fletcher school wrote in los angeles times if we look at the past several us administrators including donald trump tried to impose restrictions on telecommunications equipment maker huawei now president biden is taking on china s entire computing industry the limits aim to limit the transfer of cutting edge graphics processing units known as gpus a type of chip that is considered very crucial to running artificial intelligence applications in data centres for a decade the u s has failed to stop the flow of computing technology to the chinese military it is considered easy to limit technologies like missiles or radars when they solely have a military purpose miller said the u s had tried to stop certain chinese firms with military links from accessing advanced chips while letting tech flow to commercially oriented firms but that policy clearly left gaps after which the biden administration placed new controls not merely on specific chinese firms but on the whole country the reason of us being sceptical about allowing sales of chips even for civilian purposes is the fact that once chips enter china the u s has no control over where they end up miller further said but miller says that the us tech industry will also have to face the effect of the restrictions u s citizens have often been legally engaged with chinese chip firms servicing their machines selling them materials or in some cases even working as chief executive officers now americans will have to face legal penalties for conducting business with chinese firms just like they are sanctioned while conducting business with companies from iran or north korea per miller the us companies are also feeling the heat as several stock prices slumped after the us president announced although the company will be able to make revenue outside china still the lost revenue will hurt them besides that even the american buyers of chinese chips will also be hit and one of the prime examples of the case is apple inc earlier apple inc was planning to use chips from yangtze memory technologies a chinese government backed company at subsidized prices but now it will have no other option to buy chips from non chinese companies at market prices miller said however other than silicon valley china to is expected to be facing a blow after the decision it will take china s chip firms at least a decade to develop advanced chipmaking capabilities at home if they ever succeed she said the biden administration s new restrictions on china s chip sector may finally succeed in closing this loophole christopher miller wrote in la times ani

are necessary to recover the cost of providing safe reliable service while contributing to earnings growth and achieving our financial objectives we regularly review the need for electric and natural gas rate relief in each state in which we provide service on august 8 2022 we filed a montana electric and natural gas rate review filing 2021 test year under docket 2022 07 078 a summary of our

rate review filing we requested an increase to the pccam base rate pccam base of 68 1 million as well as structural revisions to the pccam mechanism to provide customers with prices that better reflect the cost of services received we also proposed to implement a revised electric only pilot for the fixed cost recovery mechanism fcrm beginning july 1 2023 or alternatively to terminate the fcrm our rate review filing also includes proposals for more timely cost recovery beyond the test period including critical reliability resources such as the yellowstone county generating station our enhanced wildfire mitigation plan and business technology maintenance costs interim rates on september 28 2022 the montana public service commission mpsc approved the recommendations of its staff for interim rates subject to refund which increased base electric rates 29 4 million pccam base rates 61 1 million and base natural gas rates 1 7 million effective october 1 2022 key dates in the

montana power costs and credits adjustment mechanism the current montana pccam base of 138 7 million approved in 2019 no longer reflects an accurate current forecast of our normal fuel and power costs

reflected in customer bills and are not recovered until the subsequent power cost adjustment year adversely affecting our cash flows and liquidity the mpsc s september 28 2022 decision approving interim rates in our rate review included an increase to the pccam base of 61 1 million on an interim basis effective october 1 2022 under the pccam under and over collection of non qualifying facility related net costs are allocated 90 to montana customers and 10 to shareholders for the three and nine months ended september 30 2022 we deferred 35 4 million and 50 0 million of costs respectively to be collected from customers 90 of the costs above base and recorded a reduction in pre tax earnings of 3 9 million and 5 6 million respectively 10 of the variance for the three and nine months ended september 30 2021 we deferred 25 4 million and 37 6 million respectively of costs for future collection from customers and recorded a reduction in pre tax earnings of 2 8 million and 4 2 million respectively holding company filings on june 1 2022 we filed a legal corporate restructuring application restructuring plan with the state commissions in montana south dakota and nebraska and the federal energy regulatory commission ferc currently our utility businesses are held in the same legal entity under the proposed restructuring plan we would legally separate our montana public utility business from our south dakota and nebraska public utility business and establish a holding company to hold the ownership interests of all of the subsidiaries the purpose of the reorganization is to integrate our organizational structure to be more transparent and in line with the public utility industry the restructuring plan does not propose and we do not expect any procedural or substantive change in how the state public utility commissions regulate those services implementation of the restructuring plan is subject to receipt of all regulatory approvals on july 26 2022 the nebraska public service commission approved our restructuring plan application on august 3 2022 the south dakota public utilities commission approved the application we expect ferc to release a decision during the fourth quarter of 2022 the mpsc is expected to hold a hearing on our restructuring plan on january 11 2023 electric resource planning montana yellowstone county 175 mw plant construction at the site began in april 2022 with a current schedule that is expected to allow the plant to serve our montana customers during 2024 with total construction costs of approximately 275 million 98 1 million incurred through september 30 2022 on october 21 2021 the montana environmental information center and the sierra club filed a lawsuit in montana state court against the montana department of environmental quality and us alleging that the environmental analysis conducted prior to issuance of the yellowstone county project s air quality permit was inadequate the montana district court judge held oral argument on june 20 2022 we expect a decision during the fourth quarter of 2022 we are subject to additional legal challenges related to the yellowstone county plan that could delay the project beartooth battery 50 mw project on december 21 2021 we filed an application with the mpsc for preapproval of the beartooth battery agreement as a new capacity resource this agreement is contingent upon mpsc approval of our application as discussed below under risk factors the montana district court ruled that the montana preapproval statute that serves as the basis for our beartooth battery agreement application is unconstitutional on oct 18 2022 the mpsc dismissed our application because the statute upon which the application was filed was found unconstitutional future integrated resource planning to comply with statutory resource planning requirements we expect to submit an integrated resource plan to the mpsc by the end of 2022 followed by an all source competitive solicitation request for capacity available in 2026 due to the significant impact of our ownership in colstrip unit 4 to the capacity available in our portfolio the outcome in the arbitration amongst the co owners may affect this plan electric resource supply south dakota our new bob glanzer generating station was operational as of may 27 2022 the 58 mw natural gas plant is located in huron south dakota construction was completed under budget at a total cost of approximately 83 1 million our electric supply resource plans for south dakota continue to identify portfolio requirements including potential investments resulting from a completed competitive solicitation process we filed an updated integrated resource plan on september 6 2022 which is consistent with the prior plan laying out a retire and replace generation asset strategy a decision whether to use a competitive solicitation process and what type of generation technology to add is expected to be made in 2023 supply chain and inflation challenges we place significant reliance on our third party business partners to supply materials equipment and labor necessary for us to operate our utility and reliably serve current customers and future customers as a result of current macroeconomic conditions both nationally and globally we have recently experienced issues with our supply chain for materials and components used in our operations and capital project construction activities issues include higher prices scarcities shortages longer fulfillment times for orders from our suppliers workforce availability and wage increases should these conditions continue we could have difficulty completing the operations activities necessary to serve our customers safely and reliably and or achieving our capital investment program which ultimately could result in higher customer utility rates longer outages and could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and operations during the third quarter of 2021 we decided to discontinue our plans to build a 30 40 mw electric generation plant near aberdeen south dakota as a result of significant increases in estimated construction costs as a result of global supply chain challenges at this time our forecasted 2022 capital investment remains consistent with the 582 million disclosed within our annual report on form 10 k for the year ended december 31 2021 as rising costs have been offset by delays in project timelines continued challenges with product and services availability and price inflation could cause further project delays and impact on our capital investment forecasts fire mitigation with changing weather conditions which include more significant wind events drought conditions and warmer air temperatures we do not consider the fire season specific to a time of year but rather a condition that may exist at any time of year each year s weather conditions impact these situations differently early season rains encourage plant growth which fuels fires later in the growing season and winters with little snow leave dry plant material available for late season fires the threat is not only in forested areas where insect infestations and resulting tree death has been severe but across the entire system including rural areas where grassland fires could be ignited along with urban areas where extreme weather conditions pose a great risk to heavily populated areas recognizing the risk of significant wildfires in montana we continue to proactively seek to mitigate wildfire risk we have developed an enhanced fire mitigation plan addressing five key areas situational awareness operational practices system preparedness vegetation management and public communications and outreach this plan builds upon several key initiatives that were initiated and executed over the past decade including nearly 80 million spent on vegetation management and hazard tree removal programs and our growing annual investment to harden our transmission and distribution system infrastructure because of ever increasing wildfire risk our plan includes greater focus on situational awareness to monitor changing environmental conditions operational practices that are more reactive to changing conditions increased frequency of patrol and repairs and more robust system hardening programs that target higher risk segments in our transmission and distribution systems we included a request for expected costs associated with the mitigation plan in our 2022 montana rate review reconciliation of

as utility margin adjusted non gaap pretax income adjusted non gaap net income and adjusted non gaap diluted eps that are considered non gaap financial measures generally a non gaap financial measure is a numerical measure of a company s financial performance financial position or cash flows that excludes or includes amounts that are included in or excluded from the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap we define utility margin as operating revenues less fuel purchased supply and direct transmission expense exclusive of depreciation and depletion as presented in our condensed consolidated statements of income this measure differs from the gaap definition of gross margin due to the exclusion of operating and maintenance property and other taxes and depreciation and depletion expenses which are presented separately in our condensed consolidated statements of income a reconciliation of utility margin to gross margin the most directly comparable gaap measure is included above management believes that utility margin provides a useful measure for investors and other financial statement users to analyze our financial performance in that it excludes the effect on total revenues caused by volatility in energy costs and associated regulatory mechanisms this information is intended to enhance an investor s overall understanding of results under our various state regulatory mechanisms our supply costs are generally collected from customers in addition utility margin is used by us to determine whether we are collecting the appropriate amount of energy costs from customers to allow recovery of operating costs as well as to analyze how changes in loads due to weather economic or other conditions rates and other factors impact our results of operations our utility margin measure may not be comparable to that of other companies presentations or more useful than the gaap information provided elsewhere in this report management also believes the presentation of adjusted non gaap pre tax income adjusted non gaap net income and adjusted non gaap diluted eps is more representative of normal earnings than gaap pre tax income net income and eps due to the exclusion or inclusion of certain impacts that are not reflective of ongoing earnings the presentation of these non gaap measures is intended to supplement investors understanding of our financial performance and not to replace other gaap measures as an indicator of actual operating performance our measures may not be comparable to other

in early 2022 the esg ratings industry attracted attention when electric vehicle manufacturer tesla inc was dropped from the s p 500 esg index explaining its decision s p cited perceived deficiencies in many esg areas including tesla s lack of an internal low carbon strategy for reporting and reducing carbon emissions insufficient codes of business conduct claims of racial discrimination and poor working conditions at a california factory and poor handling of a federal investigation into deaths and injuries linked to tesla s autopilot vehicles tesla was not dropped from other comparable esg indexes the differing treatment of tesla from an esg rating perspective highlights several realities about the esg rating industry first the fact that esg ratings providers use different ranking methodologies often results in assigning divergent rankings to the same company second lumping all of e and s together or at times all of the different issues within each of these categories can obscure the reason for a particular company s esg rating the at times low correlation among ranking scores the lack of granular information as to the basis of the rating and more generally concerns around the transparency of ratings processes have led some to question the value or how to best make use of esg ratings confusion and controversy can exist even with respect to ratings conferred by a single esg ratings provider industry commentators for instance have raised questions regarding the s p 500 esg index s inclusion of companies such as exxonmobil and mcdonald s the latter of which generated more greenhouse gases than portugal or hungary in 2019 and the exclusion of tesla and technology companies such as meta a major contributor to this situation is that esg ratings providers use a variety of sources of data methodologies and formulae to arrive at their ultimate esg scores they present their data using different scales some using letter rankings with others providing numerical scores causing difficulty when trying to perform one to one comparisons between esg ratings providers some ratings providers rely solely on publicly available information as their source data whereas others rely on questionnaires and feedback from companies directly which may include material information not otherwise available to the public in addition to information that is publicly available a 2021 ey survey revealed that 46 of asset managers viewed the lack of daily information to be a limitation on the value of esg data however few ratings providers update their data on a day to day basis these different methodologies and approaches have led to poor correlation among esg ratings one consequence is even greater proliferation of rankings a 2021 report found that 20 of the 50 largest global asset managers use data from four or more esg ratings providers in order to make informed decisions about their sustainable finance products the same report found that 30 of the same asset managers have developed their own proprietary internal esg ratings systems further there is growing recognition that most ratings do not assess companies sustainability profiles but instead are based on the impact of climate change on a company s anticipated financial performance atings don t measure a company s impact on the earth and society in fact they gauge the opposite the potential impact of the world on the company and its shareholders if an esg ratings provider concludes that climate change neither poses a risk nor offers opportunities to the company s bottom line it may issue a higher esg rating that is not necessarily reflective of that company s sustainability efforts as discussed in our article climate risk is investment risk the asset management industry confronts the challenges and opportunities presented by climate change transition asset managers face challenges when assessing the sustainability of their investments and then disclosing those characteristics to investors due in part to the lack of coherent esg ratings based on consistent and reliable criteria and methodologies there are currently more than 600 esg standards and frameworks data providers and ratings and rankings provided by a mix of established credit ratings agencies and data vendors along with niche providers at present there is very little consistency across esg ratings providers and no established industry norms relating to disclosure measurement transparency and quality this poses challenges to investors and fund managers seeking esg investment opportunities and at worst raises concerns that the lack of consistency may facilitate greenwashing these challenges are only likely to increase as esg assets are estimated to reach 53 trillion by 2025 and risk outstripping the capabilities of existing ratings providers in this area many investors prefer active investment strategies and want managers to use active security selection to uncover esg opportunities and active ownership to engage and influence investee companies one commentator estimates there are approximately 240 esg focused etfs in the u s alone and over 500 esg focused etfs in europe regulators in the u s uk and eu recognize this as an important issue and are starting to develop rules in this area in the u s the securities and exchange commission sec is pushing to standardize climate related disclosures by public companies which it is hoped will have a positive knock on impact on the accuracy of esg ratings in the eu the european securities and market authority esma is considering increased regulation of the esg ratings sector in the uk the financial conduct authority fca has opined that low correlation among esg ratings is not in itself harmful as long as ratings providers are transparent about their methodology and the data they use and have robust governance processes the board of the international organization of securities commissions iosco has also published recommendations for esg ratings providers industry bodies such as the international financial reporting standards foundation recently launched the international sustainability standards board aimed at delivering a comprehensive global baseline of sustainability related disclosure standards that provide investors and other capital market participants with information about companies sustainability related risks and opportunities to help them make informed decisions the common theme across regulators and industry bodies is a push toward increased transparency this approach is backed by research that transparent disclosure standards and publicly accessible data is the solution to fight the noise from conflicting esg ratings this article contains a detailed discussion of these issues it begins by explaining the purpose of esg ratings and outlining some common categories of information and data that are considered when calculating esg ratings to highlight the different approaches in the current market the article goes on to summarize the methodologies applied by some of the leading esg ratings providers this is followed by a discussion on why ratings for the same company differ among different providers and how the ratings are used by investors and asset managers a summary of the current regulatory initiatives in various jurisdictions including the u s the uk and the eu is provided and the article concludes with some key takeaways esg ratings are likely to remain in the spotlight given their importance for investors issuers and policymakers it remains to be seen whether the current esg ratings ecosystem can be simplified through regulatory measures or broader market consensus more consistency would certainly benefit investors and companies focused on sustainable initiatives another approach might be for ratings providers to unbundle and separately rank companies according to the e s and g some ratings providers such as s p do currently provide such disaggregated information thereby providing investors with more targeted assessments and therefore more useful information after all different investors may for instance place different weight or value on a company s ability to manage climate change transition versus its workplace environment one commentator has observed for example that certain technology companies score highly in esg ratings due to low greenhouse gas emissions despite questionable labor and misinformation policies an example of environmental factors giving a company a high esg score despite alleged poor performance on social factors one proffered reason is that social risk factors and issues have been poorly defined so far asset managers may be able to derive the greatest value from ratings providers that present e s and g scores or present even more granular information on an issue specific basis with the e and s categories individually and transparently so that they can provide the best solutions for their clients specific needs ultimately however the current polyphony of approaches is reflective of 1 the wide range of information to consider regarding a company s esg profile 2 the lack of consensus on how to assess that information and 3 divergent views on what constitutes good and beneficial in the broader esg market only by offering greater transparency regarding the inputs to their rankings and how those inputs are assessed and weighed can esg ratings providers offer consumers of that information a basis to make informed decisions as to how to effectively utilize the ratings each of these subjects is discussed in detail below our takeaways include a ratings divergence in its response to the eu s consultation on a renewed sustainable finance strategy esma cited one study finding that esg ratings are 60 correlated compared to a 99 correlation for credit ratings from the top three credit rating agencies the lack of standardized esg disclosures or weighting of esg factors coupled with the grouping and subjective weighting of all esg issues drives this divergence which in turn causes market participants to question the accuracy and comparability of ratings by any esg provider however while no doubt helpful increased esg disclosure alone seems unlikely to alleviate all the challenges associated with using esg ratings one harvard study found that increased esg disclosures were correlated with greater esg rating disagreement y moving from the 25th to the 75th percentile in terms of esg disclosure firms saw the spread between their best and worst esg scores widen by as much as 31 percent because each esg ratings provider selects its own variables measures each variable using its own method and weighs each variable to add up to its score differently transparency regarding methods and input will not lead to ratings convergence that in turn calsl into question the utility of any provider s rating which is intended as a short hand simple way to assess a particular company s sustainability characteristics it follows that the current state of play where ratings are only truly meaningful if the consumer takes the time to dig into the rating provider s approach will persist until there is an industry or regulatory consensus regarding esg rating methodology b tension between the e the s and the g calls for distinct scores for each as illustrated by the esg ratings of tesla a company may have a positive environmental impact but a poor work culture though investors may care about both when reviewing a company s esg score a poor s rating may obscure a positive e rating in an overall esg rating and thus mislead investors or at least deprive them of valuable information regarding a company s sustainability efforts to resolve this issue esg ratings providers should consider assigning subscores for the e s and g or even to discrete issues within each category c investors should not rely on esg ratings as a sole indicator as many asset managers already do investors should look to esg ratings from multiple providers as a starting point to guide further diligence the divergence in ratings and variability in definitions renders esg ratings unreliable as a sole mechanism to judge potential esg investments d potential litigation because esg ratings can vary significantly enforcement actions or litigation are possible an asset manager that relies on a particular esg provider to assess the sustainability of its portfolio may be accused by regulators or clients of greenwashing to the extent that other providers assign lower ratings to those same companies likewise a company s employees who participate in company sponsored retirement vehicles could claim that the employer misrepresented the sustainability of investment offerings based on the divergence among esg rating providers e conflicts of interest another area of concern to regulators and other market participants is that esg ratings providers often provide other services such as esg consulting services the risk that a ratings provider might provide a better rating in order to win other business from a particular company raises a number of challenges including the quality of disclosure regarding the issue how a company or asset manager should deal with the potential conflict if it utilizes that provider s ratings and the concern that such conflicts may lead to industry regulation f ratings bias consumers of esg ratings should consider the possibility of unintended ratings bias being injected into the process as noted above reprisk attempts to account for a large company bias which it characterizes as negatively affecting large cap companies because they receive greater media attention however esma has pointed to a bias in favor of large caps which have the resources to respond to provider surveys and generally address esg perceptions in the marketplace and in fact large cap companies on average receive higher esg ratings another potential bias for example could be based on geography european companies on average score higher than u s companies while companies in emerging markets generally receive lower scores i what are esg ratings esg ratings aim to measure a company s or portfolio s long term exposure to environmental social and governance risk factors ultimately they attempt to quantify and standardize the financial risks that esg factors pose to companies and by extension shareholders they are designed to be used for two purposes first by individual investors and fund managers to guide investment strategies by understanding potential sustainability risks to business performance and second as an internal benchmarking tool to help improve sustainability performance and for potential public relations opportunities issues arise when different ratings providers implement different methodologies and source different data to calculate their ratings leading to what one group of researchers refers to as noise it also is noteworthy that by and large esg ratings only measure one aspect of what european regulators refer to as double materiality which reflects a view that information can be important and should be disclosed if related to a company s financial performance also known as the outside in perspective or to the sustainability impact of a company on society and the planet inside out perspective the concept of double materiality is incorporated in the eu s various sustainability reporting directives such as the corporate sustainability reporting directive and the sustainable finance disclosure regulation while it is not clear whether u s regulators will expressly adopt the concept it is not a stretch to conclude that investors may consider information material under a traditional tsc industries standard even if it relates to the inside out perspective i e a company that currently is successfully managing climate transition may nonetheless suffer material harm such as loss of customers harm to reputation and regulatory scrutiny due to its negative impact on the external climate the failure of most esg ratings providers to take such information into account is a significant shortcoming in the ratings landscape ii factors weighting presentations summary descriptions of methodologies overview graphics of leading ratings providers as described above there is noise surrounding the different methodologies utilized by data ratings providers in computing esg scores in this section we explore the approaches employed by five leading esg ratings providers this is followed with a summary table outlining some of the key aspects of the methodologies employed by each provider a msci esg ratings msci is a global provider of equity fixed income real estate indexes multi asset portfolio analysis tools esg and climate products it offers esg ratings for over 2 900 companies using 35 key issues that it determines to be material for each industry it sources data from third party academic government and ngo datasets public disclosures by companies and government media ngo and other shareholder databases while msci does send data requests to companies directly it does not consider in its analysis any data that is not otherwise publicly available it publishes one overall rating for each company calculating and normalizing the weighted average of scores for each applicable key issue against industry peers each environmental and social key issue contributes between 5 30 these are weighted scores of the final esg rating while all the governance issues combined contribute at least 33 to the final esg rating the key issues examine a company s exposure to and management of both risks and opportunities associated with climate transition and other esg related issues environmental and social key issues include carbon emissions raw material sourcing packaging material and waste labor management privacy and data security and product safety and quality governance key issues include ownership and control matters relating to the board of directors business ethics and tax transparency the final rating is only provided after a quality check by an esg ratings review committee which reviews the selection of key issues assignment of weights treatment of company specific issues rating changes and rating distribution before giving final approval after incorporating any committee level overrides i e situations where msci determines to override the data based on a qualitative assessment msci rates a company on a scale of aaa the best to ccc the worst this climate rating ultimately aims to provide a measure of a company s resilience to long term financially relevant esg risks reflecting the outside in perspective described above for example alphabet inc s msci data is produced in figure 1 figure 1 alphabet inc esg rating from msci b refinitiv esg scores refinitiv a subsidiary of the london stock exchange is a leading provider of financial market data it provides two scores for over 11 800 companies globally 1 an esg score that evaluates a company s performance of esg factors measured relative to other companies in the same sector and capacity to address those esg factors and 2 an esgc score that discounts from the esg score to account for any material esg controversies data is collected for over 630 esg measures from publicly available sources such as companies annual reports websites and esg disclosures ngo websites public filings and news sources esg measures include a company s use of resources like water and energy its commitment to reducing emissions and the effectiveness in terms of respecting fundamental human rights conventions to name a few the data is audited and updated weekly refinitiv groups the esg measures into 10 categories listed below in figure 2 in which companies are scored comparatively based on percentile rank the 10 category scores are then sorted into environmental social and governance pillar scores with each pillar score reflecting the relative sum of the category weights normalized to a percentage between 0 and 100 from these pillar scores the esg score is calculated separately an esg controversies score is calculated using 23 esg controversy topics while addressing the market cap bias that results from the fact that large cap companies attract relatively greater media attention and scrutiny although the fca in its 2021 esg disclosure consultation discussed below posited that mid and small sized companies are penalized by ratings providers that request company survey responses on the theory that they have less resources to devote to actually completing the survey and correcting misimpressions on the part of the provider refinitiv calculates the esgc score by discounting as a weighted average the esg controversies score from the final esg score a company s esg score is presented both as a numerical score out of 100 as well as ranked out of all other companies in the industry refinitiv s scores are aimed at helping asset managers assess esg risks and opportunities in investment portfolios focusing on company valuation risk management and regulatory compliance i e adopting the outside in financial perspective described above for example alphabet inc s refinitiv data is produced in figure 2 figure 2 alphabet inc esg score from refinitiv c sustainalytics risk ratings sustainalytics owned by morningstar calculates the magnitude of a company s unmanaged esg risks material esg risks that are 1 unmanageable and not even in theory capable of being addressed by the company s initiatives and 2 potentially manageable but not currently sufficiently managed by the company as a measure of its economic value reflecting the outside in perspective it gathers data from public disclosures media analyses and ngo reports as well as direct feedback from companies the overall esg risk rating is based on assessment in three main areas corporate governance material esg issues and idiosyncratic esg issues the corporate governance block applies to all companies and contributes roughly 20 to the overall risk rating material esg issues are those that affect all companies in a particular industry in a predictable manner and require a common set of management initiatives or a similar type of oversight on the other hand idiosyncratic esg issues are those unrelated to a particular industry such as event driven scandals that affect a specific company sustainalytics measures both exposure to esg risks and management of that exposure first sustainalytics calculates the average exposure to a material esg issue within each subindustry in which the company operates the subindustry exposure assessments are conducted annually second a beta score representing the degree to which a specific company s exposure to that issue deviates from the subindustry average is calculated the company s exposure is calculated by multiplying the beta score by the subindustry exposure score third sustainalytics also measures manageable risk factors for each subindustry which represents the share of exposure to a material esg issue that is deemed to be at least theoretically manageable by the company fourth the unmanaged risk for each material esg issue is calculated by subtracting the managed risk from the company s exposure score finally a company s overall esg risk rating score is tabulated as the sum of the unmanaged risk scores for each individual material esg issue confronting the company the risk ratings score is presented alongside a risk categorization for example the sustainalytics report for alphabet inc is presented in figure 3 figure 3 alphabet inc esg risk rating from sustainalytics d reprisk ratings based in switzerland reprisk maintains the world s largest database of esg risk research with information from or concerning over 200 000 public and private companies over 50 000 infrastructure projects over 25 000 ngos and over 19 000 governmental bodies it also sources and updates data daily from over 100 000 public sources and stakeholders such as news media social media blogs government bodies and think tanks in 23 languages and ranging from the international to local level the research is focused on 28 esg issues and 73 esg topics reprisk s 28 issues are the core of its research process with each selected and defined pursuant to international esg and business conduct standards i e world bank group environmental health and safety guidelines and the un global compact the 73 topics are extensions of the issues and are more thematic with each topic relating back to one or more issues for example the epidemics pandemics topic relates to nine separate issues anti competitive practices corruption bribery extortion and money laundering fraud freedom of association and collective bargaining impacts on communities misleading communication poor employment conditions products health and environmental issues and occupational health and safety issues unlike other ratings methodologies reprisk uses issue and event driven approaches instead of a company specific approach in that vein every risk incident affecting an industry that flags one of the 101 esg factors reprisk evaluates is analyzed and quantified risks are calibrated both generally industry wide as well as specifically as to a company or country sector based on its methodology reprisk publishes three different results 1 a reprisk index score from zero lowest to 100 highest that quantifies reputational risk exposure for the esg issues 2 a reprisk rating from aaa best to d worst that facilitates corporate benchmarking against the peer group and sector of a company as well as integration of esg and business conduct risks into business processes and 3 a united nations global compact violator flag that identifies companies that have a high risk or potential risk of violating one or more of the ten un global compact principles a company s rating is dependent on the risks and index as well as the company s country specific esg risk and industry specific esg risk reprisk s esg ratings are proprietary and therefore we are unable to include an example of the data it provides e s p global esg scores s p global covers 8 000 companies worldwide encompassing 90 of global market capitalization it analyzes many of the same subindustries as msci because both utilize the global industry classification system a joint product developed by msci and s p that has been providing classification across industry sectors since 1999 the s p global esg scores measure companies exposure to and performance on key esg risks and opportunities the quality and completeness of their public disclosures and their awareness of emerging but underreported esg issues data is sourced directly from publicly listed companies using 61 industry specific questionnaires the corporate sustainability assessment csa that request data and supporting evidence beyond that available in public disclosures analysts complete the assessment questionnaires for companies that do not respond to the invitations each question receives a score using pre defined scoring frameworks which then aggregates to criteria level scores that reflect the most material esg themes for each subindustry criteria level scores combine into standalone e s and g dimension scores which are then further combined into a single esg score for each company s p global uses reprisk to monitor daily corporate controversies and may downgrade a company s esg score if the controversy is sufficiently severe all companies are evaluated annually using the csa and the data underlying the scores is updated monthly for example a portion of the s p

asset managers in particular may have reason to rely on esg ratings whether for purposes of assessing potential sustainability risks to business performance or in order to avoid greenwashing the sustainability characteristics of their portfolios esg ratings may qualify or disqualify a particular security from an asset manager s portfolio if the manager is working within a defined esg mandate how asset managers utilize esg ratings differs based on each firm s objectives as well as internal resources and expertise in its fact finding exercise conducted to gain an understanding of the significant role played by esg ratings and data in financial markets around the world iosco observed a wide variation as to how asset and fund managers consume and use the information provided by esg ratings specifically the study revealed a broad range of uses for esg ratings including to integrate esg factors in their investment process manage sustainability exposure and or opportunities of their investment portfolio or develop and oversee sustainable products use ratings to guide stakeholder engagement strategy with invested companies or produce esg reports for clients or monitor external asset managers as a trustee by assessing their exposure to esg and more specifically climate risks but a majority of participants declined to indicate how esg ratings are incorporated into investment decision making certain respondents indicated that they do not incorporate esg ratings into all of their investment decisions but instead at times use them to reinforce internal analyses and investment decisions by helping to identify risks and opportunities for many firms looking to the esg rating is only one step in a significantly broader research process adding yet another nuance to esg rating consumption several have developed their own kpis tools processes and scores to fully evaluate corporate esg performance and find own answers large asset managers may seek out esg providers that provide the broadest possible coverage of sectors and geography because they can incorporate that data into their own tools processes and scores this enables them to identify key esg factors in each sector and use their internal resources to conduct further diligence for instance blackrock uses certain external esg ratings to contribute to three main themes driving its esg integration efforts investment processes material insights and transparency the firm creates its own internal esg ratings based on the data provided by third parties and its own set of analytic tools blackrock s actively managed funds and advisory strategies are esg integrated meaning that portfolio managers are accountable for managing exposure to material esg risks and investment teams are required to demonstrate how they incorporate esg information into their investment strategies similarly state street developed an internal esg scoring system based on external esg ratings and other data from third party providers it then uses internal scores to inform investment decisions and advise both companies and investors iv regulation of esg ratings there is currently little alignment among regulators on an appropriate or effective approach to regulate esg ratings current approaches focus on the transparency of rating methodologies improved reliability and accuracy the adoption of disclosure standards or a combination of these elements a regulation of ratings global united kingdom in 2021 the fca published a consultation paper inviting views on whether the regulation of esg ratings providers should be brought within the fca s regulatory authority or alternatively whether these service providers should simply be encouraged to adopt a voluntary best practice code in its corresponding feedback statement fs22 4 the fca reported seeing a clear rationale for the regulation of esg data and rating providers the fca further explained that as industry participants more fully integrate esg into their activities and expand their esg focused product offerings they are increasingly reliant on third party esg data and rating services these services are increasingly embedded within investment processes including mandates and benchmark indices directly influencing capital allocation in order to protect the integrity of financial markets and harm to investors the fca advocates for esg data and rating services to be transparent well governed independent objective and based on reliable and systematic methodologies and processes further where such services aim to measure specific esg attributes users should be able to understand their purpose and access sufficient information in order to assess whether their outputs are fit for their intended purpose the feedback statement also sets out that the fca will coordinate its regulatory focus with iosco s recommendations so as to ensure international coordination the potential future direction of travel in respect of esg data and ratings providers is to develop and consult on a proportionate and effective regulatory regime with a focus on outcomes in areas highlighted in iosco s recommendations the fca also states however that given the lead time before any such regime could come into force would in the interim convene support and encourage industry participants to develop and follow a voluntary code of conduct such a voluntary code could potentially continue to apply for esg data and rating providers that fall outside the scope of any future regulatory regime nevertheless industry participants are starting to develop their own frameworks governing sustainable investing though none has yet been made available further in july 2022 japan s financial services agency issued a draft code of conduct for esg ratings providers the fca has stated that it strongly supports an international coordinated approach coordinating as far as possible with other jurisdictions on the design of any regulatory approach or voluntary code of conduct and the japanese draft therefore provides a possible indication of what a uk voluntary code of conduct might look like recently the fca has focused on the transparency of disclosure rather than setting out how esg ratings providers should apply their rating methodologies the purpose of disclosure is to enable informed investor decision making while periodic reporting aims to reflect a fund s progress against its esg objectives the fca s consultation paper acknowledged that esg ratings are highly influential because of how broadly they are used by a range of market participants for investment purposes by companies to benchmark their own performance and by investors who are using esg ratings in a fairly simplistic way to determine whether a company is good or bad nonetheless the fca does not consider a low correlation among different providers esg ratings in and of itself as a source of harm so long as such providers are transparent about their methodology and information and data inputs determine their outputs by applying systematic processes and sound systems and controls identify and manager conflicts of interest and operate with robust governance the fca is expected to provide a detailed pronouncement on its approach to esg related regulation in 2023 following this year s consultation process european union in february 2022 the european commission ec updated its sustainable finance strategy demonstrating active engagement with regards to recommendations for esg rating and data providers for esg ratings providers the ec suggested the introduction of conflict of interest rules minimum disclosure requirements for ratings methodology and a centralized eu registration system for providers rather than imposing mandatory ratings criteria aimed at making ratings more standardized and comparable further the ec has considered whether to make credit rating agencies disclose the impact or absence of esg factors within their ratings and an explicit requirement to take esg factors into account where relevant currently credit rating agencies do not incorporate assessments of long term esg factors such as climate pledges and climate risks within credit ratings on the basis that such factors do not have immediate credit implications subsequently esma the european union s financial markets supervisory authority called for written submissions in order to develop an understanding of the market for esg rating providers active in the eu and gather the views of users and entities covered by esg ratings publishing its results in june 2022 esma reported that the majority of users of esg ratings contract for those products from several providers simultaneously so as to increase coverage either by asset class or geographically in order to receive different types of assessments shortcomings identified by users included a lack of coverage of a specific industry or a type of entity and insufficient granularity of data esma reported that complexity and lack of transparency around methodologies are cited as an issue further users highlighted some degree of shortcoming in their interactions with esg ratings providers most notably with respect to transparency as to the basis for the rating the timing of feedback or the correction of errors as is the usual course the ec will consider esma s findings in its assessment of the need to introduce regulatory safeguards for esg ratings products international standards there are some interesting examples both within and outside the eu where funds are taking matters into their own hands in developing their own rating and scoring systems prior to the publication of the disclosure recommendations by the financial stability board s task force on climate related financial disclosure this includes japanese insurance company nippon life spanish insurer mapfre and norges bank investment management which runs norway s 1 4 trillion sovereign wealth fund it is possible that when the ifrs s international sustainability standards board publishes its disclosure standards these meet the growing demand for consistent comparable and reliable corporate sustainability disclosures which in turn places enough information in the public domain to allow investors to make more informed choices b u s regulation of esg ratings while the sec has not attempted to regulate esg ratings providers directly a proposed rule directed at asset managers could impact esg ratings providers in may 2022 the sec proposed for comment new rules regarding asset manager disclosure in order to combat inconsistencies among esg ratings providers the proposed rules would require 1 disclosure of esg strategies in prospectuses annual reports and advisor brochures 2 a tabular disclosure approach that will more easily allow investors to compare among esg funds and 3 environmentally focused funds to disclose the greenhouse gas emissions of their portfolio investments according to the sec these requirements will encourage the increased transparency with respect to esg ratings because asset managers will need to disclose how esg ratings are used in their own esg strategies i e which ratings providers are used why certain ratings providers were selected as well as improve the quality and reliability of esg ratings by promoting competition among esg ratings providers this proposed rule highlights the need for esg ratings providers to be more transparent and standardize their data so that the asset managers that use the data they provide can comply with impending sec reporting requirements recently congress has joined the fray on september 20 2022 senator pat toomey r pa ranking member of the u s senate banking committee brought attention to the noise surrounding esg ratings by sending letters to 12 ratings providers including the five providers discussed above msci refinitiv sustainalytics reprisk and s p global senator toomey stated his belief that many ratings providers consider information that is not material or financially relevant under federal securities laws and requests providers disclose information regarding the specific e s and g factors measured and how those factors are weighed how the firms determine the scope of industry sectors including whether they employ analysts with sector specific expertise and reports intended to capture controversies faced by a company such as pending litigation negative press coverage or shareholder resolutions the letters also request that ratings providers answer questions regarding the involvement of rated companies during ratings calculations the veracity of data sources the impact of political issues on esg scores and conflicts of interest to date

washington october 24 ani the biden administration announced a dramatic expansion of controls on the export of us semiconductor technology to china making it illegal for any american company to trade semiconductor chips with chinese companies the step is being taken to bring a pause in the chinese tech sector and innovative ecosystems as the biden administration considers further advances in chinese semiconductor technology as counter to us national interests christopher miller a professor at fletcher school wrote in los angeles times if we look at the past several us administrators including donald trump tried to impose restrictions on telecommunications equipment maker huawei now president biden is taking on china s entire computing industry the limits aim to limit the transfer of cutting edge graphics processing units known as gpus a type of chip that is considered very crucial to running artificial intelligence applications in data centres for a decade the u s has failed to stop the flow of computing technology to the chinese military it is considered easy to limit technologies like missiles or radars when they solely have a military purpose miller said the u s had tried to stop certain chinese firms with military links from accessing advanced chips while letting tech flow to commercially oriented firms but that policy clearly left gaps after which the biden administration placed new controls not merely on specific chinese firms but on the whole country the reason of us being sceptical about allowing sales of chips even for civilian purposes is the fact that once chips enter china the u s has no control over where they end up miller further said but miller says that the us tech industry will also have to face the effect of the restrictions u s citizens have often been legally engaged with chinese chip firms servicing their machines selling them materials or in some cases even working as chief executive officers now americans will have to face legal penalties for conducting business with chinese firms just like they are sanctioned while conducting business with companies from iran or north korea per miller the us companies are also feeling the heat as several stock prices slumped after the us president announced although the company will be able to make revenue outside china still the lost revenue will hurt them besides that even the american buyers of chinese chips will also be hit and one of the prime examples of the case is apple inc earlier apple inc was planning to use chips from yangtze memory technologies a chinese government backed company at subsidized prices but now it will have no other option to buy chips from non chinese companies at market prices miller said however other than silicon valley china to is expected to be facing a blow after the decision it will take china s chip firms at least a decade to develop advanced chipmaking capabilities at home if they ever succeed she said the biden administration s new restrictions on china s chip sector may finally succeed in closing this loophole christopher miller wrote in la times ani

ted wheeler portland s abysmal democratic mayor is finally getting around to shutting down 700 unsanctioned homeless camps that promote poverty misery drug use crime and disease around the city video credit koin 6 squalid filthy crime ridden shanty towns have popped up all over what was once a beautiful city under his watch wheeler called it a vortex of misery which is an understatement he has come up with a plan pretty much doomed to failure from the get go to handle some of it meanwhile residents are fleeing the city as fast as they can to get away from the crisis the daily mail is reporting that locals are dumping the democrats over it because they have been in charge for 40 years and have driven portland into the gutter they are fed up with skyrocketing crime drug use and rampant homelessness in the center of the city that s why in a state that is mostly red except for the bastions of liberalism in the big cities such as portland a republican is on the verge of becoming the governor with the backing of nike co founder and oregon s richest man phil knight he s backing christine drazan to defeat her democratic rival wheeler is being blamed for the demise of portland a record number of 90 murders occurred there last year shattering the previous record of 66 it looks like the murder record will be surpassed again this year video credit the daily mail hey dems when you ve lost portland portland s open air drug markets and homeless encampments turn oregon election upside down daily mail online buzz patterson buzzpatterson october 18 2022 there are over 700 homeless encampments across portland crammed into less than 150 square miles it has purportedly made portland one of the most violent cities in the nation no wonder starbucks and other businesses have closed up shop and just left it s not just downtown either some of the most expensive neighborhoods in the city are besieged by homeless tent cities which crowd and block sidewalks and spew trash all over the place locals and tourists don t want any part of that scenario the magnitude and the depth of the homelessness crisis in our city is nothing short of a humanitarian catastrophe wheeler proclaimed stating the obvious concerning a situation he helped create he plans to ban the 700 homeless encampments and prep for the construction of 20 000 affordable housing units over the next decade many contend it won t work according to the daily mail video credit the daily mail we need to move our scattered vulnerable homeless population closer to the services that they need wheeler impotently declared he wants to create additional emergency shelters safe rest villages and city designated campsites it s a typical progressive way of addressing the situation and will almost certainly faceplant plus he doesn t plan to ban the homeless until funding has been secured once funding is secured the plan could take 18 months to roll out there are more than 3 000 people living on portland s streets and winter is coming fast no government agency in oregon has more experience putting together temporary outdoor emergency shelter camps than the state with the state s help we can get portland s designated sanctioned camping areas up before winter wheeler hilariously claimed video credit the daily mail wheeler is blaming much of the homeless problem on mental health issues and drug use collectively this is a vortex of misery for all involved he stated on friday according to the mayor social workers would be responsible for locating individuals living in campsites on the city s streets and directing them to the designated sites if they refuse the police will be called in this isn t the first time wheeler has taken aim at the homeless in portland he s made four emergency declarations this year alone he has prohibited camping on highways and walking routes nearby k 12 schools none of it has made even a dent in the situation this is a vortex of misery portland mayor announces his plan to ban unsanctioned homeless encampments as squalid tent cities plague the city s streets and crime skyrockets daneg dane__garcia october 24 2022 wheeler s latest lame plan follows a virtual meeting of the portland city council where one woman proclaimed that the democrats attempt to stop homelessness in the area has been an epic failure you have to stop enabling this gillian rose a portland resident demanded i m angry and i m sad and i m fed up and i m so sick of having politicians pander to a woke agenda that s been nothing short of an epic failure wheeler had the gall to chuckle at her comments responding thank you you ve made your point emphatically clear thank you for being here and sharing your perspective we do appreciate it she said he made her point

binance becoming too dominant by sam reynolds while ftx and coinbase might have the mindshare binance s 44 billion in daily volume is unchallenged by any other crypto exchange binance pushes through around 53 of all crypto trades on spot and derivatives markets by trade count and around 30 of the market s value and binance is so much more than just an exchange it has an eponymous blockchain for which it controls most of the validators a stablecoin to which it gives preference on its exchange though it might not be a bad thing a major governance entity on the uniswap dao and is a lender of

market corrects for monopolies microsoft for instance is nowhere near the dominant force it was during the antitrust case of the late 1990s within the web2 world regulators haven t been very keen on antitrust lawsuits because of allegations of monopolistic behavior suits by the u s federal trade commission and the states alleging that meta then facebook engaged in monopolistic practices have been thrown out as a result there have been calls to revamp antitrust laws but it will take years for congress to get to this will the same happen in crypto will there be a challenger to binance when binance announced that it was killing access to three stablecoins that compete with its own circle wasn t too upset circle ceo jeremy allaire tweeted that usdc would emerge a winner as it would accelerate a shift away from usdt which is a token non grata in the u s while optimizing dollar liquidity on the world s largest exchange may carry benefits the paradigm does raise potential market conduct questions circle was quoted as saying so there are hints of antitrust ingredients but because usdc a competitor to busd for now remains a beneficiary there s not a case to be made yet but what happens when binance puts together all the separate entities it has and does something where all its competitors get unfairly locked out of a particular market at that point it might be relevant to

bob cropp the price of barrel cheddar cheese strengthened to above 2 per pound from mid september and continuing into october reaching as high as 2 2450 the price of barrel cheese was well above 40 pound cheddar blocks being as much as 02775 per pound higher from mid september and into october 40 pound blocks ranged from 1 9675 per pound to just 2 06 the price of dry whey weakened from 0 4875 per pound mid september to a low of 0 41 in october before improving to 0 4425 higher average cheese prices will be enough to improve the class iii price from 19 82 in september to around 21 80 for october butter has been well above 3 per pound all of september and october reaching a record high of 3 2675 per pound nonfat dry milk weakened from a high of 1 58 per pound in september to a low of 1 4250 in october higher average butter prices will more than offset lower nonfat dry milk prices to push the class iv price a little higher from 24 63 in september to around 24 80 for october coming holidays adds to boost in butter prices buyers purchasing cheese and butter to build stocks to meet the upcoming strong holiday sales pushed cheese and butter prices higher good domestic sales as well as exports helped to strengthen prices compared to a year ago august butter exports were 71 higher and cheese exports 6 higher but as stocks are filled we can expect lower butter and cheese prices lowering the class iii and class iv price both the class iii and class iv price could fall below 20 by december the class iii price could end the year averaging about 21 90 compared to 17 08 for 2021 the class iv price could average about 24 60 compared to 16 09 for 2021 cow numbers increase milk cows increased by 52 000 january to may peaking at 9 419 million but cow numbers have declined for four consecutive months to 9 411 million in september milk per cow has improved with september 1 4 above a year ago september total milk production was 1 5 higher than a year ago this marks three consecutive increases with july up 0 5 and august 1 7 south dakota continues to lead all states in increased milk production with september 14 9 above a year ago with an addition of 25 000 cows other states with more cows and relatively high increase in milk production were georgia 10 000 cows and 13 1 more milk texas 30 000 more cows and 8 5 more milk iowa 12 000 more cows and 5 3 more milk colorado 7 000 more cows and 3 8 more milk arizona 4 000 more cows and 3 2 more milk idaho 6 000 more cows and 2 4 more milk california had 4 000 more cows but just 0 5 more milk wisconsin had 7 000 fewer cows but still 0 9 more milk michigan continues to lose cows down 11 000 and 0 7 less milk new mexico had 16 000 fewer cows and 3 5 less milk cow numbers were down 11 000 in florida and 12 9 less milk new york had 3 000 fewer cows but improved milk per cow still resulted in 2 2 more milk milk price outlook milk prices are likely to average lower in 2023 with milk production increasing only about 0 3 in 2022 we can expect with stronger milk prices this past year higher milk production but any increase in milk production will be hampered by high feed costs labor shortage and labor cost high construction cost for expansion and fewer available dairy replacements also some dairy cooperatives still have in place base plans to limited milk expansion so the increase in the average number of milk cows is likely to be limited usda forecasts the average number of cows for the year to increase by 15 000 cows or 0 2 with a modest 0 9 increase in milk per cow resulting in just a 1 0 increase in total milk production opportunities for u s exports domestic demand is likely to be dampened some with continued high inflation and at the same time the possibility of the economy being in a recession dairy exports are setting a record in 2022 both in volume and value the question is can exports continue this growth path milk production continues below year ago levels in the eu new zealand and australia all major dairy exporters this leaves open opportunities for u s exports especially if u s prices of cheese nonfat dry milk and whey products remain price competitive but the strong u s dollar and many countries also facing high inflation and possible recession could dampen exports usda is still forecasting an increase in export volume on both a fat and skim milk basis for 2023 milk prices to fall in 2023 but by how much while the forecast is for lower milk prices in 2023 how much lower is uncertain as of now it looks like for the first quarter class iii could be in the 19 s and class iv in the 20 s second quarter prices could weaken some as milk production increases seasonally with some increase in prices third quarter and prices peaking early fourth quarter it looks like class iv prices may averaging higher than class iii usda is forecasting fairy strong milk prices with class iii averaging 19 80 for the year and class iv averaging 21 00 but milk prices are very sensitive to changes in milk production domestic sales or dairy exports and can easily change higher or lower by 1 per hundredweight or more because of this price risk along with anticipated high feed costs dairy producers may consider signing up for the 2023 dairy margin coverage program for up to five million pounds of milk marketings at the 9 50 margin for a fee of 0 15 per hundredweight profits may also be protected with the dairy revenue protection program and the livestock gross margin plan for dairy also dairy futures currently offer opportunities to protect favorable prices by hedging class iii or buying class iii put options cropp is professor emeritus at the university of wisconsin cooperative extension university of wisconsin madison
