want to thank each and every member of heico s worldwide team for these efforts and the outstanding results that we are reporting today i will now summarize the highlights of our third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 21 we were very pleased to report consolidated operating income and net sales in the third quarter of fiscal 21 improved 47 and 22 respectively as compared to the third quarter of fiscal 20 which was the quarter in which our operating results were most negatively affected by the pandemic our performance principally reflects quarterly consolidated organic net sales growth of 17 as well as the favorable impact from our fiscal 20 and 21 acquisitions the flight support group reported quarterly increases of 250 and 33 in operating income and net sales respectively as compared to the third quarter of fiscal 20 these substantial increases principally reflect increased demand for the majority of our commercial aerospace products and services resulting from some recovery in global commercial air travel as compared to the prior year in addition this marks the fourth consecutive quarter of sequential growth in net sales and operating income at the flight support group we are very pleased with this trend and we do expect to see it continue the electronic technologies group reported quarterly increases of 14 and 11 in net sales and operating income respectively as compared to the third quarter of fiscal 20 these increases principally reflect the impact from our profitable fiscal 20 and 21 acquisitions as well as strong organic net sales for the majority of our products our total debt to shareholders equity improved to 17 4 as of july 31 21 and that compared to 36 8 as of october 31 20 our net debt which is total debt less cash and cash equivalents of 117 1 million as of july 31 compared to shareholders equity ratio improved to a very low 5 3 as of july 31 21 and that was down from 16 6 as of october 31 20 obviously we are not a heavily leveraged company and we have a lot of debt capacity and ability for acquisition and growth our net debt to ebitda ratio improved to 0 25 as of july 31 21 down from 0 71 times as of october 31 20 during fiscal 21 we successfully completed four acquisitions and have no significant debt maturities until fiscal 24 we plan to utilize our financial strength and flexibility to aggressively pursue high quality acquisitions of various sizes to accelerate growth and maximize shareholder returns cash flow provided by operating activities was very strong increasing 33 to 124 million in the third quarter of fiscal 21 and that was up from 93 1 million in the third quarter of fiscal 20 cash flow provided by operating activities remained strong increasing 12 to 334 1 million in the first nine months of fiscal 21 and that was up from 299 million in the first nine months of fiscal 20 in july 21 we paid a regular semi annual cash dividend of 0 09 per share and this represented our 86th consecutive semiannual cash dividend and it was 12 5 higher than the 0 08 per share cash dividend we paid in january 21 in june 21 we acquired 80 1 of the assets of camtronics an faa certified part 145 repair station with extensive proprietary faa designated engineering representative repairs the remaining 19 9 interest continues to be owned by certain members of camtronics management team as well as certain members of the management team of an existing heico flight support subsidiary camtronics is part of heico flight support and we expect the acquisition to be accretive to earnings within the first 12 months following closing earlier this month we acquired 89 of ridge engineering and the bechdon company ridge is a leader in performing tight tolerance machining and brazing of large sized parts in mission critical defense and aerospace applications bechdon provides machining fabrication and welding services for aerospace defense and other industrial applications the remaining 11 interest continues to be owned by certain members of ridge s and bechdon management team these companies are now part of heico s flight support group and we expect these acquisitions to be accretive to our earnings per share within the first 12 months following closing at this time i would like to introduce eric mendelson co president of heico and president of heico s flight support group and he will discuss the results of the flight support group eric a mendelson co president and president of heico s flight support group thank you very much i d like to start out by first thanking all of heico s team members for their incredible dedication and in particular their sacrifice in 2020 i think our shareholders and the community at large expect phenomenal results from heico and they just automatically think that we re able to pump out these incredible results quarter after quarter but the truth is that all of the businesses that we re in are very competitive businesses and our people have to work incredibly hard and last year they went through tremendous sacrifices tremendous personal sacrifices in order to help heico and looking at the results that we see now today i believe it s the result of that hard work and dedication so i just personally thank all of the heico team members for everything that they ve done to make our company what it is today moving on to the prepared remarks the flight support group s net sales increased 33 to 237 1 million in the third quarter of fiscal 21 up from 178 2 million in the third quarter of fiscal 20 the net sales increase in the third quarter of fiscal 21 is principally from organic growth of 32 the organic growth is mainly attributable to increased demand for commercial aerospace products across all of our product lines the flight support group s net sales were 666 7 million in the first nine months of fiscal 21 as compared to 731 2 million in the first nine months of fiscal 20 the net sales decrease in the first nine months of fiscal 21 is principally organic and reflects lower demand for the majority of our commercial aerospace products and services resulting from a decline in global commercial air travel attributable to the pandemic the flight support group s operating income increased 250 to 42 1 million in the third quarter of fiscal 21 up from 12 million in the third quarter of fiscal 20 the operating income increase in the third quarter of fiscal 21 principally reflects the previously mentioned net sales growth and an improved gross profit margin mainly due to increased demand for our commercial aviation products additionally we had a decrease in bad debt expense due to certain commercial aviation customers filing for bankruptcy protection in the third quarter of fiscal 20 last year as a result of the pandemic s financial impact the flight support group s operating income was 103 4 million in the first nine months of 21 as compared to 121 6 million in the first nine months of fiscal 20 the operating income decrease in the first nine months of fiscal 21 principally reflects the previously mentioned lower net sales as well as higher performance based compensation expense and the impact from lost fixed cost efficiencies stemming from the pandemic partially offset by a decrease in bad debt expense the flight support group s operating margin improved to 17 7 in the third quarter of fiscal 21 up from 6 7 in the third quarter of fiscal 20 the operating margin increase in the third quarter of fiscal 21 principally reflects the previously mentioned increase in net sales improved gross profit margin and lower bad debt expense the flight support group s operating margin was 15 5 in the first nine months of fiscal 21 as compared to 16 6 in the first nine months of fiscal 20 the operating margin decrease in the first nine months of fiscal 21 principally reflects an increase in sg a expenses as a percentage of net sales mainly from the previously mentioned higher performance based compensation expense and lost fixed cost efficiencies partly offset by the previously mentioned lower bad debt expense now i would like to introduce victor mendelson co president of heico and president of heico s electronic technologies group to discuss the results of the electronic technologies group victor h mendelson co president and president of heico s electronic technologies group eric thank you and first let me thank all of heico s remarkably talented and dedicated team members who delivered yet again on behalf of each other on behalf of our customers and on behalf of our fellow shareholders this quarter as you did throughout 2020 and throughout this year and frankly before and as you do in both good times and in challenging times we are truly grateful for what you do and how you do it and thank you to all of our team members the electronic technologies group s net sales increased 14 to 239 5 million in the third quarter of fiscal 21 up from 210 9 million in the third quarter of fiscal 20 the net sales increase in the third quarter of fiscal 21 principally resulted from our fiscal 20 and 21 acquisitions as well as organic growth of 5 the organic growth principally reflects increased demand from our other electronic defense medical and commercial aerospace products partially offset by decreased commercial space net sales as we ve historically noted commercial space revenue recognitions tends to be uneven through the quarters due to factors like 606 accounting and periodic shifting of production resources between commercial and defense space work which occurred this quarter and saw total space activity overall in line with our expectations importantly our space orders remained healthy the electronic technologies group s net sales increased 11 to a record 706 2 million in the first nine months of fiscal 21 up from 638 3 million in the first nine months of fiscal 20 the net sales increase in the first nine months of fiscal 21 principally reflects our fiscal 20 and 21 acquisitions as well as organic growth of 2 the organic growth principally reflects decreased demand for our other electronic and defense products partially offset by lower commercial aerospace and commercial space product sales the electronic technologies group s operating income increased 11 to 69 million in the third quarter of fiscal 21 up from 61 9 million in the third quarter of fiscal 20 the operating income increase in the third quarter of fiscal 21 principally reflects the previously mentioned net sales growth partially offset by a slightly lower gross profit margin mainly from the commercial space products net sales decrease the electronic technologies group s operating income increased 8 to a record 200 4 million in the first nine months of fiscal 21 up from 184 9 million in the first nine months of fiscal 20 the operating income increase in the first nine months of fiscal 21 principally reflects the previously mentioned net sales growth partially offset by a lower gross profit margin mainly from a less favorable product mix for defense products and the lower commercial space products net sales which in turn was partially offset by an increase in net sales of other electronic products the electronic technologies group s operating margin was 28 8 in the third quarter of fiscal 21 as compared to 29 4 in the third quarter of fiscal 20 the electronic technologies group s operating margin was 28 4 in the first nine months of fiscal 21 as compared to 29 in the first nine months of fiscal 20 the current year s third quarter and nine months margins are within the anticipated range i frequently discussed on these calls and remain excellent overall margins of which we and our team members are very proud the operating margin change in the third quarter and nine months of fiscal 21 principally reflects the previously mentioned gross profit margin effects from the periodic commercial space sales shift i turn the call back over to larry mendelson laurans a mendelson chairman and chief executive officer thank you victor and eric moving on to earnings per share consolidated net income per diluted share increased 40 to 0 56 in the third quarter of fiscal 21 and that was up from 0 40 in the third quarter of fiscal 20 the increase in the third quarter of fiscal 21 principally reflects previously mentioned higher operating income at both operating segments consolidated net income per diluted share was 1 58 in the first nine months of fiscal 21 and that compared to 1 83 in the first nine months of fiscal 20 the decrease in the first nine months of fiscal 21 principally reflects higher income tax expense and lower operating income of flight support partially offset by higher operating income of the electronic technologies group depreciation and amortization expense totaled 22 9 million in the third quarter of fiscal 21 and that was up slightly from 21 9 million in the third quarter of fiscal 20 and totaled 68 8 million in the first nine months of fiscal 21 and that was up from 65 2 million in the first nine months of fiscal 20 the increase in the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 21 principally reflects the incremental impact from our fiscal 20 and 21 acquisitions research and development expense increased to 18 million or 3 8 of net sales in the third quarter of fiscal 21 and that was up from 15 1 million or 3 9 of net sales in the third quarter fiscal 20 r d expense increased to 52 2 million or 3 8 of net sales in the first nine months of fiscal 21 and that was up from 49 million or 3 6 of net sales in the first nine months of fiscal 20 as usual significant ongoing new product development efforts are continuing at both etg and flight support our consolidated sg a expenses were 83 9 million in the third quarter of fiscal 21 and that compared to 75 million in the third quarter of fiscal 20 the increase in consolidated sg a expense in the third quarter of fiscal 21 principally reflects higher performance based compensation expense higher other sg a expense and the impact from our fiscal 20 and 21 acquisitions partially offset by lower bad debt expense consolidated sg a expenses were 245 1 million in the first nine months of fiscal 21 and that compared to 232 8 million in the first nine months of fiscal 20 the increase in consolidated sg a expenses in the first nine months of fiscal 21 principally reflects higher performance based compensation expense and the impact from our fiscal 20 and 21 acquisitions and partially offset by reductions in bad debt expense and other sg a expense the company s lower bad debt expense in the first nine months and third quarter of fiscal 21 reflects higher bad debt expense in the first nine months and third quarter of fiscal 20 and that was due to potential collection difficulties from certain commercial aviation customers that filed for bankruptcy protection during the third quarter of fiscal 20 as a result of the pandemic s financial impact consolidated sg a expense as a percentage of net sales decreased to 17 8 in the third quarter of fiscal 21 and that was down from 19 4 in the third quarter of fiscal 20 the decrease in consolidated sg a expense as a percentage of net sales in the third quarter of fiscal 21 principally reflects lower bad debt expense as well as efficiencies gained from the previously mentioned net sales growth partially offset by higher performance based compensation consolidated sg a expense as a percentage of net sales was 18 1 in the first nine months of fiscal 21 and that compared to 17 1 in the first nine months of fiscal 20 the increase in consolidated sg a expense as a percentage of net sales in the first nine months of fiscal 21 principally reflects higher performance based compensation expense partially offset by lower bad debt expense interest expense decreased to 1 7 million in the third quarter of fiscal 21 and that was down from 2 6 million in the third quarter of fiscal 20 the decrease was principally due to lower weighted average balance on borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility and interest expense decreased to 6 2 million in the first nine months of fiscal 21 down from 10 6 million in the first nine months of fiscal 20 that decrease was principally due to a lower weighted average interest rate on borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility other income in the first nine months and third quarter was not significant our effective tax rate was 15 7 in the third quarter of fiscal 21 and that was up from 13 4 in the third quarter of fiscal 20 the increase principally reflects a larger deduction related to foreign derived intangible income principally resulting from final tax regulations that were issued in the third quarter of fiscal 20 our effective tax rate in the first nine months of fiscal 21 was 13 3 and that compared to 3 5 in the first nine months of fiscal 20 as previously discussed in a prior quarterly teleconference heico recognized a larger discrete tax benefit from stock option exercises in the first quarter of fiscal 20 compared to fiscal 21 and that accounted for the majority of the increase in the year to date effective tax rate in addition our effective tax rate in the first nine months of fiscal 21 reflects the favorable impact of higher tax exempt unrealized gains in the cash surrender value of life insurance policies related to the heico corporation leadership compensation plan net income attributable to non controlling interest was 6 8 million in the third quarter fiscal 21 and that compared to 3 2 million in the third quarter of fiscal 20 net income attributable to non controlling interest was 18 2 million in the first nine months of fiscal 21 and that compared to 16 6 million in the first nine months of fiscal 20 the increase in net income attributable to non controlling interest in both the third quarter of fiscal 21 and the first nine months of fiscal 21 principally reflects higher allocation of net income to non controlling interest as a result of certain fiscal 20 acquisitions and an increase in the operating results of certain subsidiaries of flight support and etg in which non controlling interest are held for the full fiscal 21 year we now estimate a combined effective tax rate and non controlling interest rate between 22 and 23 of pre tax income our days sales outstanding of receivables improved to 41 days as of july 31 21 and that was down from 43 days as of july 31 20 of course we monitor all receivable collection efforts in order to limit credit exposure no one customer accounted for more than 10 of net sales and our top 5 customers represented approximately 22 and 25 of consolidated net sales in the third quarter of fiscal 21 and 20 respectively our inventory turnover rate improved to 150 days for the period ending july 31 21 and that compared to 154 days for the period ending july 31 20 now for the outlook looking ahead to the remainder of fiscal 21 and to fiscal 22 we remain cautiously optimistic that the ongoing worldwide rollout of covid 19 vaccines will positively influence commercial air travel and will benefit the markets we serve but as we have all learned it is difficult to predict the pandemic s path and effects including factors like vaccination rates new variants which can impact our key markets therefore we feel it would not be responsible to provide fiscal 21 net sales and earnings guidance at this time nor for 22 however our ongoing conservative policies very strong balance sheet high degree of liquidity enable us to invest in new r d execute on our successful acquisition program and position heico for market share gains as the industry recovers again in closing i would like to thank our incredible team members for their continued support and commitment to heico without their unwavering passion to exceed customer expectation our outstanding quarterly results would not be possible thank you for making heico such an excellent and unique company i also want to thank our loyal shareholder base that recognizes the future or believes as we do that the future is very bright and continue to hold our shares and support our efforts thank you and now i d like to open the floor for questions questions and answers operator your first question comes from the line of larry solow from cjs securities your line is open please ask your question larry solow cjs securities analyst great good morning guys and thanks for taking the questions first question larry perhaps for you just on a more macro temperature check it sounds like obviously we realize it s a very fluid situation with covid and all but just what are you guys seeing obviously we saw a nice large improvement in commercial travel in the first six months of the year and now we re sort of stabilizing down about 20 has this driven any changes in customer behavior order trends and more importantly the path to full recovery seems like it s sort of up in the year but do you still kind of think you can get back to 19 levels sort of some time maybe perhaps toward the end of calendar 22 particularly in fsg and commercial aviation laurans a mendelson chairman and chief executive officer so larry that s a very difficult question to ask it s like asking a fortune teller what s in my future so it s so difficult because things like the new delta version of covid pop up all of a sudden we were on a streak restaurants are pulling back people are saying well hesitating and so forth my personal opinion is that we will continue to grow through the remainder of 21 i m talking about flight support larry solow cjs securities analyst yeah of course laurans a mendelson chairman and chief executive officer we ll grow through the remainder of 21 and certainly into 22 again we are cautious because what is going to happen will the other shoe drop assuming that we don t have another shoe dropping and another version of covid or some other unusual event or the afghanis attacking mr biden or something but assuming things are kind of normal i see continued strength and growth in our markets but to go out on the limb and predict it and tell shareholder we re definitely going to do it that s just not been our style we don t hype the stock we say we ll try our best but i mean i have a very positive outlook i can t based upon what i see i feel very positive but could something else happen yes i d like eric to add to that if you don t mind larry solow cjs securities analyst absolutely eric a mendelson co president and president of heico s flight support group hi larry good morning it s eric larry solow cjs securities analyst hi eric a mendelson co president and president of heico s flight support group so great question and something we spend a lot of time talking about i spent a lot of the last two weeks with our aftermarket leadership and sales and marketing folks understanding what they re seeing and what their plans are and i can tell you that they re all very optimistic and i believe that we not i believe we are continuing to take market share we re doing very well in all of our businesses in the aftermarket i feel that since we were able to hang on to a greater percentage of our people than our competitors that we are very well positioned for the recovery specifically to answer your question across the board no we have not seen a drop in business as a result of the delta variant thus far the americas in general has been strong europe never saw really the recovery and asia ex china hasn t seen the recovery so i think that we ve got a lot of wind to our backs and i think a lot of increased demand to help drive the continue to drive the sales higher having said that if you look at what s going on with the delta variant in the united states i think it s inevitable that there ll be a little bit of pullback here i think people are continuing to travel for personal travel as well as for business meetings i think where travel is being clipped is in larger conventions larger group meetings so i don t we haven t seen it but it would be logical for us to temper back a little bit of course there is normally a little bit of a fall pull back anyway but again since we haven t seen the rebound in europe nor asia ex china i think that we ve got a lot of very good potential there so i remain very optimistic as far as when do we get back to the 19 levels i certainly hope that by the end of 22 we are back at the 19 levels however that is not to say that 22 will equal 19 because it s going to take a while to get back to those levels so i think consensus in the industry is that 2023 should overall for full year equal to 19 remember our 2023 starts november 1 in 2022 so i m pretty optimistic on how we re doing so we feel good notwithstanding the recent news flow larry solow cjs securities analyst all right no no i really appreciate that color and then maybe just switching gears real fast a quick question for victor i know you guys don t give specifics on particular acquisitions but it does look like this ridge engineering and bechdon company i guess that s two separate purchases kind of combined it looks like it s a little bit larger than some of your smaller ones to date i guess that s sort of part a of the question and then part b it looks like there you don t have a manufacturing expertise so perhaps there is some cross selling opportunities using their technologies or their expertise or capabilities as you look at your other businesses as well is that true victor h mendelson co president and president of heico s electronic technologies group well yeah larry this is victor so of course that as you know is part of the flight support group being a mechanical manufacturing business a metals based manufacturing business and there is some opportunity for cross selling with some of the things that the etg does i don t think it s going to be a tremendous needle mover but there is some opportunity there and we ll explore those as we get a little further down the road and a little more time passes larry solow cjs securities analyst got it okay great thank you guys i appreciate it victor h mendelson co president and president of heico s electronic technologies group you re welcome laurans a mendelson chairman and chief executive officer thanks larry operator your next question comes from the line of josh sullivan your line is open please ask your question josh sullivan the benchmark company llc analyst hey good morning laurans a mendelson chairman and chief executive officer morning josh josh sullivan the benchmark company llc analyst heico s always been thought of as a leader in the pma market but curious of your thoughts on the der market is camtronics part of any larger opportunity in der or just what are some of the dynamics you re seeing in that market laurans a mendelson chairman and chief executive officer yeah josh that s a great question i think something that a lot of people often overlook but yes heico we believe is the largest independent repair and overhaul group focusing on the components market in the world and when we say independent it means non oem non airline non government affiliated and a key part of that strategy is using the der repairs and when we combine that with the opportunity to use certain pma parts i think it results in an unbeatable combination i can tell you that the we operate a very decentralized business where we ve got businesses that focus on specific product and camtronics is particularly good in a number of the products that it does and it does have ders i think we ve got the ability to develop more ders and i think we re going to do very well because we offer it as a full suite it s not just walking in and offering a single der it s offering lots of ders so yes i think that s been an important part of the strategy along with the pma josh sullivan the benchmark company llc analyst okay then and then just thinking about the bad debt expense exposure at this point last year obviously was a very tough time for the airlines but as the government support tapers off going forward what do you think about your airline partners financial position just kind of broadly speaking i mean do you think the bad debt expenses are behind us or do you think that we should just be cognizant going forward laurans a mendelson chairman and chief executive officer i think the distress is behind us frankly i feel good about where they are and i can tell you looking at some of the order patterns and some of the stuff that they re ordering from us that they never bought from us before leads me to believe that heico is going to continue to take market share as they ve got to focus on cost and as heico s treated them very well through these crises but i really think the airline distress is behind us josh sullivan the benchmark company llc analyst okay thank you laurans a mendelson chairman and chief executive officer thank you operator your next question comes from the line of peter arment from baird your line is open please ask your question peter arment baird analyst yeah good morning larry victor eric carlos eric a mendelson co president and president of heico s flight support group good morning peter arment baird analyst hey eric maybe just to start with you on can you maybe just give us little more color on kind of what you just mentioned on order rates at fsg regarding you kind of were early on calling the end of the kind of destocking and we saw i guess surprisingly 16 sequential growth last quarter but just 3 this quarter maybe you could talk maybe a little bit about the cadence of what you re seeing eric a mendelson co president and president of heico s flight support group sure i mentioned in the call in the second quarter call three months ago that the 16 really surprised us and we were frankly shocked to see it so strong and i cautioned everybody at that time that i didn t see that continuing and sure enough that didn t continue at that 16 rate but look i m very happy that we held the ground when you go up 16 often you can cut back trim back i was happy that we were able to post 3 above what was off the chart numbers in hindsight would it have looked good to have 10 growth and then 10 growth yes but that s not how we manage it i can tell you the airlines with whom we deal are very optimistic and i ve never spoken to our sales force before and seen them so positive and optimistic now part of that is due to us gaining market share in the pma and the der as well as the distribution area so heico is doing very well because we were financially strong through the crisis we held on to a much larger percentage of our workforce than our competitors so i think we re starting to reap those benefits it s very hard to figure out quarter over quarter increases again the other the focus the other point i want to make is that our businesses are focused on profitability and if you see the profitability in the margin it far outpaced the sales increase we evaluate businesses on cash flow and profitability sales is sort of irrelevant as a matter of fact if you have a lot of sales and not profitability that s not a good thing at heico so because we don t want to tie up capital and that we d rather invest capital in something that s going to produce income so i am overjoyed frankly with the earnings that we ve been able to put out while delivering very good savings to the customers and i think that in north america it s there is got to be some sort of impact on flight schedules but i think it s going to be at the margins and again europe and asia ex china haven t experienced the return so i think we ve got far more upside in those areas than we do in some little potential risk in the united states i got to say our the major operators in the united states are all without exception very optimistic and they want to make sure that they re going to get product and everybody s nervous about supply chain shortages i mean there were articles in thejournal today about china not being able not that we get our products from china but not being able to get enough labor for their factories as well as covid in vietnam and all sorts of supply chain challenges so i think going they re going to be pretty aggressive and leave those parts on order so i m we re feeling good peter arment baird analyst yeah so just to follow up on that so we re not really seeing kind of a restocking yet on the shelves yet for kind of it s sort of a just in terms of the transition from out of the end of the destocking you re just you re sort of you re in a more normalized rate kind of matching overall flight activity we haven t seen kind of a restocking of parts yet eric a mendelson co president and president of heico s flight support group yeah i would say that is correct but i think in hindsight some of the second quarter may have been a little bit of restocking for certain customers no there s not wholesale restocking going on but in the americas the or really north america i think the airlines want to make sure that they ve got enough parts on the shelf so maybe there has been a little bit there was a little bit of that in the second quarter but not to the full extent that we would anticipate peter arment baird analyst okay understood and just a follow up a quick one on carlos just the your cash generation continues to be really impressive maybe you could just talk a little bit about expectations around the working capital dynamic from here is there a potential for a little bit of a headwind as demand starts to pick up as we go into next year building any inventory or anything carlos l macau executive vice president chief financial officer and treasurer peter thanks for the question i was feeling lonely over here in the corner working capital management on our subsidiaries is fantastic and i expect that to continue we went through what i ll call challenging times over the last year dealing with covid and the focus by our subsidiaries on cost management without penalizing the labor force just looking for efficiencies and doing the most lean things they could has been extraordinary and i think that will continue so i don t expect big changes in the pattern you re seeing now as sales pick up we will have it in investment in receivables that will happen i think our inventory is at the right levels right now so the only change i could see is an investment in receivables but i do anticipate capital to be strong for this year peter arment baird analyst appreciate all the colors thanks carlos l macau executive vice president chief financial officer and treasurer bye peter operator your next question comes from the line of michael ciarmoli from trust securities your line is open please ask your question michael ciarmoli trust securities analyst hey good morning guys thanks for taking the questions here i don t know eric or carlos maybe just to put a finer point on this this quarter i guess is normally a little bit slower in general coming off the heavy flying season we ve seen this pick up in delta here and i guess you re not going to get the guidance but if i look at fsg sequential growth street s got you guys at 13 into the fourth quarter i mean given what we re seeing the softer as you already telegraphed last quarter eric that 16 wasn t sustainable but is that two head or do you guys have orders and kind of confirmation that you ll see a step up in sequential growth into this current quarter we re in now carlos l macau executive vice president chief financial officer and treasurer michael this is carlos i ll answer the first part of that maybe eric will have the follow up because of the uncertainties we re seeing in the marketplace and it s real stops starts the trend is there but we have we had challenges with order patterns as the delta variant had kicked up so that s why we didn t give guidance so i don t want to comment on 13 20 5 i we really don t know i can tell you that i think in general the sales will continue to trend up we ve said consistently for quite some time that we think it s more of a linear pattern upward that s why we were surprised in q2 at the growth in fsg but i think we ll continue this pace back up to 19 levels toward the end of 22 on a trailing 12 to at the end of the year and i think that s what people should expect anything above that will be gravy and will make us all happy but we re not expecting lumpiness in the patterns quarter by quarter more of a just a linear progression up eric a mendelson co president and president of heico s flight support group yeah i think that s a great and very accurate response carlos the only thing that i would add and also on what you re bringing up here as well as some of the prior questions is that it s very difficult to predict when the restocking is going to occur we don t believe that we ve seen much restocking to date because our aog orders have been fairly strong so if people are needing parts right away they don t have them on the shelf so that leads me to believe that there is a lot of pent up demand yet to come and i keep on mentioning from europe and asia ex china so but mike it s really hard to predict when it s going to hit as you know we get roughly 70 of our orders in the monthly shipment so i really don t have we don t have visibility to be able to see that we know that we re winning market share we know we re developing products we know that our people are more pumped up than ever and so i think that we re going to do exceptionally well and people will continue to fly i m sure you ve been flying everyone s itching to fly and but when that occurs is very hard to predict so that s michael ciarmoli trust securities analyst got it eric a mendelson co president and president of heico s flight support group yeah michael ciarmoli trust securities analyst yeah got it that s fair what about are you getting any indications eric either from your people or from airlines i mean we ve been talking about maybe when this restocking happened but presumably the bulk of your demand right now coming from narrow bodies i mean should we expect assuming vaccinations continue to happen here and knock on wood maybe international travel starts to really recover is there an expectation from you guys that maybe we get a little bit of a bow wave of activity to support some of the widebodies out there in the fleet that presumably are still very much underutilized in terms of daily utilization flight activity as that starts to pick up eric a mendelson co president and president of heico s flight support group yeah i think that will start but frankly the wide body is really going to be more transoceanic traffic and my guess is that recovery is shifted more to the right and probably getting prepared for next summer my sense is next summer is going to be very strong it s interesting when i look at our asian facilities the vaccination rate is somewhere between 90 and 100 our people are vaccinated at least with one shot and we ve been very careful in how we re operating but we re doing quite well out there which leads me to believe that there is going to be a big surge in travel people are going to want to go to europe to asia they re going to want to come here i think wide body time the spring is wide body demand for parts is going to start taking off and it will be delayed just like the narrow body was but it s going to be there so i still feel good about it michael ciarmoli trust securities analyst got it okay maybe just one last one for carlos the fsg operating margins very strong sequential growth i think 3 revenue growth 18 operating growth great leverage there really high sequential incremental margins i mean can that sort of margin expansion thinking about costs starting to be layered back in as that top line continues to ramp or just how should we calibrate ourselves for margin and expansion and cadence going forward carlos l macau executive vice president chief financial officer and treasurer i think the best way michael for you to look at that is trend the operating margin up with the revenue growth i mean we ultimately expect the flight support group get back to 20 gaap operating margins and i think if you trend that upwards with the model on revenue growth you re going to be pretty much in line with at least our expectations at this point as we rebounded and as i ve mentioned in prior calls the incremental margins can be a little higher than our decrements because you have things like product flying off the shelf as opposed to manufacturing right so you can get a bigger bang for the incremental dollar than on the downside and so we saw that this quarter but i wouldn t assume massive leaps in our oi margin i would trend it with sales growth and get your model back to around 20 and then at that point i think what will happen is we ll react similarly to how we have in the past you have this incremental bump ups in the margin as time passes through efficiencies and growth in sales does that help michael ciarmoli trust securities analyst got it perfect thanks thanks guys i ll jump back in the queue operator your next question comes from the line of sheila kahyaoglu your line is open please ask your question sheila kahyaoglu jefferies llc analyst good morning guys thank you for the time i ll start with maybe etg victor i don t want you to feel left out so what s kind of going on in etg organic growth it was pretty good up 5 branded on easy comp but we ve seen a lot of suppliers really decelerate in their defense business so maybe if you could talk about what you re seeing in defense and space because i believe that accounts for 60 of etg sales kind of what s going on and should we expect any air pockets or softness victor h mendelson co president and president of heico s electronic technologies group hi sheila this is victor i would say that overall the business is as we pointed out in the numbers it was pretty much firing on just about all cylinders this quarter that s the outlook i think is pretty healthy i mean it s not every business is as strong as the other business i think we ve said over time we expect defense to flatten out at the very least with the budgets i mean the budget is not resolved as you know and so we would expect that to be the case going forward we would expect space to be strong we think our other markets right now should continue overall to be strong and of course that s predicated on what happens in the overall economy and with the viruses but right now what we see is general strength and recovery as well in our commercial aviation markets and when i refer to space i refer generally to commercial space but also our defense space and i think we ll just have to see where defense plays out over time we tend not to just look quarter to quarter as you know and in defense i think we ve constructed the business pretty well to avoid the operations tempo although we re certainly not free from that and we ve always tried to stay more focused on the higher technology realms that are not so much involved with the engagements that our country is involved in and that we re involved in a more involved with intelligence surveillance reconnaissance to a certain extent standoff warfare and things like that and that generally tends not to be as volatile of course we ll have to see how that plays out but that s been the strategy sheila kahyaoglu jefferies llc analyst okay no that s helpful color and then larry for you your favorite topic i think you guys raised your dividends and you also did three acquisitions within fsg over the last two months so kind of what are you seeing in the market whether it s for m a or using your balance sheet and just given recent deals with meggitt and parker and transdigm how do you guys approach what is a rational estimate for synergies as a percentage of sales like how do you guys see that and just your overall thoughts on the market laurans a mendelson chairman and chief executive officer well i think overall we are looking at quite a large number of transactions we re doing due diligence on them some of these big transactions specifically you mentioned the transdigm and parker with regard to meggit i think that both of them are paying very high prices for that we looked at we model dozens of public companies to see what they might look like combined with heico and they are we think they re paying a very high price but they also feel that they can get great synergies and i would say that they re both very good companies and i assume that they know what they re doing so it s probably richer than our blood could stand but i wish them good luck and success in those acquisitions we are looking at a large number of companies we certainly have the balance sheet and the capacity to do large transactions and our nature is to be more conservative of course than transdigm which you know and our model is a little bit different than transdigm but i think we are seeing a lot of opportunity and we re working on it so the problem is a lot of private equity and other money is very cheap and people are pushing up i think there is basic inflation in the m a world people are paying very high prices and we are a little bit conservative on that and also because our model is a decentralized model we don t go in and clean house with an acquisition and throw people out of jobs and all that kind of stuff so again we have to be a little bit careful in how we do things but i think there are enough transactions out potential transactions out there that will enable us to close on our fair share of what s available so i m cautiously optimistic i think with us it will be sort of business as usual it is harder because we are competing it with a lot of people with a lot of cash in their pocket and it s burning a hole in their pocket we probably won t be as aggressive as those people but that is just our style and it s worked for 31 years so i think we ll continue pretty much the way we are sheila kahyaoglu jefferies llc analyst awesome well thank you for the color laurans a mendelson chairman and chief executive officer okay operator your next question comes from the line of gautam khanna from cowen your line is open please ask your question gautam khanna cowen analyst hi good morning guys laurans a mendelson chairman and chief executive officer good morning victor h mendelson co president and president of heico s electronic technologies group morning gautam khanna cowen analyst hey i have a couple of questions first at fsg i was curious about sequential trend within the quarter so was like the exit rate in july sales in july were they substantially different than that of the preceding two months was there any sort of fits and starts you saw through the quarter anything you could talk about just within the quarter with the trend flows eric a mendelson co president and president of heico s flight support group no not gautam it s eric no i wouldn t say that we saw any real particular trends within the quarter just sort of gradual upward shift but it s no nothing that really stands out gautam khanna cowen analyst okay and then within the segment of fsg we have the three major sub segments any major differences between the three specialized products repairs and the aftermarket parts and services carlos l macau executive vice president chief financial officer and treasurer hey gautam this is carlos how are you gautam khanna cowen analyst great thank you carlos l macau executive vice president chief financial officer and treasurer the repair group was quite strong in q3 which by the way we expected but it performed quite nicely it had it really really done a good job parts and repair were way up and again we expected that i don t want to harp on this too much but the laggard if you would the lowest growing part of the segment was specialty products and again we kind of anticipated that the oem cycle is a little softer than the aftermarket so we anticipated that but it s growing nicely and we re happy with its performance and you ll see the breakout if you look at our will file our quarter on thursday so you ll be able to see the trend in the sales by those two areas eric a mendelson co president and president of heico s flight support group hey gautam this is eric that s why carlos just pointed out with the specialty products sort of growing the least out of the group although the smallest percentage that s why we ve got a lot of confidence that when that as that recovers that we re going to have a nice rebound there because we haven t seen that yet we have we ve seen some but not to the full extent gautam khanna cowen analyst that makes sense and then victor i was just curious within the etg group there s it s not all defense it s there s aero defense and then there s other industrial markets medical whatever i was curious anything you could speak about the non defense the non aero businesses within etg and how they trended in the quarter and what visibility looks like in the upcoming quarters thank you victor h mendelson co president and president of heico s electronic technologies group sure hey gautam this is victor those businesses have been very strong and actually gaining momentum throughout the year and we re seeing strong demand and they re not without supply chain challenges in fact but we have never been one of them just in time inventory companies in our own policies so we haven t really had to contend much with those challenges i anticipate that as the year wears on we might see some here and there but we ve been able to navigate those very successfully and i think that s a sign frankly that we might encounter a little more of those in the noise level that demand is just very very strong there and it doesn t seem to be subsiding and that s across the board in the various markets that we serve it s not just limited to one individual market let s say so right now we re very pleased with how those businesses are proceeding and we ve seen a nice recovery as well in some of the medical product end markets that we serve that had been affected of course by the pandemic and an improvement in demand there and obviously its procedures were put on hold in the middle or early part of 2020 those recoveries have been good for us as well so those feel pretty good for us too gautam khanna cowen analyst okay thank you victor and then larry for you last one from me just wanted to ask about your comments on the parker people paying high prices and all that i am curious is there any larger transactions you guys are looking at or is the pipeline today kind of filled with more of the typical heico acquisition profile mid sized small size tuck ins or is there an opportunity here to kind of while the cycle is still early go bigger is that something you guys are keen to do or anything you could say about that would be helpful laurans a mendelson chairman and chief executive officer so the answer is yes we are looking as i mentioned earlier in this call we are looking at larger companies sometimes we can t make the numbers work at least in our decentralized operation where we don t go in and cut and do those type of things but we are looking at larger companies and standard companies and all sized companies and we run models consistently our m a people in addition to investment banking people who call us every virtually every day to look at this possibility and this possibility so we certainly have the financial ability to do large transactions in the multi billion dollar size and our balance sheet is pristine you know that and we are trying our very best to the idea that we have is not to grow because of size top line biggest sales company but to be the most profitable company that generates the most cash so to us an acquisition is really all about cash yes earnings per share and so forth but for example on these calls what we haven t focused on is and i m sure that many many people on the call analysts and investors focus on cash i know that because when we have one on one conferences and conversations that s what they talk about so in my opinion running heico managing heico it s all about what the ebitda looks like and what is the cash flow looking like and that s the critical factor so when we make an acquisition it s all about cash flow return on our investment not to become the biggest company in aerospace or electronics or anything else so that s what we really focus on and we find if you really do the arithmetic we find that on medium size acquisitions at the right price and the right company we can generate as much or more cash than we can generate on very large companies so this is a be assured that carlos eric victor me our m a guys we re looking at this virtually 24 7 so again it s all different sizes but the bottom line to us is number one cash flow two earnings per share because if we have cash flow we ll have earnings per share but if we have earnings per share we might be heavily leveraged and we won t have cash flow that s a possibility as you know so we put that all into the model and we try to figure out what is the best total overall result for heico for an acquisition but yes we re looking at all sizes gautam khanna cowen analyst thank you guys operator your next question comes from the line of noah poponak from goldman sachs your line is open please ask your question noah poponak goldman sachs analyst hi good morning everybody laurans a mendelson chairman and chief executive officer good morning noah eric a mendelson co president and president of heico s flight support group good morning noah noah poponak goldman sachs analyst so in the aerospace aftermarket i m hearing you say no major sequential change month by month through the quarter i m hearing you say that airlines are generally still sort of concerned about not being ready for recovery as opposed to being incrementally worried about covid and i m hearing you say that you expect 4q revenue up sequentially and that s with a month under your belt and then also a period that usually transitions a little bit to business from leisure and so i guess maybe less of a question and more of a making sure i have the summary correct because we ve heard some other companies say that the exit rate of the june quarter was worse than the entry rate and suggest that airlines have gone on a little bit of a pause in aftermarket purchasing activity because they are worried about delta variant just want to confirm that i have it correct that you re not really seeing it that way that you ve seen domestic leisure strong international business weak and delta just kind of keeps it there for the time being and you re not seeing really incremental weakness that you are concerned about within your aerospace aftermarket business eric a mendelson co president and president of heico s flight support group hi noah it s eric there s a lot of information in there but basically i would agree with what you said with just one little caveat on the international side i don t think it s only business i think it s a lot of leisure travel as well that international hasn t picked up so my comment was more overall that i think international has got good potential to go up against number one and number two europe hasn t recovered and asia ex china has not recovered noah poponak goldman sachs analyst correct eric a mendelson co president and president of heico s flight support group so i would say yes noah poponak goldman sachs analyst but that was all true pre delta variant so i guess what i m saying is it sounds like your summary is that the delta variant of covid 19 has not really significantly changed the trend line in your aerospace aftermarket business for now eric a mendelson co president and president of heico s flight support group for now that is correct for now that is correct and i was asked to comment on what i thought would come down the road and since europe hasn t recovered asia ex china hasn t recovered of course the oem cycle is building and we ve got significant market share gains that i answered the way that i did but yes look i think it s possible that heico does a bit better than other companies because of these various points that we just spoke about but obviously it s very difficult to anticipate specifically what the fourth quarter is going to yeah we do have you re right we ve got 3 5 weeks under our belt but i don t have full numbers for august yet we never know what the subsidiaries are going to do until they post those numbers so i won t know until basically september 1 what the month looks like and it s very difficult to predict because we ve seen our guys tend to be fairly conservative so the trend tends to be right before the end of the month they re always way low and they end up coming in higher until i see that i don t know what it is i mean i would caution against being too aggressive for the fourth quarter because i mentioned delta variant is obviously not good news for the united states nor for the rest of the world but from what we ve seen thus far it s not crippling at all so yeah noah poponak goldman sachs analyst okay ok no that s very helpful and i recognized i packed a lot into that question there but the overall overarching summary i think i understand does heico have more exposure to what s happening with the parked fleet and aircraft coming back into service i know you have a i think a significant sized structures component repair group business and maybe there s other exposures there but in addition to usually traffic and parked are linked but to the extent that aircraft are coming back into the service at a faster clip than traffic or those are just different is that meaningful for heico eric a mendelson co president and president of heico s flight support group yeah the look i think overall the aftermarket not only for heico but for the industry is obviously you got to look at the 20 000 something aircrafts out there and by definition most of those the ones that were parked were basically in need of maintenance they didn t park the ones that didn t need maintenance so yes as demand gets added back they ve got to put money into the fleet so i think that is one of the situations that we ve seen however we do ultimately anticipate a restocking and ultimately of course the rest of the world returning to normal so my sense is it s going to be pretty those attributes are going to be present over the next year as well noah poponak goldman sachs analyst okay and then just last question the share gain that you ve referred to any way to quantify that i mean how much revenue have you added to the pma business over the last 18 months from share gain or i know it s not just in pma but any way to even directionally size what you ve accomplished there eric a mendelson co president and president of heico s flight support group yeah it s hard to for me to present what those numbers are because they re occurring in many different areas and it s difficult to see in the numbers i mean yes we know what we re doing in terms of new products but also you got to combine that with the recovery in other markets you got to look at how additional share gain is going to impact this going forward so it becomes very difficult to identify to call out carlos l macau executive vice president chief financial officer and treasurer part of the problem this is carlos part of the problem might be is because we track the share gains by customers and we certainly don t want to talk about customers on this call but we re very aware of our market share with each airline globally that we serve and we are seeing that they re buying more and they re buying things that or they re putting in orders for things that they had not bought in before so we believe that that trend that we re seeing is a result of the gaining market share from our customer base noah poponak goldman sachs analyst okay fair enough thanks very much carlos l macau executive vice president chief financial officer and treasurer you bet eric a mendelson co president and president of heico s flight support group thank you operator your next question comes from the line of louis raffetto from ubs your line is open please ask your question louis raffetto ubs analyst hey good morning everybody laurans a mendelson chairman and chief executive officer good morning eric a mendelson co president and president of heico s flight support group good morning louis raffetto ubs analyst so eric i wanted to circle back with you on the ridge bechdon deal as you talked about flight support getting back to 19 levels by the end of 22 can you how much impact does that deal sort of have on that and sort of sticking with that i know the deal didn t close till early 4q sorry i m guessing we re not going to know what you spent on that until the 10 k or any guidance you can give us on those two things just as we think about cash balances and things like that going into the year carlos l macau executive vice president chief financial officer and treasurer louis this is carlos so we didn t disclose the purchase price because the acquisition relative to our balance sheet was not material we have a big balance sheet i wouldn t look at the it being a drain on cash or we pay with cash on hand in our beginning of this month so if you look at our cash balance whatever we had sitting around we usually operate with probably half of what we got on the balance sheet so some of that went toward the acquisition louis raffetto ubs analyst okay great thank you and then eric any impact i guess on the top line you can just help us because again it does seem like it s a bigger deal within fsg than you ve done in a while so i don t know if there s anything eric a mendelson co president and president of heico s flight support group it s a nice sized company i mean they ve got about 200 people they are in the manufacturing business and they re really a very outstanding company we re really honored to be the home that they ve selected for this business and we think that there are a lot of people who would have coveted buying the company and they saw the culture that heico has got and really our long term commitment and the fact that we don t sell companies and that we just build and grow them they re going to be embarking on additional growth in terms of more buildings more equipment we re very excited about that we ve spoken with major customers and they re extremely well valued and really the furthest ahead in that space according to our customers and so we re really very very optimistic that it s going to provide another great avenue for growth just good business with really great people we re very optimistic and it s again a nice adjacent wide space for us we never did machining or bracing like this frankly i d never seen this elsewhere what they ve been able to pioneer and develop i mean it started out as a very small company and due to the grit and determination of the founders and leaders in the business and all the people they ve been able to do stuff that other people viewed as really impossible and frankly i ve barely i ve seen quite a bit of machining in my 31 years at heico and i ve never seen anything like ridge the machining and the brazing that they do is really very very close tolerance very difficult to do and i don t think anybody else in the world can really do these kinds of products so i think it s just a very good opportunity for us and it s one of the reasons i m very optimistic about our specialty products business that we re going to see continued demand as the cycle builds over on the commercial side and then with these products and some of the other stuff we re doing on the military side while i m why i m very optimistic on it louis raffetto ubs analyst okay that s great thank you carlos just another one for you i guess the corporate costs looks like another quarter of pretty high is this a new sustainable level anything else like one time in nature in there just to be mindful of as we think forward carlos l macau executive vice president chief financial officer and treasurer i think we had the only thing really in the corporate cost centers itself is performance based comp expense and i think going into the first quarter was like q2 we had a little bit more q3 was more on the run rate so i think what you ll see louis is if you look for anywhere from 1 8 to 2 of revenues that s about what our corporate cost center will amount to for any given year so that s what i d focus on if you re modeling but the only there s no unusual stuff it really is just related to hopefully having bonuses this year remember we didn t have any last year so the comparables to the prior year are low principally related to the performance based comp being absent in 2020 louis raffetto ubs analyst okay that s right and just a quick one larry you talked a lot about the m a and obviously you guys have been extremely successful in doing that over the last 30 years i bet i guess maybe the question is just has that landscape changed at all given all this new competition that you re seeing and what people are kind of willing to pay and get and then sort of combine that with your conservative nature laurans a mendelson chairman and chief executive officer well as i indicated earlier people are paying much higher prices because there is an inflation in our a in our economy and you see that just read the newspaper and they tell you that prices of goods and services is going up number one and the m a world is seeing the same thing low interest rates just a plethora of money and the definition of inflation is more money chasing the same amount of goods so obviously we are getting inflation in acquisition so the question is can we invest heico s money wisely to get the type of return that makes sense and that becomes more difficult when you re competing with somebody who is willing to pay 14 times ebitda and it take you 20 25 years to repay your investment so we look at things as a return as you would as a wise investor which you are as return on investment and we like to get our money back within say 10 years and our model is that and we pay fair prices we ll pay 8 times 10 times ebitda and but we want to see the cash flow coming back so that if we mentally say we pay whatever we pay for it by the time we re into the fourth or fifth year of owning a company we have received enough cash back to make that company costing us in our portfolio say 4 times or 5 times ebitda so it becomes a no brainer and that has been our strategy but if we have to pay prices that take us 20 years to do that all of a sudden we wind up going to the banks and getting heavily indebted which we don t again our strategy is to be relatively low leverage and we can t do that if it takes us 20 years or 25 years to recoup our investment so we do that study and that s our model our model we ve been able to grow without being heavily indebted for the past 31 years when we ve grown at a compound rate of i don t know 19 or the stock has grown at 24 of whatever it is and that s the model we want to stick to we had a board meeting the other day we discussed it and basically the board is in agreement with that so not to say there aren t opportunities for us to acquire companies that are strong cash flow generators and will give us and our shareholders holders a return on their investment so but there are a lot of companies going at 14 times and 16 times ebitda and you make all kinds of assumptions i mean you can justify any acquisition you cannot justify a 20 times ebitda price if you assume that the synergies are going to be god knows what we re a little more conservative and we don t do that i can t tell you is that the smartest thing i don t know except that we ve done 80 some acquisitions and we ve never had one blow upon us and our history is very clear so that s our strategy and i think we re sticking to that but i believe there will be enough it s harder we have to look at more companies to get one good acquisition than we ve looked at in the past but we will do that and we will continue to do it and i m convinced that we will be successful going forward i mean we have a very very experienced m a group with eric victor carlos other people that worked on it myself included so i am confident that we will continue to exceed expectations in m a but believe me it is really tough tough because people are paying price louis raffetto ubs analyst that s great i really appreciate all the color larry operator there is no further question at this time you may continue laurans a mendelson chairman and chief executive officer i do want to thank the people that have turned into this conference and shown interest in heico we appreciate your interest and your support over the years as you all know carlos eric victor myself we re available if you call us email us we ll discuss if you have questions that we can answer without running into problems sec problems disclosure problems we ll be very happy to discuss things anything that we can discuss openly we ll be happy to our doors and telephones are open to you and we welcome any call that you may want to make we will talk to you i guess the fourth quarter we don t report until the middle toward the end of december probably in the middle of december so we look forward to speaking with you at that time and in the meantime let us know if you have any questions but again thank you very much and this ends our formal

comparison to the last 10 years dani lipkin director of global business development at tmx said article content total equity financing in the sector is poised to break the 2016 record of 3 12 billion for the whole year in the world of privately held renewable energy companies the financing market is also active though not as frothy there is a fair amount of capital in the private markets as well but the way i would describe the difference between the two is in the private markets it looks like the capital is a bit more disciplined or institutional said brian boulanger chief executive of arc financial corp a calgary based private equity firm arc financial has previously been a major funder of early stage oil and gas producers and energy services companies but boulanger said the firm has expanded its mandate to start investing in the energy transition he said the company has recently closed a deal the details of which he s not ready to disclose with a private renewables company company valuations for publicly traded companies have outpaced those on the private side boulanger said advertisement 3 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article

from what i ve seen he said adding that this has led more renewable companies to look for public capital rather than private equity one thing that we re going to see a lot in this energy transition space is volatility he said adding the volatility has in some cases led to overly generous valuations for companies one of the things that investors need to be careful about is managing enthusiasm about how quickly this energy transition is going to play out in total there are 88 cleantech companies listed on the two tmx group exchanges with a market cap of 89 1 billion as of the end of june this is the highest market cap the sector has seen in at least the past 10 years tmx data show around 16 cleantech companies were listed on the two exchanges including nine on the main tsx exchange in the first six months of the year according to tsx data compared to no listings during the first six months of 2020 that momentum has continued in july with two more clean energy listings we have a very robust pipeline and continue to see strong interest in public markets and companies ability to tap into financing and grow said tmx s lipkin when asked about the prospects of new listings in the

the vegetation management and industrial vehicle company faces challenges but also has opportunities second quarter earnings results show forestry commercial and agricultural vehicle maker alamo group alg 0 10 revved up its performance this spring and early summer as the economy started shaking off the effects of covid 19 lockdowns alamo saw orders slump in 2020 due to the impact of the pandemic among other reasons some trends created by last year s temporary lockdowns may even be giving alamo a further lift though other factors are interfering with its growth there are at least two points investors should consider before deciding whether or not to add alamo group to their portfolios 1 alamo is rebounding and showing signs of longer term growth unsurprisingly alamo group s second quarter report revealed a strong rebound from the covid 19 crimped prior year period with revenue and net income significantly improved in addition alamo group s acquisitions of morbark and other small companies several years ago are helping catalyze growth now year over year quarterly revenue jumped by 29 to 347 6 million while adjusted earnings per share surged by 73 to 1 97 these metrics also grew compared to q2 2019 by 21 9 and 12 6 respectively significantly the company has also paid down much of the long term debt it was forced to take on earlier in the covid 19 pandemic its long term debt at the end of q2 2019 was 166 2 million by the end of q2 2020 that figure had exploded to 423 7 million now it s hovering around 299 million still significantly above 2019 s figure but the deleveraging continues and the company also has 85 6 million in cash on hand unlike some companies alamo group continued paying its dividend throughout 2020 it also increased the quarterly per share payout from 0 13 to 0 14 at the start of this year revenue and earnings growth are likely to persist as orders have continued to pour in leading to an all time record backlog in orders during the quarter we saw continued strong customer demand across the entire range of our industrial and agricultural products chief sustainability officer dan malone said during the q2 earnings conference call on aug 5 2 new trends favor alamo group despite its negative impact especially in the first half of 2020 the covid 19 pandemic also caused some significant shifts in trends that will be beneficial to alamo now the company s agricultural equipment sales are specifically improving because of these factors according to some research the recent rise in commodity prices will probably boost cash crop income by approximately 30 this will lift farmers incomes enabling more purchases of new equipment according to information compiled by alamo competitor deere co de 0 83 for its fiscal third quarter investor presentation north american sales of large agricultural equipment are expected to rise by 25 during its fiscal 2021 while small equipment will grow by 10 the forecasts say that asian sales will increase significantly european sales will rise by 10 to 15 and south american demand for tractors and combines will jump by 20 this trend has clearly given alamo group s agricultural division a much needed lift earnings reports from before the covid 19 pandemic showed agriculture vehicle sales declining in q2 2019 these sales dropped 6 6 year over year in the comments accompanying that quarter s report ceo ron robinson said this was because of adverse weather trade tariffs and prolonged soft agricultural commodity prices in q1 2020 sector sales dropped 4 4 however agricultural equipment sales are hot in 2021 surging by 35 year over year in q2 sales are also up from 2019 though direct comparisons are more difficult to make because the company has reorganized how its division sales are reported ceo robinson noted the company s agricultural division benefited from robust demand for its mowers and agricultural implements from farm and ranch customers he also said non governmental purchases in the industrial division had improved most notably in our morbark business which serves the forestry and tree care markets with more people opting for rural or semi rural lifestyles more equipment will be needed to improve land remove brush to prevent wildfires and the like these sales are being driven by the same factors giving the recreational vehicle market a long term surge and creating growth for retailer tractor supply tsco 2 33 as sales of mowers and utility vehicles climb is alamo looking bullish alamo group looks like a good pick among lesser known industrial stocks its overall growth both relative to 2020 and as part of a long term pattern stretching back into 2018 is strong its previously weak agricultural division is now thriving because of new but apparently persistent trends it pays a dividend and it managed to do so throughout the worst of the pandemic s economic impacts too now it s turning out record results despite some supply chain issues demand for food and forestry products isn t likely to decline any time soon and the overall outlook for this equipment company is positive into the medium term and probably longer

holding 17 different factors steady in a complex statistical analysis of more than 2 million conventional mortgage applications for home purchases we found that lenders were 40 more likely to turn down latino applicants for loans 50 more likely to deny asian pacific islander applicants and 70 more likely to deny native american applicants than similar white applicants lenders were 80 more likely to reject black applicants than similar white applicants these are national rates in every case the prospective borrowers of color looked almost exactly the same on paper as the white applicants except for their race the industry had criticized previous similar analyses for not including financial factors they said would explain disparities in lending rates but were not public at the time debts as a percentage of income how much of the property s assessed worth the person is asking to borrow and the applicant s credit score the first two are now public in the home mortgage disclosure act data including these financial data points in our analysis not only failed to eliminate racial disparities in loan denials it highlighted new devastating ones we found that lenders gave fewer loans to black applicants than white applicants even when their incomes were high 100 000 a year or more and had the same debt ratios in fact high earning black applicants with less debt were rejected more often than high earning white applicants who have more debt lenders used to tell us it s because you don t have the lending profiles the ethno racial differences would go away if you had them said josé loya assistant professor of urban planning at ucla who has studied public mortgage data extensively and reviewed our methodology your work shows that s not true we sent our complete analysis to industry representatives the american bankers association the mortgage bankers association the community home lenders association and the credit union national association they all criticized it generally saying the public data is not complete enough to draw conclusions but did not point to any flaws in our computations blair bernstein director of public relations for the aba acknowledged that our analysis showed disparities but that given the limitations in the public data we used the numbers are not sufficient on their own to explain why those disparities exist in written statements the aba and mba criticized the markup s analysis for not including credit scores and for focusing on conventional loans only and not including government loans such as those guaranteed by the federal housing administration and department of veterans affairs isolating conventional loans from government loans is common in mortgage research because they are different products with different thresholds for approval and loan terms government loans bring people who wouldn t otherwise qualify into the market but tend to be more expensive for the borrower even the federal reserve and consumer financial protection bureau the agency that releases mortgage data separate conventional and fha loans in their research on lending disparities authors of one academic study out of northeastern and george washington universities said they focus on conventional loans only because fha loans have long been implemented in a manner that promotes segregation as for credit scores it was impossible for us to include them in our analysis because the cfpb strips them from public view from hmda data in part due to the mortgage industry s lobbying to remove them citing borrower privacy when the cfpb first proposed expanding mortgage data collection to include the very data that industry trade groups have told us is vital for doing this type of analysis credit scores debt to income ratio and loan to value ratio those same groups objected they didn t want the government to even collect the data let alone make it public they cited the risk of a cyberattack which could reveal borrowers private information these new data fields include confidential financial data several large trade groups wrote in a letter to the cfpb including the aba and mba consequently if this sic data are inadvertently or knowingly released to the public the harm associated with re identification would be even greater government regulators do have access to credit scores the cfpb analyzed 2019 hmda data and found that accounting for credit scores does not eliminate lending disparities for people of color in addition to finding disparities in loan denials nationally we examined cities and towns across the country individually and found disparities in 89 metropolitan areas spanning every region of the country in charlotte where crystal marie and her family searched for a home lenders were 50 more likely to deny loans to black applicants than white ones with similar financial profiles in other places the gap was even larger black applicants in chicago were 150 more likely to be denied by financial institutions than similar white applicants there lenders were more than 200 more likely to reject latino applicants than white applicants in waco texas and to reject asian and pacific islander applicants than white ones in port st lucie florida and native american applicants in minneapolis were 100 more likely to be denied by financial institutions than similar white applicants there it s something that we have a very painful history with said alderman matt martin who represents chicago s 47th ward redlining the now outlawed practice of branding certain black and immigrant neighborhoods too risky for financial investments that began in the 1930s can be traced back to chicago chicago activists exposed that banks were still redlining in the 1970s leading to the establishment of the home mortgage disclosure act the law mandating the collection of data used for this story when you see that maybe the tactics are different now but the outcomes are substantially similar martin added it s just not something we can continue to tolerate who makes these loan decisions officially lending officers at each institution in reality software most of it mandated by a pair of quasi governmental agencies freddie mac and fannie mae were founded by the federal government to spur homeownership and now buy about half of all mortgages in america if they don t approve a loan the lenders are on their own if the borrower skips out and that power means fannie and freddie essentially set the rules for the industry starting from the very beginning of the mortgage approval process fannie and freddie require lenders to use a particular credit scoring algorithm classic fico to determine whether an applicant meets the minimum threshold necessary to even be considered for a conventional mortgage currently a score of 620 this algorithm was developed from data from the 1990s and is more than 15 years old it s widely considered detrimental to people of color because it rewards traditional credit to which white americans have more access it does not consider among other things on time payments for rent utilities and cellphone bills but will lower people s scores if they get behind on them and are sent to debt collectors unlike more recent models it penalizes people for past medical debt even if it s since been paid this is how structural racism works said chi chi wu a staff attorney at the national consumer law center this is how racism gets embedded into institutions and policies and practices with absolutely no animus at all potentially fairer credit models have existed for years a recent study by vantage score a credit model developed by the big three credit bureaus to compete with fico estimated that its model would provide credit to 37 million americans who have no scores under fico models almost a third of them would be black or latino yet fannie and freddie have resisted a steady stream of plaintive requests since 2014 from advocates the mortgage and housing industries and congress to update to a newer model even the company that created classic fico has lobbied for the agencies to adopt a newer version which it said expands credit to more people a lot of things that minorities and underserved borrowers are doing responsible financial behaviors are going under the radar said scott olson executive director of chla a trade group representing small and midsized independent mortgage lenders fannie s and freddie s regulator and conservator the federal housing finance agency continues to allow the companies to stick with classic fico more than five years after ordering them to study the effects of switching to something newer the fhfa has also expressed concern about the cost and operational implications if they would have to continually test new credit scoring models neither of the companies would answer questions from the markup about why they still require classic fico they ve been testing alternate scores for years and i don t know why the process is taking so long said lisa rice president and ceo of the national fair housing alliance a consortium of hundreds of fair housing organizations well deserving consumers are being left behind fannie s and freddie s approval process also involves other mysterious algorithms automated underwriting software programs that they first launched in 1995 to much fanfare about their speed ease and most important fairness using a data base as opposed to human judgment can avoid influences by other forces such as discrimination against minority individuals and red lining peter maselli then a vice president of freddie mac told the new york times when it launched its software now called loan product advisor a bank executive told congress that year the new systems were explicitly and implicitly color blind since they did not consider a person s race at all in their evaluations but like similar promises that algorithms would make colorblind decisions in criminal risk assessment and health care research shows that some of the factors fannie and freddie say their software programs consider affect people differently depending on their race or ethnicity these include in addition to credit histories the prospective borrowers assets employment status debts and the size of the loan relative to the value of the property they re hoping to buy the quality of the data that you re putting into the underwriting algorithm is crucial said aracely panameño director of latino affairs for the center for responsible lending if the data that you re putting in is based on historical discrimination then you re basically cementing the discrimination at the other end research has shown that payday loan sellers usually place branches in neighborhoods populated mainly by people of color where bank branches are less common as a result residents are more likely to use these predatory services to borrow money this creates lopsided incomplete credit histories because banks report both good and bad financial behavior to credit bureaus while payday loan services only report missed payments gig workers who are people of color are more likely to report that those jobs are their primary source of income rather than a side hustle they re using for extra cash than white gig workers having multiple sources of income or unconventional employment can complicate the verification process for a mortgage as crystal marie and eskias mcdaniels learned considering an applicant s assets beyond the down payment which lenders call reserves can cause particular problems for people of color people with fatter bank accounts present a lower risk because they can more easily weather a setback that would leave others unable to pay the mortgage but largely due to intergenerational wealth and past racist policies the typical white family in america today has eight times the wealth of a typical black family and five times the wealth of a latino family people of color are more likely to have smaller savings accounts and smaller or nonexistent stock portfolios than white people this is a relatively new world of automated underwriting engines that by intent may not discriminate but by effect likely do said david stevens a former president and ceo of the mortgage bankers association now an independent financial consultant not even home valuations are free from controversy the president of the trade group representing real estate appraisers who determine property values for loans recently acknowledged that racial bias is prevalent in the industry and launched new programs to combat it any type of data that you look at from the financial services space has a high tendency to be highly correlated to race said rice of the national fair housing alliance in written statements fannie said its software analyzes applications without regard to race and both fannie and freddie said their algorithms are routinely evaluated for compliance with fair lending laws internally and by the fhfa and the department of housing and urban development hud said in an email to the markup that it has asked the pair to make changes in underwriting criteria as a result of those reviews but would not disclose the details this analysis includes a review to ensure that model inputs are not serving as proxies for race or other protected classes chad wandler freddie s director of public relations said in a written statement he declined to elaborate on what the review entails or how often it s done no one outside fannie and freddie knows exactly how the factors in their underwriting software are used or weighted the formulas are closely held secrets not even the companies regulator the fhfa appears to know beyond broad strokes exactly how the software scores applicants according to stevens who served as federal housing commissioner and assistant secretary for housing at hud during the obama administration the markup s analysis does not include decisions made by fannie s and freddie s underwriting algorithms because while lenders are required to report those decisions to the government the cfpb scrubs them from public mortgage data arguing that including them would likely disclose information about the applicant or borrower that is not otherwise public and may be harmful or sensitive lenders ultimate mortgage decisions are public however borrowers names are not reported to the government and addresses are not in the public data fannie and freddie declined to answer our questions about why their algorithms decisions are excluded from the public data but said in a 2014 letter to the cfpb that the revelation could allow their decision making algorithms to be reverse engineered loan officers say the software s decisions are mysterious even to them when you run so many deals through the automated system you ll look at one deal that didn t get an approval and you just know that that s a better client than someone else that might ve gotten approved said ashley thomas iii a broker and owner of la top broker inc a minority owned real estate agency and brokerage in south los angeles that lack of transparency in the technology is very concerning the community home lenders association sent a letter to fannie and freddie in april complaining about unannounced changes to both of their underwriting software programs that members discovered when applicants who had previously been approved suddenly were denied scott olson executive director of chla said there s no good reason to keep lenders in the dark the more transparent the more clear the guidance is the easier it is for borrowers to know what they need to do to be in a position to qualify earlier this month and weeks after we began asking about its algorithms fannie announced in a news release that it would start incorporating on time rent payments in its loan approval software starting in mid september when we asked about the timing of that change spokesperson katie penote emailed the markup a statement saying the company wanted prospective borrowers to have this option as soon as possible but was silent about what prompted it in addition to using fannie s or freddie s software many large lenders also run applicants through their institutions own underwriting software which may be more stringent how those programs work is even more of a mystery they are also proprietary when we examined the reasons lenders listed for denying mortgages in 2019 the most common reason across races and ethnicities with the exception of native americans was that applicants had too much debt relative to their incomes when lenders did list credit history as the reason for denial it was cited more often for black applicants than white ones in 2019 33 versus 21 when we examined the decisions by individual lenders many denied people of color more than white applicants an additional statistical analysis showed that several were at least 100 more likely to deny people of color than similar white borrowers among them the mortgage companies owned by nation s three largest home builders the two principal laws forbidding housing and lending discrimination are the 1968 fair housing act and the 1974 equal credit opportunity act an alphabet soup of federal agencies can refer evidence of violations of these laws to hud or the justice department for investigation but referrals have dropped precipitously over the past decade marcia fudge who took over hud leadership earlier this year told axios in june that part of the reason black ownership rates are so low in america is that we have never totally enforced the fair housing act in an email hud press secretary meaghan lynch told the markup that fudge intends to tackle systemic discrimination in the housing and credit markets that is at the heart of the racial homeownership gap we do have laws that explicitly protect against discrimination and yet you still see these disparities that you re finding so that suggests that we need better enforcement of existing laws and more investigations said kevin stein deputy director of the california reinvestment coalition agencies need to do a better job of ferreting out discrimination and taking serious action once they find it another key housing law the federal community reinvestment act cra of 1977 allows the federal government to penalize lenders who fail to invest in low income or blighted neighborhoods but makes no requirements regarding borrowers race stein s group has lobbied for the law to be reformed lenders who violate fair lending rules can be punished with fines in the millions of dollars rep al green a texas democrat has sponsored legislation wending its way through congress that would make it a crime to engage in lending discrimination banks already have laws that punish people who commit fraud he said you can be imprisoned for i hope you have your seatbelt on 30 years why not have some similar law that deals with banks who are invidiously discriminating against people who are trying to borrow money and some fair lending advocates have begun to ask whether the value system in mortgage lending should be tweaked as an industry we need to think about what are the less discriminatory alternatives even if they are a valid predictor of risk said david sanchez a former federal housing finance agency policy analyst who currently directs research and development at the nonprofit national community stabilization trust because if we let risk alone govern all of our decisions we are going to end up in the exact same place we are now when it comes to racial equity in this country crystal marie mcdaniels said whatever effect race may have had on her denial it wasn t overt i m not sure you ever really know because there s no klansmen in our yard or anything but it s definitely something we always think about she said it s just something that we always understand might be a possibility the lender loandepot denied race had anything to do with the decision the company s vice president of communications lori wildrick said in an email that the company follows the law and expects fair and equitable treatment for every applicant we take the issues raised by ms mcdaniels very seriously and are conducting a thorough review of her concerns crystal marie said buying a house was crucial for her because she wants to pass on wealth to her son someday giving him an advantage she never had so when the loan officer told her the deal wasn t going to happen she refused to give up with the help of their real estate agent and multiple emails from her employer on her behalf she and her husband eskias pushed back against the denial around 8 p m on the night before the original closing date crystal marie got an email from the lender you re cleared to close she still doesn t understand how the lender went from a no to a yes but she was relieved and elated it means so much to me as a black person to own property in a place where not that many generations ago you were property said crystal marie who said she is descended from slaves in neighboring south carolina she said her family has always had a fraught relationship with money some relatives were so mistrustful of banks that they d insisted on dealing only in cash she said making it impossible to build up credit or wealth for future generations it s meant so much she said that we were able to go through this process and finally eventually be successful

holding 17 different factors steady in a complex statistical analysis of more than 2 million conventional mortgage applications for home purchases we found that lenders were 40 more likely to turn down latino applicants for loans 50 more likely to deny asian pacific islander applicants and 70 more likely to deny native american applicants than similar white applicants lenders were 80 more likely to reject black applicants than similar white applicants these are national rates in every case the prospective borrowers of color looked almost exactly the same on paper as the white applicants except for their race the industry had criticized previous similar analyses for not including financial factors they said would explain disparities in lending rates but were not public at the time debts as a percentage of income how much of the property s assessed worth the person is asking to borrow and the applicant s credit score the first two are now public in the home mortgage disclosure act data including these financial data points in our analysis not only failed to eliminate racial disparities in loan denials it highlighted new devastating ones we found that lenders gave fewer loans to black applicants than white applicants even when their incomes were high 100 000 a year or more and had the same debt ratios in fact high earning black applicants with less debt were rejected more often than high earning white applicants who have more debt lenders used to tell us it s because you don t have the lending profiles the ethno racial differences would go away if you had them said josé loya assistant professor of urban planning at ucla who has studied public mortgage data extensively and reviewed our methodology your work shows that s not true we sent our complete analysis to industry representatives the american bankers association the mortgage bankers association the community home lenders association and the credit union national association they all criticized it generally saying the public data is not complete enough to draw conclusions but did not point to any flaws in our computations blair bernstein director of public relations for the aba acknowledged that our analysis showed disparities but that given the limitations in the public data we used the numbers are not sufficient on their own to explain why those disparities exist in written statements the aba and mba criticized the markup s analysis for not including credit scores and for focusing on conventional loans only and not including government loans such as those guaranteed by the federal housing administration and department of veterans affairs isolating conventional loans from government loans is common in mortgage research because they are different products with different thresholds for approval and loan terms government loans bring people who wouldn t otherwise qualify into the market but tend to be more expensive for the borrower even the federal reserve and consumer financial protection bureau the agency that releases mortgage data separate conventional and fha loans in their research on lending disparities authors of one academic study out of northeastern and george washington universities said they focus on conventional loans only because fha loans have long been implemented in a manner that promotes segregation as for credit scores it was impossible for us to include them in our analysis because the cfpb strips them from public view from hmda data in part due to the mortgage industry s lobbying to remove them citing borrower privacy when the cfpb first proposed expanding mortgage data collection to include the very data that industry trade groups have told us is vital for doing this type of analysis credit scores debt to income ratio and loan to value ratio those same groups objected they didn t want the government to even collect the data let alone make it public they cited the risk of a cyberattack which could reveal borrowers private information these new data fields include confidential financial data several large trade groups wrote in a letter to the cfpb including the aba and mba consequently if this sic data are inadvertently or knowingly released to the public the harm associated with re identification would be even greater government regulators do have access to credit scores the cfpb analyzed 2019 hmda data and found that accounting for credit scores does not eliminate lending disparities for people of color in addition to finding disparities in loan denials nationally we examined cities and towns across the country individually and found disparities in 89 metropolitan areas spanning every region of the country in charlotte where crystal marie and her family searched for a home lenders were 50 more likely to deny loans to black applicants than white ones with similar financial profiles in other places the gap was even larger black applicants in chicago were 150 more likely to be denied by financial institutions than similar white applicants there lenders were more than 200 more likely to reject latino applicants than white applicants in waco texas and to reject asian and pacific islander applicants than white ones in port st lucie florida and native american applicants in minneapolis were 100 more likely to be denied by financial institutions than similar white applicants there it s something that we have a very painful history with said alderman matt martin who represents chicago s 47th ward redlining the now outlawed practice of branding certain black and immigrant neighborhoods too risky for financial investments that began in the 1930s can be traced back to chicago chicago activists exposed that banks were still redlining in the 1970s leading to the establishment of the home mortgage disclosure act the law mandating the collection of data used for this story when you see that maybe the tactics are different now but the outcomes are substantially similar martin added it s just not something we can continue to tolerate who makes these loan decisions officially lending officers at each institution in reality software most of it mandated by a pair of quasi governmental agencies freddie mac and fannie mae were founded by the federal government to spur homeownership and now buy about half of all mortgages in america if they don t approve a loan the lenders are on their own if the borrower skips out and that power means fannie and freddie essentially set the rules for the industry starting from the very beginning of the mortgage approval process fannie and freddie require lenders to use a particular credit scoring algorithm classic fico to determine whether an applicant meets the minimum threshold necessary to even be considered for a conventional mortgage currently a score of 620 this algorithm was developed from data from the 1990s and is more than 15 years old it s widely considered detrimental to people of color because it rewards traditional credit to which white americans have more access it does not consider among other things on time payments for rent utilities and cellphone bills but will lower people s scores if they get behind on them and are sent to debt collectors unlike more recent models it penalizes people for past medical debt even if it s since been paid this is how structural racism works said chi chi wu a staff attorney at the national consumer law center this is how racism gets embedded into institutions and policies and practices with absolutely no animus at all potentially fairer credit models have existed for years a recent study by vantage score a credit model developed by the big three credit bureaus to compete with fico estimated that its model would provide credit to 37 million americans who have no scores under fico models almost a third of them would be black or latino yet fannie and freddie have resisted a steady stream of plaintive requests since 2014 from advocates the mortgage and housing industries and congress to update to a newer model even the company that created classic fico has lobbied for the agencies to adopt a newer version which it said expands credit to more people a lot of things that minorities and underserved borrowers are doing responsible financial behaviors are going under the radar said scott olson executive director of chla a trade group representing small and midsized independent mortgage lenders fannie s and freddie s regulator and conservator the federal housing finance agency continues to allow the companies to stick with classic fico more than five years after ordering them to study the effects of switching to something newer the fhfa has also expressed concern about the cost and operational implications if they would have to continually test new credit scoring models neither of the companies would answer questions from the markup about why they still require classic fico they ve been testing alternate scores for years and i don t know why the process is taking so long said lisa rice president and ceo of the national fair housing alliance a consortium of hundreds of fair housing organizations well deserving consumers are being left behind fannie s and freddie s approval process also involves other mysterious algorithms automated underwriting software programs that they first launched in 1995 to much fanfare about their speed ease and most important fairness using a data base as opposed to human judgment can avoid influences by other forces such as discrimination against minority individuals and red lining peter maselli then a vice president of freddie mac told the new york times when it launched its software now called loan product advisor a bank executive told congress that year the new systems were explicitly and implicitly color blind since they did not consider a person s race at all in their evaluations but like similar promises that algorithms would make colorblind decisions in criminal risk assessment and health care research shows that some of the factors fannie and freddie say their software programs consider affect people differently depending on their race or ethnicity these include in addition to credit histories the prospective borrowers assets employment status debts and the size of the loan relative to the value of the property they re hoping to buy the quality of the data that you re putting into the underwriting algorithm is crucial said aracely panameño director of latino affairs for the center for responsible lending if the data that you re putting in is based on historical discrimination then you re basically cementing the discrimination at the other end research has shown that payday loan sellers usually place branches in neighborhoods populated mainly by people of color where bank branches are less common as a result residents are more likely to use these predatory services to borrow money this creates lopsided incomplete credit histories because banks report both good and bad financial behavior to credit bureaus while payday loan services only report missed payments gig workers who are people of color are more likely to report that those jobs are their primary source of income rather than a side hustle they re using for extra cash than white gig workers having multiple sources of income or unconventional employment can complicate the verification process for a mortgage as crystal marie and eskias mcdaniels learned considering an applicant s assets beyond the down payment which lenders call reserves can cause particular problems

when naomi koshi was elected in june to the board of one of japan s largest telecommunications companies she became one of the few women in the country to reach the top of the corporate ladder now that she s there she wants to pull others up with her in japan now in most companies only old men make decisions koshi a partner at law firm miura partners said during a recent interview if we have more female votes on boards we can change companies she said adding that if more people join the decision making process that will change the culture and create innovation
the energy sector is going through a rough patch the sector hit its peak in mid june and it s been on a decline ever since the bull run for the energy sector is now over and has been over for more than two months now if we gauge the sector s performance on the s p tsx capped energy index it hit a peak in mid june and has come down 21 9 since that s slightly quicker than its recovery momentum there might be quite a few reasons for this decline including a too fast recovery as well as the fear of the delta variant the latter is also one of the reasons why the oil futures are looking grimmer every day and why crude oil prices have been slipping for the last three weeks and if the pattern continues the angle of the energy index declined in canada might become steeper a few energy stocks are already available at a discounted price if you wait for the sector to decline further and hit the lowest point in the current correction you might be able to buy at an even more attractive valuation and there are two stocks that should be on your radar one of the largest energy producers canadian natural resources tsx cnq nyse cnq has the distinction of being one of the largest independent natural gas and heavy crude oil producer in the country it s also emerging as a powerful oil sands player and claims to follow environmentally responsible operations protocols as a major oil producer cnq is naturally susceptible to fluctuations in the energy market still the stock remained quite stable before the pandemic although the 2020 market crash was quite hard on the company the stock fell almost 70 one of the most extensive declines even in the rough energy sector still it showed resilience and was up to its pre pandemic levels in about 13 months now the stock is declining again it has already fallen 15 5 from its yearly peak and the yield which is already quite attractive at 4 8 will become even more so if the stock keeps sliding and become more aggressively discounted an intenerated energy company cenovus energy tsx cve nyse cve is an even more heavily discounted energy company the stock is down 25 from its yearly peak and the decline is in line with its recovery pace which was quite remarkable from its lowest point in the last 12 months to its highest the stock grew almost 190 the company has a well diversified regional portfolio as it operates in north america as well as the asia pacific region it s also quite heavy on the oil sands and has four major projects cenovus is also a dividend paying company but the current yield 0 74 is too low to be a buying attraction even after the 25 decline if the stock slips down further and you have a chance to buy it at or around its rock bottom value you might be able to leverage the recovery fueled capital growth potential foolish takeaway
race tracks of the west side by angus macfarlane in the lake merced parking lot at the south end of sunset boulevard is a statue of a man on a horse the man represents juan bautista de anza the spaniard who founded san francisco in 1776 the horse is just a horse of course but the location of the horse s statue is historically significant for two reasons on november 2 1769 five years before anza s colonists arrived in san francisco a small scouting party led by sergeant jose ortega left the portola expedition and traveled on the hard wet sands of ocean beach crossing into what would become san francisco this marked the arrival of the horse in san francisco one hundred years later less than a furlong from today s statue of a horse and rider the first of the west side s horse racing venues opened for business this is the history of those race tracks previous the ocean course track golden gate driving park 1868 1885 the next west side race track was a half mile oval adjacent to the point lobos toll road today s geary boulevard from the toll gate at cemetery presidio avenue to the cliff house four miles away point lobos road penetrated a virtually unpopulated landscape when it was widened from 20 to 40 feet and regraded to make it level most of the distance it was an open invitation to race in response to this need for speed an unnamed and long forgotten visionary scraped out a primitive track on the north side of the road near today s 25th avenue where informal and impromptu races between owners of teams could be held in march 1868 james eoff leased the land where the primitive track had been and laid out a half mile track along with substantial buildings fences and horse sheds this track was located roughly between clement and california streets and 26th and 22nd avenues the purpose of what was at first called the golden gate driving park was to provide a type of racing that the other tracks didn t or couldn t offer private racing where gentleman could challenge each other to settle whose team was the better set of horseflesh rather than endangering the welfare of their horses and risking property damage from racing along the point lobos road public thoroughfare proud competitive gentlemen desiring to do their own racing were invited to eoff s facility the track formally opened on october 10 1868 the highlight of the day was the introduction of norfolk the star attraction and victor of the opening of the ocean course four years earlier eoff s golden gate driving park prospered because he knew what his patrons wanted and he obliged by providing excitement and variety in his racing programs eoff kept a steady stream of competitors and spectators coming to his track week after week month after month james eoff s facility was in operation while week after week and month after month the ocean view and bay view course another racing course located in the bayview district stood idle and silent in april 1870 the bay district agricultural association was formed and it leased the golden gate driving park for three years a series of improvements were initiated the track which remained a half mile oval was leveled and widened ten feet the turns were banked and the track was entirely enclosed with a fence a roadway was built to the track s infield allowing those who desired to sit in their carriages during to races to do so out buildings including stables were constructed and existing structures were vastly improved including enlarging the grandstand for ladies it was proclaimed the best half mile track in the world agricultural park was inaugurated on july 23 1870 with an exhibition of stock and five trotting races three thousand people attended this event the most notable difference between the golden gate driving park and agricultural park was the size of the purses which naturally attracted higher quality racers which in turn attracted a higher quality clientele particularly ladies over the next three years everything seemed to fall into place for the little track by the side of the road and its owner james eoff however when the three year lease expired in april 1873 the directors of the bay

were confirmed in response to this setback eoff announced on august 2 1873 that he intended to enlarge his half mile track to a mile he had purchased enough land at either end of his facility to extend the straight aways while keeping the turns the same distance he expected that work on the track would commence immediately but his plans for a mile track never came to fruition and by august 8

when the treasury department first explained in late spring how a proposed higher tax on investment profits would work if approved by congress it left some financial advisors and tax experts scratching their heads a new capital gains rate nearly double the existing 23 8 would kick in on profits and qualified dividends banked by earners making at least 1 million a year the government agency said just what kind of earners confusingly treasury only partially answered the question last may in its green book an official document detailing the spending and tax increases outlined in the biden administration s proposed 6 trillion federal budget the all important question treasury didn t directly address or explain would the proposed 1 million threshold for adjusted gross income agi apply to single and married filers equally treasury made clear that it applied to married couples but what about individuals like unmarried working professionals and divorced small business owners turns out the answer to the high stakes question is yes while the highest rate would apply to married couples with more than 1 million in income that threshold would be the same for individuals giving some single filers a juicy tax break that s correct treasury spokesperson alexandra lamanna wrote to financial planning in an emailed response to the query while the point is moot for the ultra wealthy who easily blow past the threshold it s of interest to advisors with upper middle class clients and emerging millionaires at stake for a filer was potentially tens of thousands of dollars in tax a year on investment profits under biden once a married couple s or individual s taxable income reaches 1 million realized gains and qualified dividends in excess of that mark would be taxed at 43 4 the highest rate since the early 1920s the 39 6 base of that high rate would also become the new top ordinary income tax rate while not all advisors wondered if the threshold applied to individuals many had questions marriage penalty confirmed the seven figure threshold solidifies what some advisors say is an exacerbation of the longstanding marriage penalty in the tax code in which wedded people who each earn high incomes can pay more in federal and often state income tax than they would if they filed separate returns the marriage penalty tends to hit well paid professionals in places like new york bloomberg news at the same time the threshold would give well paid individuals a sizable advantage over high earning couples if president biden s proposed tax increases are eventually voted into law and signed by him that s because a highly paid technology executive banker or doctor who isn t married would have more wiggle room to take investment profits at the current 23 8 rate before getting hit by the 43 4 rate both include the affordable care act s 3 8 surcharge by contrast two high earners who are married say an advertising executive and a lawyer and who file jointly would see their combined salaries push them to the higher tax threshold faster leaving less room for taking investment gains at the current preferential rate it s another example of irs rules and regulations not incentivizing the family unit said clark kendall the president and ceo of fee only fiduciary firm kendall capital management in rockville maryland the threshold really gives you incentive to divorce your spouse maybe you re saying i was gonna divorce anyway might as well now in its 114 page green book treasury devoted all of two brief paragraphs with two short footnotes to the issue of how a taxpayer s filing status would affect the income level at which their capital gains tax bill would spike the language clearly addressed married couples filing jointly who would face the higher rate at 1 million in income ditto married couples filing separately who would each hit the rate at a lower 500 000 but it said nothing about individual filers referring instead to the generic word taxpayer the explanation was not entirely clear says john gimigliano accounting firm kpmg s principal in charge of federal tax legislative and regulatory services you could read it more than one way as a 1 million threshold for individuals or a 500 000 one while the most simple straightforward reading suggests 1 million for individuals gimigliano said the issue was debatable because the green book didn t specify that it was not clear agreed dean zerbe the national managing director of alliantgroup a tax services firm in washington d c re title assets bag the altar advisors know that filing separate returns when married in which the irs treats each spouse as its own taxable entity can help a couple avoid having their combined income push them into a higher tax bracket only around 5 of married couples file separately according to irs data now doing so could be beneficial on another tax front michael d addio a lawyer specializing in tax at accounting and business advisory firm marcum in new haven connecticut said that if a married couple consists of one high earner and one lower earner they could adjust their joint ownership of stock and other assets so that profits are in the name of the lower earner that would preserve the couple s ability to keep their capital gains tax bill low if they file separately kendall said that if the proposed changes become law and it s not certain that they will affluent older people who are divorced or have lost a spouse might think twice about remarrying more questions it s not up to treasury to answer the question of when a higher capital gains rate would go into effect while the date could potentially be retroactive to april 28 when the biden administration first announced its proposed increases it s up to congress to decide everyone s really freaked about the effective date but nobody thinks it will be april 28 zerbe said i think it will be jan 2 2022 it s also up to congress to decide just how high a new capital gains rate might be zerbe said that the expectation is more 25 28 once the tax writing house ways and means committee completes its mark up of a tax bill

helping you live richer reviewed by experts trusted by millions of readers for most people owning a home and saving enough money to retire top their lists of financial goals but it s easy for both to feel impossibly out of reach in fact many people feel that their only chance of success is to focus on just one of those goals but is it more important to own a home or to save for retirement gobankingrates spoke with a variety of experts to help make the decision less painful watch out good news you don t have to pick one over the other first thing s first picking between buying a home and saving for retirement doesn t have to be an either or type of choice the decision is not mutually exclusive said anthony watson cfa cfp and founder and president of thrive retirement specialists a home can be a key part of a well constructed retirement plan and can even be set up to pay you monthly income while still providing you with a place to live through a reverse mortgage in retirement keep in mind that homes are expensive to own and retirement accounts are not never let an investment in the former prevent you from investing in the latter a home can be a fantastic investment and a way to build wealth but homeownership brings with it many costs such as utilities taxes maintenance and furnishing watson said buying a home is a great first step but be sure to consider these other expenses so they do not prohibit you from also being able to start saving for retirement the stock market not the housing market is america s wealth generation machine unless you re really skillful or really lucky your home is not going to appreciate as rapidly as the s p 500 the stock market has much higher returns in the long run than the housing market said john marsano ceo and president of inheritance advanced also to access the money in your home you have to tap into your equity that s not the case with income producing investments like bonds and dividend stocks having passive income post retirement is a huge help to living comfortably and most people don t realize this because retirement always seems too far away marsano said there is of course no one right answer for everyone in reality every person and household will walk a different path to the sensible choice whether someone opts for a down payment or saving for retirement depends entirely on how individuals perceive long term financial stability said giovanni braghieri ceo and co founder of myconsultingcoach to some having a hefty retirement fund is the main predictor of long term financial stability personally they value long term investments over quicker and more tangible gains to them saving for retirement is going to be an obvious choice on the other hand some see long term financial stability as an unattainable goal due to constant economic shifts and frequent downturns it just doesn t make sense to save for retirement in such a volatile and unpredictable environment so people prioritize short term investments there s nothing more tangible in the short term than buying a house but there s also a significant long term value in it it also has a lot to do with your type of work the most important factor that determines where your savings should go is your income source marsano said if you work a corporate job you ll have to put more effort into your retirement savings and it would make more sense to save for it first but if you re a government employee or a war veteran you don t have to worry about your retirement and can save for a house first it s better to be a renter who s saving for retirement than a homeowner who isn t in the end the choice of whether or not to buy a house is intensely personal homeownership is not for everyone the same can not be said for retirement savings which everyone must have if they don t want their golden years to be defined by poverty and dependence in short if you can t afford to save for a down payment while also saving for retirement then you re probably not ready to own a home for most people it makes more financial sense to save for retirement before saving for a down payment on a house said stephanie genkin a certified financial planner and founder of my financial planner llc a registered investment adviser in brooklyn new york long term investing for retirement comes with a number of benefits first there are tax advantages in retirement savings accounts whether you choose pre tax contributions or after tax roth contributions second the compounding nature of investments packs a much bigger punch over decades supporting savers when they retire by providing cash flow to supplement social security besides the fact that a house is an illiquid asset home values over the long run grow only a percentage or so above inflation meanwhile an age appropriate mix of stocks and bonds for retirement savers can earn much more than that if you can only do one save for someday buying a home is a great goal but it should come after one is able to maximize retirement savings on an annual basis genkin said more from gobankingrates
hutchmed initiates a phase ib ii trial of fruquintinib in combination with tislelizumab in advanced triple negative breast cancer or advanced endometrial cancer tweet hong kong and shanghai china and

patients with advanced triple negative breast cancer tnbc or advanced endometrial cancer ec in the u s the first patient was dosed on august 24 2021 this trial is to explore the potential for the addition of a highly selective vascular endothelial growth factor receptor vegfr inhibitor fruquintinib to anti programmed death 1 pd 1 antibody tislelizumab in inducing activity to immune checkpoint inhibitors this is an open label multi center non randomized study to assess the safety and efficacy of fruquintinib in combination with tislelizumab in patients with locally advanced or metastatic tnbc or advanced ec this study will be conducted in two parts a safety lead in phase part 1 and a dose expansion phase part 2 the safety lead in phase will determine safety and tolerability and the recommended phase ii dose rp2d of the combination in the dose expansion phase the rp2d will be administered to two cohorts of patients cohort a patients with tnbc who have received prior therapy with an immune checkpoint inhibitor and cohort b patients with tnbc who have not received prior therapy with an immune checkpoint inhibitor a cohort evaluating the combination in second line advanced ec is

regulators have been reluctant to approve a cryptocurrency etf citing a myriad of issues such as volatility and security inconsistencies but such fears have been underscored by recent news concerning coinbase four months ago tanja vidovic received a series of alerts related to suspicious activity in the access layer of her cryptocurrency account to vidovic s horror she quickly discovered that she had lost nearly all of her 168 000 in holdings like many investors and speculators eager to take advantage of the cryptocurrency trend husband and wife tanja and jared vidovic started cryptocurrency investing in 2017 and were fortunate to see their funds nearly quadruple over four years the vidovics opted to use coinbase the country s largest cryptocurrency exchange for their foray into the virtual currency exchanges like coinbase permit users to deposit u s dollars in exchange for cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and ethereum the couple s investing vehicles of choice i looked into coinbase and it seemed like it was one that everybody used and trusted tanja said for the vidovics the crypto investment was part of a possible retirement plan offering freedom for the couple and their three children that was until late april when tanja a firefighter discovered the security attack on her computer i signed onto the crypto and i said it s gone tanja said the panicked couple said that they attempted to reach coinbase but nobody answered their calls unfortunately this appears to be a pattern as a number of interviews with coinbase customers around the nation along with a comprehensive review of customer complaints reveals a pattern of account takeovers in these takeovers users are ambushed by security issues and financial losses which are then followed by poor customer service from coinbase that leaves customers infuriated and desperate cryptocurrency transactions cannot be reversed according to the fbi and stealthy criminals can siphon funds from customer accounts within minutes since going public earlier this year coinbase has a market cap of about 65 billion over 68 million users in 100 plus countries more than 2 100 full time employees and 223 billion in held assets according to the company the initial belief was that going public might assuage some of the existing security concerns surrounding the cryptocurrency world hopefully coinbase going public and having its direct listing is going to be viewed as kind of a landmark moment for the crypto space ceo brian armstrong said in april when the company went public people no longer need to be scared of it like in the early days instead while the cryptocurrency exchange company has grown rapidly complaints have continued to climb since 2016 coinbase users have filed more than 11 000 complaints against coinbase with the federal trade commission and consumer financial protection bureau largely due to customer service problems although the vidovics account had once climbed to 168 596 on april 28 when the hacking occurred according to account statements the vidovics shared with cnbc they were left with only a 587 15 balance visible the following day the couple is not alone another crypto investor ben a virginia resident who asked that his last name be withheld said that he saw nearly 35 000 in various coins disappear from his account back in march despite his having verified his identity with two factor authentication despite sending a panicked email to coinbase looking for help from the hacking ben explained that the company said they were unable to help him i really am baffled he said it just seems to me that coinbase did absolutely zero research and just said hey yeah sorry the cfpb offered further corroboration explaining to ben in an email that transactions on the blockchain are irrevocable and that coinbase s insurance policy does not cover theft from individual accounts there is no credible or supportable evidence that the compromise of your login credentials was the fault of coinbase the message said as a result coinbase is unable to reimburse you for your alleged losses eventually the company sent a 200 credit telling ben your coinbase experience and your wait for a response to your formal complaint was not up to our standards so how do crypto accounts get hacked with such ease experts say sim swapping is the issue a technique hackers use to take control control of a victim s phone number and sim card through their phone company the problem with sim swapping and cryptocurrency is the moment you lose access to your cell phone professional hackers will steal all of your money in less than 30 minutes said david silver an attorney who focuses on cryptocurrency most people who contact me would tell you it s poor customer service silver said they re being almost victimized twice because they themselves have almost no ability to contact coinbase and deal with them directly they re forced to retain professionals etay maor senior director of security strategy for cybersecurity company cato networks has witnessed cybercriminals on the dark web plotting how to access customer accounts like those of coinbase users these exchanges have to invest heavily invest in security if they want to take it seriously just like the banks have done and have learned the hard way maor said with as many as 1 128 complaints over the past three years according to its website the better business bureau in march determined that coinbase has a pattern of complaints from customers who state they are locked out of their accounts even after providing required information or updates bbb said that it sent a letter to coinbase in order to address the customers complaints and receive feedback from any implemented improvements the group has not heard a response from this business about the situation pattern of complaints for the last three years said alma galvan a marketing and communications manager with the bbb marci preble a california based marketer said coinbase did credit her account the approximate amount of her original investment roughly 8000 which had grown to almost 12 000 by the time she was hacked in april however she said that this happened only after months of wrangling with the company my question is how can a publicly traded company on the new york stock exchange be doing this to customers how can they not have a customer service dedicated line worldwide preble said

james maro esq 484 270 1453 toll free at 844 887 9500 via e mail at or click rocket is an online mortgage lender that operates the rocket mortgage online platform which allows clients to apply for and service mortgages through the internet or by using rocket s proprietary mobile phone app ninety percent of rocket s revenues are derived from originating closing selling and servicing home mortgages rocket operates two primary segments 1 the direct to consumer segment and 2 the partner network segment in its partner network rocket partners with third parties who utilize its platform to provide their clients with mortgage solutions the partner network has lower operating margins because rocket shares profits with its partners the class period commences on february 25 2021 when rocket issued a press release titled in part rocket companies experiences explosive growth which announced rocket s financial results for the fourth quarter and full year of 2020 rocket reportd among other things closed loan origination volume of 107 2 billion and gain on sale margin of 4 41 for the fourth quarter rocket emphasized that it had ncreased gain on sale margin by 100 basis points year over year during the quarter and ncreased gain on sale margin by 127 basis points year over year to 4 46 for the full year period throughout the class period rocket continued to tout its business operations and downplayed the effects of competition on rocket s gain on sale margins the truth was revealed on may 5 2021 when rocket issued a press release announcing its first quarter results and second quarter outlook rocket reported that it was on track to achieve closed loan volume within a range of only 82 5 billion and 87 5 billion and gain on sale margins within a range of only 2 65 to 2 95 for the second quarter of 2021 at the mid point this gain on sale margin estimate equated to a 239 basis point decline year over year and a 94 basis point decline sequentially which represented rocket s lowest quarterly gain on sale margin in two years following this news the price of rocket s class a common stock dropped from 22 80 per share when the market closed on may 5 2021 to 19 01 per share when the market closed on may 6 2021 a nearly 17 decline the complaint alleges that throughout the class period the defendants made false and or misleading statements and or failed to disclose that 1 rocket s gain on sale margins were contracting at the highest rate in two years as a result of increased competition among mortgage lenders an unfavorable shift toward the lower margin partner network operating segment and compression in the price spread between the primary and secondary mortgage markets 2 rocket was engaged in a price war and battle for market share with its primary competitors in the wholesale market which was further compressing margins in rocket s partner network operating segment 3 the adverse trends were accelerating and as a result rocket s gain on sale margins were on track to plummet at least 140 basis points in the first six months of 2021 4 as a result of the above the favorable market conditions that had preceded the class period and allowed rocket to achieve historically high gain on sale margins had vanished as rocket s gain on sale margins had returned to levels not seen since the first quarter of 2019 5 rather than remaining elevated due to surging demand rocket s gain on sale margins had fallen materially below recent historical averages and 6 as a result of the foregoing the defendants positive statements about rocket s business operations and prospects were materially misleading and or lacked a reasonable basis rocket investors may no later than august 30 2021 seek to be appointed as a lead plaintiff representative of the class through

the first signs of armed resistance to the taliban come from a narrow valley that has a history of resistance to invaders just days after the taliban invaded the capital and overthrew the government in a lightning attack former mujahedin fighters and afghan commandos announced that they had regrouped and started a war of resistance in the last zone of afghanistan not yet controlled by the islamic fundamentalist group the man in charge is ahmad massoud 32 son of the famous and legendary mujahedin commander ahmad shah massoud son massoud follows in his father s footsteps 20 years after his father s death resuming his bitter struggle against the taliban however their struggle faces enormous difficulties however strategic their stronghold the fighters of this resistance are isolated and surrounded by the taliban their stocks of food and others will soon run out and they have no visible outside support for now the resistance has only two strengths the panjshir valley 110 km north of kabul which has a long tradition of repelling invaders and the legendary name of massoud spokesmen for ahmad massoud insist he has already drawn thousands of troops to the valley including remnants of the afghan army special operations forces and some of the veteran guerrilla commanders who have fought with his father as well as activists and others who reject the islamic emirate of the taliban spokesmen some with ahmad massoud in the panjshir valley and others outside the country rallying their support said massoud had stocks of weapons and war material including including american helicopters but needed more we are waiting for an opportunity a support said hamid saifi former colonel of the afghan national army and now commander of the resistance led by massoud he was contacted by phone on sunday in the panjshir valley maybe some countries are ready to face this great job for now all the countries we have spoken with are silent america europe china russia everyone is silent massoud senior gained his exceptional reputation for resisting repeated soviet offensives in the 1980s surviving thanks to his intelligence and the high mountains of the hindu kush range he launched devastating ambushes against russian supply convoys gaining the reluctant respect of several soviet generals among his opponents massoud led the mujahedin attack on kabul that overthrew the communist government in 1992 after being appointed minister of defense however it never received the full support of washington or neighboring pakistan he smeared his hands with blood during the devastating civil war in kabul and when the taliban came to power and seized the capital in 1996 he retreated to their stronghold in the panjshir valley while constantly losing ground massoud resisted the taliban regime for five years mobilizing a united opposition against a movement he saw as totalitarian and foreign to afghan traditions because of its dogmatic fundamentalism he alerted the west to the danger of al qaeda terrorism under his leadership the panjshir valley became a sort of listening outpost for western intelligence a freehold of the tajik minority ethnic group in a country dominated by the pashtun taliban regime and a constant thorn in the taliban heel it is clear that ahmed massoud aspires to play the same role as his father who died assassinated by al qaida two days before september 11 2001 as a sort of gift to the taliban regime which housed al qaida but there are important differences between the situation then and today the father had supply lines that crossed the border with tajikistan allowing the resistance to be supplied for a long time since then the taliban have learned well from past military conflicts and made it their business to cut off access to afghanistan s borders and isolate the panjshir valley before heading for kabul another factor is that massoud filho has little military experience although he studied at the royal military college sandhurst uk and king s college london and graduated with a degree in military studies war before returning to afghanistan in 2016 he spoke last defiantly weekend we are facing the soviet union and we will be able to face the taliban massoud told dubai based al arabiya tv channel on sunday 22 his father withstood nine soviet offensives and ahmad massoud insists he can honor that legacy he rushed to the panjshir valley in a military helicopter on august 15 after the taliban overran government defenses on kabul s western flank and president ashraf ghani fled the country at the same time vice president amrullah saleh left for the panjshir valley vowing to fight and not sit under the same roof as the taliban he was attacked twice en route but managed to get there mohammad zahir aghbar who served as afghanistan s ambassador to tajikistan said in an interview last week it is possible that massoud and his supporters have taken a firm stand to gain influence in the negotiations that will take place when any new government is formed we prefer peace massoud s chief of staff fahim dashty said in a telephone message we are ready to participate in negotiations to achieve peace but not only peace we want an inclusive government in afghanistan a government that represents all the different ethnic groups in the country that guarantees the rights of the afghan people the human rights the rights of women and that guarantees social justice in afghanistan but the conflict was already underway massoud s supporters said their forces attacked a taliban convoy in andarab on the north side of the salang tunnel causing heavy losses destroying a bridge and cutting a critical highway connecting the capital to the north of the country former senior officials in the recently ousted afghan government are reluctant to talk about the movement s chances of success i don t think the resistance will last long without international aid commented a former official i think the taliban will crush it in the coming months he said speaking anonymously matin bek a former member of the government s negotiating team with the taliban suggested that some opponents would wait to see how the taliban rule but that resistance may mobilize the opposition if he fights the taliban he can become a hope for the whole nation he said for now however we don t know what the fate of this resistance will be bek said are you going to resist or are you going to negotiate i don t know who is supporting her the most prominent former head of government to have taken refuge in the panjshir valley is saleh former head of the national security directorate and former collaborator of massoud senior last week he proclaimed himself the rightful president of afghanistan rejecting the taliban takeover the taliban show no willingness to launch real negotiations saleh wrote in a text message you want loyalty surrender or subordination what we offer is very simple people must have a say in any decision that determines the character of the state

smoke billows from the kzn resins factory in balfour road jacobs south durban on 25 august the main plastics factory in the foreground did not catch fire photo supplied correction in an earlier version of this story it was incorrectly reported that the fire at kzn resins had spread to a plastics company next door although a boundary wall between the adjoining companies was damaged during the blaze the fire department said the fire was contained before it could spread into the plastics company for the second time in as many months thousands of durban residents were warned to take shelter indoors and shut their windows because of dense clouds of toxic chemical fumes this time from a fire and explosion that broke out in a chemical resins factory the fire started at the kzn resins factory in balfour road jacobs in the early hours of 25 august according to durban environmental justice activist desmond d sa who lives nearby and who drove to the plant just after the fire began staff at the kzn resins facility said that they were on night shift when the fire began d sa coordinator of the south durban community environmental alliance said residents were woken by loud rumblings just before a ball of fire and dense smoke clouds were seen above the plant which manufactures a variety of synthetic resins such as hydroxy acrylamide and thermoplastic resins d sa said the fire burnt for at least five hours before eight fire engines brought the visible flames under control just before 3pm the ethekwini municipality broadcast a public health warning urging nearby residents to stay indoors as the plant was still smouldering and releasing toxic smoke areas affected include wentworth and merebank but due to a change in wind directions areas such as clairwood montclair bluff and mobeni may also be affected as a precautionary measure residents are advised to close their windows and doors and to put wet cloths over ventilators until the smoke clears residents are further advised to refrain from outdoor activities from impacted areas officials will be on site until the situation is resolved the public will be informed in the event of new developments however said d sa he saw no visible signs of city emergency officials physically warning residents of surrounding areas to stay indoors or to close windows nor did city officials appear to have the capacity to collect samples of toxic fume levels prompting his alliance to take their own bucket samples a rudimentary method developed in the united states by community activists exposed to frequent chemical releases from nearby petrochemical operations he said the fire brigade had also used large volumes of high pressure water to douse the fire and it remained to be seen whether any waterborne overflow of chemical poisons would soon enter durban harbour to kill fish and marine organisms in one of the country s largest estuarine fish nurseries via the amanzimnyama canal and stormwater drains the latest chemical fire explosion comes as government regulators battle to allay widespread public anxiety around the aftermath of the arson attack on the 14 000m2 united phosphorus limited upl pesticides and agrochemicals warehouse in cornubia north of durban earlier this week following an oversight inspection at the upl warehouse by the national assembly s committee on environmental affairs the committee compiled a scathing report urging government departments to establish a multi stakeholder forum to ensure that the public was kept properly informed about the public health and environmental implications of the upl chemical inferno that lasted for 11 days in a report adopted on 24 august the committee said it had received complaints from community groups that there had been a lack of communication from both the government and upl concerns were also raised over the exclusion of the representatives of communities and ngos from the government joint operations committee even though they represent the very people who bore the brunt of the events upl had not made any visible efforts to show empathy for its employees and surrounding communities with the human health impact of the events not assessed nor communicated the representatives believed that the latter would have a devastating effect on the lives of communities in the long term a medical team should have been put together from the beginning to attend to the impact of the incident on human life and mitigate other risks the committee reported the report included that there were further concerns that there was general secrecy by the company upl on the actual contents of the chemicals that were stored in the cornubia warehouse there should be adequate compensation by the company for all people who will be found to have been adversely affected by the incident there was a plea that parliament ensures that all the outstanding and pending investigation reports by the various authorities on the matter be shared with all including community representatives and ngos the committee also heard of the devastating impact the incident had left on the tourism sector in the surrounding areas residents from around the warehouse reported respiratory distress that they suffered on the days of the smoke some of whom are worried about long term effects that are yet to be discovered the children could be the worst affected because they were playing outside while the fires were raging the ethekwini officials assigned to the pollution line ignore phone calls when they do take calls they are rude unhelpful and refuse to issue call reference numbers the community was also worried that the sugarcane growers had continued harvesting the contaminated sugarcane for processing following the interactions with the stakeholders the committee makes the following findings and observations the committee was not satisfied that a proper environmental and risk assessment process was undertaken before the company began its operations in the area of the incident as is legally prescribed by the national environmental management act hazardous substance act and the occupational health and safety act among others the incident revealed a lack of adequate regulation of the industry which would go a long way in ensuring the curbing of incidents of this kind with regard to the locations of chemical storage facilities the committee was concerned by what seemed a lack of capacity in human financial and other resources for the involved government authorities to oversee and facilitate the implementation of appropriate remedial actions following the cornubia incident it was also of grave concern that the ethekwini fire department could not respond on time to begin with the extinguishing of the fire and nor could they receive the necessary support from the south african police service and the south african national defence force to undertake that crucial task on time the committee further noted with dismay that the plans by upl were more concerned with the clean up and reinstating operations to the detriment of proper assessments and interventions on the impact to human health the committee was also concerned that government had not required more urgent work to be undertaken in relation to understanding and communicating the impacts on human health particularly resulting from the air pollution the committee heard from the department of labour s health and safety specialist that the company had not complied with the legal requirements related to notification risk assessment and approved emergency plans as per the major hazard installations regulations no r 692 of 2001 that are supposed to be in place before operations of upl s kind can operate it was equally concerning that the company did not yet have the required permit from the ethekwini municipality to store hazardous chemicals in the area at the time of the visit both upl and the environmental department were yet to release the list of the chemicals and their material safety data sheet the committee observed that there had not been adequate consultation and inclusion of the affected communities or its representatives leading to strained relations between the parties the committee also noted the apparent chemical smell in the area and was worried about the exposure of school children there was an urgent need for upl to declare the public liability funds set aside for disasters of this calibre to assist affected communities recover from the traumas associated with the incident or there be a mechanism for compensation the committee further recommended that

in this story overdrive s alex lockie surveys the landscape ahead for vaccine mandates potential to ripple into the freight world from employers capping that with a personal story illustrating the value of incentives the food and drug administration on monday granted full approval to pfizer s covid 19 vaccine and it didn t take long for president joe biden to urge employers to mandate vaccinations across their workforces if you re a business leader a nonprofit leader a state or local leader who has been waiting on full fda approval to require vaccinations i call on you now to do that biden said require it the same day the national safety council recommended employers follow our guidelines to encourage vaccine uptake by incentivizing and requiring vaccines as well as sharing information about the safety of vaccines a big engineering association the international bridge turnpike and tunnel association moved to require proof of vaccination to attend an in person conference something that hasn t happened around trucking related events as yet even before the fda approved the pfizer vaccine though companies from facebook to ford from retailers to restaurants clinics and pharmacies had mandated employees show proof of vaccination before returning to on site work but in the trucking world with so many independent contractors and owner operators who can and do frequently take business elsewhere when work requirements prove too onerous do big businesses and employers even have the leverage to mandate vaccinations no they don t according to early indications vaccine mandates might backfire spectacularly for fleets shippers overdrive s fleet focused sister publication ccj recently spoke to veriforce master trainer james junkin who said that vaccine mandates are largely legal on the federal level but could cause problems in recruiting and retention employees may decide to resign from their positions and recruitment efforts suffer because of a vaccine mandate junkin told ccj fleets routinely cite driver recruiting and retention as their number one problem making it unlikely a fleet would absent any legal or business pressure mandate vaccinations could small fleets and independents meet shippers who ask for proof of vaccination before doing business partner insights information to advance your business from industry suppliers presented by eksatelecom introducing the eksatelecom s30 open ear air conduction true wireless headset gail rutkowski executive director of the national shippers strategic transportation council said that she hasn t heard of any shippers or carriers mandating vaccines but many companies are still following masking guidelines other industry leaders basically fell in line with local guidelines none of them imposing anything too heavy we have a mask requirement for employees or visitors who have not been vaccinated nothing beyond that said meg duncan the director of strategic sourcing at 3pl koch logistics we adhere to the local guidelines said john janson senior director of global logistics at sanmar an apparel shipper at this point masks are required while in the building and in all conference rooms we do not have a vaccine requirement in fact the strictest rules we found only asked unvaccinated employees to wear a mask on site in the u s dayco employees who are vaccinated may but do not need to wear a mask or social distance but non vaccinated employees are required to wear a mask and social distance where possible said company global supply chain manager candace holowicki dayco products is a large shipper of automotive and construction parts all employees contractors and visitors are required to check in and complete a pre entry health screening this can be adjusted to be more stringent by site but it cannot be lessened at tranzact an insurer for motor carriers a source said that unvaccinated employees must wear a mask on site and that the company does require proof of vaccination for workers to go unmasked if any of these shippers or affiliated businesses sought to incentivize vaccinations they didn t mention any besides allowing maskless visits on site further a recent overdrive poll found few respondents among vaccine holdouts who indicated willingness to receive a vaccine if mandated as a condition of doing business or employment a ccj facebook post asked its readership mainly fleet owners workers and some drivers how they would respond to their company requiring vaccinations overwhelmingly those who represented themselves as drivers said they would leave the company with some suggesting colorful flourishes to mark their exit those who represented themselves as fleet owners said they would not consider such a move giving yet more anecdotal data to the conventional wisdom that says requiring drivers to get the vaccine might not end well for fleets long haul paul marhoefer a frequent contributor to overdrive who is vaccinated himself has been engaging owner operators and other readers on a personal level around vaccinations as his personal circle suffers illness and death at the hands of covid 19 he wrote yesterday on this website a round up of reader responses to his questions about vaccines the poll question that accompanied marhoefer s story showed a majority of drivers just like the majority of americans had gotten the vaccine already or were primed to following fda approval remaining holdouts mostly cited hesitance around the vaccine s long term safety or generally not feeling like they had the time or motivation to take the shot as noted earlier very few of the unvaccinated indicated willingness to get vaccinated because of an employer or customer mandate a full 35 of the unvaccinated driver respondents cited mistrust of elites as a reason they wouldn t take the shot could refusing vaccines hurt owner ops and drivers after hearing from several companies and conducting a few informal polls this author is ready to conclude that if drivers and carriers think they they can ditch their employer or business partner if they disagree with any vaccine mandate and easily find another they re probably correct i can point you to the heaps of open trucking positions for drivers and incredibly high demand for carriers large and small as proof basically employers and the shipping community need truckers too badly to boss them around too much even if shippers want an entirely vaccinated work force more than that they just want truckers to show up on time yet as covid cases surge across the country daily deaths top 1 000 and hospitals in some regions fill to the brim the unvaccinated are 29 times more likely to become hospitalized by a covid infection than those with a vaccine of course vaccinated people can still get covid in may my fully vaccinated 65 year old father tested positive for covid our whole family feared for his health but instead of seeing his health slowly deteriorate until he needed inpatient care or perhaps even intubation in a covid ward where we couldn t safely visit him he was just achy for a few days he stayed in the guest room for ten days until his symptoms passed he s fine now the vaccine didn t stop him from getting covid but it stopped him from eating hospital food i think we all know this by now but perhaps it bears repeating covid spreads mostly through respiratory droplets from an infected person truck stops have increased their cleaning efforts but travel hubs inherently carry a high risk of covid transmission if a large portion of the trucking community remains unvaccinated that population remains at risk of getting sidelined by illness then who would stock the shelves indeed it s the opinion of this author that drivers can best take care of the economy by taking care of themselves drivers and owner operators rarely recipients of outsize perks or preferential treatment can probably go ahead and declare victory in any war on vaccine mandates mark zuckerberg can mandate all the facebook employees in california getting the jab but fleets and shippers will have to think long and hard before imposing that on drivers maybe we can think of that as a certain type of hard won freedom for the trucking community and it s one i would urge you to protect by voluntarily taking the vaccine if you re a small fleet and employing drivers now is a good time to remember what drivers truly want at bottom drivers normally rank pay as the biggest incentive to take a job second home time further basic respect and dignity is a prime consideration as well rather than mandating vaccines consider cash or home time incentives for drivers that respect their personal choices but encourage greater safety for us all

holding 17 different factors steady in a complex statistical analysis of more than 2 million conventional mortgage applications for home purchases we found that lenders were 40 more likely to turn down latino applicants for loans 50 more likely to deny asian pacific islander applicants and 70 more likely to deny native american applicants than similar white applicants lenders were 80 more likely to reject black applicants than similar white applicants these are national rates in every case the prospective borrowers of color looked almost exactly the same on paper as the white applicants except for their race the industry had criticized previous similar analyses for not including financial factors they said would explain disparities in lending rates but were not public at the time debts as a percentage of income how much of the property s assessed worth the person is asking to borrow and the applicant s credit score the first two are now public in the home mortgage disclosure act data including these financial data points in our analysis not only failed to eliminate racial disparities in loan denials it highlighted new devastating ones we found that lenders gave fewer loans to black applicants than white applicants even when their incomes were high 100 000 a year or more and had the same debt ratios in fact high earning black applicants with less debt were rejected more often than high earning white applicants who have more debt lenders used to tell us it s because you don t have the lending profiles the ethno racial differences would go away if you had them said josé loya assistant professor of urban planning at ucla who has studied public mortgage data extensively and reviewed our methodology your work shows that s not true we sent our complete analysis to industry representatives the american bankers association the mortgage bankers association the community home lenders association and the credit union national association they all criticized it generally saying the public data is not complete enough to draw conclusions but did not point to any flaws in our computations blair bernstein director of public relations for the aba acknowledged that our analysis showed disparities but that given the limitations in the public data we used the numbers are not sufficient on their own to explain why those disparities exist in written statements the aba and mba criticized the markup s analysis for not including credit scores and for focusing on conventional loans only and not including government loans such as those guaranteed by the federal housing administration and department of veterans affairs isolating conventional loans from government loans is common in mortgage research because they are different products with different thresholds for approval and loan terms government loans bring people who wouldn t otherwise qualify into the market but tend to be more expensive for the borrower even the federal reserve and consumer financial protection bureau the agency that releases mortgage data separate conventional and fha loans in their research on lending disparities authors of one academic study out of northeastern and george washington universities said they focus on conventional loans only because fha loans have long been implemented in a manner that promotes segregation as for credit scores it was impossible for us to include them in our analysis because the cfpb strips them from public view from hmda data in part due to the mortgage industry s lobbying to remove them citing borrower privacy when the cfpb first proposed expanding mortgage data collection to include the very data that industry trade groups have told us is vital for doing this type of analysis credit scores debt to income ratio and loan to value ratio those same groups objected they didn t want the government to even collect the data let alone make it public they cited the risk of a cyberattack which could reveal borrowers private information these new data fields include confidential financial data several large trade groups wrote in a letter to the cfpb including the aba and mba consequently if this sic data are inadvertently or knowingly released to the public the harm associated with re identification would be even greater government regulators do have access to credit scores the cfpb analyzed 2019 hmda data and found that accounting for credit scores does not eliminate lending disparities for people of color in addition to finding disparities in loan denials nationally we examined cities and towns across the country individually and found disparities in 89 metropolitan areas spanning every region of the country in charlotte where crystal marie and her family searched for a home lenders were 50 more likely to deny loans to black applicants than white ones with similar financial profiles in other places the gap was even larger black applicants in chicago were 150 more likely to be denied by financial institutions than similar white applicants there lenders were more than 200 more likely to reject latino applicants than white applicants in waco texas and to reject asian and pacific islander applicants than white ones in port st lucie florida and native american applicants in minneapolis were 100 more likely to be denied by financial institutions than similar white applicants there it s something that we have a very painful history with said alderman matt martin who represents chicago s 47th ward redlining the now outlawed practice of branding certain black and immigrant neighborhoods too risky for financial investments that began in the 1930s can be traced back to chicago chicago activists exposed that banks were still redlining in the 1970s leading to the establishment of the home mortgage disclosure act the law mandating the collection of data used for this story when you see that maybe the tactics are different now but the outcomes are substantially similar martin added it s just not something we can continue to tolerate who makes these loan decisions officially lending officers at each institution in reality software most of it mandated by a pair of quasi governmental agencies freddie mac and fannie mae were founded by the federal government to spur homeownership and now buy about half of all mortgages in america if they don t approve a loan the lenders are on their own if the borrower skips out and that power means fannie and freddie essentially set the rules for the industry starting from the very beginning of the mortgage approval process fannie and freddie require lenders to use a particular credit scoring algorithm classic fico to determine whether an applicant meets the minimum threshold necessary to even be considered for a conventional mortgage currently a score of 620 this algorithm was developed from data from the 1990s and is more than 15 years old it s widely considered detrimental to people of color because it rewards traditional credit to which white americans have more access it does not consider among other things on time payments for rent utilities and cellphone bills but will lower people s scores if they get behind on them and are sent to debt collectors unlike more recent models it penalizes people for past medical debt even if it s since been paid this is how structural racism works said chi chi wu a staff attorney at the national consumer law center this is how racism gets embedded into institutions and policies and practices with absolutely no animus at all potentially fairer credit models have existed for years a recent study by vantage score a credit model developed by the big three credit bureaus to compete with fico estimated that its model would provide credit to 37 million americans who have no scores under fico models almost a third of them would be black or latino yet fannie and freddie have resisted a steady stream of plaintive requests since 2014 from advocates the mortgage and housing industries and congress to update to a newer model even the company that created classic fico has lobbied for the agencies to adopt a newer version which it said expands credit to more people a lot of things that minorities and underserved borrowers are doing responsible financial behaviors are going under the radar said scott olson executive director of chla a trade group representing small and midsized independent mortgage lenders fannie s and freddie s regulator and conservator the federal housing finance agency continues to allow the companies to stick with classic fico more than five years after ordering them to study the effects of switching to something newer the fhfa has also expressed concern about the cost and operational implications if they would have to continually test new credit scoring models neither of the companies would answer questions from the markup about why they still require classic fico they ve been testing alternate scores for years and i don t know why the process is taking so long said lisa rice president and ceo of the national fair housing alliance a consortium of hundreds of fair housing organizations well deserving consumers are being left behind fannie s and freddie s approval process also involves other mysterious algorithms automated underwriting software programs that they first launched in 1995 to much fanfare about their speed ease and most important fairness using a data base as opposed to human judgment can avoid influences by other forces such as discrimination against minority individuals and red lining peter maselli then a vice president of freddie mac told the new york times when it launched its software now called loan product advisor a bank executive told congress that year the new systems were explicitly and implicitly color blind since they did not consider a person s race at all in their evaluations but like similar promises that algorithms would make colorblind decisions in criminal risk assessment and health care research shows that some of the factors fannie and freddie say their software programs consider affect people differently depending on their race or ethnicity these include in addition to credit histories the prospective borrowers assets employment status debts and the size of the loan relative to the value of the property they re hoping to buy the quality of the data that you re putting into the underwriting algorithm is crucial said aracely panameño director of latino affairs for the center for responsible lending if the data that you re putting in is based on historical discrimination then you re basically cementing the discrimination at the other end research has shown that payday loan sellers usually place branches in neighborhoods populated mainly by people of color where bank branches are less common as a result residents are more likely to use these predatory services to borrow money this creates lopsided incomplete credit histories because banks report both good and bad financial behavior to credit bureaus while payday loan services only report missed payments gig workers who are people of color are more likely to report that those jobs are their primary source of income rather than a side hustle they re using for extra cash than white gig workers having multiple sources of income or unconventional employment can complicate the verification process for a mortgage as crystal marie and eskias mcdaniels learned considering an applicant s assets beyond the down payment which lenders call reserves can cause particular problems for people of color people with fatter bank accounts present a lower risk because they can more easily weather a setback that would leave others unable to pay the mortgage but largely due to intergenerational wealth and past racist policies the typical white family in america today has eight times the wealth of a typical black family and five times the wealth of a latino family people of color are more likely to have smaller savings accounts and smaller or nonexistent stock portfolios than white people this is a relatively new world of automated underwriting engines that by intent may not discriminate but by effect likely do said david stevens a former president and ceo of the mortgage bankers association now an independent financial consultant not even home valuations are free from controversy the president of the trade group representing real estate appraisers who determine property values for loans recently acknowledged that racial bias is prevalent in the industry and launched new programs to combat it any type of data that you look at from the financial services space has a high tendency to be highly correlated to race said rice of the national fair housing alliance in written statements fannie said its software analyzes applications without regard to race and both fannie and freddie said their algorithms are routinely evaluated for compliance with fair lending laws internally and by the fhfa and the department of housing and urban development hud said in an email to the markup that it has asked the pair to make changes in underwriting criteria as a result of those reviews but would not disclose the details this analysis includes a review to ensure that model inputs are not serving as proxies for race or other protected classes chad wandler freddie s director of public relations said in a written statement he declined to elaborate on what the review entails or how often it s done no one outside fannie and freddie knows exactly how the factors in their underwriting software are used or weighted the formulas are closely held secrets not even the companies regulator the fhfa appears to know beyond broad strokes exactly how the software scores applicants according to stevens who served as federal housing commissioner and assistant secretary for housing at hud during the obama administration the markup s analysis does not include decisions made by fannie s and freddie s underwriting algorithms because while lenders are required to report those decisions to the government the cfpb scrubs them from public mortgage data arguing that including them would likely disclose information about the applicant or borrower that is not otherwise public and may be harmful or sensitive lenders ultimate mortgage decisions are public however borrowers names are not reported to the government and addresses are not in the public data fannie and freddie declined to answer our questions about why their algorithms decisions are excluded from the public data but said in a 2014 letter to the cfpb that the revelation could allow their decision making algorithms to be reverse engineered loan officers say the software s decisions are mysterious even to them when you run so many deals through the automated system you ll look at one deal that didn t get an approval and you just know that that s a better client than someone else that might ve gotten approved said ashley thomas iii a broker and owner of la top broker inc a minority owned real estate agency and brokerage in south los angeles that lack of transparency in the technology is very concerning the community home lenders association sent a letter to fannie and freddie in april complaining about unannounced changes to both of their underwriting software programs that members discovered when applicants who had previously been approved suddenly were denied scott olson executive director of chla said there s no good reason to keep lenders in the dark the more transparent the more clear the guidance is the easier it is for borrowers to know what they need to do to be in a position to qualify earlier this month and weeks after we began asking about its algorithms fannie announced in a news release that it would start incorporating on time rent payments in its loan approval software starting in mid september when we asked about the timing of that change spokesperson katie penote emailed the markup a statement saying the company wanted prospective borrowers to have this option as soon as possible but was silent about what prompted it in addition to using fannie s or freddie s software many large lenders also run applicants through their institutions own underwriting software which may be more stringent how those programs work is even more of a mystery they are also proprietary when we examined the reasons lenders listed for denying mortgages in 2019 the most common reason across races and ethnicities with the exception of native americans was that applicants had too much debt relative to their incomes when lenders did list credit history as the reason for denial it was cited more often for black applicants than white ones in 2019 33 versus 21 when we examined the decisions by individual lenders many denied people of color more than white applicants an additional statistical analysis showed that several were at least 100 more likely to deny people of color than similar white borrowers among them the mortgage companies owned by nation s three largest home builders the two principal laws forbidding housing and lending discrimination are the 1968 fair housing act and the 1974 equal credit opportunity act an alphabet soup of federal agencies can refer evidence of violations of these laws to hud or the justice department for investigation but referrals have dropped precipitously over the past decade marcia fudge who took over hud leadership earlier this year told axios in june that part of the reason black ownership rates are so low in america is that we have never totally enforced the fair housing act in an email hud press secretary meaghan lynch told the markup that fudge intends to tackle systemic discrimination in the housing and credit markets that is at the heart of the racial homeownership gap we do have laws that explicitly protect against discrimination and yet you still see these disparities that you re finding so that suggests that we need better enforcement of existing laws and more investigations said kevin stein deputy director of the california reinvestment coalition agencies need to do a better job of ferreting out discrimination and taking serious action once they find it another key housing law the federal community reinvestment act cra of 1977 allows the federal government to penalize lenders who fail to invest in low income or blighted neighborhoods but makes no requirements regarding borrowers race stein s group has lobbied for the law to be reformed lenders who violate fair lending rules can be punished with fines in the millions of dollars rep al green a texas democrat has sponsored legislation wending its way through congress that would make it a crime to engage in lending discrimination banks already have laws that punish people who commit fraud he said you can be imprisoned for i hope you have your seatbelt on 30 years why not have some similar law that deals with banks who are invidiously discriminating against people who are trying to borrow money and some fair lending advocates have begun to ask whether the value system in mortgage lending should be tweaked as an industry we need to think about what are the less discriminatory alternatives even if they are a valid predictor of risk said david sanchez a former federal housing finance agency policy analyst who currently directs research and development at the nonprofit national community stabilization trust because if we let risk alone govern all of our decisions we are going to end up in the exact same place we are now when it comes to racial equity in this country crystal marie mcdaniels said whatever effect race may have had on her denial it wasn t overt i m not sure you ever really know because there s no klansmen in our yard or anything but it s definitely something we always think about she said it s just something that we always understand might be a possibility the lender loandepot denied race had anything to do with the decision the company s vice president of communications lori wildrick said in an email that the company follows the law and expects fair and equitable treatment for every applicant we take the issues raised by ms mcdaniels very seriously and are conducting a thorough review of her concerns crystal marie said buying a house was crucial for her because she wants to pass on wealth to her son someday giving him an advantage she never had so when the loan officer told her the deal wasn t going to happen she refused to give up with the help of their real estate agent and multiple emails from her employer on her behalf she and her husband eskias pushed back against the denial around 8 p m on the night before the original closing date crystal marie got an email from the lender you re cleared to close she still doesn t understand how the lender went from a no to a yes but she was relieved and elated it means so much to me as a black person to own property in a place where not that many generations ago you were property said crystal marie who said she is descended from slaves in neighboring south carolina she said her family has always had a fraught relationship with money some relatives were so mistrustful of banks that they d insisted on dealing only in cash she said making it impossible to build up credit or wealth for future generations it s meant so much she said that we were able to go through this process and finally eventually be successful

and eskias mcdaniels s personal american dream the reason they had moved to this southern town from pricey los angeles a few years ago a lush long lawn 2 700 square feet of living space a neighborhood pool and playground for their son nazret all for 375 000 prequalifying for the mortgage was a breeze they said they had saved much more than they would need for the down payment had very good credit scores of 805 and 725 and earned roughly six figures each she in marketing at a utility company and eskias representing a pharmaceutical company the monthly mortgage payment was less than they d paid for rent in los angeles for years they were scheduled to sign the mortgage documents on aug 23 2019 a friday and were so excited to move in they booked movers for the same day the wednesday before the big day the loan officer called crystal marie and everything changed she said the deal wasn t going to close the loan officer told the couple that he had submitted the application internally to the underwriting department for approval a dozen 15 maybe 17 times getting a no each time the couple had spent 6 000 in fees and deposits all nonrefundable it seemed like it was getting rejected by an algorithm crystal marie said and then there was a person who could step in and decide to override that or not she was told she didn t qualify because she was a contractor not a full time employee even though her boss told the lender she was not at risk of losing her job her co workers were contractors too and they had mortgages crystal marie s co workers are white she and eskias are black i think it would be really naive for someone like myself to not consider that race played a role in the process she said an investigation by the markup has found that lenders in 2019 were more likely to deny home loans to people of color than to white people with similar financial characteristics even when we controlled for newly available financial factors that the mortgage industry for years has said would explain racial disparities in lending holding 17 different factors steady in a complex statistical analysis of more than two million conventional mortgage applications for home purchases we found that lenders were 40 more likely to turn down latino applicants for loans 50 more likely to deny asian pacific islander applicants and 70 more likely to deny native american applicants than similar white applicants lenders were 80 more likely to reject black applicants than similar white applicants these are national rates in every case the prospective borrowers of color looked almost exactly the same on paper as the white applicants except for their race the industry had criticized previous similar analyses for not including financial factors they said would explain disparities in lending rates but were not public at the time debts as a percentage of income how much of the property s assessed worth the person is asking to borrow and the applicant s credit score the first two are now public in the home mortgage disclosure act data including these financial data points in our analysis not only failed to eliminate racial disparities in loan denials it highlighted new devastating ones we found that lenders gave fewer loans to black applicants than white applicants even when their incomes were high 100 000 a year or more and had the same debt ratios in fact high earning black applicants with less debt were rejected more often than high earning white applicants who have more debt lenders used to tell us it s because you don t have the lending profiles the ethno racial differences would go away if you had them said josé loya assistant professor of urban planning at ucla who has studied public mortgage data extensively and reviewed our methodology your work shows that s not true we sent our complete analysis to industry representatives the american bankers association the mortgage bankers association the community home lenders association and the credit union national association they all criticized it generally saying the public data is not complete enough to draw conclusions but did not point to any flaws in our computations blair bernstein director of public relations for the aba acknowledged that our analysis showed disparities but that given the limitations in the public data we used the numbers are not sufficient on their own to explain why those disparities exist in written statements the aba and mba criticized the markup s analysis for not including credit scores and for focusing on conventional loans only and not including government loans such as those guaranteed by the federal housing administration and department of veterans affairs isolating conventional loans from government loans is common in mortgage research because they are different products with different thresholds for approval and loan terms government loans bring people who wouldn t otherwise qualify into the market but tend to be more expensive for the borrower even the federal reserve and consumer financial protection bureau the agency that releases mortgage data separates conventional and fha loans in their research on lending disparities authors of one academic study out of northeastern and george washington universities said they focus on conventional loans only because fha loans have long been implemented in a manner that promotes segregation as for credit scores it was impossible for us to include them in our analysis because the cfpb strips them from public view from hmda data in part due to the mortgage industry s lobbying to remove them citing borrower privacy when the cfpb first proposed expanding mortgage data collection to include the very data that industry trade groups have told us is vital for doing this type of analysis credit scores debt to income ratio and loan to value ratio those same groups objected they didn t want the government to even collect the data let alone make it public they cited the risk of cyberattack which could reveal borrowers private information these new fields include confidential financial data several large trade groups wrote in a letter to the cfpb including the aba and mba consequently if this data are inadvertently or knowingly released to the public the harm associated with re identification would be even greater government regulators do have access to credit scores the cfpb analyzed 2019 hmda data and found that accounting for credit scores does not eliminate lending disparities for people of color location location location in addition to finding disparities in loan denials nationally we examined cities and towns across the country individually and found disparities in 89 metropolitan areas spanning every region of the country in charlotte where crystal marie and her family searched for a home lenders were 50 more likely to deny loans to black applicants than white ones with similar financial profiles in other places the gap was even larger black applicants in chicago were 150 more likely to be denied by financial institutions than similar white applicants there lenders were more than 200 more likely to reject latino applicants than white applicants in waco texas and to reject asian and pacific islander applicants than white ones in port st lucie fla and native american applicants in minneapolis were 100 more likely to be denied by financial institutions than similar white applicants there it s something that we have a very painful history with said alderman matt martin who represents chicago s 47th ward redlining the now outlawed practice of branding certain black and immigrant neighborhoods too risky for financial investments that began in the 1930s can be traced back to chicago chicago activists exposed that banks were still redlining in the 1970s leading to the establishment of the home mortgage disclosure act the law mandating the collection of data used for this story when you see that maybe the tactics are different now but the outcomes are substantially similar martin added it s just not something we can continue to tolerate who makes these loan decisions officially lending officers at each institution in reality software most of it mandated by a pair of quasi governmental agencies freddie mac and fannie mae were founded by the federal government to spur homeownership and now buy about half of all mortgages in america if they don t approve a loan the lenders are on their own if the borrower skips out and that power means that fannie and freddie essentially set the rules for the industry starting from the very beginning of the mortgage approval process stuck in the past fannie and freddie require lenders to use a particular credit scoring algorithm classic fico to determine whether an applicant meets the minimum threshold necessary to even be considered for a conventional mortgage currently a score of 620 this algorithm was developed from data from the 1990s and is more than 15 years old it s widely considered detrimental to people of color because it rewards traditional credit to which white americans have more access it doesn t consider among other things on time payments for rent utilities and cellphone bills but will lower people s scores if they get behind on them and are sent to debt collectors unlike more recent models it penalizes people for past medical debt even if it s since been paid this is how structural racism works said chi chi wu a staff attorney at the national consumer law center this is how racism gets embedded into institutions and policies and practices with absolutely no animus at all potentially fairer credit models have existed for years a recent study by vantage score a credit model developed by the big three credit bureaus to compete with fico estimated that its model would provide credit to 37 million americans who have no scores under fico models almost a third of them would be black or latino yet fannie and freddie have resisted a steady stream of plaintive requests since 2014 from advocates the mortgage and housing industries and congress to update to a newer model even the company that created classic fico has lobbied for the agencies to adopt a newer version which it said expands credit to more people a lot of things that minorities and underserved borrowers are doing responsible financial behaviors are going under the radar said scott olson executive director of the community home lenders association a trade group representing small and midsized independent mortgage lenders fannie s and freddie s regulator and conservator the federal housing finance agency continues to allow the companies to stick with classic fico more than five years after ordering them to study the effects of switching to something newer the fhfa has also expressed concern about the cost and operational implications if they would have to continually test new credit scoring models neither of the companies would answer questions from the markup about why they still require classic fico they ve been testing alternate scores for years and i don t know why the process is taking so long said lisa rice president and ceo of the national fair housing alliance a consortium of hundreds of fair housing organizations well deserving consumers are being left behind color blind approvals fannie s and freddie s approval process also involves other mysterious algorithms automated underwriting software programs that they first launched in 1995 to much fanfare about their speed ease and most important fairness using a data base as opposed to human judgment can avoid influences by other forces such as discrimination against minority individuals and red lining peter maselli then a vice president of freddie mac told the new york times when it launched its software now called loan product advisor a bank executive told congress that year that the new systems were explicitly and implicitly color blind since they did not consider a person s race at all in their evaluations but like similar promises that algorithms would make color blind decisions in criminal risk assessment and health care research shows that some of the factors fannie and freddie say their software programs consider affect people differently depending on their race or ethnicity these include in addition to credit histories the prospective borrowers assets employment status debts and the size of the loan relative to the value of the property they re hoping to buy the quality of the data that you re putting into the underwriting algorithm is crucial said aracely panameño director of latino affairs for the center for responsible lending if the data that you re putting in is based on historical discrimination then you re basically cementing the discrimination at the other end research has shown that payday loan sellers usually place branches in neighborhoods populated mainly by people of color where bank branches are less common as a result residents are more likely to use these predatory services to borrow money this creates lopsided incomplete credit histories because banks report both good and bad financial behavior to credit bureaus while payday loan services only report missed payments gig workers who are people of color are more likely to report that those jobs are their primary source of income rather than a side hustle they re using for extra cash than white gig workers having multiple sources of income or unconventional employment can complicate the verification process for a mortgage as crystal marie and eskias learned considering an applicant s assets beyond the down payment which lenders call reserves can cause particular problems for people of color people with fatter bank accounts present a lower risk because they can more easily weather a setback that would leave others unable to pay the mortgage but largely due to intergenerational wealth and past racist policies the typical white family in america today has eight times the wealth of a typical black family and five times the wealth of a latino family people of color are more likely to have smaller savings accounts and smaller or nonexistent stock portfolios than white people this is a relatively new world of automated underwriting engines that by intent may not discriminate but by effect likely do said david stevens a former president and ceo of the mortgage bankers association now an independent financial consultant not even home valuations are free from controversy the president of the trade group representing real estate appraisers who determine property values for loans recently acknowledged that racial bias is prevalent in the industry and launched new programs to combat it any type of data that you look at from the financial services space has a high tendency to be highly correlated to race said rice of the national fair housing alliance in written statements fannie said its software analyzes applications without regard to race and both fannie and freddie said their algorithms are routinely evaluated for compliance with fair lending laws internally and by the fhfa and the department of housing and urban development hud said in an email to the markup that it has asked the pair to make changes in underwriting criteria as a result of those reviews but would not disclose the details this analysis includes a review to ensure that model inputs are not serving as proxies for race or other protected classes chad wandler freddie s director of public relations said in a written statement he declined to elaborate on what the review entails or how often it s done a secret algorithm s secret decisions no one outside fannie and freddie knows exactly how the factors in their underwriting software are used or weighted the formulas are closely held secrets not even the companies regulator the fhfa appears to know beyond broad strokes exactly how the software scores applicants according to stevens who served as federal housing administration commissioner and assistant secretary for housing at hud during the obama administration the markup s analysis does not include decisions made by fannie s and freddie s underwriting algorithms because while lenders are required to report those decisions to the government the cfpb scrubs them from public mortgage data arguing that including them would likely disclose information about the applicant or borrower that is not otherwise public and may be harmful or sensitive lenders ultimate mortgage decisions are public however borrowers names are not reported to the government and addresses are not in the public data fannie and freddie declined to answer our questions about why their algorithms decisions are excluded from the public data but said in a 2014 letter to the cfpb that the revelation could allow their decision making algorithms to be reverse engineered loan officers say the software s decisions are mysterious even to them when you run so many deals through the automated system you ll look at one deal that didn t get an approval and you just know that that s a better client than someone else that might ve gotten approved said ashley thomas iii a broker and owner of la top broker inc a minority owned real estate agency and brokerage in south los angeles that lack of transparency in the technology is very concerning courtesy the markup the community home lenders association sent a letter to fannie and freddie in april complaining about unannounced changes to both of their underwriting software programs that members discovered when applicants who had previously been approved suddenly were denied olson executive director of chla said there s no good reason to keep lenders in the dark the more transparent the more clear the guidance is the easier it is for borrowers to know what they need to do to be in a position to qualify earlier this month and weeks after we began asking about its algorithms fannie announced in a press release that it would start incorporating on time rent payments in its loan approval software starting in mid september when we asked about the timing of that change spokesperson katie penote emailed the markup a statement saying the company wanted prospective borrowers to have this option as soon as possible but was silent about what prompted it in addition to using fannie s or freddie s software many large lenders also run applicants through their institutions own underwriting software which may be more stringent how those programs work is even more of a mystery they are also proprietary when we examined the reasons lenders listed for denying mortgages in 2019 the most common reason across races and ethnicities with the exception of native americans was that applicants had too much debt relative to their incomes when lenders did list credit history as the reason for denial it was cited more often for black applicants than white ones in 2019 33 versus 21 when we examined the decisions by individual lenders many denied people of color more than white applicants an additional statistical analysis showed that several were at least 100 more likely to deny people of color than similar white borrowers among them the mortgage companies owned by nation s three largest home builders laws and their limits the two principal laws forbidding housing and lending discrimination are the 1968 fair housing act and the 1974 equal credit opportunity act an alphabet soup of federal agencies can refer evidence of violations of these laws to hud or the justice department for investigation but referrals have dropped precipitously over the past decade marcia fudge who took over hud leadership earlier this year told axios in june that part of the reason black ownership rates are so low in america is that we have never totally enforced the fair housing act in an email hud press secretary meaghan lynch told the markup that fudge intends to tackle systemic discrimination in the housing and credit markets that is at the heart of the racial homeownership gap we do have laws that explicitly protect against discrimination and yet you still see these disparities that you re finding so that suggests that we need better enforcement of existing laws and more investigations said kevin stein deputy director of the california reinvestment coalition agencies need to do a better job of ferreting out discrimination and taking serious action once they find it another key housing law the federal community reinvestment act cra of 1977 allows the federal government to penalize lenders who fail to invest in low income or blighted neighborhoods but makes no requirements regarding borrowers race stein s group has lobbied for the law to be reformed lenders who violate fair lending rules can be punished with fines in the millions of dollars rep al green d tx has sponsored legislation wending its way through congress that would make it a crime to engage in lending discrimination banks already have laws that punish people who commit fraud he said you can be imprisoned for i hope you have your seatbelt on 30 years why not have some similar law that deals with banks who are invidiously discriminating against people who are trying to borrow money and some fair lending advocates have begun to ask whether the value system in mortgage lending should be tweaked as an industry we need to think about what are the less discriminatory alternatives even if they are a valid predictor of risk said david sanchez a former federal housing finance agency policy analyst who currently directs research and development at the nonprofit national community stabilization trust because if we let risk alone govern all of our decisions we are going to end up in the exact same place we are now when it comes to racial equity in this country crystal marie said whatever effect race may have had on her denial it wasn t overt i m not sure you ever really know because there s no klansmen in our yard or anything but it s definitely something we always think about she said it s just something that we always

in 2018 ohioans voted to make redistricting a more public process that includes hosting nine public hearings all across the state community members packed an auditorium at sinclair community college on tuesday for the dayton hearing with only four minutes each to speak residents made their case to a panel of seven state representatives who sit on the redistricting committee this is what some of what they had to say joy schwaab i remember from my 1966 civics class in high school they taught me that gerrymandering was wrong and that it was a ridiculous thing that was ridiculed for its political corruption that started in 1812 and i was shocked to realize in the past 10 years that my state was severely gerrymandered derrick foward what happened the last time in 2011 when the lines were drawn they want to come down straight down to the heart in the gut of dayton ohio they want to come straight down hoover avenue and split the black vote and in fact we were you know they were highly successful as a black man i need representation as black people we need representation nathaniel lathy both parties do not represent the people that is the problem and that is the issue not this redistricting redistricting redistricting thing this gerrymandering and i think it s ridiculous to try to make it one tilted more toward the democrats and that s what this is an effort to do both parties are bad we do not want a blue state california and new york are laughing stocks why would you want to make it like that grace dean i heard a lot of people talk about how they want everyone to reach across the aisle and work together and so i almost believed it until the man back there was speaking and they all laughed at him and that wasn t fair because everyone else got their time to speak up here and nobody laughed at them and everyone gave them the respect that they deserved until someone said something that they didn t agree with so they don t want to be fair they want an advantage calliea tellez but if i were a young professional living in columbus who has the privilege to drive here to dayton back to my hometown because it is my job and one of the few people to talk to you today about the environmental racism your government perpetuates in dayton then that is a shameful illustration of this commission s attempt to be accountable to all ohioans the creation the creation of fair and representative maps must center the critical voices of black and brown and low income ohioans who experience more environmental health and social injustices toni holmes because growing up black in poverty we are taught that politics don t matter for us things are going to happen to us no matter what we are used to fighting we are used to the struggle and we are used to surviving but we are not knowledgeable about politics all we get taught is how to go to college hopefully or get another job working our butts off and we would never become on that level because it s not meant for us to be there the committee must submit a state legislative map by september 1 they are hosting public hearings all this week more information can be found on redistricting ohio gov
posted wednesday august 25 2021 6 22 pm regional all across northern minnesota livestock producers are slashing their herds in response to dried up pastures minimal hay crops and the rising cost of other feeds necessary to sustain them with little or no relief in sight it s not a question of if but of how many head to cull as a difficult summer transitions into fall i hate to sell them but i ll have to said paul knuti of embarrass who used to run as many as 25 beef cows after i wean my calves i ll probably have to ship them to market knuti is hardly alone emmett berens a longtime cattle rancher and livestock trucker from linden grove said he s been far busier than usual hauling livestock to various markets he said a recent auction in bagley featured over 5 000 head of cattle for sale usually you ll have about 3 500 there he said berens is cutting his herd as well dropping it from the usual 150 160 head down to 120 at this point but i ll have to get rid of more yet he said the loss of pasture is among the biggest problems facing area ranchers right now as many fields have produced only a fraction of the forage of a typical summer i had to pasture on 40 acres of a neighbor s land just to give them something green to eat said berens it was brushier than most pasture but at least it gave his cattle some leaves to browse he added knuti said land he normally pastures well into september is already drying up quickly after weeks of minimal rainfall while many area ranchers can t rely on pasture to hold their livestock in this summer the availability of winter feed stocks is looking even more doubtful the big problem is that the hay crop is about two thirds short said keith aho who owns and operates homestead mills in cook with his wife carol people at the mill are looking for hay and i m having to pull it from way out in the red river valley aho added but they re short there as well the way it is now it s looking grim knuti agrees the outlook isn t hopeful for winter feed stocks the guy from cook who i normally buy 100 150 bales of hay from now has none available said knuti i usually buy 90 100 bales from a guy in meadowlands but he has none available either knuti said he s been forced to look for hay in northern wisconsin and the u p of michigan in order to sustain the cattle he hopes to carry through the winter that s awfully expensive hay when you factor in the mileage he said aho agrees and notes that livestock producers had better be prepared for higher prices even if hay or grains are available grain is growing but the test weights are going to be down considerably predicts aho one of the biggest outstanding questions for livestock producers now is whether prices will hold even as ranchers send more cattle to market in response to the drought knuti said he expects cattle prices will drop as producers cull their herds although that hasn t happened so far according to berens prices have been holding pretty good so far he said i can t believe it will last historic dryness while farmers and ranchers are used to the vagaries of weather the ongoing drought that s hit the region is of a nature few if any in the region can remember i ve lived on this farm for close to 50 years said berens and the crick that runs through my property has never run dry until this year much of the region is currently listed in extreme drought although conditions are even worse further west according to the u s drought monitor the northwestern half of koochiching county is now listed in exceptional drought the highest level of drought that the monitor indicates it s the first time in the 20 plus year history of the drought monitor that any portion of minnesota has reached such an extreme level of dryness the latest forecast as of presstime indicated a good chance of showers and thunderstorms on friday and saturday although rainfall amounts are not expected to be heavy the region will require several inches of soaking rain to break the current drought pattern

chief executive officer president and director thanks ken and good afternoon everyone our team delivered another very strong quarter with cloud arr growing 72 our tenth consecutive quarter of 70 plus growth over the last year we ve also doubled the number of customers of cloud arr by more than 1 million and our cloud dollar based net retention rate remains best in class at 129 these results speak to the high strategic value we delivered to the world s largest and most dynamic organizations our q2 outperformance was also broad based with each of our major geographic regions exceeding plan and validating that customers globally are relying on splunk and our market leading data platform and cloud based capabilities splunk offers the most comprehensive data platform in the market today powering our customer security it and devops teams we are 100 focused on enabling them to make sense of and act on their log metric and trace data to achieve the outcomes that matters most to them we re also helping organizations rapidly migrate to the cloud sticking more effectively and securely to serve their own customers we brought together the best cloud experts in the market to do this while evolving our platform and customer facing teams to serve our customers multi cloud and hybrid worlds when we talk about splunk s supporting multi class deployments we re enabling deep and native visibility across any public cloud aws google cloud microsoft azure and others as well as any combination of those clouds our priority is for our customers to have the highest level of visibility across their organization s data so they can serve their own customers effectively and securely and when we talk about supporting any hybrid deployment we re referring to helping customers at absolutely any stage of their transition to the cloud whether they re still predominantly on prem or all in on the cloud or somewhere between as transformation to cloud accelerates and data ingestion needs skyrocket our customers have asked for more flexible pricing that s why we introduced workload based pricing nearly two years ago allowing our customers to take action on even more of their data without any gates on the ingestion of that data this quarter s results showed that our customers are increasingly favoring this pricing option during q2 more than 80 of net new cloud arr was from workload based pricing up more than 3x from a year ago and now more than 25 of our total cloud arr is from customers utilizing workload based pricing and our customers are reaping the benefits for example after using splunk on prem for five years a major north american based services provider to the finance industry decided to begin to shift to splunk cloud and workload based pricing in q2 this shift was driven from expected infrastructure management savings of 75 increased splunk feature and capability and velocity and the ability to forgo a costly hardware refresh that have been planned for the next year also in q2 one of india s top five banks decided to go all in on splunk cloud and workload based pricing they are leaning on the versatility of our pricing model making it central to their overall security and cloud transformation strategy they re leveraging splunk cloud services to drive efficiency and visibility across their entire technological infrastructure delivering a world class making experience to their customers by improving the efficiency of their operations this customer expects to be better able to meet strict compliance requirements and reduce risk while taking advantage of splunk cloud s scalability to help accelerate their digital transformation workload pricing was a big factor in one of several competitor displacements during q2 for example a major north american financial services firm have grown tired of the billing surprises a competitor dropped on them every single month this customer appreciated our flat predictable and transparent pricing and turn to splunk to monitor their workloads across multiple clouds both existing and new customers are embracing splunk cloud for example one organization new to splunk this past quarter was the norwegian labor and welfare administration also known as nav nav one of norway s largest public entities purchased the splunk cloud platform to help optimize and secure the distribution of norway s citizens of unemployment benefits pensions and more that amount to one third of the national budget nav is on a rapid digital transformation journey and relies on splunk as their trusted tech partner to accelerate their systems from on premise to the cloud in a way that s flexible scalable and compliant with norway s central government regulations now let s turn to our product portfolio in q2 we launched our splunk observability it and security clouds applying our evolved cloud platform and pricing to our customers specific needs during our last earnings call i shared news of our launch of splunk observability cloud which brings together the world s best in class solutions for infrastructure monitoring application performance monitoring real user monitoring synthetic monitoring log investigation and incident response giving it and devops teams full stack visibility and context across any hybrid or multi cloud environment this integrated multi faceted delivery enables some powerful capabilities that now comes for our customers for example with splunk observability cloud our customer lenovo reduced their mean time to resolution from 30 minutes to about five allowing them to maintain 100 uptime through black friday traffic which was 300 higher than the previous year when it comes to it operations we re delivering some of the most broad and robust services in the market through our it cloud which combines the power of end to end virtual service visibility and monitoring with next generation stream based infrastructure monitoring and dashboard generation incident and event management and on call distribution response capabilities and splunk was recently recognized the value we re delivering to our it customers we earned gartner s no 1 spot in the itom performance analysis market for 2020 we were also named a leader in aiops by mbia and research in action giving us independent validation that customers looking to modernize it operations through advanced analytics and automation are increasingly turning to splunk as a preferred solution provider turning to security the cyber threat landscape continues to grow in attack frequency and complexity and we are rapidly innovating so our customers remain agile to adapt to ever evolving threats we spent q2 helping customers better protect themselves from new threats like the kaseya revil ransomware attack and more we also launched splunk security cloud a modern security operations platform that gives customers advanced security analytics automated security operations and integrated threat intelligence on one comprehensive platform companies like the environmental systems research institute real chemistry and soriana are already benefiting from our security cloud pricing model using a common and predictable metric in q2 a leading healthcare services company and existing it ops customer invested in our new security cloud as they built out their next gen set their existing siem couldn t meet the technical requirements that a customer is looking for and that our security cloud could deliver while their it ops team owns a splunk perpetual license it is our ability to offer workload based pricing for our security cloud that help this customer expand from it ops into security risk splunk we also won a significant eight figure deal at one of the five largest banks in latin america here the customer is looking for a single solution for all of their machine data security and advanced machine learning in a rapidly evolving cyberspace full of threats basic logging and security offerings from two of our competitors fell short of matching splunk s breadth and depth of offerings delivered on one cohesive platform with splunk this large enterprise is now collecting data once and using it for investigation it use cases and to protect their mission critical assets including financial and confidential data and last month for the eighth year in a row splunk continued to be a leader in the 2021 gartner siem magic quadrant gartner also validated splunk as no 1 in the siem performance analysis market for 2020 additionally we retained the no 1 spot in idc s cyber analytics intelligent response orchestration and tier 2 soc analytics market shares on the partner front we re seeing terrific progress as well for example splunk has continued to work with aws to release new offerings to provide a more curated experience for customers who have an aws centric cloud adoption model announced in q2 the new splunk security analytics for aws is a simplified security analytics solution designed for lean security teams this offering leverages deep centralized visibility of aws environments accelerating threat protection investigation and response capabilities for security teams who have fewer staff also one of our long term preferred managed service provider partners blue voyant recently announced the launch of their bluevoyant modern soc for splunk cloud platform the platform is designed to empower customers to maximize our investment in splunk cloud through features such as white glove technical workshops rapid onboarding in the splunk cloud and 24 7 managed detection response powered by bluevoyant 24 7 managed soc and finally we re excited to host over 15 000 splunk customers and partners at our annual user conference in october where we ll roll out new capabilities our updated product and services road map and further celebrate the data ecosystem in incredible ways that our customers are trading data into doing when it comes to innovative on behalf of our customers over nearly two decades we never rest i m so proud of the entire splunk team for delivering another fantastic quarter and i want to thank our customers and partners for inspiring us to better serve them every day thank you and i ll turn it over to jason for more on the quarter jason child senior vice president and chief financial officer thanks doug and good afternoon everyone thanks for joining us our execution in q2 was very strong with overall bookings well above plan we ended with total arr of 2 63 billion up 37 year over year cloud arr was 976 million up 72 over last year and we ended the quarter with 582 customers with total arr greater than 1 million up 47 two hundred thirty four of these customers had cloud arr over 1 million double the year ago period our continued focus on customer cloud adoption drove nearly 100 million in net new cloud arr and total net new arr of 164 million recall that in prior periods rpo bookings was skewed by shorter overall contract duration related to the pandemic as well as change in our field compensation plans with these factors mostly normalized now rpo bookings is becoming a better indicator of bookings momentum and in q2 total rpo bookings was 676 million up 29 over last year as i said last quarter with a substantial base of previous perp to term conversions coming up for renewal in the second half of this year we expect total rpo growth rates will continue to accelerate in q3 and q4 on the p l q2 cloud revenue was 217 million up 73 over last year reflecting acceleration of customer adoption of our cloud platform total revenues were 606 million in q2 up 23 and are benefiting from a more normalized average year over year term contract durations professional services and education accounted for 8 of total revenues in the quarter on margins which are all non gaap cloud gross margin was 61 in q2 up slightly from last year with continued progress toward our expected exit rate approaching 70 this year and improving to 70 to 75 next year as we realize leverage from scale and elasticity of the platform total gross margin was 75 down slightly on a year over year basis due to the greater proportion of revenue contribution coming from the cloud operating margin was negative 20 in q2 significantly better than planned due to our bookings of top line outperformance on the balance sheet we ended q2 with 2 5 billion in cash and investments reflecting net proceeds of 983 million from the silver lake convertible note issuance as we previously announced proceeds from that placement will be utilized for common stock repurchases and during the quarter we repurchased 1 65 million shares at an average price of 138 90 and the plan has continued into q3 turning to guidance we continue to see a robust demand environment and customer engagement is excellent especially for existing customers planning their hybrid deployments we expect to surpass 1 billion of cloud arr in q3 as we continue our acceleration reaching 1 1 billion to 1 11 billion and total arr of between 2 8 billion and 2 825 billion looking toward the end of the year we expect demand and bookings strength to continue and to end the year with cloud arr between 1 305 billion and 1 33 billion and total arr of 3 085 billion and 3 135 billion on the income statement the cloud transition will continue to drive variability in our revenue and operating margin results in q3 we expect total revenues of between 625 million and 650 million depending on cloud mix and the success of new programs to promote cloud adoption non gaap operating margin should be negative 15 to 20 full year total revenues should range between 2 53 billion and 2 6 billion with a non gaap operating margin of negative 14 to 17 on cash flow we will be lapping our change to annual billings in the second half which we expect will drive a return to full year positive cash flow nearing 100 million we expect to enter next fiscal year with our customer base fully normalized with the annual billings and cash collections driving a significant increase in ocf next year in closing we ve outperformed nicely year to date and are set up for a strong back half of the year the overall demand environment remains robust and with our product and service innovations geared to push cloud adoption faster we expect continued high growth with that let s open it up for questions questions answers operator thank you our first question comes from brent thill with jefferies you may proceed with your question brent thill jefferies analyst thanks doug maybe if you can just talk a little bit about the consumption by type and it looks like you had good upside on the license and term and many are asking when we expect to see even a harder inflection on cloud i ll start there and i had a quick follow up doug merritt chief executive officer president and director thanks brent yeah we were really excited about the continued progress with workload based pricing 80 plus percent net new cloud arr was workload twenty five percent now of all cloud arr is workload based so i think that program when you talk to customers that have moved to cloud and have abandoned infrastructure based sorry ingest fixed pricing and moved infrastructure if you re aligned with everything i m hearing you ll hear a lot of enthusiasm from customers it was a stronger term quarter than we thought and that really comes back to the craziness of the transformation why arr is such an important metric and we were thrilled that we got some big tcv term deals in this quarter we re honored to help a customer whether they manage it themselves or we manage it for them but that definitely skewed up term a bit including term duration because they are multiyear contracts but overall the trajectory remains the same super strong cloud growth more and more of the overall base going ratable more and more of the overall base going workloads infrastructure based on the pricing piece and we continue to stay super focused on that through q3 and q4 and beyond brent thill jefferies analyst and jason real quickly just on the buyback good to see that obviously is picking up should we expect kind of an even pickup in that buyback throughout the quarters or any way you can help us understand how that s going to progress jason child senior vice president and chief financial officer i would just say we took advantage of the share price and we were aggressive buyers in the last quarter as indicated i think what about 250 million or so that we bought back in the quarter there were more purchases i d say ongoing in q3 don t really have an update of when we re going to finalize so i d just say stay tuned brent thill jefferies analyst great thanks doug merritt chief executive officer president and director thanks brent jason child senior vice president and chief financial officer thanks brent operator thank you our next question comes from raimo lenschow with barclays you may proceed with your question raimo lenschow barclays analyst thank you just one i ll start with one for jason and one for doug jason like it s been a while since you kind of started talking about annual guidance seeing that coming back it s obviously like a very at least to me a very strong signal that visibility is increasing as you re coming out the other end on the transformation is that kind of the right way to think about it just kind of maybe talk to that a little bit what gives you that extra confidence now jason child senior vice president and chief financial officer yeah so thanks raimo i would say first we always had planned with this transformation there s kind of a lag of as we move to cloud it takes we knew it s going to take roughly a year from last year s cloud bookings to kind of show up in this year s kind of gaap numbers in terms of rpo and crpo and all the various kind of derivative metrics and i think maybe q2 was maybe a quarter early in terms of seeing some of the rebound i mean you saw rpo bookings at plus 29 this quarter after being i think it was only 5 positive last quarter and it was negative i think every quarter last year so i think as we start to see more momentum in a lot of those other metrics which i do expect as i said on the scripted portion of the call that certainly along with really a pretty strong purchasing environment we have a great pipeline all the indicators look good i did talk about some of the cloud programs that we put in place this quarter so i think the combination of those factors is what gives us more confidence going into the second half raimo lenschow barclays analyst ok perfect and then one for you doug like if i think about that consumption pricing that you put in that is so like by the customers now like how do you think that will feed through into the installed base do i kind of need to think about it like every time someone comes up for renewal they will do that are you going to try to push it intra renewal how do i think about that evolution within the client base thank you doug merritt chief executive officer president and director good question raimo so for net news it s default any net new cloud customers default for the sales force to focus on workflow based pricing customer success is a no 1 company priority we really stay focused on that so we don t want too strong on our customer into workload based pricing but every ounce of data we ve collected and we now have got a big body of data continues to point that s better for the customer gives them a significantly wider aperture to play with data without worrying about the volume of data brings more people to the overall platform makes these solutions more palatable for them so stay tuned there s a lot of interesting things that the combination of shawn and teresa and some of the additional people we ve been focused on bringing on board and listening to have in play for the course of this year to make sure that we keep making this the right choice for customers and increasing the volume of customers that are switching away from the data ingest model raimo lenschow barclays analyst congratulations thank you doug merritt chief executive officer president and director thank you jason child senior vice president and chief financial officer thanks operator thank you our next question comes from matt hedberg with rbc capital markets you may proceed with your question matt hedberg rbc capital markets analyst all right guys thanks for taking my questions congrats on the results first of all doug i want to start with you it s been a few months since the silver lake investment but i m curious if you could talk a little bit about what that means to sort of the strategy and really where you re at in this cloud transition and just how that benefits kind of the investment thesis doug merritt chief executive officer president and director sure matt so yes we actually had our first interim board meeting where ken hao participated and it s been great to out of the board i think the overall perspective that we get from silver lake they ve watched a few of these transformations in the past they ve got a broad based large and tech oriented companies that they invest in so a lot of good compares that are definitely helping us in some areas on how are we approaching the transformation how are we collapsing our metrics and measurements the core for me on top of that and for the rest of the team was the bar the high bar that i think someone like silver s lake sets they re pretty effective and savvy at getting effective returns for themselves and they re limited and the deep due diligence that we had to go through to get that investment i think was very it was purposeful on our part right going through transformation is tough there s a lot of opinions out there about splunk and adding someone as an insider who is part of that investor community and is top tier from an investor perspective we felt was another support that there s light at the end of this transformation tunnel that it s a very positive light and as we just talked through on guidance and we re now focused on 3 plus billion arr by the end of this year north of 1 3 billion in arr for our cloud business at continued really enviable growth rate so excited about the support and help that silver lake and ken and lee wittlinger who is assisting ken in providing and looking forward to continued momentum on this transformation matt hedberg rbc capital markets analyst that s great and then just a quick one for jason the 3 billion arr target is great i guess from your perspective when we re coming out of this transition and we re leaning more cloud how do you think you get more to leverage in the sales force to me it feels like there s a great opportunity to see even more leverage there as we progress through the year so just kind of thoughts on how that might transpire jason child senior vice president and chief financial officer yeah i think that s absolutely right the leverage in the model right now is at least as measured by operating profit is certainly negative because of the 606 impacts of moving from term to cloud we will see those recover in the near term you re going to see the leverage in cash flow and so as we said we ll have approximately 100 million of cash flow this year and then next year we ll have a full year of collections since we were lapping that upfront invoicing to now annual invoicing which we did two years ago and so next year you ll see a full year return of strong cash flow so i do expect to see the cash leverage really start to come back next year i think on an operating margin basis it will take a little longer and that s really just dependent on revenue recognition treatment specifically to sales if you go and look at the dollar kind of per arr from the sales team we re actually seeing really strong double digit growth i do expect that to increase certainly in cloud where we do have dbnrr of 129 that is one of the best indicators that i think we re going to have really really strong leverage and certainly we re hiring reps at a rate that s less than the dbnrr rate so that obviously will turn into the leverage going forward matt hedberg rbc capital markets analyst thanks operator our next question comes from keith weiss with morgan stanley you may proceed with your question matt wilson morgan stanley analyst hi it s matt wilson on for keith weiss if i could dig a little bit more into the cloud transition the annual cloud percentage of total software bookings was 51 this quarter which was roughly flat from fy 21 after a couple of years of solid gains can you kind of help us understand what s going on here has there been any change in customers willingness to move to the cloud or any color there would be helpful doug merritt chief executive officer president and director i think for this quarter it was more the performance of term than anything cloud related right we saw cloud arr grow at 72 revenue overall in cloud 73 so our view especially given the arr size and the magnitude of the business now those as really really unique and enviable growth rates that said as jason mentioned in his remarks teresa had begun to use her experience with 10 plus years of getting people to understand the benefits of cloud through aws she put in place a couple of programs some internally facing some customer facing that could continue to help customers and our teams and partners understand the benefits of cloud so we re still very confident that we will end the year at a 60 or 60 plus cloud mix and anything we do to accelerate that we are focused on making sure that happens matt wilson morgan stanley analyst great that was helpful and one more if i may you re seeing really great progress in large deals and customers over 1 million can you kind of just talk generally about the progress upmarket that you re seeing and the success there doug merritt chief executive officer president and director yes getting near 250 cloud customers at 1 million plus a year and almost 600 overall that we re really proud of those numbers i think a chunk of that is we are the only unified platform and comprehensive set of solutions with high features and capability ties together security teams infrastructure management it teams devops and appdev teams they re really really different groups they re different backgrounds different skills different metrics they don t always love and hug each other but they ve got to work together if we want this digital transformation to actually continue to progress the way that we all wanted to so i think we re seeing increasing understanding and cross sell between those groups and then as we ve talked about and why workload is so important as far as the transformation the volume of data continues to expand now that we re in cloud we re moving away from data volume that s great but more volume means more opportunities to find needles in haystack more opportunities on different bits to monitor and predict around and that all results in expansion within those accounts which is why i think we ve been very consistent on a apples to apples cloud dbnrr compare of 129 130 131 for those numbers matt wilson morgan stanley analyst great thank you very much doug merritt chief executive officer president and director thank you operator thank you our next question comes from brad sills with bank of america you may proceed with your question brad sills bank of america merrill lynch analyst great thanks guys for taking my questions and congratulations on a nice quarter i wanted to ask about early reception to the latest release that has made a lot of progress for integration of signalfx on mission into that observability suite what are you seeing there from customers in terms of willingness to expand into those other use cases from core logging that splunk s so successful and known for doug merritt chief executive officer president and director yeah really really good and important question so my excitement about observability is also kind of countered with this term becoming a super overloaded term i think it s in danger of being the next ai or a client server or where it almost becomes meaningless because it s such a broad topic area within our durability suite we ve got infrastructure monitoring application performance monitoring real user monitoring synthetic monitoring log investigation incident response so it s a really comprehensive offering what we have seen is bringing the depth and capability across that really broad suite is important to customers but what they want is going to vary based on where they are on their movement from a last generation static of apps to a next generation highly fluid ephemeral cloud based set of apps so our belief and why we ve invested so strongly in a comprehensive nature of the suite is they ultimately need all those capabilities across eventually it security and appdev right now the bulk of it is devops and appdev and that s a little bit more apm and that can really user oriented and it where it s a little bit more infrastructure monitoring oriented our strength is we play in both camps both the last generation monitoring and visibility as well as what s going on within the cloud deployments that these guys have brad sills bank of america merrill lynch analyst great thanks so much dough and one more if i may please with the success you re seeing in workload based pricing and the data velocity that that s enabling less friction in bringing more data in what s your confidence in the ability to sustain that cloud dollar based net retention level of 129 very strong levels it would seem that with that trend in place that it could be a very long runway if that workload based pricing is doing what it s supposed to do which is bring in more data volumes that you re seeing already thank you so much doug merritt chief executive officer president and director really really good observation i mean the interesting part and why the shift to workload has been i think so important for on behalf of our customers is data volume is a factor but it s not the factor i ve said in a couple of calls that the cost of finding moving and indexing data so it s available is it s a cost but that s not the big driver the big driver is what are you going to do with that data and that s where the curation of the data the cube queries and interrogation of that data come into play and whether it s hitting our index whether it s allowing our heterogeneous search to go after data directly within s3 or other storage vehicles whether it s something on the stream that our solutions are continuously are increasingly relying on workload neutralizes that factor we ve heard complaints forever of hey i d love to play with netflow data but it s huge it s hundreds of terabytes per day and i don t want to pay for that but i want to at least have it so i can play with it now with workload based pricing you get that opportunity very cheap to push that either into our index or in something like s3 and then when you need it it s there so that you can rewind time do the needle in the haystack work that you need to because ultimately every one of these systems will go down and will all likely face some type of a breach you need to be able to investigate and understand what happened so i think it really aligns much more clearly with what customers have been asking for brad sills bank of america merrill lynch analyst that s great to hear thanks so much doug operator thank you our next question comes from karl keirstead with ubs you may proceed with your question karl keirstead ubs analyst thanks very much maybe two for jason jason if i take your 4q arr number of the high end 3 1 billion to 3 5 billion and i assume a relatively slow decel as splunk scales i can arrive at a view that you re actually only going to miss your original 4 5 billion arr target by let s say two quarters i just wanted to ask is that way off the mark and when do you think you d be in a position to offer visibility on the arr number beyond fiscal 22 jason child senior vice president and chief financial officer first you know yes i think your math is reasonable and yes i think it s reasonable and i think the when we re in a position to talk about long term targets later sometime in the near future i would say i haven t finalized yet it s either going to be it would be at earliest late late this year or maybe sometime early next year the things that we re trying to figure out are we ve got a bunch of new cloud programs as we talked about that we just put in place this quarter we ve got two great leaders from aws that have been here a couple of months and then obviously we ve got a bunch of new cloud and a bunch of new products and services that have been released and so to really be able to kind of distill all those things and come up with a kind of a high fidelity view on what the next few years look like will take us a little bit of time but hopefully what you re seeing is really strong fundamental growth and so as you pointed out really not that far off from where our old long term targets were but we ll give you we ll definitely give you a better view at some point the first step was to give full year guidance and that s what we ve done now and i ll be certainly working on trying to come up with some firm long term targets sometime in the near future karl keirstead ubs analyst yeah that makes sense jason i think we all appreciate that so thank you and then my follow up is just on your comment that rpo bookings should accelerate in 3q 4q i just want to clarify from a base of 29 that you just did does that acceleration assume any duration increase and then if you could also clarify i think you said on the last call that crpo should be in the low 20s in the next several quarters do you still feel good about that thank you jason child senior vice president and chief financial officer yeah on crpo i think that s certainly a reasonable range and that nothing has changed and something in the 20s certainly is reasonable just remember on crpo it does get distorted if cloud mix bounces around for example if you have a higher term percentage you will book three years of revenue and that shows up all in current rpo because it s part of revenue and the change in rpo is going to while it may be our current rpo may be high current rpo bookings may not be so that metric still can bounce around based on cloud mix total rpo bookings really it was only affected by duration in fact if you look at the 29 that we put up this quarter you can see that our duration was actually down two and a half months year on year and so if you duration adjust it you d be something closer to 34 so we are not assuming duration extension to help with rpo bookings in the future instead we are lapping a q3 was a tough quarter last year and so that certainly makes for an easier comp as well as as the guidance implies we do see a strong fundamental for the second half of the year karl keirstead ubs analyst thanks a lot it s nice to see splunk coming back with a good quarter no drama appreciate it very much thank you jason child senior vice president and chief financial officer thank you i appreciate that a lot operator our next question comes from kirk materne with evercore isi you may proceed with your question kirk materne evercore isi analyst thanks very much and congrats on a nice quarter jason or i don t know if doug you want to take this but you both sound very upbeat about the pipeline heading into the back half of the year can you just talk a little bit about sort of what your confidence is sort of based upon i think one of the challenges maybe earlier this year was not knowing how some of the renewal deals were going to look in terms of the construction of the deal itself whether it s cloud or and what kind of capacity people are going to be buying in front sort of in front of or what level of capacity they re going to buy in the next reup are you just seeing more normalization in sort of buying patterns i was just wondering if you can unpack that a little bit more as you obviously both sound very upbeat as we go into the back half of the year thanks doug merritt chief executive officer president and director yeah so we certainly took away a lot of lessons from midyear last year that i think as we ve talked about has pretty dramatically impacted the level of visibility and some of the process steps and other pieces that help us get higher confidence in qualification and wherever possible can at least highlight unexpected surprises with a little bit more scrutiny when something is ever included in the forecast or not i think the theme around that so that all is good housekeeping internally from a very unique moment in time the height of the pandemic and a very unique impact within splunk externally what we ve seen is consistently i think from the headlights of q2 and q3 where people where companies and leaders were really trying to digest and understand what s going on with this pandemic what s going to happen with the economy what s going to happen with my balance sheet what s going to happen with my income statements i think was taken over and i ve heard it with virtually every company that s reported the past two quarters including us is if you re not online and if you re not a leader online you re going to be in trouble like there s no strong likelihood that life is going to go back to normal anytime soon so you ve got to have an effective digital presence i think that with continued confidence in access to capital and the stock market buoyancy certainly helps all of us in some ways has had a very consistent set of purchasing behavior i think over the past few quarters we re not expecting that to radically change over q3 q4 but the forecast we put forward is really based more less on our estimates about the macro environment and more the interrogation and inspection of our customer base the health and quality of the forecast our assumptions on cloud or noncloud movement so a little bit more of a bottoms up set of activity that s driving our q3 q4 outlook jason child senior vice president and chief financial officer the only thing i would add is that obviously dbnrr continues to hold steady at 129 which at our size is certainly something that we feel really good about that continues to hold and then second i would say the renewal pipeline in the second half of the year is always it s always been expected that it s going to continue to grow into q3 and then peak in q4 and because those high retention rates that does definitely provide confidence kirk materne evercore isi analyst that s super helpful thanks jason jason child senior vice president and chief financial officer thank you operator thank you your next question comes from keith bachman with bmo you may proceed with your question keith bachman bmo capital markets analyst hi thank you very much two questions maybe the first one for doug or jason but i wanted to see if you could talk about customer churn and the way i d frame the question is customer churn over the last 12 months versus the previous 12 months and part of the reason i m asking the question there still is an investor perception out there about splunk losing some share and so i wanted to ask it in the context of customer churn and then i have a follow up please doug merritt chief executive officer president and director yes despite what you guys read in here that s not what we re experiencing we continue with very consistent just straight renewal rates on both cloud and term and obviously very consistent dbnrr again that is a cloud based ttm number if we factored in the overall corporate stance it s higher than that because that does take in consideration some of the impacts of the uplift from term of the cloud and we want to get that out so we d have an apples to apples comparison we have been talking about it for a while our health within the top 100 accounts the fortune 100 accounts that s consistent ninety two of the 100 are still are splunk customers i m really intent on making sure those last eight become customers as well i d confuse whether or not but there s reasons for each one of them the number of customers with greater than 1 million right close to 250 cloud customers close to 600 overall customers within the company so it s hard what we see and what we hear from customers definitely is different than some of the i get from you and some of your peers that different analyst firms and others are driving up keith bachman bmo capital markets analyst ok ok jason i wanted to follow up with you on cloud gross margins relatively flat the last three quarters call it lower than total gross margin so what s the movement you think in cloud gross margins as we look out over the next couple of quarters and how should that make us think about the ability to expand your total gross margins if we or excuse me total operating margins as we think about the impact of cloud gross margins as we look into fy 22 thank you jason child senior vice president and chief financial officer sure if you look at well if you heard my comments in the prepared remarks we re expecting continued improvement in cloud gross margin through the back half of this year with an exit rate approaching 70 and then actually went on to say that we expect next year to be 70 to 75 so the reason why it s been kind of stuck for the past few quarters is there s kind of two different aspects there s the splunk kind of cloud gross margin on the core splunk cloud offering which has been steadily increasing but it s been offset by some lower gross margin in the observability suite where we worked over the past couple of quarters to integrate some of the acquisitions and really kind of pull things together and so that work was really largely complete in may and now you ll start to see us focus on overall elasticity which basically means paying for what you need when you need it and that allows us that will allow us to make sure that we re improving our gross margins over the back half of this year and on into next year keith bachman bmo capital markets analyst ok perfect many thanks operator thank you our next question comes from rob owens with piper sandler you may proceed with your question rob owens piper sandler analyst great thank you for taking my question just one from me was curious on the security front relative to competition in the siem market and particularly from the xdr players that hold that they re starting to take share from siems so curious what you re seeing there relative to your offering and the demand picture thanks doug merritt chief executive officer president and director i think like we ve seen with the rest of the security market we did see an uptick in overall security activity as far as purchasing activity expansion from q1 to q2 so it s a really healthy quarter for security as we d all expect given the intensity of what s happening there again kind of a lot of work to say that xdr is replacing siem right now i don t even know how that s logical given the limited data sets they capture and the relative infancy of their offerings right now relative to a siem and from an edr perspective i get it but a siem is very different than that so what we stay focused on is progression of our security suite we had a really big four five months we ve got a full cloud based suite now of soar analytics security analytics siem we re thrilled to add the threat intelligence platform to the offering a lot of feature velocity that was delivered and a lot more that we re focused on for our user conference in october the needs that the top teams have are pretty important right now and we stay very focused on that rob owens piper sandler analyst wonderful thanks for the color doug merritt chief executive officer president and director you bet thanks rob operator thank you and our last question comes from erik suppiger with jmp securities you may proceed with your question erik suppiger jmp securities analyst thanks for taking the question on the competitive front i m curious if there s been any update on the observability front any change there and then secondly can you just comment on the timing for the silver lake investment what was the nature of pulling the trigger when you did doug merritt chief executive officer president and director sure sure so the observability and comparative overall very consistent win loss rates this quarter versus last quarter and observability had actually a slight uptick in our performance versus competitors we recognize that we are a newer entrant in observability and there s a lot of work we have to do to develop the strength there that we have in security and it ops so that is a super super strong focus area for us and remains really exciting as far as the opportunity and our understanding of our unique differentiations and how to compete effectively for silver lake you never really can fully time these things you ve got to have both parties that are open and interested i think the stars and moon lined up where it was appropriate for silver lake to consider this and we were thrilled that they were interested super tight process i think it s the only conversation that we focused on and the value that we ve already seen that ken and lee the firm are adding has been tangible and we re excited about how the partnership that s developing and how they can continue to help us stay focused through the transformation and make sure that we have the same upside that we ve seen in the adobes and the autodesks and a handful of others that have successfully navigated these waters as they come out the other end erik suppiger jmp securities analyst very good thank you doug merritt chief executive officer president and director thanks erik operator thank you i would now like to turn the call back over to doug merritt for any further remarks doug merritt chief executive officer president and director all right thanks josh i just want to thank everyone for joining us today i know there s a lot of new announcements coming out of earnings calls today i want to step back and reiterate how proud i am at the entire splunk team and the impressive execution that we drove across every region it was really really nice to see the company come together under the leadership of our theater leaders our capable theater leaders to deliver that end results the passion grit and resilience to delivery has been absolutely key through a really challenging 18 months as we re all dealing with lots of variables i ll just reaffirm one more time that we re the most comprehensive data platform in the market our customers are benefiting from the rich range of capabilities from the underlying platform as well as the solutions on top we continue to see strong momentum in how our customers are migrating to our cloud services how they re adopting and updating the pricing options that we re putting in front of them data is the oil it is the oxygen these companies need and we re excited to be there to help them with that i also want to highlight that we are to continue to be able to attract and hire the best cloud and tech talent on the planet they re bringing the right expertise to help us capture this massive and growing market opportunity that we re staring at and working hard to make sure we capture effectively and i m more confident than ever in our position and growth outlook so thank you again have a great evening and i look forward to talking to you all in another quarter operator duration 57 minutes call

photo credit karamysh shutterstock when the covid 19 pandemic hit america and sent people fleeing from small apartments in the biggest cities it immediately propelled rent and home prices in opposite directions however despite quickly escalating home prices there are still many places across the country where the typical monthly mortgage payment is on par or below market rent offering opportunities for both prospective home buyers and real estate investors there is plenty of evidence to confirm that homes are indeed getting more expensive especially in relation to rental units just before the start of 2020 home and rent prices were growing at the same rate 3 7 year over year according to the federal reserve s tracking of the urban rent and home price indexes within months however rental costs experienced an uncharacteristic cooling off that slowed growth to less than 2 annually by april 2021 meanwhile the effects of the pandemic nearly quadrupled the growth rate of home prices catapulting it to 14 6 by april 2021 while at first glance these trends might indicate the relative unaffordability of owning when compared to renting record low mortgage rates have dramatically pushed down the monthly costs associated with homeownership long gone are the days of 15 interest rates from the early 1980s they ve been below 5 for an entire decade and at the start of 2021 the 30 year mortgage rate set a new all time record low at 2 65 for potential buyers who have been able to save enough for a down payment or for investors looking to maximize cash flow on a rental property affordable options still exist in a wide range of markets outside of the trendiest destinations like idaho utah and other hotspots in the northwest and northeast market rents are actually higher than the monthly mortgage payment and associated property taxes for a median priced home when factoring in mortgage payments and property taxes compared to rent the range of affordability favoring owners encompasses more than half the nation including all of the south and some states beyond homeowners and investors get the best deal in west virginia where a mortgage payment and property taxes is about half as costly as renting as well as in mississippi and the states surrounding it most of which are more than 30 cheaper to own on a monthly basis even other high growth states like texas and florida register 8 6 and 19 discounts for owners note that the comparison only factors in mortgage payments and property taxes other costs such as insurance hoa fees and maintenance also influence the affordability of owning versus renting or the cash flow associated with a rental property investment but the data serves as a reliable directional indicator of where owning is most comparable or even preferable to renting to find the metropolitan areas where it s cheaper to buy than rent researchers at stessa analyzed data from zillow the u s department of housing and urban development and the u s census bureau they calculated the percentage difference between owner payments for a median priced home and median rent estimates owner payments include the mortgage and associated property taxes based on a current 30 year fixed mortgage with a 20 down payment the result is that homeowners could save as much as 35 in large metros monthly or even more in smaller

the arts are vital to america and many culture groups were hit hard during the pandemic according to brookings institution which reported the sector lost 150 billion in revenue and 2 7 million jobs fortunately washington saw that helping such organizations was needed to revive the country recognizing that the arts matter not only as a key part of the economy but to help people appreciate and better understand the world in central illinois arts groups generate more than 35 million with 1 1 million people attending area events annually as the community word reported in 2019 the government aid has helped many despite difficulties now called the shuttered venue operators grant svog administered by the small business administration sba such aid was initially proposed as save our stages by sens john cronyn r texas and amy klobuchar d minn providing a lifeline for theaters museums dance companies humanities centers etc open to businesses that suffered substantial financial losses it passed and provides about 16 billion in funding to such cultural institutions stephen chilton a board member with the national independent venue association niva said a lot of venues made the decision to hold on instead of close when the aid package was approved civic center general manager rik edgar says they received a svog grant in august we submitted paperwork as soon as we were eligible he says it took several months but we understood it would be a lengthy process with so many venues needing assistance maggie sloter the grants fundraising coordinator at corn stock theatre said it took a week to complete forms furnish photos seating charts lighting details and financial records but they received assistance we applied april 26 we received notification for the grant on july 15 she says it was a long process but we were thrilled to receive the award the area s major independent promoter jay goldberg says he also received help but the process took more than six months the delays were very stressful goldberg says they obviously were not prepared and had several online access issues there were also lots of changes to the rules and qualifications as they got into it and realized all the questions and the unique situations involved some regional venues didn t seek svog help bill butler at the contemporary arts center says they got some paycheck protection program funds which for a while made recipients ineligible and vikki poorman general manager at five points washington also says that s why they didn t apply peoria riverfront museum was fortunate to receive payroll protection program loans in both round 1 2020 and round 2 2021 along with employee retention credits adds museum cfo ruth bittner these programs limited the amount of expenses toward which we would be able to apply a shuttered venue operators grant to the point that the time spent applying for svog would have outweighed what we would have received from it the process didn t go smoothly despite klobuchar originally predicting money should arrive the month after the month of application it took three months after passage that svog s web site went live in april when it crashed and had to shut down hours later applicants couldn t log on or received error messages and eventually found it burdensome and confusing some had to resubmit applications everyone is frustrated chilton said the sba overwhelmed by innumerable applications arriving almost simultaneously as operators competed against each other warned of online fraud which discouraged some applicants adam hartke is another member of niva which complained to congress and he said that some delays stemmed from the svog s version of an irs form giving sba access to tax records it seems as if there s no rhyme or reason hartke told billboard magazine at corn stock long time board member rebekah bourland comments it seems to be so backlogged in so many cases that who knows if it will ever be distributed or distributed in time to float the boats the doesn t have the systems or manpower to take money in and send money out at these volumes months after the hope was offered some venues were still waiting i m frustrated because with niva we ve done our jobs the house and senate have done their jobs they responded to us by voting in this bill montana concert promoter sean lynch told rolling stone but then it was handed off to people who didn t seem to have that urgency things improved in early june only about 127 million had been disbursed and by late june the sba had given out 1 345 awards a fraction of the 10 000 applicants the administration hoped for by july 4 but on aug 9 the sba s office of disaster assistance reported that 8 4 billion had been awarded to 10 826 of 15 872 applicants but now with new covid variants and inadequate vaccinations more than 98 of covid hospitalizations and deaths are unvaccinated according to the associated press any government aid seems invaluable it makes a world of difference says corn stock s sloter the process was not too bad for us just a lot of waiting we were lucky that we didn t have any problems the award makes a world of difference for our organization and we re incredibly thankful civic center gm rik edgar adds the most important element for us was to receive some dollars so we could get back on our feet we are very appreciative for the assistance we received

skip to comments the four reasons real science fails to sway vaccine mandators and otherwise lucid people noq report 08 25 2021 jd rucker posted on by seekandfind with all of the various experiments in play regarding covid 19 the pfizer vaccine experiment should have already been declared a complete and utter failure it performs the worst against the delta variant data indicates it s the first to require a booster shot in order for it to keep delivering the questionable protection it allegedly offers according to vaers it s the deadliest of the shots available in the united states for all of this failure pfizer was awarded this week with fda approval the question we need to answer if we re going to understand what s happening around us is why pfizer of all the drugs is the one getting all of the love from the powers that be as i noted at freedom first network the failures of the pfizer jabs may be their most redeeming quality in the eyes of the powers that be the fact that the cdc and fda are favoring the pfizer drug despite it having lower overall effectiveness against covid 19 should raise alarm bells in fact it should terrify anyone who has received the pfizer jabs because it seems their best value in the eyes of the powers that be is that pfizer s vaccines promise a need for indefinite booster shots it s not like an actual vaccine in which permanent immunity is established in one or two treatments with covid 19 the pfizer shot is the ticket to perpetual boosting if that s the quality the powers that be seek what could their actual motivations be some of us have turned towards conspiracy theories today even if we didn t believe them in the past because the vaccines have made us question the motives of those supposedly leading us governments across the world are turning to mandates as their preferred societal existence this seems to be less about making us medically well and more about keeping constant control over the population let s break down the failures of pfizer thus far this will help us to understand what s driving the great delusion that seems to be spreading to otherwise lucid people first and foremost the rising delta variant is the fearmongering tool du jour data shows that it spreads more easily but is less virulent than other variants but the powers that be are treating it like it s more virulent even if it s a boogeyman the pfizer injections have been unable to keep up with the competition in preventing the delta variant from spreading one pfizer jab offers an abysmal 36 protection it goes up from there with second and third shots but we ll talk more about that shortly second the pfizer vaccines have been attributed to over 3 000 deaths vaers data shows when we consider that somewhere between 1 and 10 of actual adverse reactions are ever reported to vaers that would mean the pfizer vaccines have likely killed between 30 000 and 300 000 americans according to christian news wire however this fda approval does not mean the pfizer shots are safe as evident by the vaers data that shows 595 620 adverse events including 13 608 deaths as of august 13 2021 from the covid injections the deaths in this data includes approximately 3 079 deaths after receiving the pfizer shot regulators also said they determined there are increased risks of myocarditis and pericarditis or heart inflammation following administration of the shot particularly within the seven days following the second dose of the two dose regimen the prescribing information for the pfizer injection also includes the following warnings the observed risk is higher among males under 40 years of age compared to females and older males the observed risk is highest in males 12 through 17 years of age available data from short term follow up suggest that most individuals have had resolution of symptoms however some individuals required intensive care support information is not yet available about potential long term health outcomes in addition the prescribing information also states the most commonly reported adverse reactions include fatigue headache muscle pain chills joint pain fever and injection site swelling third new studies are showing that the pfizer vaccines as well as others have their effectiveness in preventing covid 19 wane after 6 8 months this was noted in a daily beast article though that fact seemed to be quickly injected and dismissed for some reason the article s topic is the fourth and arguably most damning piece of evidence against the pfizer vaccines israel has had 80 of its eligible population inoculated with pfizer accounting for the vast majority of them despite being ultra vaccinated the country has seen a surge in cases that makes no sense to those who believe the vaccines work nevertheless the conclusion seems to be that israel needs more vaccines and booster shots according to the daily beast in june there were several days with zero new covid infections in israel the country launched its national vaccination campaign in december last year and has one of the highest vaccination rates in the world with 80 percent of citizens above the age of 12 fully inoculated covid most israelis thought had been defeated all restrictions were lifted and israelis went back to crowded partying and praying in mask free venues fast forward two months later israel reported 9 831 new diagnosed cases on tuesday a hairbreadth away from the worst daily figure ever recorded in the country 10 000 at the peak of the third wave more than 350 people have died of the disease in the first three weeks of august in a sunday press conference the directors of seven public hospitals announced that they could no longer admit any coronavirus patients with 670 covid 19 patients requiring critical care their wards are overflowing and staff are at breaking point i don t want to frighten you coronavirus czar dr salman zarka told the israeli parliament this week but this is the data unfortunately the numbers don t lie one would think it s crystal clear that the vaccines in general and the pfizer vaccine in particular are not delivering anywhere close to what was promised to the hundreds of millions around the world who have taken their jabs but it isn t at least it s not being acknowledged as being clear the pro vaccine crowd is growing at a time when skepticism and even fear should be setting in we were lied to about the vaccines setting things right and bringing society back to normal we were lied to when they said the vaccines would allow people to regain their freedoms take off their masks and enjoy life like before the pandemic and we re still being lied to about the need to vaccinate everyone in order to beat covid 19 case in point a carnival cruise to belize according to the gateway pundit carnival is pushing back on what they call disinformation and insisted marilyn tackett did not get infected on the ship because she had toured an island about 40 miles off the northern coast of honduras one day before she started having respiratory problems with all of the data pointing to the utter failure of the vaccines especially the now fda approved pfizer jabs why does it seem like the masses are still embracing them if anything we re seeing more exuberance among the vaccinated to get the unvaccinated to either take the jabs or exit society altogether i ve spent a great deal of time contemplating this i ve talked to a few anti vaxx pros i m a newbie to the anti vaxx world some seasoned conspiracy theorists also a newbie to that realm a psychologist a pastor and two pro vaxx friends to all i asked why the science is being ignored four reasons emerged as contributing in some way to the delusion already vaxxed and unwilling to admit a mistake mark twain may or may not have said it s easier to fool people than to convince them that they have been fooled whether he said it or not is irrelevant here because the sentiment is true and fully applicable to the current vaccine debate i had a lengthy text chat with a friend who happens to be a doctor he was vaxxed he s a conservative and has been fighting to prevent mandates because he believes only the most vulnerable should get the shots he s in his 70s and stands by his decision no matter how much evidence i send his way showing that he may have made a mistake he follows up with other vaccine friendly studies to justify his decision topics culture society government news current events keywords antivaxhysteria antivaxxcult conspiracy covid jdmucker jdnutcase mandate nofactsreport notnews pfizer propaganda propagandanotnews science vaccine vaxxx to seekandfind re more than 350 people have died of the disease in the first three weeks of august from the article question to ask were these people who died vaccinated or not the vaccines were supposed to be close to 100 effective at preventing death by covid to seekandfind they didnt get approval for their mrna death shot they got a eua extension for the mrna death shot they also got an approval letter for a vax that doesnt even exist for sale yet the comrity vax to seekandfind again from the article about israel re with 670 covid 19 patients requiring critical care their wards are overflowing and staff are at breaking point how many of these 670 covid 19 patients were vaccinated how many unvaccinated simply telling us that there is a surge in hospitalizations tell us nothing about the efficacy of the pfizer vaccine to seekandfind in israel the health ministry numbers put out late tonight indicating half and half when it comes to the 10 001 new confirmed cases but vaccinated are the close majority of them tomorrow it will on the blog in my post by 5 posted onby nextrush freedom is

put out late tonight indicating half and half when it comes to the 10 001 new confirmed cases but vaccinated are the close majority of them thank you looking forward to your post but please i am not interested in cases i want to know how many percent of the hospitalized are vaccinated and how many percent of recent deaths are vaccinated why am i interested in these numbers because we have been told incessantly here in the usa that our hospitals today especially in the southern states like florida are filled with unvaccinated people so i d like to know if israel s experience mirrors ours and if not what the heck did they do wrong to seekandfind second the pfizer vaccines have been attributed to over 3 000 deaths vaers data shows did he subtract the reported deaths which have nothing to do with the vaccine by 8 posted onby palmer democracy dies six ways from sunday to seekandfind real science otherwise lucid people lucid people know the word thalidomide lucid people know the scientific definition of a vaccine doesn t change due to the marketing efforts of pharmaceutical korporations lucid people know that real science is tested and tested again and again and tested on animals and tested for worse case scenarios uses control groups has multiple reviews of open data etc lucid people know real scientists reveal the source of the virus instead of covering it up lucid people know that science involves recording data such as what medications all test subjects are on before receiving experimental treatments lucid people know that it s critical for scientific experiments to have the consent of the subjects not that they re forced into it lucid people know that science involves controlled doses not situations where individuals can mix and match vaccines from different manufacturers and have even gotten a third shot with fake paperwork because they were worried about the delta strain lucid people know that real scientists would examine test subjects after the first injection and before they took the second lucid people know that real scientific experiments are not carried out in parking lots new york city times square and subway platforms lucid people know that real scientific experiments are carried out by trained professionals not volunteers knocking on doors or going saloon to saloon to inject people lucid people know that science involves controlled doses not situations where individuals can mix and match vaccines from different manufacturers and have even gotten a third shot with fake paperwork because they were worried about the delta strain

seekandfind good question by 11 posted onby nextrush freedom is everybodys business remember pastor niemoller to seekandfind it has been reported several days ago so the numbers may be different today that 85 of the hospitalized in israel have had the clot shot 95 of those in critical care have had the clot shot those two numbers should tell you all you need to know israel brags that they are the most vaccinated nation in the world for wu flu yet with 80 of their population jabbed 85 pf those hospitalized have been jabbed if the jab was worth anything at all the numbers should have been something like just to make an example 5 hospitalized jabbed 95 not jabbed the fact that the hospitalized is almost exactly the same percentage as the jabbed proves that the jab is worthless for its intended purpose the ratio of jabbed protected is the same as the ratio in the general population the same ratio you would get with a roll of the dice and added to that it has unacceptable dangers for many to seekandfind monday the u s food and drug administration fda approved a biologics license application for the pfizer comirnaty vaccine the press reported that vaccine mandates are now legal for military healthcare workers college students and employees in many industries new york city mayor bill de blasio has now required the vaccine for all teachers and school staff the pentagon is proceeding with its mandate for all military service members but there are several bizarre aspects to the fda approval that will prove confusing to those not familiar with the pervasiveness of the fda s regulatory capture or the depths of the agency s cynicism first the fda acknowledges that while pfizer has insufficient stocks of the newly licensed comirnaty vaccine available there is a significant amount of the pfizer biontech covid vaccine produced under emergency use authorization eua available for use the fda decrees that the pfizer biontech vaccine under the eua should remain unlicensed but can be used interchangeably page 2 footnote 8 with the newly licensed comirnaty product second the fda pointed out that both the licensed pfizer comirnaty vaccine and the existing vaccine are legally distinct but proclaims that their differences do not impact safety or effectiveness there is a huge real world difference between products under an eua compared with those that fda has fully licensed eua products are experimental under u s law both the nuremberg code and federal regulations provide that no one can force a human being to participate in this experiment under 21 u s code sec 360bbb 3 e 1 a ii iii authorization for medical products for use in emergencies it is unlawful to deny someone a job or an education because they refuse to be an experimental subject instead potential recipients have an absolute right to refuse eua vaccines u s laws however permit employers and schools to require students and workers to take licensed vaccines eua licensed vaccines have an extraordinary liability shield under the 2005 public readiness and preparedness act vaccine manufacturers distributors providers and government planners are immune from liability the only way an injured party can sue is if he or she can prove willful misconduct and if the u s government has also brought an enforcement action against the party for willful misconduct no such lawsuit has ever succeeded the government has created an extremely stingy compensation program the countermeasures injury compensation program to redress injuries from all eua products the program s parsimonious administrators have compensated under 4 of petitioners to date and not a single covid vaccine injury despite the fact that physicians families and injured vaccine recipients have reported more than 600 000 covid vaccine injuries at least for the moment the pfizer comirnaty vaccine has no liability shield vials of the branded product which say comirnaty on the label are subject to the same product liability laws as other u s products when the centers for disease control and prevention s cdc advisory committee for immunization practices places a vaccine on the mandatory schedule a childhood vaccine benefits from an generous retinue of liability protections but licensed adult vaccines including the new comirnaty do not enjoy any liability shield just as with ford s exploding pinto or monsanto s herbicide roundup people injured by the comirnaty vaccine could potentially sue for damages and because adults injured by the vaccine will be able to show that the manufacturer knew of the problems with the product jury awards could be astronomical pfizer is therefore unlikely to allow any american to take a comirnaty vaccine until it can somehow arrange immunity for this product given this background the fda s acknowledgement in its approval letter that there are insufficient stocks of the licensed comirnaty but an abundant supply of the eua pfizer biontech jab exposes the approval as a cynical scheme to encourage businesses and schools to impose illegal jab mandates the fda s clear motivation is to enable pfizer to quickly unload inventories of a vaccine that science and the vaccine adverse events reporting system have exposed as unreasonably dangerous and that the delta variant has rendered obsolete americans told that the pfizer covid vaccine is now licensed will understandably assume covid vaccine mandates are lawful but only eua authorized vaccines for which no one has any real liability will be available during the next few weeks when many school mandate deadlines occur the fda appears to be purposefully tricking american citizens into giving up their right to refuse an experimental product while the media has trumpeted that the fda has approved covid vaccines the fda has not approved the pfizer biontech vaccines nor any covid vaccines for the 12 to 15 year age group nor any booster doses for anyone and fda has not licensed any moderna vaccine nor any vaccine from johnson johnson so the vast majority of vaccines available in the u s if not all remain unlicensed eua products here s what you need to know when somebody orders to get the vaccine ask to see the vial if it says comirnaty it s a licensed product if it says pfizer biontech it s an experimental product and under 21 u s code 360bbb you have the right to refuse if it comes from moderna or johnson johnson marketed as janssen you have the right to refuse the fda is playing bait and switch with the american public but we don t have to play along if it doesn t say comirnaty you have not been offered an approved vaccine comment 14 removed by moderator to seekandfind how many of these 670 covid 19 patients were vaccinated how many unvaccinated and they really

holding 17 different factors steady in a complex statistical analysis of more than 2 million conventional mortgage applications for home purchases we found that lenders were 40 more likely to turn down latino applicants for loans 50 more likely to deny asian pacific islander applicants and 70 more likely to deny native american applicants than similar white applicants lenders were 80 more likely to reject black applicants than similar white applicants these are national rates in every case the prospective borrowers of color looked almost exactly the same on paper as the white applicants except for their race the industry had criticized previous similar analyses for not including financial factors they said would explain disparities in lending rates but were not public at the time debts as a percentage of income how much of the property s assessed worth the person is asking to borrow and the applicant s credit score the first two are now public in the home mortgage disclosure act data including these financial data points in our analysis not only failed to eliminate racial disparities in loan denials it highlighted new devastating ones we found that lenders gave fewer loans to black applicants than white applicants even when their incomes were high 100 000 a year or more and had the same debt ratios in fact high earning black applicants with less debt were rejected more often than high earning white applicants who have more debt lenders used to tell us it s because you don t have the lending profiles the ethno racial differences would go away if you had them said josé loya assistant professor of urban planning at ucla who has studied public mortgage data extensively and reviewed our methodology your work shows that s not true we sent our complete analysis to industry representatives the american bankers association the mortgage bankers association the community home lenders association and the credit union national association they all criticized it generally saying the public data is not complete enough to draw conclusions but did not point to any flaws in our computations blair bernstein director of public relations for the aba acknowledged that our analysis showed disparities but that given the limitations in the public data we used the numbers are not sufficient on their own to explain why those disparities exist in written statements the aba and mba criticized the markup s analysis for not including credit scores and for focusing on conventional loans only and not including government loans such as those guaranteed by the federal housing administration and department of veterans affairs isolating conventional loans from government loans is common in mortgage research because they are different products with different thresholds for approval and loan terms government loans bring people who wouldn t otherwise qualify into the market but tend to be more expensive for the borrower even the federal reserve and consumer financial protection bureau the agency that releases mortgage data separate conventional and fha loans in their research on lending disparities authors of one academic study out of northeastern and george washington universities said they focus on conventional loans only because fha loans have long been implemented in a manner that promotes segregation as for credit scores it was impossible for us to include them in our analysis because the cfpb strips them from public view from hmda data in part due to the mortgage industry s lobbying to remove them citing borrower privacy when the cfpb first proposed expanding mortgage data collection to include the very data that industry trade groups have told us is vital for doing this type of analysis credit scores debt to income ratio and loan to value ratio those same groups objected they didn t want the government to even collect the data let alone make it public they cited the risk of a cyberattack which could reveal borrowers private information these new data fields include confidential financial data several large trade groups wrote in a letter to the cfpb including the aba and mba consequently if this sic data are inadvertently or knowingly released to the public the harm associated with re identification would be even greater government regulators do have access to credit scores the cfpb analyzed 2019 hmda data and found that accounting for credit scores does not eliminate lending disparities for people of color in addition to finding disparities in loan denials nationally we examined cities and towns across the country individually and found disparities in 89 metropolitan areas spanning every region of the country in charlotte where crystal marie and her family searched for a home lenders were 50 more likely to deny loans to black applicants than white ones with similar financial profiles in other places the gap was even larger black applicants in chicago were 150 more likely to be denied by financial institutions than similar white applicants there lenders were more than 200 more likely to reject latino applicants than white applicants in waco texas and to reject asian and pacific islander applicants than white ones in port st lucie florida and native american applicants in minneapolis were 100 more likely to be denied by financial institutions than similar white applicants there it s something that we have a very painful history with said alderman matt martin who represents chicago s 47th ward redlining the now outlawed practice of branding certain black and immigrant neighborhoods too risky for financial investments that began in the 1930s can be traced back to chicago chicago activists exposed that banks were still redlining in the 1970s leading to the establishment of the home mortgage disclosure act the law mandating the collection of data used for this story when you see that maybe the tactics are different now but the outcomes are substantially similar martin added it s just not something we can continue to tolerate who makes these loan decisions officially lending officers at each institution in reality software most of it mandated by a pair of quasi governmental agencies freddie mac and fannie mae were founded by the federal government to spur homeownership and now buy about half of all mortgages in america if they don t approve a loan the lenders are on their own if the borrower skips out and that power means fannie and freddie essentially set the rules for the industry starting from the very beginning of the mortgage approval process fannie and freddie require lenders to use a particular credit scoring algorithm classic fico to determine whether an applicant meets the minimum threshold necessary to even be considered for a conventional mortgage currently a score of 620 this algorithm was developed from data from the 1990s and is more than 15 years old it s widely considered detrimental to people of color because it rewards traditional credit to which white americans have more access it does not consider among other things on time payments for rent utilities and cellphone bills but will lower people s scores if they get behind on them and are sent to debt collectors unlike more recent models it penalizes people for past medical debt even if it s since been paid this is how structural racism works said chi chi wu a staff attorney at the national consumer law center this is how racism gets embedded into institutions and policies and practices with absolutely no animus at all potentially fairer credit models have existed for years a recent study by vantage score a credit model developed by the big three credit bureaus to compete with fico estimated that its model would provide credit to 37 million americans who have no scores under fico models almost a third of them would be black or latino yet fannie and freddie have resisted a steady stream of plaintive requests since 2014 from advocates the mortgage and housing industries and congress to update to a newer model even the company that created classic fico has lobbied for the agencies to adopt a newer version which it said expands credit to more people a lot of things that minorities and underserved borrowers are doing responsible financial behaviors are going under the radar said scott olson executive director of chla a trade group representing small and midsized independent mortgage lenders fannie s and freddie s regulator and conservator the federal housing finance agency continues to allow the companies to stick with classic fico more than five years after ordering them to study the effects of switching to something newer the fhfa has also expressed concern about the cost and operational implications if they would have to continually test new credit scoring models neither of the companies would answer questions from the markup about why they still require classic fico they ve been testing alternate scores for years and i don t know why the process is taking so long said lisa rice president and ceo of the national fair housing alliance a consortium of hundreds of fair housing organizations well deserving consumers are being left behind fannie s and freddie s approval process also involves other mysterious algorithms automated underwriting software programs that they first launched in 1995 to much fanfare about their speed ease and most important fairness using a data base as opposed to human judgment can avoid influences by other forces such as discrimination against minority individuals and red lining peter maselli then a vice president of freddie mac told the new york times when it launched its software now called loan product advisor a bank executive told congress that year the new systems were explicitly and implicitly color blind since they did not consider a person s race at all in their evaluations but like similar promises that algorithms would make colorblind decisions in criminal risk assessment and health care research shows that some of the factors fannie and freddie say their software programs consider affect people differently depending on their race or ethnicity these include in addition to credit histories the prospective borrowers assets employment status debts and the size of the loan relative to the value of the property they re hoping to buy the quality of the data that you re putting into the underwriting algorithm is crucial said aracely panameño director of latino affairs for the center for responsible lending if the data that you re putting in is based on historical discrimination then you re basically cementing the discrimination at the other end research has shown that payday loan sellers usually place branches in neighborhoods populated mainly by people of color where bank branches are less common as a result residents are more likely to use these predatory services to borrow money this creates lopsided incomplete credit histories because banks report both good and bad financial behavior to credit bureaus while payday loan services only report missed payments gig workers who are people of color are more likely to report that those jobs are their primary source of income rather than a side hustle they re using for extra cash than white gig workers having multiple sources of income or unconventional employment can complicate the verification process for a mortgage as crystal marie and eskias mcdaniels learned considering an applicant s assets beyond the down payment which lenders call reserves can cause particular problems for people of color people with fatter bank accounts present a lower risk because they can more easily weather a setback that would leave others unable to pay the mortgage but largely due to intergenerational wealth and past racist policies the typical white family in america today has eight times the wealth of a typical black family and five times the wealth of a latino family people of color are more likely to have smaller savings accounts and smaller or nonexistent stock portfolios than white people this is a relatively new world of automated underwriting engines that by intent may not discriminate but by effect likely do said david stevens a former president and ceo of the mortgage bankers association now an independent financial consultant not even home valuations are free from controversy the president of the trade group representing real estate appraisers who determine property values for loans recently acknowledged that racial bias is prevalent in the industry and launched new programs to combat it any type of data that you look at from the financial services space has a high tendency to be highly correlated to race said rice of the national fair housing alliance in written statements fannie said its software analyzes applications without regard to race and both fannie and freddie said their algorithms are routinely evaluated for compliance with fair lending laws internally and by the fhfa and the department of housing and urban development hud said in an email to the markup that it has asked the pair to make changes in underwriting criteria as a result of those reviews but would not disclose the details this analysis includes a review to ensure that model inputs are not serving as proxies for race or other protected classes chad wandler freddie s director of public relations said in a written statement he declined to elaborate on what the review entails or how often it s done no one outside fannie and freddie knows exactly how the factors in their underwriting software are used or weighted the formulas are closely held secrets not even the companies regulator the fhfa appears to know beyond broad strokes exactly how the software scores applicants according to stevens who served as federal housing commissioner and assistant secretary for housing at hud during the obama administration the markup s analysis does not include decisions made by fannie s and freddie s underwriting algorithms because while lenders are required to report those decisions to the government the cfpb scrubs them from public mortgage data arguing that including them would likely disclose information about the applicant or borrower that is not otherwise public and may be harmful or sensitive lenders ultimate mortgage decisions are public however borrowers names are not reported to the government and addresses are not in the public data fannie and freddie declined to answer our questions about why their algorithms decisions are excluded from the public data but said in a 2014 letter to the cfpb that the revelation could allow their decision making algorithms to be reverse engineered loan officers say the software s decisions are mysterious even to them when you run so many deals through the automated system you ll look at one deal that didn t get an approval and you just know that that s a better client than someone else that might ve gotten approved said ashley thomas iii a broker and owner of la top broker inc a minority owned real estate agency and brokerage in south los angeles that lack of transparency in the technology is very concerning the community home lenders association sent a letter to fannie and freddie in april complaining about unannounced changes to both of their underwriting software programs that members discovered when applicants who had previously been approved suddenly were denied scott olson executive director of chla said there s no good reason to keep lenders in the dark the more transparent the more clear the guidance is the easier it is for borrowers to know what they need to do to be in a position to qualify earlier this month and weeks after we began asking about its algorithms fannie announced in a news release that it would start incorporating on time rent payments in its loan approval software starting in mid september when we asked about the timing of that change spokesperson katie penote emailed the markup a statement saying the company wanted prospective borrowers to have this option as soon as possible but was silent about what prompted it in addition to using fannie s or freddie s software many large lenders also run applicants through their institutions own underwriting software which may be more stringent how those programs work is even more of a mystery they are also proprietary when we examined the reasons lenders listed for denying mortgages in 2019 the most common reason across races and ethnicities with the exception of native americans was that applicants had too much debt relative to their incomes when lenders did list credit history as the reason for denial it was cited more often for black applicants than white ones in 2019 33 versus 21 when we examined the decisions by individual lenders many denied people of color more than white applicants an additional statistical analysis showed that several were at least 100 more likely to deny people of color than similar white borrowers among them the mortgage companies owned by nation s three largest home builders the two principal laws forbidding housing and lending discrimination are the 1968 fair housing act and the 1974 equal credit opportunity act an alphabet soup of federal agencies can refer evidence of violations of these laws to hud or the justice department for investigation but referrals have dropped precipitously over the past decade marcia fudge who took over hud leadership earlier this year told axios in june that part of the reason black ownership rates are so low in america is that we have never totally enforced the fair housing act in an email hud press secretary meaghan lynch told the markup that fudge intends to tackle systemic discrimination in the housing and credit markets that is at the heart of the racial homeownership gap we do have laws that explicitly protect against discrimination and yet you still see these disparities that you re finding so that suggests that we need better enforcement of existing laws and more investigations said kevin stein deputy director of the california reinvestment coalition agencies need to do a better job of ferreting out discrimination and taking serious action once they find it another key housing law the federal community reinvestment act cra of 1977 allows the federal government to penalize lenders who fail to invest in low income or blighted neighborhoods but makes no requirements regarding borrowers race stein s group has lobbied for the law to be reformed lenders who violate fair lending rules can be punished with fines in the millions of dollars rep al green a texas democrat has sponsored legislation wending its way through congress that would make it a crime to engage in lending discrimination banks already have laws that punish people who commit fraud he said you can be imprisoned for i hope you have your seatbelt on 30 years why not have some similar law that deals with banks who are invidiously discriminating against people who are trying to borrow money and some fair lending advocates have begun to ask whether the value system in mortgage lending should be tweaked as an industry we need to think about what are the less discriminatory alternatives even if they are a valid predictor of risk said david sanchez a former federal housing finance agency policy analyst who currently directs research and development at the nonprofit national community stabilization trust because if we let risk alone govern all of our decisions we are going to end up in the exact same place we are now when it comes to racial equity in this country crystal marie mcdaniels said whatever effect race may have had on her denial it wasn t overt i m not sure you ever really know because there s no klansmen in our yard or anything but it s definitely something we always think about she said it s just something that we always understand might be a possibility the lender loandepot denied race had anything to do with the decision the company s vice president of communications lori wildrick said in an email that the company follows the law and expects fair and equitable treatment for every applicant we take the issues raised by ms mcdaniels very seriously and are conducting a thorough review of her concerns crystal marie said buying a house was crucial for her because she wants to pass on wealth to her son someday giving him an advantage she never had so when the loan officer told her the deal wasn t going to happen she refused to give up with the help of their real estate agent and multiple emails from her employer on her behalf she and her husband eskias pushed back against the denial around 8 p m on the night before the original closing date crystal marie got an email from the lender you re cleared to close she still doesn t understand how the lender went from a no to a yes but she was relieved and elated it means so much to me as a black person to own property in a place where not that many generations ago you were property said crystal marie who said she is descended from slaves in neighboring south carolina she said her family has always had a fraught relationship with money some relatives were so mistrustful of banks that they d insisted on dealing only in cash she said making it impossible to build up credit or wealth for future generations it s meant so much she said that we were able to go through this process and finally eventually be successful

holding 17 different factors steady in a complex statistical analysis of more than 2 million conventional mortgage applications for home purchases we found that lenders were 40 more likely to turn down latino applicants for loans 50 more likely to deny asian pacific islander applicants and 70 more likely to deny native american applicants than similar white applicants lenders were 80 more likely to reject black applicants than similar white applicants these are national rates in every case the prospective borrowers of color looked almost exactly the same on paper as the white applicants except for their race the industry had criticized previous similar analyses for not including financial factors they said would explain disparities in lending rates but were not public at the time debts as a percentage of income how much of the property s assessed worth the person is asking to borrow and the applicant s credit score the first two are now public in the home mortgage disclosure act data including these financial data points in our analysis not only failed to eliminate racial disparities in loan denials it highlighted new devastating ones we found that lenders gave fewer loans to black applicants than white applicants even when their incomes were high 100 000 a year or more and had the same debt ratios in fact high earning black applicants with less debt were rejected more often than high earning white applicants who have more debt lenders used to tell us it s because you don t have the lending profiles the ethno racial differences would go away if you had them said josé loya assistant professor of urban planning at ucla who has studied public mortgage data extensively and reviewed our methodology your work shows that s not true we sent our complete analysis to industry representatives the american bankers association the mortgage bankers association the community home lenders association and the credit union national association they all criticized it generally saying the public data is not complete enough to draw conclusions but did not point to any flaws in our computations blair bernstein director of public relations for the aba acknowledged that our analysis showed disparities but that given the limitations in the public data we used the numbers are not sufficient on their own to explain why those disparities exist in written statements the aba and mba criticized the markup s analysis for not including credit scores and for focusing on conventional loans only and not including government loans such as those guaranteed by the federal housing administration and department of veterans affairs isolating conventional loans from government loans is common in mortgage research because they are different products with different thresholds for approval and loan terms government loans bring people who wouldn t otherwise qualify into the market but tend to be more expensive for the borrower even the federal reserve and consumer financial protection bureau the agency that releases mortgage data separate conventional and fha loans in their research on lending disparities authors of one academic study out of northeastern and george washington universities said they focus on conventional loans only because fha loans have long been implemented in a manner that promotes segregation as for credit scores it was impossible for us to include them in our analysis because the cfpb strips them from public view from hmda data in part due to the mortgage industry s lobbying to remove them citing borrower privacy when the cfpb first proposed expanding mortgage data collection to include the very data that industry trade groups have told us is vital for doing this type of analysis credit scores debt to income ratio and loan to value ratio those same groups objected they didn t want the government to even collect the data let alone make it public they cited the risk of a cyberattack which could reveal borrowers private information these new data fields include confidential financial data several large trade groups wrote in a letter to the cfpb including the aba and mba consequently if this sic data are inadvertently or knowingly released to the public the harm associated with re identification would be even greater government regulators do have access to credit scores the cfpb analyzed 2019 hmda data and found that accounting for credit scores does not eliminate lending disparities for people of color in addition to finding disparities in loan denials nationally we examined cities and towns across the country individually and found disparities in 89 metropolitan areas spanning every region of the country in charlotte where crystal marie and her family searched for a home lenders were 50 more likely to deny loans to black applicants than white ones with similar financial profiles in other places the gap was even larger black applicants in chicago were 150 more likely to be denied by financial institutions than similar white applicants there lenders were more than 200 more likely to reject latino applicants than white applicants in waco texas and to reject asian and pacific islander applicants than white ones in port st lucie florida and native american applicants in minneapolis were 100 more likely to be denied by financial institutions than similar white applicants there it s something that we have a very painful history with said alderman matt martin who represents chicago s 47th ward redlining the now outlawed practice of branding certain black and immigrant neighborhoods too risky for financial investments that began in the 1930s can be traced back to chicago chicago activists exposed that banks were still redlining in the 1970s leading to the establishment of the home mortgage disclosure act the law mandating the collection of data used for this story when you see that maybe the tactics are different now but the outcomes are substantially similar martin added it s just not something we can continue to tolerate who makes these loan decisions officially lending officers at each institution in reality software most of it mandated by a pair of quasi governmental agencies freddie mac and fannie mae were founded by the federal government to spur homeownership and now buy about half of all mortgages in america if they don t approve a loan the lenders are on their own if the borrower skips out and that power means fannie and freddie essentially set the rules for the industry starting from the very beginning of the mortgage approval process fannie and freddie require lenders to use a particular credit scoring algorithm classic fico to determine whether an applicant meets the minimum threshold necessary to even be considered for a conventional mortgage currently a score of 620 this algorithm was developed from data from the 1990s and is more than 15 years old it s widely considered detrimental to people of color because it rewards traditional credit to which white americans have more access it does not consider among other things on time payments for rent utilities and cellphone bills but will lower people s scores if they get behind on them and are sent to debt collectors unlike more recent models it penalizes people for past medical debt even if it s since been paid this is how structural racism works said chi chi wu a staff attorney at the national consumer law center this is how racism gets embedded into institutions and policies and practices with absolutely no animus at all potentially fairer credit models have existed for years a recent study by vantage score a credit model developed by the big three credit bureaus to compete with fico estimated that its model would provide credit to 37 million americans who have no scores under fico models almost a third of them would be black or latino yet fannie and freddie have resisted a steady stream of plaintive requests since 2014 from advocates the mortgage and housing industries and congress to update to a newer model even the company that created classic fico has lobbied for the agencies to adopt a newer version which it said expands credit to more people a lot of things that minorities and underserved borrowers are doing responsible financial behaviors are going under the radar said scott olson executive director of chla a trade group representing small and midsized independent mortgage lenders fannie s and freddie s regulator and conservator the federal housing finance agency continues to allow the companies to stick with classic fico more than five years after ordering them to study the effects of switching to something newer the fhfa has also expressed concern about the cost and operational implications if they would have to continually test new credit scoring models neither of the companies would answer questions from the markup about why they still require classic fico they ve been testing alternate scores for years and i don t know why the process is taking so long said lisa rice president and ceo of the national fair housing alliance a consortium of hundreds of fair housing organizations well deserving consumers are being left behind fannie s and freddie s approval process also involves other mysterious algorithms automated underwriting software programs that they first launched in 1995 to much fanfare about their speed ease and most important fairness using a data base as opposed to human judgment can avoid influences by other forces such as discrimination against minority individuals and red lining peter maselli then a vice president of freddie mac told the new york times when it launched its software now called loan product advisor a bank executive told congress that year the new systems were explicitly and implicitly color blind since they did not consider a person s race at all in their evaluations but like similar promises that algorithms would make colorblind decisions in criminal risk assessment and health care research shows that some of the factors fannie and freddie say their software programs consider affect people differently depending on their race or ethnicity these include in addition to credit histories the prospective borrowers assets employment status debts and the size of the loan relative to the value of the property they re hoping to buy the quality of the data that you re putting into the underwriting algorithm is crucial said aracely panameño director of latino affairs for the center for responsible lending if the data that you re putting in is based on historical discrimination then you re basically cementing the discrimination at the other end research has shown that payday loan sellers usually place branches in neighborhoods populated mainly by people of color where bank branches are less common as a result residents are more likely to use these predatory services to borrow money this creates lopsided incomplete credit histories because banks report both good and bad financial behavior to credit bureaus while payday loan services only report missed payments gig workers who are people of color are more likely to report that those jobs are their primary source of income rather than a side hustle they re using for extra cash than white gig workers having multiple sources of income or unconventional employment can complicate the verification process for a mortgage as crystal marie and eskias mcdaniels learned considering an applicant s assets beyond the down payment which lenders call reserves can cause particular problems for people of color people with fatter bank accounts present a lower risk because they can more easily weather a setback that would leave others unable to pay the mortgage but largely due to intergenerational wealth and past racist policies the typical white family in america today has eight times the wealth of a typical black family and five times the wealth of a latino family people of color are more likely to have smaller savings accounts and smaller or nonexistent stock portfolios than white people this is a relatively new world of automated underwriting engines that by intent may not discriminate but by effect likely do said david stevens a former president and ceo of the mortgage bankers association now an independent financial consultant not even home valuations are free from controversy the president of the trade group representing real estate appraisers who determine property values for loans recently acknowledged that racial bias is prevalent in the industry and launched new programs to combat it any type of data that you look at from the financial services space has a high tendency to be highly correlated to race said rice of the national fair housing alliance in written statements fannie said its software analyzes applications without regard to race and both fannie and freddie said their algorithms are routinely evaluated for compliance with fair lending laws internally and by the fhfa and the department of housing and urban development hud said in an email to the markup that it has asked the pair to make changes in underwriting criteria as a result of those reviews but would not disclose the details this analysis includes a review to ensure that model inputs are not serving as proxies for race or other protected classes chad wandler freddie s director of public relations said in a written statement he declined to elaborate on what the review entails or how often it s done no one outside fannie and freddie knows exactly how the factors in their underwriting software are used or weighted the formulas are closely held secrets not even the companies regulator the fhfa appears to know beyond broad strokes exactly how the software scores applicants according to stevens who served as federal housing commissioner and assistant secretary for housing at hud during the obama administration the markup s analysis does not include decisions made by fannie s and freddie s underwriting algorithms because while lenders are required to report those decisions to the government the cfpb scrubs them from public mortgage data arguing that including them would likely disclose information about the applicant or borrower that is not otherwise public and may be harmful or sensitive lenders ultimate mortgage decisions are public however borrowers names are not reported to the government and addresses are not in the public data fannie and freddie declined to answer our questions about why their algorithms decisions are excluded from the public data but said in a 2014 letter to the cfpb that the revelation could allow their decision making algorithms to be reverse engineered loan officers say the software s decisions are mysterious even to them when you run so many deals through the automated system you ll look at one deal that didn t get an approval and you just know that that s a better client than someone else that might ve gotten approved said ashley thomas iii a broker and owner of la top broker inc a minority owned real estate agency and brokerage in south los angeles that lack of transparency in the technology is very concerning the community home lenders association sent a letter to fannie and freddie in april complaining about unannounced changes to both of their underwriting software programs that members discovered when applicants who had previously been approved suddenly were denied scott olson executive director of chla said there s no good reason to keep lenders in the dark the more transparent the more clear the guidance is the easier it is for borrowers to know what they need to do to be in a position to qualify earlier this month and weeks after we began asking about its algorithms fannie announced in a news release that it would start incorporating on time rent payments in its loan approval software starting in mid september when we asked about the timing of that change spokesperson katie penote emailed the markup a statement saying the company wanted prospective borrowers to have this option as soon as possible but was silent about what prompted it in addition to using fannie s or freddie s software many large lenders also run applicants through their institutions own underwriting software which may be more stringent how those programs work is even more of a mystery they are also proprietary when we examined the reasons lenders listed for denying mortgages in 2019 the most common reason across races and ethnicities with the exception of native americans was that applicants had too much debt relative to their incomes when lenders did list credit history as the reason for denial it was cited more often for black applicants than white ones in 2019 33 versus 21 when we examined the decisions by individual lenders many denied people of color more than white applicants an additional statistical analysis showed that several were at least 100 more likely to deny people of color than similar white borrowers among them the mortgage companies owned by nation s three largest home builders the two principal laws forbidding housing and lending discrimination are the 1968 fair housing act and the 1974 equal credit opportunity act an alphabet soup of federal agencies can refer evidence of violations of these laws to hud or the justice department for investigation but referrals have dropped precipitously over the past decade marcia fudge who took over hud leadership earlier this year told axios in june that part of the reason black ownership rates are so low in america is that we have never totally enforced the fair housing act in an email hud press secretary meaghan lynch told the markup that fudge intends to tackle systemic discrimination in the housing and credit markets that is at the heart of the racial homeownership gap we do have laws that explicitly protect against discrimination and yet you still see these disparities that you re finding so that suggests that we need better enforcement of existing laws and more investigations said kevin stein deputy director of the california reinvestment coalition agencies need to do a better job of ferreting out discrimination and taking serious action once they find it another key housing law the federal community reinvestment act cra of 1977 allows the federal government to penalize lenders who fail to invest in low income or blighted neighborhoods but makes no requirements regarding borrowers race stein s group has lobbied for the law to be reformed lenders who violate fair lending rules can be punished with fines in the millions of dollars rep al green a texas democrat has sponsored legislation wending its way through congress that would make it a crime to engage in lending discrimination banks already have laws that punish people who commit fraud he said you can be imprisoned for i hope you have your seatbelt on 30 years why not have some similar law that deals with banks who are invidiously discriminating against people who are trying to borrow money and some fair lending advocates have begun to ask whether the value system in mortgage lending should be tweaked as an industry we need to think about what are the less discriminatory alternatives even if they are a valid predictor of risk said david sanchez a former federal housing finance agency policy analyst who currently directs research and development at the nonprofit national community stabilization trust because if we let risk alone govern all of our decisions we are going to end up in the exact same place we are now when it comes to racial equity in this country crystal marie mcdaniels said whatever effect race may have had on her denial it wasn t overt i m not sure you ever really know because there s no klansmen in our yard or anything but it s definitely something we always think about she said it s just something that we always understand might be a possibility the lender loandepot denied race had anything to do with the decision the company s vice president of communications lori wildrick said in an email that the company follows the law and expects fair and equitable treatment for every applicant we take the issues raised by ms mcdaniels very seriously and are conducting a thorough review of her concerns crystal marie said buying a house was crucial for her because she wants to pass on wealth to her son someday giving him an advantage she never had so when the loan officer told her the deal wasn t going to happen she refused

said her family has always had a fraught relationship with money some relatives were so mistrustful of banks that they d insisted on dealing only in cash she said making it impossible to build up

joining the call today we achieved strong second quarter results across all metrics marking our fifth consecutive quarter of achieving both revenue and non gaap eps above our guidance we delivered second quarter revenue growth of 12 year over year a second consecutive quarter of accelerating revenue growth billings growth of 13 and rpo growth of 27 from our business performance and building momentum it s clear that enterprises are increasingly making strategic long term decisions on how to support a remote workforce and digital processes while still maintaining a high level of security and compliance policies as a result more customers are turning to the box content cloud to deliver secure content management and collaboration built for this new way of working our strong momentum is best illustrated by our customer deal metrics in the second quarter our net retention rate was 106 up from 103 in the prior quarter we had 74 new deals over 100 000 up 16 year over year and we had a 73 attach rate of suites on deals over 100 000 in the quarter up from 49 in the prior quarter and up from 31 in q2 fiscal 21 we view these strong customer metrics is evident that we are executing on the right product strategy one that is well aligned with the three major changes happening around the future of work and the enterprise first hybrid work is going to be a necessity going forward second digital transformation is driving significant change across all industries and third cyber security and privacy threats are increasing at a growing rate as we ve seen with recent ransomware attacks these trends have major implications for how companies work with their content content is at the heart of how leading life sciences firms discover develop and deliver new drugs and treatment how banks collaborate with an on board new clients or close deals and how consumer product organizations ideate on manufacturer and scale new products whether it s a cad design sales presentation marketing asset research study legal contract or financial data content is our customers business today enterprises have to purchase and integrate a mix of solutions from disparate vendors to solve the entire content management lifecycle this leads to broken processes for users security risk due to the gaps between tools fragmented data and increased cost for enterprise customers our vision for the box content cloud is to integrate empower the complete content lifecycle from the moment content is created through the entire content workflow by leveraging our product leadership and content management our content cloud will continue to extend in the key elements of this lifecycle including e signature content publishing deeper content workflows new collaboration experiences analytics data privacy and advanced security critical to our success is our ability to execute on our product roadmap which expands our total addressable market and adds value to our core platform with new product innovation this is why we were pleased to deliver on our product road map with the launch of box sign to select customers in late july capitalizing on the trend of more transactions moving from paper based manual workflows to the cloud while also addressing an incremental multi billion dollar market box sign was developed through the acquisition of signrequest a leading cloud based electronic signature company and a good example of our disciplined approach to m a our decision to acquire this particular technology versus developing internally was driven by time to market with e signature being the number 1 requested feature from customers last year initial response from customers has been very positive and we are rolling our box sign to all business and enterprise customers throughout this fall with a significant roadmap of innovation ahead also over the quarter we made meaningful updates to our governance functionality to help support customers legal hold and document retention needs as well as new features within box shield to protect the flow of content with advanced machine learning based security features our security compliance data governance and privacy capabilities remain one of the most critical reasons customers choose the box content cloud and our innovation here is only accelerating in addition to these and many other product updates in the quarter we continue to integrate deeply across the saas landscape a key part of our content product value proposition interoperability and strong partnerships with leading technology companies this is critical to our success at scale building on the great work we ve done with so many amazing partners including slack and microsoft in the second quarter we announced a new integration with servicenow legal service delivery application to modernize legal operations which benefit customers by bringing together servicenow s advanced workflow expertise to minimize manual processing while ensuring confidential legal content is secured on box s content cloud and we also announced new and deepened integrations with box for cisco webex and make it easier for customers to work securely and effectively in the cloud and we re just getting started to address our 50 billion plus market opportunity we are building the end to end platform for managing the lifecycle of content and continue to be regarded by customers and analysts as the leading independent vendor for cloud content management of course evolving our product strategy to meet today s enterprise remote and hybrid workforce needs and strengthening our partnerships with leading technology companies are only part of our strategy to drive growth we have also been methodically enhancing our land and expand go to market model to deliver our full platform to our customers to accelerate growth over the past couple of years we ve been actively implementing a number of strategic go to market initiatives including optimizing pricing and packaging improving sales segmentation and territory planning driving efficient marketing programs and pipeline generation increasing sales enablement and doubling down our focus on key verticals such as life sciences and financial services in the federal government and the success of our go to market initiatives and the growing demand for our more advanced capabilities drove our strong suites adoption in the second quarter this is why we ve been working aggressively to sell the full box platform through our suites offering to bring all the box has to offer to our customers we know that when a customer adopts our multi product offerings we see greater total account value higher net retention higher gross margin and a more efficient sales process building on the success of suites in late july we also announced a new simplified product addition for our enterprise customers called enterprise plus which includes shield governance relay platform box sign the ability for large file uploads and enhanced important consulting credits you can see the success of our go to market efforts most clearly when looking at our q2 customer expansion for instance one of the largest banks in the world purchased a seven figure deal with multiple products including keysafe governance relay shield and platform to support new use cases for box including claims processing and loan origination in a more secure virtual environment the bank has also standardized on box for internal and external collaboration an innovative biopharmaceutical company did a six figure expansion with box to support its growing workforce following multiple acquisition to help power its mission to transform the way the drugs are manufactured in the us with box the company s workforce is able to improve collaboration security and gst compliance providing with them with a scalable and secure foundation that allows them to work faster and finally a global leader in energy services that has been a box customer since 2017 expanded its use of box with a six figure ela and the purchase of enterprise plus this will enable them to have a proactive approach to internal threat detection on content be more prescriptive with security controls around content and automate more than a dozen critical business workflows these deals showcase the simplicity and power of our business model we are focused on expanding our customers through additional seed growth by going wider within organizations as well as adding more value through additional feature enhancements and new products that drive up customer value and retention over the past year we have been executing on our strategy to reaccelerate growth while also driving continued operating margin improvements and our results in the second quarter demonstrate that our strategy is working as a result we have raised our guidance for the full fiscal year 2022 and are reiterating our long term target for the 12 to 16 revenue growth and 23 to 27 non gaap operating margin in fy 24 our strong second quarter results and our confidence in our outlook for this fiscal year and beyond are the direct result of the leadership of our board and the hard work and execution we ve been driving as a company i could not be prouder of the team at box and while we still have so much we want to accomplish i am confident that we have the right team and leadership to execute on our strategy and targets going forward as well as a world class board of directors that is focused on and committed to driving enhanced value for shareholders with that i ll turn it over to dylan dylan smith chief financial officer and co founder thanks aaron good afternoon everyone and thank you for joining us as aaron mentioned we are proud to have delivered strong top and bottom line results in q2 we drove an acceleration across key metrics revenue growth net retention and operating profit clearly demonstrating strong business momentum as we build on our content cloud vision revenue of 214 million was up 12 year over year an acceleration from our q1 revenue growth of 11 and above the high end of our guidance our content cloud offerings are increasingly resonating with our customers as shown by the strong suites traction and net retention rate we achieved in q2 as our customers are increasingly adopting products with more advanced capabilities 61 of our revenue is now attributable to customers who have purchased at least one additional product up from 56 a year ago in q2 we closed 74 deals worth more than 100 000 up 16 year over year a record 73 of the six figure deals were sold as a suite up from 49 in q1 and from 31 in the year ago period suites have enabled us to streamline our sales process and drive greater adoption of multi product solutions resulting in customers who are larger stickier and have a greater propensity to expand over time we couldn t be more encouraged by our traction here we ended q2 with remaining performance obligations or rpo of 922 million up 27 year over year an acceleration from the prior quarter s rpo growth rate of 20 and exceeding our revenue growth by 1 500 basis points q2 s rpo growth is comprised of 16 deferred revenue growth and 37 backlog growth demonstrating box s stickiness as we continue to sign longer term agreements to support our customers content strategies we expect to recognize more than 60 of our rpo over the next 12 month q2 billings of 213 million were up 13 year over year and well ahead of our previous expectations to deliver a growth rate in the mid single digit range this billings result reflects the strong sales execution that we saw in the enterprise and smb with both teams generating double digit year over year sales productivity improvement our net retention rate at the end of q2 was 106 up 300 basis points from 103 in q1 this result was driven by strength in customer expansion and a stable annualized full churn rate of 5 based on the strong momentum we re seeing in customer expansion and retention we expect to deliver additional improvement in our net retention rate over the course of this fiscal year turning to margin gross margin came in at 74 5 up 100 basis points from 73 5 a year ago q2 gross profit of 160 million was up 13 year over year exceeding our revenue growth rate we continue to benefit from both our ongoing shift to cloud data centers and the hardware and software efficiencies we re generating in the infrastructure we manage our gross margin expectations for the full year of fy 22 continue to be approximately 74 our ongoing efforts to improve profitability are paying off as we continue to unlock leverage in our operating model q2 operating income increased 47 year over year to 44 million which in turn drove a 500 basis point improvement in q2 operating margin to 20 6 we continue to deliver profitable growth and disciplined expense management this year we ve made significant progress in building out our engineering center of excellence in poland which will help us drive additional operating leverage and efficiencies over time as we transition certain engineering functions away from higher cost california locations this resulted and are delivering 0 21 of diluted non gaap eps in q2 above the high end of our guidance and up from 0 18 a year ago i ll now turn to our cash flow and balance sheet in q2 we delivered cash flow from operations of 45 million up 39 from the year ago period we also generated free cash flow of 30 million a year over year improvement of 124 capital lease payments which we include in our free cash flow calculation were 13 million down from 14 million in q2 of last year for the full year of fy 22 we continue to expect capex and capital lease payments combined to be roughly 7 of revenue as a result we ended the quarter with 779 million in cash cash equivalents and restricted cash we completed our modified dutch auction tender offer at the end of june for an aggregate cost of approximately 238 million and our board subsequently authorized a 260 million share repurchase program as of august 24 2021 we had repurchased 2 9 million shares of class a common stock at a weighted average price of 23 89 for a total of 70 million combined with the modified dutch auction tender we have repurchased a total of 12 2 million shares for a total of 308 million with that i would like to turn to our guidance for q3 and fiscal 2022 as we announced a few weeks ago based on our strong q2 results and our continued business momentum we raised our full year revenue operating margin and eps guidance note that our share count and eps expectations factor in only the shares that we have already repurchased to date while we expect to opportunistically purchase additional shares through the remainder of the year under our ongoing share repurchase program the amount could vary significantly based on market conditions and other factors therefore we re taking a prudent approach and not assuming any future repurchases in our q3 or fy 22 outlook for the third quarter of fiscal 2022 we anticipate revenue of 218 million to 219 million representing 12 year over year growth and a third consecutive quarter of revenue growth acceleration at the high end of this range we expect our non gaap operating margin to be approximately 20 representing a 200 basis point improvement year over year we expect our non gaap eps to be in the range of 0 20 to 0 21 and gaap eps to be in the range of negative 0 09 to 0 08 on approximately 162 million and 154 million shares respectively we expect our q3 billings growth rate to be roughly in line with our revenue growth for the full fiscal year ending january 31 2022 we have raised our full year revenue guidance and we expect fy 22 revenue to be in the range of 856 million to 860 million up 11 year over year this is an increase from last quarter s guidance of 845 million to 853 million and represents an acceleration from last year s revenue growth we expect our non gaap operating margin to be approximately 19 5 representing a 410 basis point improvement from last year s result of 15 4 and a sizable increase over our previous guidance of 18 to 18 5 due to our strong top and bottom line momentum we now expect our fy 22 non gaap eps to be in the range of 0 79 to 0 81 on approximately 166 million diluted shares our gaap eps is expected to be in the range of negative 0 34 to 0 32 on approximately 158 million shares we continue to expect our billings growth rate to be above our revenue growth rate for the full year of fy 22 and for rpo growth to outpace both revenue and billings growth for the full year of fy 22 we will provide further details into our q4 expectations on our q3 earnings call finally our fy 22 revenue growth rate combined with fy 22 free cash flow margin is now expected to be at least 32 an increase over our previous guidance of at least 30 box today is not the box of 2019 our strong q2 performance is the result of the business transformation we began two years ago this year we re delivering both revenue acceleration and increased operating leverage for our shareholders proving that our content cloud platform is resonating with customers we are well on our way to delivering against our previously stated target of 12 to 16 revenue growth and 23 to 27 operating margin in fy 24 two years from now in fy 24 we re also committed to delivering revenue growth plus free cash flow margin of 40 before we conclude i ll hand it back to aaron for a few closing remarks aaron levie chief executive officer and co founder thanks dylan before we open it up to questions we wanted to share that on october 6 we will be hosting 10s of thousands of attendees at boxworks which will be an all digital event for the second year in a row this year will be another incredible event where we ll share more on our vision for the content cloud and we ll showcase major product advancements attendees will also be hearing from an outstanding slate of speakers including the ceos of okta slack and zoom as well as it leaders from enterprises like lionsgate state street usaa and world fuel services among many others q2 was a strong quarter not only in terms of achieving quarterly revenue and non gaap operating results that were above our original guidance but also in our metrics that show the power of our content cloud platform net retention rate billings and rpo growth are all leading indicators that show the success of our strategy not only retaining customers but expand our solutions within our existing customer base to drive revenue growth and operating margin improvements and ultimately shareholder value dylan and i would be happy to take your questions operator questions and answers operator thank you we have our first question coming from the line of brian peterson with raymond james your line is open brian peterson raymond james analyst hi everyone and thanks for taking the questions so wanted to hit on the sales strength with large deals this quarter aaron and dylan could you maybe unpack that a little bit and i d be curious how did that pipeline look for the back of the year because obviously the execution has been strong but what are you seeing in terms of pipeline generation and how are those customer conversations maybe changed a little bit with the suites offer aaron levie chief executive officer and co founder yeah thanks brian this is aaron we are certainly very happy about the q2 and overall the first half results when we look at our big deal metrics and our suites adoption that we ve seen and as we look forward and as i think you can tell evidence in the revenue guide up we re also feeling really confident about the back half of the year and the momentum that we re going to see on suite expansion the large deals that we re now we re not seeing in the pipeline and even within the large deals 100k plus deals in q2 we also saw a very healthy number and an increase on the 500k plus deals as well so so just nice set of trends within the customer base right now that we re seeing and overall customers are fully expanding into our multi product plans and we re going to keep doubling down on that momentum brian peterson raymond james analyst okay and that s a good segue into my next question just how are you guys thinking about incremental go to market investments going forward i know sales productivity has been in focus it looks like that s ramping up just curious how you re thinking about head count investment going forward thanks guys aaron levie chief executive officer and co founder yeah i think the message that we had in the past couple of earnings calls i would say is consistent we re incrementally investing in go to market capacity right now and we certainly saw that in q2 over q1 and i think the key is that we re going to making investments into the highest productivity regions the highest productivity segments the areas where we re seeing increasing momentum but in q2 i think we saw that in a number of a number of areas around the world and across segments so we re really happy about the results and we re going to incrementally invest certainly consistent with our operating margin targets that we ve called out but we want to make sure that we re doubling down in areas of growth rate now that we re seeing brian peterson raymond james analyst thank you operator we have our next question coming from the line of steve enders with keybanc capital markets your line is open steve enders keybanc capital markets analyst okay great thanks for taking my questions just want to get a better sense for what you are seeing out there and on the macro side impressive growth with rpo up 27 and bookings up 39 there but i guess what would you kind of attribute the strength to in the quarter on that front do you think it s more the macro driven in the market is coming toward you or is this a proportion of better sales productivity and better execution on your front aaron levie chief executive officer and co founder yeah thanks steve i think it s it s certainly been many quarters of work to get here and and we also are absolutely seeing very favorable mega trends within our customer base of major moves to the cloud a massive push toward remote and hybrid work significant issues around cyber security challenges and then broad digital transformation tailwinds and so when you add up those thee or four mega tailwinds in our market specifically and then having the right product that we re building out with the right message around the content cloud and then the right team that s able to deliver that product i think all we re just seeing a confluence of events that are certainly contributing to these positive results on the macro front we have seen and i think we ve seen this across our peer group and i m sure all of you have seen it as well the macro environment has certainly improved markedly in the past year from a year ago customers were worried about the shutdowns that they were doing the layoffs that they had to enact and that was causing a decrease in it spending in some sectors of the it environment and a year later with certainly a strong macro environment but more importantly very strong tailwinds in digital transformation and remote work we are absolutely capitalizing on that with again the right team and the right product and then when you get one level even more specific if you look at our multi product plans this is again this has been a couple years of that finally really coming together nicely box shield is performing incredibly well box relay is helping us advance our workflow story having an open platform that customers can build on and integrate with many of our largest deals in the quarter both our 500 000 plus deals and our seven figure deals were customers that were buying into the entire suite of our technology building custom applications and integrating us across their software landscape and fundamentally driving new digital experiences for their employees and their customers and partners so i think we are benefiting from again the right platform and having this content cloud where the market is heading toward dylan smith chief financial officer and co founder and just to build on that a bit this is dylan because you asked about sales productivity is as we ve shared our strategy has really been to focus our go to market and sales in particular investments in the higher performing regions and geographies that strategy is definitely paying off and is the approach that we ll continue to take going forward so for both enterprise and smb in q1 and q2 we saw a strong increase in the percentage of aes achieving quota as well as a strong year on year improvements in sales force productivity so we have been as aaron mentioned incrementally been adding to that sales force and remain on track to grow the size of that sales force in the low teens as a percentage of this year steve enders keybanc capital markets analyst okay perfect great to hear and just on box i know it s only been out for about a month now but i guess what have you seen in terms of adoption or interest within that product so far aaron levie chief executive officer and co founder yeah the interest is absolutely been very strong and overwhelming we are in the midst of rolling the product out to our customers throughout this fall the select customers that we re getting it out to are starting to adopt it i was on a call with a fortune 500 customer yesterday and this was the main topic of conversation was being able to roll out box sign to all of their end users and also through the api so we re seeing a lot of great use cases emerge it s getting us into new conversations it s also helping drive further retention and renewals of customers because customers are getting a fuller suite of functionality in the same platform and when you look at the categories that are adjacent to content sharing and collaboration whether it s advanced data security workflow automation e signature content publishing content analytics you can see multiple categories that our platform is a natural fit to expand into and as we laid out over the past year or so our strategy is to really build out that entire content life cycle in a single architecture and that message is resonating very well right now with customers we re becoming a much more i think strategic vendor for them and we re having much more strategic conversations because of that steve enders keybanc capital markets analyst okay great to hear thanks for taking my question operator we have our next question coming from the line of matthew cox with j p morgan your line is open matthew cox j p morgan analyst hi good afternoon thanks for taking my question dylan on the sales productivity i think you mentioned last quarter you expected the improvement in productivity to ramp at a more measured pace and i just want to dig into this to see did sales productivity truly exceed your expectations this quarter and if so what happened that you may be changed that versus your expectations last quarter dylan smith chief financial officer and co founder sure so last year as a reminder we improved overall sales force productivity by 13 year over year and that was primarily driven by enterprise because of some of the challenges we saw with covid in the smb segment in the middle part of the year in the first half of this year we ve seen even stronger growth in both enterprise and smb so that has outperformed our expectations and to make as aaron had talked about we re really seeing the traction of our newer products boosting that performance as well as a lot of the regions that we ve been investing in outperforming as well and that s what gives us the confidence as we look at the business on a region by region geography by geography basis and continue to grow the sales force and most parts of the business certainly where the productivity trends have been strong and where we are seeing the greatest momentum and suites and large deals so as mentioned we do have more modest expectations for the rate of sales force productivity improvements going forward but we do expect continue improving that metric in both enterprise and smb even as we grow the size of our sales force matthew cox j p morgan analyst got it okay and then can you share how many of your reps are ramped currently maybe versus last quarter or this time last year dylan smith chief financial officer and co founder so well we don t break out the specific numbers but we ll say that we entered this year and have a higher percentage of reps who are ramped versus the same time a year ago especially as in those higher performing regions we tend to see a stronger sales force retention matthew cox j p morgan analyst okay and then last one for me can you help parse the demand that you re seeing now how much of the demand can you attribute to maybe a pent up demand or business that might have normally closed last year or in a more normal environment versus anything where you re seeing a secular surge that might suggest something is truly changing or maybe aaron it s as simple as what you alluded to earlier sort of the multi year effort behind the product strategy is really taking well just trying to figure out what s maybe a pent up versus what s a secularly different aaron levie chief executive officer and co founder sure thanks matt yeah i mean certainly anecdotally even and given my dozens of cio interactions in just the past month or so hundreds in the first half of the year i think we re seeing sustaining trends across the business when i look at the sectors that are buying and expanding financial services life sciences healthcare the technology sector professional services federal government and the trends are remarkably consistent across the cio conversations every single cio whether you re the cio of a 500 person company or a 500 000 person company you re trying to figure out what is the future of your workforce and what s your future of your workplace you know that you re not going to have any analog processes going forward you know that you re not going to have any on premises infrastructure for the most part i mean there s certainly going to be some lag to that but for the most part you re moving to the cloud you know that you re dealing with massive cyber security and ransomware and data privacy challenges and so as you re thinking about this modern architecture you have major vendors that you have to make sure work together you ve got a microsoft stack you ve got a google stack you have a salesforce stack you have a slack stack or a servicenow stack and fundamentally you need a platform that helps you manage content across those technologies and when i look at the trends that we re seeing within our customer base these are long term architectural are architecturally driven trends that we believe will sustain and we re just seeing that talent pick up and that s why again we are really focused on driving this continued performance matthew cox j p morgan analyst thank you both operator we have our next question coming from the line of chad bennett with craig hallum capital your line is open chad bennett craig hallum capital analyst great thanks for taking my question so if we look at rpo non current rpo has grown significantly above from a growth rate perspective current rpo for i think on the order of six quarters now and my guess is in this quarter it was significant in terms of delta between the two you guys have talked about from a strategic selling standpoint moving to suites and getting the sales force comfortable with that and kind of making sure the kind of repeatability of that sale improves in it certainly looks like it did this quarter i guess can you give us an update on how that impacts contract duration obviously you re signing more multi year deals which show up in that longer term rpo number and since the attach rates went up so much this quarter it would be good to get some perspective on where they are now versus a year ago aaron levie chief executive officer and co founder sure so as you see we did generate improvements in all components of what contributes to rpo growth both on a year on year and quarter over quarter basis but your point a lot of that was really due to the outsize backlog growth which was driven by the large multi year contracts the higher volume of those that we re seeing especially as customers are increasingly signing those longer term contracts on average we have seen to your point that that s led contract durations to improve by a little more than a month over the past year because we do see longer contracts as you d expect for our customers who are adopting a more sophisticated solutions and our add on products and so as we see more of these customers adopt suites and move into that category that is one of the big things that s driving that mix shift longer durations and then contributing to the backlog growth as well as overall rpo growth chad bennett craig hallum capital analyst and that increase or impact of a month dylan is there a rough are we at kind of 1 2 1 4 and just in terms of duration these days just for some perspective dylan smith chief financial officer and co founder yeah so it s a little more than a year and a half on average for kind of a total contract duration or average contract duration but again those suites and core plus customers tend to be on multi year deals and so while we also do see some variability quarter to quarter in those in our rpo growth what this is also being driven on it by an arrowhead this is there are some customers who are early renewing their contracts we re setting those for longer durations once they really buy into that broader suite strategy and it s really a function of bigger customers who are betting on us for the long term chad bennett craig hallum capital analyst okay and then just in terms of when you speak of acceleration in the business and in particular revenue growth obviously we want to be conservative in guide and expectations going forward but i mean the secondary metrics have looked really good relative to real time revenue growth let s just say the last two quarters and the guide forecast kind of roughly the same type of growth rate you ve seen this quarter and last quarter in the second half is there anything that i know last year i think this time we re talking about maybe professional services being a headwind and smb being a headwind is there anything in your guide that that s a headwind to the revenue growth rate that we might not be seeing thanks dylan smith chief financial officer and co founder yeah so your point as revenue growth this now reflects the prior 12 months of business performance as the momentum we re not seeing on our business flows through to revenue we do expect to see a continued upward trends over time so ending the year as implied in our guidance for q3 and the full year at a higher growth rate than either our q1 or q2 actuals or q3 guidance and that s really what gives us the confidence in improving our growth rate over time on the headwinds we are continuing to see both from a revenue point of view because it s trailing 12 months some of the impacts of the middle of the year in covid at least from a near term point of view going forward and then we do even now continue to see some pressure on our professional services business so that continues to be a slight headwind to the overall revenue growth chad bennett craig hallum capital analyst great thanks for taking my questions operator thank you the call has now ended i will now turn the call back over to cynthia for any

a longtime manager at dog eared books has bought the locally owned bookstore s second location in san francisco s lgbtq castro district it will be rechristened as fabulosa books next month alvin orloff 59 a gay man who has worked for the bookseller for 21 years is buying the store location from dog eared books queer owner kate rosenberger razo who will continue to operate the store s first location on valencia street she opened the castro store in the summer of 2016 taking over a vacated clothing store space the storefront at 489 castro street had previously been the home of beloved lgbtq focused a different light bookstore from 1986 2011 after a slight remodel of the space orloff will officially open fabulosa books september 15 on his 60th birthday i figured 60 is a good age to start assuming adult responsibility orloff joked in a phone interview with the bay area reporter at a time when many booksellers are struggling two other castro district bookstores aardvark books on church street and books inc on market street closed their doors orloff continues to believe in the necessity of a neighborhood bookstore a castro street without a bookstore is like a day without sunshine said orloff i can t even imagine how horrible it would be for castro street not to have a bookstore i love bookstores i want there to be more of them it is a calling say he has no plans to retire anytime soon said orloff who began discussing purchasing the store from razo in 2019 prior to the start of the covid 19 pandemic but the health crisis which caused the bookstore to close its doors for four months last year and put its future in doubt postponed the sale talks until recently because of my misspent youth i am not in a position to retire anytime soon said orloff for me personally i plan to keep working at least another 10 years this is not the end of my career or my swan song yet razo 60 who close to four years ago married a man she met from mexico told the b a r that it is amazing to have reached a deal for orloff to take over the store as they live near each other she expects to see him often and collaborate with him going forward that was the whole idea to get it into his hands said razo an artist who also owns alley cat books gallería on 24th street in the city s mission district i feel like he paid his dues and he is the right person to have the store i am thrilled it has worked out the sales price for the transaction has yet to be determined as orloff is currently doing an inventory check of the castro bookstore s stock which he will be buying from razo in addition to the store s fixtures he estimated the price would be between 50 000 and 100 000 he has a three year lease with his landlord at a reasonable rate said orloff with an option to renew it for another five years in june 2024 he said that razo has agreed to guarantee the lease during its first year the landlord has been very helpful and understanding said orloff he choose fabulosa as it was a gay slang word from the mid 20th century british idiom known as polari which gay men used as a secret language to skirt anti homosexual laws it is pretty obscure but people into books like obscure things said orloff the word is pretty obviously fabulous but a little more fabulous than the word fabulous the bookstore already feels marvelous under orloff s management said razo he is doing such a beautiful job with that store it is taking on more and more of his personality she said i am thrilled for him and his neighbors i am thrilled for the whole lgbtqia community locally nationally and internationally as the b a r s business briefing column reported in january dog eared books was facing an uncertain future and had launched a gofundme campaign with a goal of raising 50 000 to help it survive it raised just over 27 000 covering its back rent when it was closed to shoppers and also secured federal loans to help keep it open with the castro location s lease coming up for renewal in may orloff had told the b a r that the bookstore was exploring its options from extending its lease to a possible sale to new owners it is probably going to change hands in some form or fashion we don t know how he had predicted with the support of donors local shoppers and the staff s hard work the store was able to survive and has begun to see tourists come back noted orloff in a news release announcing his purchase of the business nothing is more cheering than to see visitors from less tolerant parts of the globe exclaim with wonder at the sight of our gigantic wall of lgbtq books he stated we re very mindful of the fact we re occupying the same space as a different light books which served queer san francisco during the difficult years of the 1980s 1990s and early 2000s as the bookstore sells new used and remaindered books along with stickers buttons posters cards notebooks and magazines as well as buys used books over the counter orloff was asked by the b a r if he considers it to be a lgbtq bookstore let s just say the bookstore said i identify as nonbinary and pansexual we welcome everybody and are looking forward to seeing all your beautiful faces said orloff for now masks are required to be worn by all shoppers who are also asked to remain six feet apart from each other because of the ongoing pandemic in store events are still a ways off from returning and orloff has postponed indefinitely hosting a grand opening celebration for fabulosa books at some point we will definitely have that party he said the bookstore will be open from 10 a m to 9 p m wednesdays through saturdays and from 10 a m to 8 p m sundays and mondays for more information visit www fabulosabooks com help keep the bay area reporter going in these tough times to support local

eia report more oil wells completed petroleum other liquids number of drilled but uncompleted wells declines based on our latest drilling productivity report dpr there were 5 957 drilled but uncompleted wells ducs in all dpr regions in july 2021 the fewest in any month since november 2017 figure 1 the decline in ducs in most major u s onshore oil producing regions most notably the permian region reflects an increase in well completions while new well drilling activity remains low the combination of more wells being completed but fewer wells being drilled is contributing to the return of oil production in the permian region however it is driving the current duc inventories down which could limit oil production growth in the united states in the coming months the two main stages in bringing a horizontally drilled hydraulically fractured well online are drilling and completion the drilling phase involves dispatching a drilling rig and crew who then drill one or more wells on a pad site the next phase well completion is typically performed by a separate crew and involves casing cementing perforating and hydraulically fracturing the well for production in general the time between drilling and completion stages takes several months leading to a natural buildup of ducs which producers can maintain as a set of working inventory to manage oil production of the five major u s oil producing regions ducs in the eagle ford bakken and niobrara have declined to the lowest level on record since december 2013 and ducs in the permian and anadarko regions have declined to the lowest level since june 2018 although the significant reduction in ducs follows an increasing rate of well completions in the permian region both the number of wells drilled and completed in all other regions remain at historically low levels figure 2 given that fewer new wells have been drilled than have been completed in recent months duc inventories may continue to decline based on our latest dpr 393 wells were completed in the permian region in july 2021 at that monthly completion rate the permian region has less than six months of ducs remaining which is approaching the lowest number of months of duc inventory since september 2018 the low months of inventory in the permian region may affect completion activity slowing it down or new well drilling activity speeding it up the length of time between the drilling and completion phases affects the total time it takes to complete a well limited crew availability and delayed delivery of equipment and materials can stretch the time required to complete a well from a few days to more than a year the drilling and production process of an oil well starts with the initial drilling or spudding since 2014 the average spud to completion time has increased in most major oil producing basins in the united states technological complexity including longer horizontally drilled wells during the drilling phase and multistage fracturing during the completion phase has increased since 2014 and has contributed to longer spud to completion times in addition the number of wells that crews simultaneously work on in the completion phase has increased and trade press cites operators claiming a number of higher efficiencies by completing multiple wells simultaneously monthly fracfocus data indicate that an average frack crew in 2021 now works on completing an average of about 2 5 wells at the same time up from 1 8 wells in 2017 and about 1 6 wells from 2014 to 2017 figure 3 based on data from fracfocus we estimate the most likely spud to completion time for all u s oil producing basins in 2019 was 3 0 months up from 1 7 months in 2014 in 2020 the impacts of the covid 19 pandemic led to a sharp decrease in both drilling and completion activities and the most likely spud to completion time increased to 3 5 months as of the latest completion data available for 2021 the most likely spud to completion time increased to 4 2 months indicators of new well drilling in the united states remain subdued as of august 20 the baker hughes active oil rig count was 405 rigs although representing an annual increase of 222 rigs this rig count is historically low compared with other periods when front month crude oil futures prices were near similar levels or at even lower prices figure 4 increases to rig counts typically lag four to six months behind a price increase if drilling activity doesn t increase then well completions and production may be limited as the inventory of ducs continues to fall u s

the midwest price decreased nearly 6 cents to 3 00 per gallon the gulf coast price decreased more than 4 cents to 2 80 per gallon the east coast price decreased nearly 2 cents to 3 02 per gallon the

evacuees await their departure during evacuation operations at hamid karzai international airport kabul afghanistan on aug 22 2021 the military industrial complex in the us has already moved on from the country s failure in afghanistan there is nothing in the united states ignominious withdrawal from afghanistan to compare with the hubris that accompanied their second occupation of afghanistan which was couched in terms of assisting the population the first occupation was to crush al qaida responsible for the sept 11 attacks on the us in 2001 which had been permitted to use afghanistan as a base the second occupation was during the war with iraq when it decided to deny other terror organizations using afghanistan as a base and give the us a central asian pivot from which to control surrounding regions including the middle east about 160 years ago colonial britain had a similar notion it wanted to deny afghanistan as a route to british india for the russians that resulted in the massacre of the british force later punitive expeditions failed to occupy the country the soviet union invaded in 1979 ostensibly to support an afghan communist party under domestic pressure but also with an eye to gain access to a warm weather port oil and minerals that resulted in a forced withdrawal in 1989 the british the russians and the americans all knew very little about afghanistan it was all to do with them rather than the people of afghanistan and that very quickly became apparent with the now well documented consequences the us has an unerring ability to misread the rest of the world particularly those states it feels are inferior the us saw north vietnam as a backward state which could be bombed into submission despite the deployment of 500 000 troops the us lost the war to a far more determined and skilled army which possessed little of the technology available to the us the us came out of that war humiliated its prestige in tatters however its self confidence was soon restored by an array of new military technologies the military industrial complex whispered in the ear of washington that vietnam was an aberration and that the us was a powerful country once more with all the new technology now available to it so it went in hard in kuwait following saddam hussein s invasion that worked the us felt confident again after the sept 11 attacks it followed up with a full scale attack on iraq which created a mess in the middle east faced with these complications the us decided to follow up its earlier mission into afghanistan and reshape the country in its own image to provide a haven for us power in central asia and the middle east the problem for the us was that afghanistan exists as a country only in the minds of major powers and the media to the people that live there it is no such thing tribal groupings and villages are of far greater relevance and the center of their existence the broader notion of country or nation is not a notion they embrace afghanistan is in many ways the creation of colonial boundaries the pathan tribal grouping was arbitrarily divided by a british imperial decision to draw a line through its tribal area it is known as the durand line and was ratified in 1919 the presence of a large number of pathans in pakistan with family friends and commercial ties on the other side of the border gives pakistan a great deal of leverage in the affairs of afghanistan there are four major tribal groupings the pathans constitute around 50 percent of the population and are the dominate tribe they are sunni and comprise the majority of the taliban they oppress and dominate the other tribal groups particularly the hazaras who are shia kabul is and will remain a city state divorced from much of what goes on in the rest of the country we have witnessed the us scrambling out of kabul they have learned little from their other wars and they seem incapable of doing so the military industrial complex will ensure that there is too much money involved the complex props up the american stock exchange war is factored into the us economy the us is a dangerous failing state the us has been forced to leave afghanistan for the same reason it was forced to leave vietnam a lack of objectives and strategic plan which demonstrated it did not know what it was doing they made up reasons to justify the insatiable needs of the military industrial complex until public opinion and the ill discipline and weariness of us and afghan troops forced a decision in addition hubris an over reliance on technology poor intelligence and the topography all added up to a failed venture in military terms the us should have left afghanistan in 2006 or 2007 us prestige has suffered but the complex has moved on to what it sees as a bigger prize china it has been boosting the confidence and egos of us and allied politicians with talk of the inferiority and weakness of the chinese system of government and superiority of western democracies in meeting future challenges a claim that is not upheld in light of their response to the covid 19 pandemic and climate change china is in the sights of the military industrial complex and is a bigger prize than iraq and afghanistan demonization of china by the us and its allies promises the construction of many new planes ships and submarines the military industrial complex is not noted for its social conscience or consideration of the long term consequences nor does climate change figure in its plans for a profitable future the author an australian political commentator author

clients and deepen existing relationships across our market leading franchises our performance reflects disciplined execution of our strategy strong expense control volume growth higher fee based client assets and record investment banking revenue this was partly offset by the expected normalization in global markets revenue and continued pressures from low interest rates we also saw improvements in our macroeconomic outlook and credit quality resulting in significant release of reserves which graeme will speak to later pcl on impaired loans and new gil formations remain at cyclical lows as our well diversified portfolios continue to perform in these uncertain times underpinned by strong underwriting and well defined risk appetite our cet1 ratio increased 80 basis points to 13 6 net of 15 billion of rwa growth this was to support client demand and business growth across our platform we leveraged our franchise and balance sheet strength to generate strong organic growth and an roe of 19 6 this quarter or 19 2 year to date well above our global peers we continue to create long term sustainable value for our shareholders in support of our 17 million clients as underscored by our 12 year over year growth in book value per share and even though regulatory restrictions remain we paid 1 5 billion in common dividends to our shareholders a majority of which are based in canada i will now offer some perspective on the macro environment which we view with cautious optimism in the near term but see growing in strength into 2022 we remain cognizant of the near term challenges to global growth posed by new variants and inconsistent global vaccine rollout supply chain disruption rising geopolitical risk and continued global travel restrictions however we are encouraged by the economy progressing as it reopens based on trends we are seeing in credit card spend on both goods and services and business investment in term assets and in working capital while the momentum that is building could moderate in the near term by rising virus cases even with 75 of the eligible canadian population being vaccinated we believe the foundation of the economy remains solid and we ll manage through the threat of the delta variant as i noted last quarter we are well positioned to leverage the scale and embedded profitability in our core franchises to significantly grow earnings in a more favorable economic scenario which would include rising interest rates higher credit card revolve rates and growth in business lending with or without a rate hike our diversified business model and scale by geography channel product or service is poised to generate strong growth particularly asset growth through cycles and with a consistent risk appetite our success comes from our investments in significant client data and geographic scale this combined with our cross sellability brand and people have produced premium growth in average earning assets and market share gains in our core products in canadian banking we added a market leading 37 billion in mortgages year over year including over 9 billion this quarter and we expect strong mortgage growth to continue albeit at a lower rate than we ve seen over an exceptional last 12 months we are seeing green shoots of growth in our higher yielding canadian credit card and commercial loan portfolios both up quarter over quarter in the u s we are seeing particular strength at city national where we ve added usd 15 billion in loans over the last two years including over usd 5 billion in mortgages the recent launch of a new strategy supporting mid corporate sized companies across the united states is also proving to be successful already booking over usd 1 billion in new commitments over the last few months and the other side of the balance sheet our long term strategy to grow our core deposit business and provide exceptional service and advice continues to succeed over the last year we added 43 billion of personal and business deposits in canadian banking and a further usd 14 billion in deposits at city national our north american wealth management businesses have also been generating strong growth in fee based client assets both sequentially and a year over year basis canadian banking assets under administration were up over 63 billion or 22 year over year partly benefiting from strong equity markets and an increased client preference for investments which i will speak to shortly furthermore canadian wealth management aua increased 23 or 95 billion from last year crossing 500 billion in client assets for the first time rbc global asset management had 35 billion in total net sales over the last 12 months increasing assets under management 13 or over 67 billion year over year to record levels and in u s wealth management we added over usd 115 billion of aua growing client assets 27 year over year and surpassing usd 550 billion for the first time we re continuing to invest in our people to capture a greater share of growth adding managing directors in core investment banking verticals such as technology healthcare and aerospace we re also adding ultra high net worth private banking teams in city national on the east coast along with an expanded presence in our core california markets and in canadian banking our team has added 1 700 employees year over year to capture strong client activity in mortgages commercial banking and investments another differentiated element of our strategy is building ecosystems that go beyond banking to enable rbc to participate in a broader part of the client journey and value chain one example is an increasingly competitive canadian commercial and small business segment several of these capabilities are made in rbc proprietary solutions ownr an rbc venture has helped 45 000 entrepreneurs launch their businesses online including 20 000 year to date with rbc insight edge our business clients can leverage aggregated data to gain relevant insights into their markets to enable them to attract more customers we continue to make investments in building a digital platform with enriched payments and cash management capabilities for our business clients rbc payedge helps our clients save time and money with a secure solution for their account payable process we also launched rbcx a platform to help entrepreneurs scale up their ideas through access to partnerships capital and advice the tech clean tech and life science verticals and to further support the canadian tech ecosystem rbc recently announced the calgary innovation hub while also signing on to become the anchor financial sponsor for hub 350 a new technology park near ottawa and both rbc pay plan and ampli allow us to increasingly partner with merchants across canada to provide even more value to our retail and business clients we have expanded our slate of partners who continue to be a differentiator for rbc and with the recent addition of doordash and financeit it will help attract new clients and create more value for existing clients i ve spoken a lot this morning about our asset generating opportunities also core to our client strategies is a fundamental belief in reciprocity which rewards clients for the depth and breadth of their relationship with us last quarter we provided a number of metrics highlighting our multiproduct relationships the recent launch of rbc vantage further incentivizes the consolidation of our strong client relationships and vantage adds a further retail banking value proposition to our existing investment capabilities such as myadviser direct investing and investees this expanded continuum of offerings allows us to support our clients with advice and solutions to help them make the best decision based on the prevailing macro backdrop the continued low interest rate environment is making it increasingly attractive for our canadian banking clients to shift out of lower yielding gics and savings accounts and putting their money to work into investment products such as mutual funds the related fee based revenue along with higher client savings and card payments rates have been positive for credit quality and risk adjusted revenue metrics helping offset margin pressure and even as we invest in our core client franchises to achieve premium asset growth we remain committed to managing our costs as we ve done in the past this includes implementing a zero based budgeting methodology where we judiciously and consistently reevaluate every cost and activity across the bank to sum up our diversified business model scale financial discipline risk management culture and robust capital position continues to provide the foundation for delivering differentiated client and shareholder value over the long term and we will continue to grow in an inclusive and sustainable way that enables our clients to thrive in our communities to prosper i will now turn it over to rod rod bolger chief financial officer thanks dave and good morning everyone starting on slide 8 we reported quarterly earnings per share of 2 97 up 35 from 2 20 per share a year ago pre provision pre tax earnings of 5 billion were up a solid 6 year over year with strong client driven performance in canadian banking and wealth management non u s along with record investment banking revenue more than offsetting a moderation in capital markets trading revenue as client activity decreased across the industry excluding the impact of foreign exchange and lower interest rates pre provision pre tax earnings were up a strong 10 from a year ago these results yet again highlight the resilience of rbc s diversified business model moving to slide 9 our cet1 ratio of 13 6 was up 80 basis points sequentially including the benefit for model parameter updates net of the increase in svar multipliers guided to last quarter this quarter saw a further 2 billion of net credit upgrades lowering the cumulative net credit downgrades since the start of the pandemic to 8 5 billion and strong internal capital generation net of dividends added nearly 50 basis points of capital this was partially offset by strong client driven business growth across our largest segments going forward we expect rwa to continue to grow given the client driven organic opportunities dave highlighted earlier i also wanted to give an update on our initial analysis of the impact of the upcoming basel changes we expect the net impact of the reforms to be moderately favorable as the benefit from the implementation of the guidelines in 2023 are partly offset by adverse market risk impacts under the fundamental review of the trading book coming into effect in 2024 moving on to slide 10 net interest income was down year over year excluding trading revenue net interest income was up 6 from last year as strong client driven volume growth in canadian banking and city national more than offset continued margin pressures canadian banking nim decreased 4 basis points from last quarter largely due to competitive pricing pressures in mortgages and changes in asset mix city national nim was down 10 basis points relative to last quarter largely due to the dilutive impact of a lower loan to deposit ratio with excess deposits being deployed into low yielding short term securities although nim was lower in each business largely due to mix more importantly net interest income was up at least 5 year over year in each business going forward we expect all bank net interest income excluding trading results to continue to increase year over year as strong volume growth more than offsets moderating margin pressures turning to slide 11 while we don t anticipate short term rates to increase in the near term both canadian banking and city national are well positioned to benefit when they do rise partly because nearly half of the deposit base has near 0 rates looking forward we expect 25 basis point increase in the short term interest rates the long end of the curve unchanged would increase canadian banking net interest income by 90 million and u s wealth management revenue would increase by another usd 80 million in this scenario including the benefits from our sweep deposits turning to slide 12 higher noninterest income net of insurance fair value change was largely driven by strong growth in our higher roe investment management and mutual fund revenue streams this quarter also saw a shift in the revenue mix in capital markets strong loan syndication and m a fees boosted underwriting advisory and credit fees this was offset by a decline in global markets revenue higher service charges and card service revenue reflected the benefits of higher client activity in canadian banking on slide 13 noninterest expenses were well controlled up only 1 year over year largely due to higher variable compensation on stronger wealth management revenue partly offset by lower compensation on reduced capital markets revenue and market related movements in our u s wealth accumulation plan excluding growth in variable share based compensation and the impact of fx expenses were up 1 5 year over year partly due to higher salary and benefit costs non compensation costs declined largely due to lower facility and cleaning costs this was partly offset by higher technology and equipment costs as well as higher marketing and travel expenses from prior year lows we are cognizant that some of these discretionary costs could start to increase as economies begin to open back up and as we implement new client acquisition strategies and as dave noted we will continue to execute on the zero based budgeting program while continuing to invest in our people and technology to drive revenue growth moving to our business segment performance beginning on slide 14 personal and commercial banking reported earnings of over 2 1 billion up 55 mainly on lower pcl canadian banking pre provision pre tax earnings were up a strong 13 from last year canadian banking revenue was up 8 year over year partly due to volume driven growth in net interest income noninterest revenue was up largely due to higher mutual fund distribution fees underpinned by very strong aua growth well controlled canadian banking expenses up 2 from last year combined with strong revenue growth drove operating leverage of 6 this quarter and 3 year to date on average we expect operating leverage to remain at or above the higher end of our annual 1 to 2 historical guidance over the next four to five quarters based on current economic projections turning to slide 15 wealth management reported record quarterly earnings of 738 million up 31 from last year pre provision pre tax earnings were up a strong 16 robust client asset growth across our wealth management franchises was underpinned by both constructive markets and higher net sales this in turn drove strong double digit growth in mutual fund and investment management revenue in addition strong volumes drove 9 year over year growth in city national net interest income in u s dollars or up 5 excluding the benefit from ppp loans which is expected to moderate in the fourth quarter rbc gam attracted net sales of over 10 billion in the quarter with institutional flows into money market mutual funds adding to continued strength in canadian long term retail net sales which added nearly 6 billion to aum as with recent quarters the majority of retail flows went into balance and equity mandates turning to insurance slide 16 net income of 234 million increased 8 from a year ago primarily due to the impact of new longevity reinsurance contracts lower claims costs and the favorable impact of actuarial adjustments these factors were partially offset by the impact of realized investment gains a year ago turning to slide 17 investor treasury services reported net income of 88 million up 16 from an even more challenged quarter last year funding and liquidity revenue increased from low levels last year and lower interest rates continue to drive deposit margin compression negatively impacting client deposit revenue turning to slide 18 capital markets reported earnings of over 1 billion for a third straight quarter and pre provision pre tax earnings of over 1 billion for the seventh quarter in a row corporate investment banking reported record investment banking revenue strong loan syndication and m a advisory fees were driven by robust deal flow and higher industry fee pools recall last year we also included recoveries in loan underwriting marks following the sawing of leveraged loan markets global markets revenue normalized from recent elevated levels down 31 year over year due to lower client activity ficc trading results were down 35 year over year as tightening credit spreads last year drove mark to market gains as well as robust activity in our spread business macro products were also down from last year which benefited from elevated market volatility lower spreads and elevated market liquidity and lower balances continue to impact our repo and secured financing business equities results were down 20 from last year underpinned by lower levels of market volatility going forward we see a solid pipeline of m a advisory mandates equity issuance activity is also expected to remain solid but lower than peaks experienced in the first half of the fiscal year we anticipate debt origination and trading activity will continue to normalize from recent peaks but remain above pre pandemic levels in summary we continue to exhibit strong momentum across our core franchises and we are well positioned to accelerate our growth trajectory while remaining focused on expense management and with that i ll turn it over to graeme graeme hepworth chief risk officer thank you rod and good morning everyone starting on slide 20 allowance for credit losses on loans of 4 9 billion was down 658 million compared to last quarter this includes 638 million release of reserves and performing loans primarily in capital markets and the canadian banking cards and personal lending portfolios the release reflects improvements in both our macroeconomic outlook as well as the credit quality of our portfolio during the quarter we have now released about 40 of our pandemic related reserve build with acl of 0 67 of loans and acceptances down from its peak of 0 89 in q4 of last year our level of allowances remains well above pre pandemic levels given the ongoing uncertainties associated with the covid 19 delta variant and a conclusion of the significant government support that has benefited both consumers and businesses turning to slide 21 our gross impaired loans of 2 6 billion were down 216 million or 5 basis points during the quarter impaired loan balances decreased across all our major businesses and new formations of 293 million were at nine year lows this quarter muted new formations in canadian banking are due in part to ongoing government support programs as noted earlier on capital markets clients continue to benefit from active debt and equity markets providing strong access to capital and the improving macroeconomic environment turning to slide 22 pcl on impaired loans of 146 million or 8 basis points was down 3 basis points from last quarter and has trended lower in each of the last five quarters in the canadian banking retail portfolio pcl of 136 million was down 25 million from last quarter with decreases across all products with the exception of our residential mortgage portfolio where pcl was flat quarter over quarter and remains at its lowest level in more than five years in the canadian banking commercial portfolio pcl of 25 million was down 9 million from last quarter the credit quality of the commercial portfolio is strong with sustained low delinquency rates positive net credit migration and reductions in our watch list exposures in capital markets we had a net recovery for the second consecutive quarter the net recovery of 16 million was due to pcl reversals in the real estate and related and oil and gas sectors partly offset by a provision in the transportation sector our strong performance on credit continues to be a reflection of the quality of our client base the diversification of our portfolios and our prudent underwriting practices with government restrictions easing and companies starting to return employees to premises i d like to provide an update on our commercial real estate portfolio on slide 23 our portfolio is well diversified by geography business segment and property type as i noted in prior quarters the retail segment of this portfolio has been most impacted by covid 19 restrictions rent collection has been most challenged for enclosed malls which will face closures and reduced foot traffic however our exposure to enclosed malls is limited and the loans were well structured heading into the pandemic as for the office segment of this portfolio we have not seen material changes in rent collection or occupancy rates however the outlook for the office segment remains uncertain as companies will need to balance remote work capabilities with physical distancing requirements and the need for more space per employee when in the office the remaining segments of this portfolio where a majority of our exposure sets have not been materially impacted by covid 19 we continue to monitor the portfolio and are carefully managing exposure to the retail and office segments to conclude we are pleased with the positive trends in our credit portfolio that we are seeing as the economy recovers we have seen pandemic related government restrictions easing and significant progress on vaccine distribution which has contributed to the strong credit performance this quarter while pandemic related uncertainty has declined translating into a larger lease of reserves on performing loans this quarter uncertainty does remain elevated due to a rise in cases of the covid 19 delta variant this could impact the timing and pace of the economic recovery we do however remain adequate provision for expected increase in delinquent season impairments in 2022 and that we believe will result in 2022 pcl on impaired loans trending above our long term average however as i noted last quarter we expect to be able to draw down on the remaining balance of our unperforming loans we built in 2020 such that our total pcl across all stages will remain below long term averages and with that operator let s open the lines for q a questions answers operator thank you and the first question is from ebrahim poonawala from bank of america thank you for your patience please go ahead ebrahim poonawala bank of america merrill lynch analyst good morning i was wondering if we could maybe dave address just your view around the housing market as you think about obviously it s become a big election issue with the ban on foreign buyers being promised just talk to us in terms of how given just your mortgage business has been very strong how you see the housing market today and do you see the appropriate policy responses coming through to kind of make housing affordable especially in the metro markets dave mckay president and chief executive officer yes thanks for that question i ll say a few comments and neil who s also very close to the issue i ll ask to make a few comments so we look at the structural elements of the housing industry in canada on a monthly basis we have a lot of stats we track on supply demand and supply demand imbalances those obviously continue to persist where you have a shorter supply and highly stimulative demand marketplaces from all the things we talked about low rates consumer preference changes and lack of general supply as i talked about an inability to fill that gap quickly so obviously price increases are part of this and as an employer in the major metropolitan areas we certainly worry about the cost of housing and the effects on our employees and our ability to attract talent to the country and to the cities where we operate one of the reasons why we created the calgary hub for technology is to diversify our employee base across the country and access talent in different marketplaces so to your question the rising cost of housing have an impact on all employers or cost of operating and our ability to operate the way we want to and therefore we re starting to make the moves like you saw in calgary to diversify our areas we don t worry about the quality of our credit book it s well adjudicated there s good equity positions still one third of it is insured therefore we re confident in the cash flows and the stress test and the policies that have gone into changing those stress tests to make sure adjudication is solid so this is more a long term macroeconomic issue and where i do worry ebrahim to your point is the more cash flow that consumers are putting into housing stock the less is available to drive the economy so i think all policymakers are worried partly as well about long term economic drag from that much cash flow going into servicing housing so those are all elements that lead us to think about policy for the country and policy that keep tries to keep everything in balance from an economic growth perspective from a cost of living perspective from an attractiveness and quality of life perspective we re all trying to keep those things in balance so i think it s important that we look at policy initiatives that try to balance the needs of canadians and the prosperity of canadians and the happiness of canadians so with that i ll pass it to neil neil mclaughlin group head personal and commercial banking thanks dave ebrahim the only other thing i would add is i think just if we focus on our mortgage business and the underwriting of that business i mean i think b20 has been a positive for the industry a lot more granularity on the different segments and transactions in the book the stress test i think is built in confidence that there is resiliency there i think the in terms of the supply demand imbalance maybe just a couple of other points to build on dave s i think more recently you ve started to see the supply side start to get more airtime i would say that s something that does need a lot more focus we have a very i think a very strong immigration policy but a big portion of those that new household formation comes from newcomers so we see what s driving it beyond some of the things i would say that are maybe more macro in nature some of the things that could be shorter term we get a lot of feedback from some of canada s largest developers that are more cooperative municipal set of policies could help them actually increase bringing more supply to market so that may be a tactical thing that could be done but i think the supply side is something we need to be talking more about ebrahim poonawala bank of america merrill lynch analyst got it helpful color thank you operator thank you the next question is from meny grauman from scotiabank please go ahead meny grauman scotiabank analyst hi good morning dave you touched on the macro outlook in your opening remarks but to put a finer point on it if i think back to the call last quarter you made a very bullish case for the recovery and for royal s ability to really take advantage of that recovery and i m wondering given the delta variant things have evolved is there any change in your outlook anything you would highlight that s different now than it was when we were speaking i guess it was early june dave mckay president and chief executive officer i think net net when you think over the medium term as i said through 2022 we re still equally as positive about the opportunity for the economy to grow to accelerate beyond where it was in 2019 we re seeing that economic activity progressed nicely right we look at our credit card spend we look at the activity levels that are now above 2019 we re starting to see draws on our operating working capital lines so that was the green shoots i referred to all symbols of confidence returning we re seeing term asset lending start to grow we ve seen our authorized credit book increase i think almost 10 so you re seeing all the signs of economic confidence what s going to happen with the delta variant it may pause things for a month or two as we have to work through and make sure we don t overwhelm the health system it s a little concerning to see the numbers but we re always starting to see in other parts of the world a little bit of a turn on the delta variant so we ll manage through this with 75 of vaccination rates we don t expect we re going to have to shut down the economy the way it was last year early in 2021 so we should have every ability to manage through this given what we ve achieved so far and therefore i think you re talking months of maybe slowing return to work slowing the full reopening of some of our service sector until we deal with this governments will make that decision but that will not i think upend the majority of the momentum we have so still very positive about the continued progress on reopening the economy through the next 12 to 24 months meny grauman scotiabank analyst thank you operator thank you the next question is from scott chan from canaccord genuity please go ahead scott chan canaccord genuity analyst good morning i m just looking at the new canadian banking slide that you provided on slide 6 and it s just on the revenue yield showing stable the nir offsetting the nim pressure so just on the nir side on the yield what kind of factors are kind of driving that and is the message that the nir is more stable or that could potentially increase over time as well rod bolger chief financial officer yeah thanks for that question scott the nim is obviously a factor of the what you re paying on the deposits as you well know and what you re receiving on the loan so the mix has been a significant driver of our overall nim and the nir as you referenced and so as we continue to grow mortgage at an elevated rate that will naturally come down because those products because they re secured and well underwritten tend to have a lower rate with the client but as the green shoots happen that dave talked to and we start to see credit card balances come up and we start to see commercial balances come up we would expect that to start to bottom out and then start to increase again and that will help nim overall bottom out an increase again but importantly because the volume growth is so strong and because the deposit growth is so strong and it s very low costing the net interest income has bottomed out and it has been growing and will continue to grow scott chan canaccord genuity analyst and what about on the nir side is that also forecasted or expected to increase like it has over the past year neil mclaughlin group head personal and commercial banking got it it s neil mclaughlin i ll jump in yeah i think what we re trying to get across there is on the other income side really good growth year over year i think a reflection of the diversification just what we have in terms of the retail bank strong growth in mutual fund trailer fees our new client acquisition over the last couple of years paying off in higher service charges we re starting to see a little bit of bounce back in fx our direct investing business obviously benefiting from the macro trends there so i think the message here is there is a strong contributor in other income and that s i think really it s while nii is up 5 nims are down obviously but between the 2 i think that s we re just trying to decompose the overall revenue contribution scott chan canaccord genuity analyst got it thank you very much operator thank you the next question is from sohrab movahedi from bmo capital markets please go ahead sohrab movahedi bmo capital markets analyst yeah thanks that s actually a great segue to my question i guess neil there is also a slide in here that talks about beyond banking for the canadian business so you re not attributing any of the fee income or other income results in your segment to these initiatives over here listed on page 5 neil mclaughlin group head personal and commercial banking yeah i mean i think what we re really trying to get to there in terms of our strategy is two things we d say really our continual focus is the value for money we re providing clients and our distribution to be able to get in front of more clients year over year what we re really trying to lay out here is we re starting to play upstream and downstream in terms of the clients value chain and an example here with ownr that dave talked about we are seeing an increase in new small business accounts related to our investment in ownr and really pleased with the trajectory really pleased with our ability to turn those new business registrations into rbc customers so that would be one example another example around the value play is rbc insight edge you see there this is an example where we re taking our data and we re turning that into new value in terms of being able to tell a merchant a b2c business client more about who their consumers are mis that they wouldn t usually have that we can then provide them on a confidential sorry on an anonymized basis but those are a couple of examples as you get in sort of further down the value chain there rbc payedge that was something else dave touched on this was a product we developed and really built out after our 2019 acquisition of a small company called waypay and what this does is it automates the accounts payable and reconciliation process so again taking another part of that entrepreneurs business and really simplifying it so they can save costs and drive more convenience so those are the types of things that you start to see represented on this slide and our confidence in terms of the strategy just continues to grow sohrab movahedi bmo capital markets analyst neil if i can just have a follow up is it fair to say then that the benefits of these initiatives listed under the beyond banking slide primarily first of all accrue to your business number one number two they accrue probably both in terms of top line growth but maybe even efficiency improvements i suppose an operating leverage but most importantly through increased customers which ultimately in a kind of concentrated mature space i guess what i m trying to figure out is how much of it is growing the pie how much of it is increasing your share of the pie and is this primarily a market share grab or benefit or gain or win in canadian banking and how much bigger can you get i suppose neil mclaughlin group head personal and commercial banking yeah great question so something like ownr would be what we think about as top of the funnel so that would be driving new clients an example like insight edge there is a fee revenue stream that comes off of that as we charge those merchants as you move down into the rbc payedge the other example i used or in payplan which is another value proposition we re putting into merchants hands this is fee income and so there is i would say a share of wallet and another income contribution from both of those so it is really both dave mckay president and chief executive officer this is dave i think that s the key it s both attracting more clients and new clients as i mentioned 20 000 new clients on the small business side this year alone we could also show you an ecosystem like this in home equity and in everyday payments and shopping so we gave you an example of a well constructed ecosystem and our business and commercial side but this is obviously a big part of the strategy we articulated at investor day four years ago that s really coming to life to drive both client acquisition but also an expansion of fee opportunity and new revenue streams to the bank sohrab movahedi bmo capital markets analyst thank you all operator thank you the next question is from gabriel dechaine from national bank financial please go ahead gabriel dechaine national bank financial analyst good morning a couple of quick ones here one on expense the outlook there for rod up 1 down 1 in the noncomp variable comp category is that focus on that number like is that one where you re continuing to grind it down over the next 1 5 years or whatever or do we start to see a ramp up and then on the discount brokerage side could you quantify the revenue exposure there where we re seeing some competition on the commission rates rod bolger chief financial officer i ll start thanks gabe i ll start on the expenses and hand off to neil for the discount for the i m sorry for direct investing so on the expenses yes i mean this is a continuation of our cost management program of our efficiency initiatives we look to spend dollars where it makes sense to continue to grow market share to continue to invest in distribution we think that s one of the key reasons why we re growing market share in our core businesses and that s not only people but also technology and we will continue to do that but we re also going to continue to as you refer to grind down other costs in an effective way as we digitize and leverage that technology we expect other cost growth to moderate now is it going to be negative or zero for five straight quarters after it s been negative or 0 for the last five straight quarters unlikely it s probably going to have a little bit of uptick on that but it s not going to grow wildly it s not going to get up to mid single digits it s going to be lower single digits and then the rest of the expenses will flow in accordance with variable compensation for our financial advisors for our managing directors and whatnot and for our employees at large so that i think is the outlook for expenses and i ll hand it off to neil for direct investment neil mclaughlin group head personal and commercial banking sure thanks gabriel yeah in terms of the competition we re seeing there i mean we ve seen one more player go to 0 on commissions we have another player in the market who s already there the announcement this week was some was from a player who has a very very small market share as we look at again the focus on value for money for our customers we feel there is good value in the rbc direct investing platform in terms of the toolsets we have there the top tier research one of the few to provide free streaming quotes so i think the value is there i think one of the differences is also we look at the investment market on a holistic basis so between doug s business and ours between the branch retail customer a di customer to a ds customer or the robo offering we have value propositions in every portion of that market a large portion of our direct investing customers are also banking customers so again the value comes from what they re paying for trade but a good portion of those also participate in the rbc vantage program and they re actually receiving discounted banking fees for that so another way that we re delivering value so i think those are the things we re focused on we ll obviously watch the market but we re committed to having a strong value proposition in every space of that market and in terms of what that would mean for us i mean i wouldn t say as we look forward this is not a material part of the retail bank s revenue line gabriel dechaine national bank financial analyst so it sounds like you re going to rush to follow that pricing strategy thanks dave mckay president and chief executive officer we ll move on to next question thanks operator thank you the next question is from doug young from desjardins capital markets please go ahead doug young desjardins capital markets analyst hi good morning just on the credit card business as balances are up quarter over quarter still down year over year but i m curious the percent of clients that are paying down balances monthly today versus pre pandemic and so how much of the growth is coming from the revolver side and maybe given the higher liquidity might the rebound on the net interest income from higher current balances lag is that a fair assumption and then maybe if i can tag on something else in terms of what you re doing or what you re seeing from a buy now pay later trend perspective and how if you feel that s a threat i believe you ve done some stuff in that marketplace maybe you could talk a little bit about your thoughts on that as well thank you neil mclaughlin group head personal and commercial banking sure so in terms of the card book i mean i think that s the appropriate split is you want to look at it in terms of the two large segments the transactors who are paying their credit card build in full every year where the focus is really on the fee side as well as interchange those transactors are driving disproportionately this increase in spending and they re also driving disproportion of the increase in what you re seeing in terms of balances on the revolver side we actually have seen that mix actually the percentage of revolvers come down versus pre pandemic and a direct correlation to the stimulus in the economy and the conversations we ve had about the average canadian just having more in their deposit accounts so there has been a segment that used to pay us interest that no longer pays us interest i would say the timing of when that comes back i think is obviously really hard to predict but i would say your point on it will you expect it to lag is absolutely right i mean when we look at it the encouraging signs dave touched on is spending is up even versus 2019 and he talked about categories i think last quarter that everything was up except for travel and dining we re seeing dining get fairly close to those 2019 levels and while travel isn t there it s really spiked since sort of mid may so a lot of positive signs so the effective yield on the portfolio is down and that s part of our nim story in terms of buy now pay later what i would say is there are options that clients have and it was a good article in the globe about how this may play out differently in canada than other markets you re already seeing a number of credit card issuers launch capability for clients to select almost any transaction over a certain threshold and be able to term that out i think that will play out differently in canada but we do look at buy now pay later as something that merchants have said this is a value and they want to have it particularly in their digital properties and that s really what led us to launch payplan so we re participating on both sides of that equation and really look at it as more so not a real headwind for our lending business but more so a value proposition merchants are going to expect doug young desjardins capital markets analyst thank you operator thank you the next question is from lemar persaud from cormark securities please go ahead lemar persaud cormark securities analyst thanks so i have a more of a big picture question i don t think i d be sitting here talking about royal delivering a near 20 roe while holding 13 6 in common equity tier 1 capital but here we are is there any reason you think that a 20 roe wouldn t be sustainable going forward i appreciate there s a number of big puts and takes normalized credit environment but on the plus side potential return of capital so i guess where i m going at is maybe can you talk to me about where you see roe for royal playing out over the longer term thank you dave mckay president and chief executive officer thanks for that question it s obviously something that we think about as well i can give you maybe some of the bigger drivers of positive and negative to those roes and we can talk about the ranges we obviously see roes well above our medium term objectives so some of the positives as we ve talked about on the call already are higher yielding asset growth such as credit card revolve rates coming back credit card spend with all the revenue drivers the nim stabilization the nim expansion being really positive for roe particularly in canadian banking but also city national you can t underestimate the impact and we have inserted the interest rate sensitivities on city national balance sheet of the impact on our revenues of the year over year rate decreases so i think as those come back as rates come back those are all positive drivers for roes on our existing balance sheet and our existing capital base so if you don t have to put more capital against a return of revenue that s obviously roe enhancing our very strong fee based revenue generation and the mix that we have which is market leading is again really positive for roes the strong investment banking pipeline we have and our goal to continue to advise clients and generate fees off our existing balance sheet and generate more turns to that balance sheet than we have in the past all are roe enhancing capabilities and obviously as we talked about returning capital to shareholders and through dividend share buybacks are all roe enhancing as we manage that base of excess capital and knowing that if we do make any inorganic play it will certainly be for strong growth and very conscious of any dilution so those are how we re thinking about capital so i would say when you net the tailwinds headwinds our particular franchise has significant opportunity to enhance revenues from the existing deployment of balance sheet in rwa and i think that s we ve earned through that as i ve said almost every call up until q3 quite nicely in those headwinds and therefore when those headwinds become tailwinds are roe enhancing now rod i ll hand it to you to add some more color it s a really important question rod bolger chief financial officer yeah thanks dave dave covered the key core business drivers a couple of things i look at and we have it on the slide one of the first slides book value per share growth of 12 year over year tangible book value of 17 part of that is showing that our organic client driven growth is going to be roe accretive and dave mentioned the city national acquisition and how it accelerated organic growth since then our rwa has had an annual cagr of 3 growth since that acquisition and our eps has grown nearly 12 and so as long as we can continue that velocity of growing earnings and client relationships faster than capital we re going to continue to be accretive to roe but as dave pointed out as you pointed out in your question it s not going to be at this level because we re not going to have big reversals every quarter on pcl so you strip that out and you should see roe in the high teens and with an upward bias lemar persaud cormark securities analyst great thank you operator thank you the next question is from mario mendonca from td securities please go ahead mario mendonca td securities analyst good morning graeme can we please go back to some of the outlook you offered you suggested that impaired loan pcls in 2022 might be above the long term average for royal i think that s how you phrased it if i look at the long term average for royal impaired you re probably talking something like 25 to 30 basis points over the very long term and this year the impaired is only about might only be about 10 basis points so we re talking about a near tripling of impaired loan pcls in 2022 relative to 2021 so to offer that outlook it seems to me that you re seeing something that s encouraging you to call for a near tripling in the impaired loan pcls firstly did i get my numbers right and secondly what might you be seeing graeme hepworth chief risk officer yeah thanks mario for that question i mean yes i think your general numbers are about right i d comment a few things one is i think we talked about in past quarters like there s really three things we ve been looking at here to kind of assess our forecast and uncertainty around those one was progress on vaccines two was the subsequent reopening of the economy and then three was the government support the significant levels of government support and certainly what we ve seen really great progress on those first two points it s that third point that s still a significant out there and will impact the trajectory of loan losses as we head into 2022 part of the debate that we ve seen over the last year is the degree to which that government support defers or mitigate those losses and i think the further that government support goes and the further it goes into the economic recovery it pushes more and more toward mitigate and now it s just deferring those loan losses and so i think there could be a period in 2022 in certain of our portfolio that we will see our loan losses our stage 3 loan losses get up to or around our long term averages but as i said in my comments we have very significant stage 1 and 2 reserves in place right now and that we would expect that really to be offset or funded by releases in stage 1 and 2 so that that kind of totaled mix if you will kind of remains well within our long term averages as you articulated mario mendonca td securities analyst so if we go back then to the notion that the impaired loan losses could be higher in 2022 than the long term average would it be possible for you to highlight what specific product lines you would point us to would it be something like credit cards and personal loans would it be more like commercial or is that just a little too granular at this point in time to comment on graeme hepworth chief risk officer yeah i would more point it toward where we see government support was significant right and so that s going to be in large part more in our personal and commercial businesses where we ve seen significant government support both benefiting consumers as well as businesses we ve seen that factor in significantly along with all the actions that consumers have taken themselves obviously to effectively suppress loan losses to very low levels that we re experiencing right now as we ve noted we ve seen the lowest level of new formations that we ve seen in a long long time and so those are all positive factors in the near term but ones that we don t necessarily expect to see persist over the long term as well recently we ve seen obviously in the wholesale side our pcl our stage 3 pcl has benefited from recoveries right we ve seen recoveries in all three businesses that have kind of again suppressed the near term stage 3 reserves we put in place so again i think some of those will normalize but certainly we re really looking to see how the government support rolls off and how that consumers transition back into the economic recovery how it will impact our loan losses and so we do expect it will rise over 2022 until we get to that point as i indicated and as i said it will be funded in part by our releases in stage 1 and 2 rod bolger chief financial officer let me put another lens on it mario which might help also i guess i don t know if you picked up on this in graeme s comments was this is we still have a significant stage 1 and 2 build since the pandemic and we still have 60 of what we added on our balance sheet and so implicit in that is that we will incur losses on those which means higher stage 3 than what we ve been seeing so if we don t see those losses we would expect to release some of the reserves if we do see some of the losses we would use the stage 1 and 2 against those so i think though what graeme is talking about is implicit in our allowance for loan losses as well mario mendonca td securities analyst ok that s helpful thank you operator thank you and the next question is from ebrahim poonawala from bank of america please go ahead ebrahim poonawala bank of america merrill lynch analyst thanks for taking my question just wanted to follow up dave you spent a lot of time talking about rbc ventures new ways of client acquisition just talk to us i think one of the conversations just from with longer term investors have centered on one what does like a structured open banking framework in canada mean with regards to your grip on the client wallet share like is there a risk to royal and then looking externally does fintech create m a opportunities or partnership opportunities in the u s or in europe for rbc to play a disruptor role as we ve seen with some of the u s big banks trying to do dave mckay president and chief executive officer that s a great question and thanks for coming back on and asking that i ll give a strategic perspective and neil is obviously very active on the strategy and on the policy within canada that s being discussed right now i have to say we are anticipating a more open market we re anticipating disruptive tech platforms that we ve talked about for the last five years and therefore when you think about ventures when you think about ownr you think about these ecosystems we feel they re all designed to compete in this type of marketplace so when we think of open banking the ability to see more clients and attract them through our beyond banking ecosystems we think we re well prepared to compete in an open banking world we ve been preparing for this one of the reasons why create more value for customers is the rallying cry and the core strategy is around wrapping our arms around clients creating value making it very hard through rbc vantage through our partners like doordash and petro canada to pull a client away so we feel really well prepared with how we ve wrapped our clients and value to compete and therefore if we have access to other clients with all the channels we have we think open banking can create a significant opportunity for rbc and we don t fear it so with that neil specifically you worked on policy you worked on the strategy over to you neil mclaughlin group head personal and commercial banking yeah thanks for the question so in canada i mean this has been a file that s been open for quite a few years now and the advisory committee has just now submitted the report to the government but the industry has been working i say very collaboratively to make this come to market faster than some may think we ve already landed as an industry on what s called the fdx standard so we have a format that we can start to put in place to exchange data in a safe and private way i mean i think these are some of the paramount concerns so at the end of the day i d say we are supportive of open banking and look at it as it s something that clients are asking for it s not about being made to do it it s about something that we see clients really having a right in terms of the portability of their data i think it s important to sort of call out if you look at other regions particularly in the u k which was one of the early movers there wasn t in that market a real increase in churn and there hasn t been many markets where you ve really seen a lot more competition i think if that does happen if canada were to play out differently i think we view this as an opportunity a lot more than a risk we look at our value propositions dave spoke to some of the new ones we re bringing to market but our core retail banking value propositions of our product line our ability to reach out to customers and the way we use data now we believe there s a real consolidation of the wallet opportunity in an open banking environment that net net we come out as a winner so i think those are probably the things to take away is that the industry is working together to try to get this to happen and that there s a lot of safety and privacy concerns to get right but it will enable some of the things dave spoke about and if there is more churn then we re ready to get into it ebrahim poonawala bank of america merrill lynch analyst that s helpful and just in terms of when you look at the u s dave is there an opportunity for on the consumer side given like city national is a very niche focus is there an opportunity for oil to place the disruptor role in u s retail banking and on the consumer side dave mckay president and chief executive officer yes it s a great question it s something we ve been thinking about for quite some time i think the key strategic capability you need is a partner that gives you access to those clients it s very straightforward to build a direct to consumer deposit bank but you pay wholesale rates or plus for those deposits that make it very difficult the key is to have an asset generator along with the deposit taker where you need a core strategic partner is the best way to go to market we ve talked to many partners it s still on the strategic table and yes it s something that i could see rbc doing in a direct to consumer way as i said before we do not see ourselves being a mass consumer branch based bank i ll say that again just because i know investors want to hear that but a direct to consumer with a strategic partner is a very effective way to go to market versus a funding model of direct to consumer which is high cost savings is always accessible to us we ve held off given obviously the long deposit position we have right now it s not worth launching that we have it on the shelf ready to go as we ve talked about before so that would be how i would think about direct to consumer strategically in the u s ebrahim poonawala bank of america merrill lynch analyst that s helpful will stay tuned thanks dave dave mckay president and chief executive officer and one more question i think we ll take and then we ll wrap up operator thank you and the final question will be from nigel d souza from veritas investment research please go ahead nigel d souza veritas investment research analyst thank you good morning i just wanted to touch on the risk weighted assets and pcl reversals in the quarter and should we expect those two items to move in tandem so what i m getting at here is as you reassess and lower your probability of default assumptions should we expect that to drive your pcl reversals as well as have a benefit on the rwa side through a lower risk weighting is that the right way to think about it graeme hepworth chief risk officer nigel it s graeme i ll start with that and if rod wants to chip in and he can add to it but they should be correlated but they re not they don t correlate 1 to 1 so the default probabilities that go into rwa are designed to meet regulatory purposes there and so they re really meant to be very long term averages and so what we do reassess those annually they won t change dramatically from year to year we saw obviously a significant shift this year but that was a byproduct of a big investment on our part to kind of reevaluate our methodology there big investment in data to get more granular and then a kind of a one time methodology change ifrs 9 is meant to be more of a point in time estimate of defaults and so that s more of a real time impact that will translate through so directionally they should correlate but they certainly don t correlate 1 to 1 rod bolger chief financial officer yeah the only thing i ll add and then i ll turn it back to david i would expect because that was a one time decrease in our parameters wholesale parameters i would expect rwa to have an upward bias from here as we continue to grow clients and our businesses and i would expect the allowances to have a downward bias as we continue to work through the pandemic and the reserve build that we built since then so with that i ll turn it back to dave dave mckay president and chief executive officer thanks rod maybe i ll just say a few wrap up questions we really appreciate the comments today which thematically we re centered around how you re going to grow how you re going to adapt to a changing world whether it s a policy changing world deal with variants and deliver shareholder value and i think just to reinforce our comments around growth whether it s in canadian banking from cards revolving credit growth well positioned on commercial to have drawdown on lines and more term lending with our existing facilities one thing we didn t mention is one third of all our mortgage volumes are now new clients first time clients to the bank and now we have a unique opportunity to cross sell those clients into rbc vantage into a number of other investment products so a very attractive client and that s different than it was five to 10 years ago where potentially 80 plus percent would have been already existing clients on city national we ve talked about our core commercial capabilities we talked about moving into the mid corporate area and growth in our high net worth core banking are all key abilities for us to continue and a lower risk higher roe core growth that we ve enjoyed now for the last five years we didn t get a chance to talk about canadian wealth today but outstanding results in our asset management business and global asset management and in our canadian wealth franchise capturing a disproportionate share of investment growth in the country whether it s aua or aum and obviously well poised to continue to grow that we ve invested not only in our people but our technology and we re cross selling better off of that so when you look at capital markets and the investment banking pipeline obviously we re really well positioned we didn t get a chance to talk about that today but a really strong pipeline and obviously looking for year over year in our trading businesses it was particularly in ficc it was a difficult year over year adjustment but we hope some of that does come back really strong cost control and i would say on the risk side we don t see anything in the portfolio very strong adjudication and our growth has been increasing in a higher roe lower products particularly mortgages in the u s mortgages in canada which is why we inserted that new slide to give you an idea it s not just the nim but it s the nim after risk adjusted that you have to also be cognizant and what roes are you driving for your organization so when i think about risk our strong ability to manage risk or premium growth investment for growth and we ve got some great questions on ventures today and around the ecosystem beyond banking which will drive not only new customers but are already starting to present new revenue streams for the organization so thank you for a very strong series of questions today i will see you in q4 operator duration 68 minutes call participants nadine ahn head of investor relations dave mckay president and chief executive officer rod bolger chief financial officer graeme
