us president donald trump speaks to reporters in the rose garden of the white house in washington us january 4 2019 reuters jim young washington us president donald trump threatened to keep the us government partially shut for months or years on friday after he and democratic leaders failed to resolve their dispute over trump s demand for 5 6 billion to build a wall on the mexican border after democratic congressional leaders refused trump s requests at a meeting in the white house situation room the republican president threatened to take the controversial step of declaring a national emergency and building the wall without congressional approval trump is withholding his support for a bill that would fully fund the government until he secures money for the wall as a result around 800 000 public workers have been unpaid with about a quarter of the federal government closed for two weeks senate democratic leader chuck schumer said democrats had told trump during the meeting to end the shutdown he resisted schumer said in fact he said he d keep the government closed for a very long period of time months or even years trump confirmed that comment but painted a more positive picture of the meeting the first since a new era of divided government began when democrats took control of the house of representatives on thursday we had a very very productive meeting and we ve come a long way trump said according to a source familiar with the white house discussion trump opened the meeting with a speech that lasted at least 15 minutes in which he insisted on the need for billions of dollars to fund a border wall the source also said trump brought up recent impeachment threats during those remarks arguing that he had notched a strong performance as president and should not be a target for impeachment the president later told reporters that nancy pelosi the new democratic speaker of the house of representatives said democrats were not looking to impeach him national emergency raising the stakes in his tussle with the newly emboldened democrats trump threatened extraordinary measures to build the wall which he says is needed to stem the flow of illegal immigrants and drugs into the united states a reporter asked trump whether he had considered declaring a national emergency to build the wall yes i have and i can do it if i want trump said we can call a national emergency because of the security of our country i may do it but we can call a national emergency and build it very quickly and it s another way of doing it but if we can do it through a negotiated process we re giving that a shot emergency powers have been invoked by previous us presidents during times of war senator jack reed the senior democrat on the senate armed services committee criticized the comments saying in a statement declaring a trumped up national emergency in order to skirt congressional approval is wrong the us constitution assigns congress the power to fund the federal government so trump likely would face legal challenges if he tried to bypass congress on financing the wall building a wall and having mexico pay for it was one of trump s main promises when he ran for president in 2016 trump s wall project is estimated to cost about 23 billion democrats have called the wall immoral ineffective and medieval pelosi said friday s meeting with trump was sometimes contentious but that they agreed to continue talking but we recognize on the democratic side that we really cannot resolve this until we open up government and we made that very clear to the president she said credit rating agency moody s said the shutdown will cause minimal us economic and credit market disruption but there could be a more severe impact on financial markets and the broad economy if the closure is protracted a reuters ipsos opinion poll last week showed that 50 percent of the public blames trump for the shutdown and 7 percent blames republican lawmakers while 32 percent blames democrats in a dec 11 meeting with pelosi and schumer trump said he would be proud to shut the government over the security issue and would not blame democrats he has since said they are responsible white house officials and congressional staffers will meet at 11 am est 1600 gmt on saturday to try to end the impasse white house spokesperson hogan gidley said house republican leader kevin mccarthy told reporters that trump had named vice president mike pence senior aide jared kushner and secretary of homeland security kirstjen nielsen to work over the weekend the partial shutdown is straining the country s immigration system worsening backlogs in courts and complicating hiring for employers federal agencies such as the justice department commerce department and departments of agriculture labor interior and treasury have been hit by the shutdown house ways and means committee chairman richard neal a democrat asked the internal revenue service in a letter on friday to explain the possible effects of the shutdown on the upcoming tax filing season for millions of americans

power equipment was responsible for sparking at least a dozen major fires across northern california in 2017 and now regulators are investigating whether pg e equipment sparked november s camp fire the deadliest and most destructive in state history the company could end up having to pay billions from legal action stemming from the 2017 and 2018 wildfire seasons equity analysts project that pg e

ratepayers so far state regulators and lawmakers have been kept out of pg e s planning loop for project falcon named for a group of peregrine falcons nesting on the roof of the company s headquarters the current and former pg e officials say they re speaking with npr out of concern that senior management is not acting in the best interests of ratepayers safety and the state there s a public trust element in being a utility monopoly said the senior company official bailout pg e is under no legal obligation to disclose its internal discussions about ways to stave off bankruptcy but given the potential impact on ratepayers and taxpayers if the utility eventually needs a bailout michael wara a lawyer and research scholar at stanford university calls the lack of transparency extremely disappointing they need to be thinking very hard about how to create safety for californians rather than how to make money for shareholders when they re not being totally transparent especially in the current context where there s a lack of trust and so many people that have been harmed by pg e s infrastructure wara said what california urgently needs and wants from its utilities right now is hard thinking about how to better protect communities from fire and it s hard to see that going on wara added what california urgently needs and wants from its utilities right now is hard thinking about how to better protect communities from fire and it s hard to see that going on wall street wants to see hard thinking too steve fleishman senior utilities analyst and a managing director at wolfe research said pg e s plan for dealing with fires in the future is unclear they clearly seem to be more at risk for that fleishman said this kind of risk profile is not sustainable pg e s stock is down about 50 percent since the camp fire broke out on nov 8 consumer watchdog groups want any big move done with transparency anything pg e wants to propose should be done in an open public manner and include a comprehensive coherent wildfire mitigation strategy says mark toney the executive director of the utility reform network there is widespread anger in the state over pg e s shoddy safety record protests broke out at recent public oversight meetings and at the company s san francisco headquarters where environmentalists and activists read the names of the more than 100 people combined who died in the camp fire and 2017 s wildfires in napa and sonoma counties at one customer service center the company has installed bulletproof glass serious safety problems in late december state regulators said they were considering several proposals in response to ongoing concerns about the utility s role in a deadly gas explosion in 2010 and in the more recent wildfires pg e has had serious safety problems with both its gas and electric operations for many years the california public utilities commission said in a statement possible changes put forth by the commission include splitting up the gas and electric divisions and either making the company a public utility or making the company s return on equity contingent on safety performance we must be careful and practical the commission s president michael picker said in a statement last month this process will be like repairing a jetliner while it s in flight crashing a plane to make it safer isn t good for the passengers the commission declined further comment for this story a spokesman said only that state regulators are looking at a range of options for the utility we must be careful and practical this process will be like repairing a jetliner while it s in flight crashing a plane to make it safer isn t good for the passengers in a separate development the state s top law enforcement official attorney general xavier becerra said in a court filingin late december that pg e could face criminal charges up to murder if it s found liable in any of the recent deadly california wildfires pg e was convicted of felony safety violations in a gas line explosion in 2010 in a san francisco suburb that killed eight people and destroyed a neighborhood the federal judge overseeing the utility s five year criminal probation in that case had asked becerra s opinion on whether pg e s possible role in the recent wildfires constitutes a probation violation the stakes a sale would have big implications for the company which supplies electricity and gas to more than 5 million california households and has more than 20 000 employees pg e s natural gas assets account for between 20 percent to 30 percent of the company the company sources who spoke to npr and provided supporting documents say the planning for project falcon began shortly after the 2017 wine country fires and picked up again in earnest this past june when cal fire determined that pg e was responsible for at least a dozen northern california fires the planning the sources say has accelerated since the camp fire the sources also said the company would like to present its own plan before one is imposed by regulators california applies inverse condemnation to utilities meaning they can be held liable for damage even if they are not found negligent structuring the deal pg e shareholders and institutional investors may welcome a gas sale as a way to cover at least in part wildfire liabilities as part of the gas sale plan all gross proceeds from the sale would go into the wildfire fund with no direct shareholder benefit from cash according to the pg e source but shareholders could get new shares in the company that purchases the gas arm regulators and lawmakers may argue that a deal should be structured to solely benefit wildfire victims and that any deal should come with protections for ratepayers we need to be asking ourselves hard questions as a state as to whether a settlement in bankruptcy might be better than something we get through this gas sale warns wara the stanford researcher the inside sources say the company is hoping to get between 10 7 billion and 15 5 billion for its gas assets given the company s safety liability and political challenges including new allegations last month that the company violated safety regulations analysts say it s not at all clear they would get that on the open market in mid december state regulators found that pg e had systematically falsified safety documents and broke safety rules related to its natural gas operations over a five year period at the time pg e spokesman matt nauman said in an emailed statement to npr that the company is committed to accurate and thorough reporting and record keeping and we didn t live up to that commitment in this case this comes on the heels of a 1 6 billion finefrom regulators the largest in state history and six felonyconvictions related to 2010 san bruno explosion travis miller senior utilities equity strategist at morningstar is skeptical that a potential gas sell off would fly with regulators or wall street he said he doesn t think another utility would step forward to buy the gas assets you may get a good price but it also carries with it a lot of regulatory and political risk miller says there s no good outcome for ratepayers under any scenario and not an ideal outcome for shareholders either project falcon and the camp fire the company s fiscal woes deepened in the wake of november s camp fire in butte county calif which killed at least 85 people and displaced tens of thousands who continue to face a desperate housing crisis paradise and neighboring towns were all but wiped out the cause of the fire is still under investigation by the state s fire agency cal fire pg e has told state regulators that it experienced problems on two sections of its electric system near where the camp fire erupted the company faces nearly two dozen lawsuits from fire victims over its possible culpability for the camp fire including allegations of possible equipment failures and poor maintenance in one lawsuit residents accuse the company of prioritizing advertising spending over fire and public safety now it s clear there are problems on both sides of the business says steve fleishman an analyst with wolfe research referring to the gas and electric divisions fleishman says a gas sale and new management on the electric side might allow pg e leaders to focus solely on improving safety i think the company is willing do anything structurally if they think it can help with safety fleishman says analysts warn that the company risks running out of access to capital not just because of present liability but also because of the risk of future catastrophic fires a specter sharpened by climate change and a century of fire suppression policy in the nation s forests the company in november said it had exhausted its revolving credit lines and the ratings agencies moody s investor service and s p have downgraded the company s credit rating to near junk status approval process will be complicated internal pg e planning documents on the potential sale labeled privileged and confidential show that company officials are concerned about regulatory approval the cpuc approval process will be complicated and lengthy so phasing the proceeding to obtain early decisions on matters that are crucial to the viability of the transaction is desirable one document reads while the gas sale would cover some liabilities the legislature also may be asked to step in state lawmakers partially shielded the company for liability claims in 2017 with a bill that critics called a bailout analysts and consumer advocates worry that lawmakers may expand that protection for this year and beyond putting taxpayers and ratepayers on the hook ultimately we re going to be left holding the bag says michael wara of stanford university if pg e can t pay all of these costs then it s the california taxpayer that ultimately will but some lawmakers are already balking state sen bill dodd who originally supported shielding pg e from liability costs related to fires in 2017 has lost patience with the company pg e has demonstrated a pattern of poor management and illegal conduct that has shattered lives across california dodd said in an emailed statement he called for systemic change which must include change on the board of directors and in the executive suite

the president also said federal workers who are working without pay would want him to keep going and fight for border security washington president donald trump declared friday he could keep parts of the government shut down for months or even years as he and democratic leaders failed in a second closed door meeting to resolve his demand for billions of dollars for a border wall with mexico they did agree to a new round of weekend talks between staff members and white house officials trump met in the white house situation room with congressional leaders from both parties as the shutdown hit the two week mark amid an impasse over his wall demands democrats emerged from the roughly two hour meeting which both sides said was contentious at times to report little if any progress the standoff also prompted economic jitters and anxiety among some in trump s own party but he appeared in the rose garden to frame the upcoming weekend talks as progress while making clear he would not reopen the government we won t be opening until it s solved trump said i don t call it a shutdown i call it doing what you have to do for the benefit and the safety of our country trump said the hundreds of thousands of federal workers who are furloughed or working without pay would want him to keep going and fight for border security asked how people would manage without a financial safety net he declared the safety net is going to be having a strong border because we re going to be safe democrats on the other hand spoke of families unable to pay bills and called on trump to reopen the government while negotiations continue senate democratic minority leader chuck schumer said it s very hard to see how progress will be made unless they open up the government friday s white house meeting with trump included eight congressional leaders the top two democrats and republicans of both chambers people familiar with the session but not authorized to speak publicly described trump as holding forth at length on a range of subjects but said he made clear he was firm in his demand for 5 6 billion in wall funding and in rejecting the democrats request to reopen the government trump confirmed that he privately told democrats the shutdown could drag on for months or years though he said he hoped it wouldn t last that long said trump i hope it doesn t go on even beyond a few more days house democrats muscled through legislation thursday night to fund the government but not trump s proposed wall however senate majority leader mitch mcconnell has said those measures are non starters on his side of the capitol without the president s support a variety of strategies are being floated inside and outside the white house among them trading wall funding for a deal on immigrants brought to the country as young people and now here illegally or using a national emergency declaration to build the wall while trump made clear during his press conference that talk on daca the deferred action for childhood arrivals program would have to wait and that he was trying to negotiate with congress on the wall the conversations underscored rising republican anxiety about just how to exit the shutdown seeking to ease concerns the white house sought to frame the weekend talks as a step forward as did mcconnell who described plans for a working group though people familiar with the meeting said that phrase never actually came up trump designated vice president mike pence homeland security secretary kirstjen nielsen and adviser jared kushner to work with a congressional delegation over the weekend some gop senators up for re election in 2020 voiced discomfort with the shutdown in recent days including cory gardner of colorado and susan collins of maine putting additional pressure on republicans but with staff level talks there is always an open question of whether trump s aides are fully empowered to negotiate for the president earlier this week he rejected his own administration s offer to accept 2 5 billion for the wall that proposal was made when pence and other top officials met at the start of the shutdown with schumer during his free wheeling session with reporters trump also wrongly claimed that he d never called for the wall to be concrete trump did so repeatedly during his campaign describing a wall of pre cast concrete sections that would be higher than the walls of many of his rally venues he repeated that promise just days ago an all concrete wall was never abandoned as has been reported by the media some areas will be all concrete but the experts at border patrol prefer a wall that is see through thereby making it possible to see what is happening on both sides makes sense to me he tweeted on dec 31 trump was joined by pence in the rose garden as well as house republican leaders kevin mccarthy and steve scalise mcconnell who went back to the capitol unaware of the press conference said it was encouraging that the white house officials and the congressional contingent would meet over the weekend to see if they can reach an agreement and then punt it back to us for final sign off schumer said that if mcconnell and senate republicans stay on the sidelines trump can keep the government shut down for a long time the president needs an intervention schumer said and senate republicans are just the right ones to intervene adding to national unease about the shutdown are economic jitters as analysts warn of the risks of closures that are disrupting government operations across multiple departments and agencies at a time of other uncertainties in the stock market and foreign trade in their first votes of the new congress house democrats approved bills thursday night to re open government at previously agreed upon levels several republicans crossed over to join them white house and department of homeland security officials have spent recent days trying to make both a public and private case that the situation at the border has reached a crisis point polls show a majority of americans oppose the border wall although republicans strongly support it ___

if you think southern b c cities are the only ones experiencing declining sales and prices think again way out here on the best coast it s easy to think of ourselves living in something of a separated off bubble and that when it comes to real estate in the south of the province the bubble looks to be deflating but the fact is that b c s biggest cities are among many around the globe that are currently experiencing a real estate market slowdown most of us are aware that the greater toronto area is also in the property doldrums with sales in 2018 down 18 per cent year over year similar to that of greater victoria and vancouver island down 20 and 19 per cent respectively but not as steep as metro vancouver s 31 6 per cent annual decline the average 2018 home resale price in our country s biggest city is also down 4 7 per cent over the previous year but what about the rest of the world property markets in major global centres are also on the slide most notably in pricey cities such as hong kong shanghai beijing singapore london and sydney in hong kong and mainland china s biggest cities prices are steadily declining with prices in beijing and shanghai around five per cent off their peak of around six months ago largely due to a slowing chinese economy affected by trade wars with the u s in london and across the u k uncertainty over brexit has sidelined homebuyers and london property prices have fallen for two consecutive years in australia s biggest city unsustainably high prices along with a pullback in demand from mainland chinese buyers have combined to drag real estate markets down over the past year with prices down more than 11 per cent in sydney according to corelogic plus singapore s prices have been hit by increased taxation and new mortgage rules bloomberg published a fascinating story on this topic january 3 and identified that even as each slowing market has its own set of characteristics most of them also have a few factors in common 1 tougher government regulations on mortgages and finances these range from the mortgage stress test in canada to stricter loan to value ratios in singapore to limits on how much money can leave mainland china 2 rising interest rates canada is far from the only country to see increased borrowing costs the bank of england led by former bank of canada governor mark carney has been similarly making incremental hikes over the past year or so and rates in singapore have risen several times over the past year with more hikes predicted in 2019 australia s reserve bank however has maintained record low rates and prices are still dropping there too 3 unpredictable stock markets with the world s markets fluctuating wildly much of which uncertainty is linked to u s china trade wars investors around the globe are unsure where things will land and are keeping a low profile 4 diminishing demand from china property markets in most pacific rim cities whether in north america australasia or asia are affected by the wobbling chinese economy and a tightening of rules on how much money is allowed to flow out of mainland china bloomberg cites an april 2018 international monetary fund study which issued a warning on the effect of simultaneous global real estate market corrections the imf wrote that such a phenomenon could lead to financial and macroeconomic instability however a glimmer of hope for global economic stability was issued today january 4 as major stock markets made a sudden recovery on the news of renewed trade talks between china and the u s it may seem like some consolation that b c cities are not alone in their housing market decline after all it makes for a more level playing field globally speaking but from a macro economic viewpoint it s not such a good thing

safety problems with both its gas and electric operations for many years the california public utilities commission said in a statement possible changes put forth by the commission include splitting up the gas and electric divisions and either making the company a public utility or making the company s return on equity contingent on safety performance we must be careful and practical the commission s president michael picker said in a statement last month this process will be like repairing a jetliner while it s in flight crashing a plane to make it safer isn t good for the passengers the commission declined further comment for this story a spokesman said only that state regulators are looking at a range of options for the utility we must be careful and practical this process will be like repairing a jetliner while it s in flight crashing a plane to make it safer isn t good for the passengers in a separate development the state s top law enforcement official attorney general xavier becerra said in a court filingin late december that pg e could face criminal charges up to murder if it s found liable in any of the recent deadly california wildfires pg e was convicted of felony safety violations in a gas line explosion in 2010 in a san francisco suburb that killed eight people and destroyed a neighborhood the federal judge overseeing the utility s five year criminal probation in that case had asked becerra s opinion on whether pg e s possible role in the recent wildfires constitutes a probation violation the stakes a sale would have big implications for the company which supplies electricity and gas to more than 5 million california households and has more than 20 000 employees pg e s natural gas assets account for between 20 percent to 30 percent of the company the company sources who spoke to npr and provided supporting documents say the planning for project falcon began shortly after the 2017 wine country fires and picked up again in earnest this past june when cal fire determined that pg e was responsible for at least a dozen northern california fires the planning the sources say has accelerated since the camp fire the sources also said the company would like to present its own plan before one is imposed by regulators california applies inverse condemnation to utilities meaning they can be held liable for damage even if they are not found negligent structuring the deal pg e shareholders and institutional investors may welcome a gas sale as a way to cover at least in part wildfire liabilities as part of the gas sale plan all gross proceeds from the sale would go into the wildfire fund with no direct shareholder benefit from cash according to the pg e source but shareholders could get new shares in the company that purchases the gas arm regulators and lawmakers may argue that a deal should be structured to solely benefit wildfire victims and that any deal should come with protections for ratepayers we need to be asking ourselves hard questions as a state as to whether a settlement in bankruptcy might be better than something we get through this gas sale warns wara the stanford researcher the inside sources say the company is hoping to get between 10 7 billion and 15 5 billion for its gas assets given the company s safety liability and political challenges including new allegations last month that the company violated safety regulations analysts say it s not at all clear they would get that on the open market in mid december state regulators found that pg e had systematically falsified safety documents and broke safety rules related to its natural gas operations over a five year period at the time pg e spokesman matt nauman said in an emailed statement to npr that the company is committed to accurate and thorough reporting and record keeping and we didn t live up to that commitment in this case this comes on the heels of a 1 6 billion finefrom regulators the largest in state history and six felonyconvictions related to 2010 san bruno explosion travis miller senior utilities equity strategist at morningstar is skeptical that a potential gas sell off would fly with regulators or wall street he said he doesn t think another utility would step forward to buy the gas assets you may get a good price but it also carries with it a lot of regulatory and political risk miller says there s no good outcome for ratepayers under any scenario and not an ideal outcome for shareholders either project falcon and the camp fire the company s fiscal woes deepened in the wake of november s camp fire in butte county calif which killed at least 85 people and displaced tens of thousands who continue to face a desperate housing crisis paradise and neighboring towns were all but wiped out the cause of the fire is still under investigation by the state s fire agency cal fire pg e has told state regulators that it experienced problems on two sections of its electric system near where the camp fire erupted the company faces nearly two dozen lawsuits from fire victims over its possible culpability for the camp fire including allegations of possible equipment failures and poor maintenance in one lawsuit residents accuse the company of prioritizing advertising spending over fire and public safety now it s clear there are problems on both sides of the business says steve fleishman an analyst with wolfe research referring to the gas and electric divisions fleishman says a gas sale and new management on the electric side might allow pg e leaders to focus solely on improving safety i think the company is willing do anything structurally if they think it can help with safety fleishman says analysts warn that the company risks running out of access to capital not just because of present liability but also because of the risk of future catastrophic fires a specter sharpened by climate change and a century of fire suppression policy in the nation s forests the company in november said it had exhausted its revolving credit lines and the ratings agencies moody s investor service and s p have downgraded the company s credit rating to near junk status approval process will be complicated internal pg e planning documents on the potential sale labeled privileged and confidential show that company officials are concerned about regulatory approval the cpuc approval process will be complicated and lengthy so phasing the proceeding to obtain early decisions on matters that are crucial to the viability of the transaction is desirable one document reads while the gas sale would cover some liabilities the legislature also may be asked to step in state lawmakers partially shielded the company for liability claims in 2017 with a bill that critics called a bailout analysts and consumer advocates worry that lawmakers may expand that protection for this year and beyond putting taxpayers and ratepayers on the hook ultimately we re going to be left holding the bag says michael wara of stanford university if pg e can t pay all of these costs then it s the california taxpayer that ultimately will but some lawmakers are already balking state sen bill dodd who originally supported shielding pg e from liability costs related to fires in 2017 has lost patience with the company pg e has demonstrated a pattern of poor management and illegal conduct that has shattered lives across california dodd said in an emailed statement he called for systemic change which must include change on the board of directors and in the executive suite

had matched the early to mid 2000 s and that means state budget shortfalls would not exist at all that new calculation comes from the state office of policy and management gov dannel p malloy s budget unit and the breakdown by taxes is consistent showing a slowing of collections across all three major categories i m sure we would have found ways to spend the money or hopefully some tax cuts but just to give you an idea of the scale said manisha srivastava an economist at opm who presented the numbers in hartford friday at a conference of the connecticut business and industry association the 3 billion represents more than 15 percent of the general fund advertisement article continues below this ad the scale is massive by any measure as annual collection rates of the state s major taxes have all slowed in the malloy era compared with the pre recession years the projected shortfall for the fiscal year that starts july 1 for example stands at 1 7 billion and gov elect ned lamont can wipe out about 500 million of that just by extending a medicaid financed hospital taxing scheme that s set to end this year what this tells us is that connecticut has a revenue problem not a spending problem i reported in october that malloy has cut 1 3 billion a year from state agency spending during his two terms adjusted for inflation economic growth going forward is what matters of course and on that score economists at friday s conference gave surprisingly upbeat forecasts connecticut s economy had a good year in 2018 arguably the best since 2007 and should continue apace as the national expansion approaches ten years in 2019 the economists on a panel with srivastava said advertisement article continues below this ad it s a nervous forecast as many economists predict a recession sometime between late 2019 and 2022 and these things tend to happen sooner than expected we are forecasting that it will still be a pretty good year we don t see a recession in 2019 said emily mandel an economist at moody s analytics who follows connecticut conditions right now are pretty strong risk factors include how the nation s economy reacts to more federal reserve rate hikes expected in 2019 and foreign trade issues made worse by president donald trump s disastrous protectionist policies with tariffs that act as taxes with little gain and of course in connecticut the ongoing risk is budget instability and another possible decline in tax collection rates maintaining the current steady growth up from zilch in 2017 might not quickly reverse the long term trend on tax collections that srivastava presented advertisement article continues below this ad paycheck withholding adjusted for annual refunds grew by a compounded average annual rate of 3 6 percent between 2011 and the estimate for this year the new figures show that compares with an average of 6 6 percent in the years from 2003 to 2008 withholding the bulk of the state personal income tax represents the largest single source of revenue for the state between 6 billion and 7 billion a year the sales and use tax which accounts for about 4 billion has grown by an average of 2 5 percent a year in the malloy era compared with 3 5 percent in 2003 08 the category known as estimates and finals a portion of the income tax that basically covers capital gains other financial gains and some large income windfalls is by far the most volatile advertisement article continues below this ad flattening out the years srivastava s analysis showed an average annual gain of 5 4 percent in the malloy era with 2018 turning in a heady 41 5 percent not bad right in fact that gain is largely responsible for a rainy day fund estimated to reach as high as 2 5 billion by the end of the current fiscal year june 30 well the average figure was 18 9 percent in 2003 08 with consistent gains as the stock markets ran up wealth ahead of the great recession there in a nutshell with those three pairs of numbers is connecticut s budget crisis rarely illustrated in such precise terms covering the various eras the problem was the economic downturn was a lot worse than imagined and it hit high income earners especially hard said peter gioia an economics consultant working for cbia advertisement article continues below this ad gioia recalled that the 2011 tax increase was meant to put the state s fiscal woes behind us and enable malloy and the general assembly to move forward with investments in transportation and cities as tax collections resumed that was malloy and ben barnes plan gioia said referring to barnes the state s chief budget official for malloy s entire 8 year tenure so instead of being a one and done silver bullet it didn t work why it didn t work is a matter of debate that will never be solved and it s not like the 2003 08 growth period was freakish in fact it was smaller than the gains of the previous economic boom 1996 to 2001 in that period state withholding grew at a compounded annual rate of 10 5 percent and the sales tax grew by 6 9 percent a year srivastava s analysis shows estimates and finals averaged a 17 percent gain in the 96 to 01 period lower than the early to mid 2000s but still far ahead of the malloy era advertisement article continues below this ad so why didn t connecticut find a way to cut into its pension and heath care liability crisis back in those years as i recall it seemed like a budget crisis every year back then as well at least from 2000 on the tax collection rates shown in the research are so called economic rates of growth meaning they take out the effects of any tax increases or cuts the great debate is whether malloy s tax increase of about 900 million in 2011 or higher depending on how you measure it caused tax collections to decline because people and companies moved out of the state or because connecticut was entering a turbulent period that would lead to what barnes called a perpetual fiscal crisis

if you think we re the only ones experiencing declining sales and prices think again way out here on the best coast it s easy to think of ourselves living in something of a separated off bubble and that when it comes to real estate the bubble looks to be deflating but the fact is that b c s major cities are among many around the globe that are currently experiencing a real estate market slowdown most of us are aware that the greater toronto area is also in the property doldrums with sales in 2018 down 18 per cent year over year not as steep as metro vancouver s 31 6 per cent annual decline the average 2018 home resale price in our country s biggest city is also down 4 7 per cent over the previous year but what about the rest of the world property markets in major global centres are also on the slide most notably in pricey cities such as hong kong shanghai beijing singapore london and sydney in hong kong and mainland china s biggest cities prices are steadily declining with prices in beijing and shanghai around five per cent off their peak of around six months ago largely due to a slowing chinese economy affected by trade wars with the u s in london and across the u k uncertainty over brexit has sidelined homebuyers and london property prices have fallen for two consecutive years in australia s biggest city unsustainably high prices along with a pullback in demand from mainland chinese buyers have combined to drag real estate markets down over the past year with prices down more than 11 per cent in sydney according to corelogic plus singapore s prices have been hit by increased taxation and new mortgage rules bloomberg published a fascinating story on this topic january 3 and identified that even as each slowing market has its own set of characteristics most of them also have a few factors in common 1 tougher government regulations on mortgages and finances these range from the mortgage stress test in canada to stricter loan to value ratios in singapore to limits on how much money can leave mainland china 2 rising interest rates canada is far from the only country to see increased borrowing costs the bank of england led by former bank of canada governor mark carney has been similarly making incremental hikes over the past year or so and rates in singapore have risen several times over the past year with more hikes predicted in 2019 australia s reserve bank however has maintained record low rates and prices are still dropping there too 3 unpredictable stock markets with the world s markets fluctuating wildly much of which uncertainty is linked to u s china trade wars investors around the globe are unsure where things will land and are keeping a low profile 4 diminishing demand from china property markets in most pacific rim cities whether in north america australasia or asia are affected by the wobbling chinese economy and a tightening of rules on how much money is allowed to flow out of mainland china bloomberg cites an april 2018 international monetary fund study which issued a warning on the effect of simultaneous global real estate market corrections the imf wrote that such a phenomenon could lead to financial and macroeconomic instability however a glimmer of hope for global economic stability was issued today january 4 as major stock markets made a sudden recovery on the news of renewed trade talks between china and the u s it may seem like some consolation that b c cities are not alone in their housing market decline after all it makes for a more level playing field globally speaking but from a macro economic viewpoint it s not such a good thing

as we step into a new year the world is facing a decisive turning point the crisis of capitalism is reaching a new level one that threatens to overthrow the entire existing world order that was painfully put together after the second world war 10 years after the financial collapse of 2008 the bourgeoisie is nowhere near solving the economic crisis all the sacrifices and pain of the last 10 years have not solved the crisis but only increased the suffering impoverishment and desperation of the masses while a tiny minority of parasites have acquired obscene levels of wealth but politics in the last analysis is concentrated economics a decade ago we predicted that all the attempts of governments to restore the economic equilibrium would only serve to destroy the social and political equilibrium we see this in one country after another in europe we have the simmering brexit crisis in itself a highly destabilising element in the situation it has thrown britain into a deep crisis with no clear end in sight not long ago britain was perhaps the most politically stable country in europe now it is one of the most unstable countries a few weeks ago on channel 4 news the well known conservative political commentator matthew parris was asked if he thought that the present crisis was the most serious one in british history he answered as follows i can remember the suez crisis of 1956 that was a very serious crisis and i have since lived through other ones but always in the past no matter how deep the crisis i always had the sensation that someone somewhere had a plan clear idea of how to get out of the crisis i no longer have that feeling in just over a week s time the british prime minister theresa may will present her ill fated deal for the approval of the british parliament her chances of success resemble those of a snowball in hell but having defeated the deal so painfully put together with eu what will happen next the possibility of britain leaving the eu without a deal is a finished recipe for unprecedented economic social and political chaos not just in britain but throughout europe the possibility of britain leaving the eu without a deal is a finished recipe for unprecedented economic social and political chaos not just in britain but throughout europe image socialist appeal it is a measure of the complete bankruptcy of the british political establishment that such a scenario could even be contemplated but the clock is ticking and britain is running out of time whatever alternative is proposed will be disastrous the only question is the degree of the disaster the stage is set in any case for a very stormy period for britain but the crisis of europe does not end there in germany which for decades was the real motor force behind the european economy the long domination of the two major political parties the christian democrats and social democrats is on the point of collapse angela merkel giving up her position as leader of the christian democrats was merely a symptom of the underlying political tensions that are a portent of a growing social polarisation the same phenomenon can be observed in many countries in france the electoral victory of emmanuel macron was heralded as a great victory for the political centre like st george and the dragon macron miraculously came down from the clouds to slay the evil dragon of extremism of the left and right but it did not take long for the man who was widely believed to walk on water to sink beneath the stormy waves of the class struggle the absurd illusions of the political commentators who saw in this petty political narcissist a saviour not only for france but for the whole of europe evaporated like a drop of water on a hot stove the collapse of macron s popularity has been far swifter and more catastrophic than that of his unfortunate predecessor françois hollande the polls that gave him over 70 percent support at the time of his election were below 20 percent in december this dramatic turnabout was the direct result of something that was not supposed to happen the direct revolutionary action of the masses in a matter of weeks the workers and youth of france succeeded in demolishing the false image of invulnerability of the french president who was reduced to pleading with them to allow him to rule the man who boasted that he would never surrender to the street was forced to carry out a humiliating u turn in the end though that will not be enough to save him france and germany for decades the destiny of europe was decided by two countries france and germany in the beginning the french ruling class with its exaggerated sense of importance wanted to tie germany to its side providing the economic basis for a united europe while france would provide the political leadership a vain hope in the end it is economic power that decides politics not vice versa nowadays only a fool can fail to understand that it is germany and not france that decides all the fundamental questions in europe macron s ambition that he would dictate to berlin and even to washington was soon exposed as the ridiculous illusion it always was merkel s crisis will not serve to increase the power and authority of the french president who now finds himself in the unenviable position of the emperor who paraded his nakedness under the guise of a suit of new clothes even when hiding behind a gilded desk his political nakedness is clear to all the growing split between france and germany is based neither on religious principles morality philosophy or humanitarianism but on hard cash which under capitalism replaces the heart and soul as the real motor force of society under conditions of capitalist crisis there is no way that this split can be healed it threatens to provoke an existential crisis at the very heart of the european union macron displays a most touching sympathy for the problems of italy and other mediterranean nations who have regrettably fallen into debt in recent years wrapping himself in the flag of european solidarity he pleads with the eu to show humanitarianism and generosity after all did not our lord himself say and forgive us our debts macron the moderate saviour of europe proved to be an emperor in new clothes and not even a golden desk could conceal his political nakedness image révolution it is a well known fact that few pleasures in life can compare with the gentle art of spending other people s money when macron pleads for debt forgiveness he is well aware that those who must forgive are not to be found in paris but in berlin and those who pull the strings of the bundesbank are not overly keen on forgiving debts or anything else as the people of greece will willingly testify in his own country emmanuel macron the rich man s president was hellbent on carrying out a policy of deep cuts together with tax relief for the rich but macron s surrender to the gilets jaunes protesters promising a 10bn 11 4bn package will mean that france s budget deficit is set like italy s to overtake the limits allowed by the eurozone this fact goes some way to explain the different attitudes adopted by the rulers of france and germany all the factors are combining to accentuate the centrifugal tendencies aggravating the contradictions and tensions between nations that the eu was formed to prevent to add fuel to the flames we have the simmering crisis caused by the flood of refugees knocking on europe s doors this in turn has opened up new fault lines between germany and its eastern european satellites poland and hungary are in a direct confrontation with the european union over the question of immigration backed from the sidelines by the right wing government of austria in germany the reactionary anti immigrant alternative for germany afd party is gaining ground particularly in four eastern german states the stage is therefore set for a grand political drama in europe the crisis over brexit is merely the curtain raiser the federalist vision for europe has sunk without trace far from moving towards greater unity the european union is fragmenting before our very eyes new fault lines emerge the political tensions between france and germany are merely a surface expression of deep seated economic divisions between the north and south of europe recently a new block has emerged yet another fault line alongside the many other cracks that threaten the european union with a breakup some have baptised it a new hanseatic league harking back to the powerful group of merchant states around the baltic area that dominated a great part of europe s financial life in the mediaeval period a chasm has opened up between the poorer countries of southern europe and the more prosperous economies of the north denmark sweden finland estonia latvia lithuania the netherlands and ireland are relatively small countries in the broader european context but they have clubbed together to resist the claims of southern european countries on europe s budget to cover huge deficits after years of austerity cuts and terrible suffering greece has been reduced to ruin by the iron embrace of berlin and brussels nothing has been solved and the crisis has now spread to italy where the accumulated deficit amounts to 130 percent of gdp the anti eu coalition in rome approved a budget that violated the limits imposed by brussels provoking an open confrontation for the time being the cracks have been papered over but the crisis of italy remains and has far more serious implications for the eu than greece ever had when all is said and done greece is a relatively small economy on the periphery of europe by contrast italy is the third biggest economy of the eurozone the italian government hoped that by pumping money into the economy they could make it grow again but if the italian treasury had been forced to pay huge fines it would have wiped out whatever impact the extra spending might have had staring down the barrel of a gun luigi di maio the leader of the five star movement m5s and matteo salvini of the northern league saw that discretion was the better part of valour swallowed hard and threw in the towel in the end a shaky agreement was cobbled together the european commission grudgingly agreed to a compromise plan italy undertook to trim its nominal budget deficit from 2 4 percent of gdp to 2 percent the commission reluctantly agreed that the structural deficit which leaves out one off measures and cyclical effects should remain unchanged next year the solution on the table is not ideal european commission vice president valdis dombrovskis grumbled that was an understatement of genius the deal allows the commission to avoid legal action against italy provided that the measures are fully implemented that subordinate clause indicates that the clash with italy has not been resolved only delayed next year s budget did not offer solutions for the country s long term problems why did the european commission agree to an unsatisfactory deal the answer is to be found not in economics but in politics they had just allowed france s president to get away with promising up to 10bn in extra spending to quell the rebellion of the gilets jaunes yellow vests that threatened to push france s budget deficit next year well over the euro zone s limit of 3 percent of gdp they were therefore scarcely in a position to put much pressure on the italians whose projected deficit was actually below 3 percent of gdp but there were clearly other more serious considerations in an interview with corriere della sera a daily the italian prime minister giuseppe conte said he had reminded the commission that his government faced a duty to maintain social stability in italy that was a scarcely veiled threat either you stop putting pressure on us or italy will face a social explosion that will have repercussions beyond our borders the warning was not lost on the men in brussels it may be said that italy is too big to fail but one must add that it is also too big to save there is not enough money in the bundesbank to bail out ailing italian capitalism this drama has not yet been played out to the end a worldwide crisis in the 1920s trotsky predicted that the centre of world history which had already passed from the mediterranean to the atlantic would in future pass from the atlantic to the pacific that remarkable prediction is now a fact europe is falling behind america and china in the race for new artificial intelligence technologies in 2019 india will probably overtake both britain and france at least in absolute terms to become the world s fifth largest economy the future of world history will be finally decided not by europe but the pacific but this process itself is full of contradictions the fate of the world economy depends to a large extent on china which until recently was one of its main motor forces but china depends to a large extent on exports falling demand in europe and the usa has created a crisis of overproduction in steel and other key sectors of the chinese economy china s growth rate has slowed to about 6 5 percent china has now emerged as a world power that is increasingly coming into conflict with the united states image the white house though this may seem like a high figure when compared to the miserable rates of growth in europe and the usa it is alarmingly slow when compared to the past it has been generally accepted that anything less than an 8 percent growth rate for china is dangerously low since that is the rate required to keep up with the growth of its population in order to stimulate exports china has resorted to dumping large amounts of cheap steel on the world market this has led to a serious crisis of steel in europe and howls of protest from the americans in particular it is one of the main factors that led to the present trade war between the usa and china china has now emerged as a world power that is increasingly coming into conflict with the united states the trade war between these two countries is a clear manifestation of this fact nevertheless the usa still retains its dominant position in the world economy and politics the combination of rising interest rates and a soaring dollar has served to attract large amounts of speculative capital to the usa with disastrous effects for the so called emerging markets in latin america asia and the middle east their fragile economies finding themselves at the mercy of the all powerful dollar which is squeezing them aggravating indebtedness and snatching away precious investments in the last period the so called emerging economies acted as a stimulus to world economic growth now they have shuddered to a halt turkey argentina brazil and other formerly resilient economies have collapsed into recession or in the best case scenario stagnation the real face of us imperialism donald trump s slogan make america great again is a kind of imperialist manifesto the subtext of which reads as follows we will make america great again at the expense of the rest of the world behind the swaggering boastful rhetoric lies a clear threat to the rest of the world do as we say or face the consequences president trump has very little time for america s european allies whom he correctly sees as midgets compared to the gigantic power of the usa he is irritated by the pretensions of the europeans their fussing about the world stage and their ridiculous attempts to influence us foreign policy they buzz around his head like so many annoying flies and whereas previous american presidents were content to pretend to pay them some attention his instinct is to swat them hard so they will cease to bother him trump s policy in essence is not very different to that of his predecessors they also did not hesitate to use america s economic and military strength to impose its will on the rest of the world but they did so in a different way some might say with more finesse others would say rather more truthfully with extreme hypocrisy while proclaiming the virtues of democracy justice peace and humanitarianism they did not hesitate to trample underfoot every manifestation that contradicted america s real or perceived interests donald trump does exactly the same but does not bother to proclaim values in which he has absolutely no interest and which in any case play absolutely no role in the foreign policy of american imperialism or any other brand of imperialism trump has cast aside the hypocritical mask of decency to reveal the real ugly face of american imperialism for the edification of the entire world to that extent one might say that he is refreshingly honest america still remains a colossus on the world scale its economic and military power is truly vast but america s power is not unlimited its limits have been demonstrated with brutal clarity in iraq syria and afghanistan and president trump has not been slow to draw the conclusions trump s whole instinct is inclined towards isolationism a very old and honoured tradition of a certain sector of the american ruling class as we have observed he is completely uninterested in the affairs of his european allies in a moment of unaccustomed sincerity he described them as enemies as opposed to the russians who were mere rivals as a matter of fact he does not even have much time for nato and would rather see it disbanded along with the united nations nafta the world trade organisation and all other unhealthy manifestations of extra national organisations but since regrettably he has to listen to the opinions of his numerous annoying advisers he has been compelled grudgingly to accept the existence of this inconvenient military alliance while loudly demanding that his european allies put their hands in their pockets to finance it thus relieving the burden of american taxpayers whose votes are more important to him than the opinions of people in paris berlin and london trump has cast aside the hypocritical mask of decency to reveal the real ugly face of american imperialism for the edification of the entire world image flickr gage skidmore nevertheless he has decided unilaterally to withdraw american troops from the middle east this will show the europeans that he means what he says and perhaps finally force them to put their money where their mouths are a similar motivation is behind his seemingly paradoxical attitude towards vladimir putin during his presidential campaign he lost no opportunity to praise the man in the kremlin calling him a real smart guy and a man with whom one could do business these remarks did not go down well with the us military establishment nor with the hawks of the republican party and they provided his political enemies with a golden opportunity to attack him alleging russian complicity in his presidential campaign the campaign on so called russian interference in the election has rumbled on relentlessly ever since although it has generated more heat than light the idea that the victory of trump was caused by russian interference would not seem credible to a six year old child of average intelligence it is merely a reflection of the inability of the democrats to accept that the american public was utterly alienated from the existing political establishment and motivated by a deep desire for change under pressure from his adversaries trump was forced to blow hot and cold in relation to russia but his decision to withdraw from syria indicates that he has not changed his position since the election once again trump s isolationist instincts have prevailed john kelly the white house chief of staff and jim mattis secretary of defence resigned in protest but protests and resignations have had no effect on trump in the past and there is no reason to believe that this time will be any different but isolationism by no means signifies abstentionism that is rendered impossible by the unstoppable trend to unify all the disparate economies in the world into a single world market globalisation is merely an expression of a phenomenon that was already predicted by marx and engels in the communist manifesto over 150 years ago that prediction has been brilliantly borne out by the history of the world particularly over the last 50 years no country no matter how big and powerful can escape the irresistible pull of the world market all the talk about national sovereignty gaining control of our own frontiers and so on is just so much hot air the storm clouds gather hanging over the whole unstable equation like a menacing storm cloud is the imminent threat of a new world recession this is now accepted by all serious economists the question is not if it will happen only when the global economic instability is reflected in the constant gyrations of the stock markets following falls in october and stagnation in november the s p 500 slumped by 15 percent between 30 november and 24 december despite a brief recovery of 5 percent the day after christmas the index finished the year 6 percent below where it started the first trading day of 2019 showed further instability with falling stocks in asia and turbulence in europe the unexpected news of a slump in apple s sales caused a wave of alarm the company issued a warning of a sharp slowdown in china s economy and weak sales in other emerging markets this meant that revenues in the fourth quarter would undershoot expectations by up to 10 percent following soon after was news that china s manufacturing sector contracted in december which unnerved investors globally s p 500 futures dipped before wall street reopened on 3 january these feverish swings on the stock exchanges of the world are an indication of extreme nervousness and increasing worry about the future perspectives of the world economy while it is true that the movements of the stock markets do not accurately reflect the state of the real economy they nevertheless serve as a useful barometer to measure the current state of mind of investors a recent article in the economist voiced its concern but the rotten performance of stock markets last year which has been maintained at the start of this one can be traced in part to growing worry about the state of the world economy and to its two biggest economies in particular the article continues according to the economist intelligence unit eiu our sister company america will grow by 2 3 this year that is substantially down on an estimated growth rate of 2 9 for last year as the federal reserve tightens monetary policy and as the effects of last year s tax cuts ebb china s forecast growth rate is much higher at 6 3 but that is still down on its estimated 2018 performance and plenty fear worse because of the trade war with america and china s campaign to rein in debt europe presents a gloomier picture still britain which is due to leave the european union in march is forecast to grow by a tepid 1 5 france faces less uncertainty but fares no better italy a perennial economic disappointment is tipped to notch up growth of just 0 4 that makes it the seventh worst performer in the eiu s table of forecasts those below it are all forecast to contract in 2019 none more precipitously than venezuela which has been in freefall for years as one might expect the economist necessarily tries to find some crumbs of comfort pointing out that india was expected to grow at the same rate as last year 7 4 percent but as we know every silver lining has a cloud and it is not for nothing that economics is known as the dismal science with a wry sense of humour the author concludes but the economy that is expected to perform best in 2019 syria with forecast growth of 9 9 is a sobering reminder that a high number can reflect the worst of starting points there is growing alarm in the ranks of the most serious bourgeois economists this alarm is well founded the total return capital gains or losses plus dividends from the s p 500 index of leading american shares was negative for the first time in a decade matters were even worse in other markets the shanghai index fell by a quarter there is a stampede of investors from risky assets including the so called emerging markets into safer havens treasury bonds and gold outstripped stocks anticipating hard times the capitalists are now hoarding cash instead of investing in production everything suggests that when it comes the next recession will be far worse than the crisis of 2008 the main reason for this is that over the last decade the bourgeoisie has used up all the instruments that have been traditionally utilised to prevent recessions or to limit their duration and depth the capitalists have basically two weapons to hand with which to confront recession the first of these is the lowering of interest rates but in their desperate attempts to climb out of the last recession they have reduced interest rates to historically unprecedented levels typically in the region of zero the scope for further rate reductions is therefore negligible even in the usa where the federal reserve has increased rates several times over the last year or so the margin for manoeuvre is still very restricted the second weapon is to increase the amount of money in circulation through intervention by the state and central banks but here there is a problem vast amounts of money were pumped into the economy over the last decade to bail out the private banks all that has been achieved has been to transform what was originally a gigantic black hole in the spreadsheets of the banks into a gigantic black hole in the public finances everywhere they have piled up huge deficits which act as a gigantic drag on the economy the bourgeoisie is struggling to reduce the debts not increase them still further given this fact there is no way that the bourgeois can yet again plunder the state in order to drag itself out of the hole the dilemma of the bourgeois is illustrated by the fact that the european central bank announced the end of monetary stimulus quantitative easing at the very time when there are signs that the european economy is slowing but the european bourgeois obsessed with the problem of brexit and immigration seem oblivious to the danger the ecb is doing the very opposite of what is needed from a capitalist point of view all this raises serious questions about the future of the euro and ultimately the eu itself the situation on the other side of the atlantic is no better the year 2019 has been celebrated by america s political rulers by an unsightly brawl that led to the partial shutdown of the government on 22 december during a televised meeting in december with nancy pelosi and chuck schumer democratic leaders in the house and senate mr trump was heard to say i will shut down the government if i don t get my wall and he was as good as his word it is true that such shutdowns have occurred before but none have lasted as long as this this reflects a deep crisis in the whole political system with a congress controlled by the democrats bitterly hostile to the president predictably an agreement has been stitched up at the last minute but trump is threatening to veto the deal and none of the underlying contradictions have been resolved to add to the general chaos there is a continuing and bitter dispute between the president and the us federal reserve as a result of the latter s insistence in raising interest rates but while the politicians bicker about economic policy the markets are set to deliver their verdict without consulting the men in washington donald trump is a man who seems to have been lucky most of his life a lucky man tends to be a gambler since past bets have been successful why not continue gambling but history shows that for every gambler the day must come when his lucky streak runs out trump had the good fortune to enter the white house at the time when the us economy was doing pretty well he could claim the credit for things that were really none of his doing but those who supported him could not see the difference his luck held he could argue with some degree of correctness that his tax cutting measures helped to boost the economy for a time but in economics as in nature sooner or later everything turns into its opposite the short term effects of president trump s stimulus package which came into force a year ago are wearing off at a time when there are clear signs of economic slowdowns in china and europe trump s imposition of tariffs and the threat of further trade disputes act as a further deterrent to investment profit forecasts have been scaled back the nervousness of the stock markets reflects concerns about the real economy the usa is about to enter the most turbulent period in its entire history and donald s lucky streak is about to come to a bumpy end a crisis of leadership society is increasingly divided between a small group of people who control the system and the overwhelming majority who are getting poorer and are in open rebellion against the system everywhere we look we see growing discontent anger fury and a hatred of the existing order this expresses itself in different ways in different countries but everywhere we see that the masses the workers and youth are beginning to move to challenge the old order and fight against it 2018 saw an upsurge in the mass movement in many different countries iran iraq tunisia spain catalonia pakistan russia togo hungary and of course france the recent events in france provide a crushing answer to all the cynics and sceptics who doubt the ability of the working class to change society like a thunderbolt from a clear blue sky the workers and youth took to the streets and in a couple of weeks brought the government to its knees if that movement had been equipped with a serious leadership it could have brought down the government and prepared the way for a root and branch transformation of french society in the absence of a clear leadership and programme it is possible that the movement will die down for a time but the underlying contradictions remain the government of macron is like a ship that has been holed below the water level it can continue to float for a while but its days are numbered the workers and youth now feel the power of collective class action they will not be bought off by partial and temporary concessions sooner or later they will move into action again this time with a clearer vision of what is needed a militant programme to kick out a hated president and to fight for a government that will act in the interests of the working class this spontaneous movement of the masses is the prior condition for socialist revolution but in and of itself it is not sufficient to guarantee success in 1938 trotsky wrote that one could reduce the crisis of humanity to the crisis of leadership of the proletariat that statement is even more true today than when it was written the history of war gives us many examples where a big army of brave soldiers has been defeated by a far smaller force of disciplined troops led by experienced officers and the war between the classes has many points of similarity with war between nations the recent events in france provide a crushing answer to all the cynics and sceptics who doubt the ability of the working class to change society image twitter cgt the cowardly evasions and half measures of the reformists far from solving the crisis will merely impart to it an even more convulsive painful and destructive character it is the task of revolutionaries to ensure that this long and painful death agony of capitalism is cut short as soon as possible and with the least possible suffering for the working class for this to occur decisive action is necessary only the marxists are capable of providing the leadership that will guarantee such a peaceful and painless outcome from the present crisis it is true that the forces of marxism on a world scale have been thrown back for a long period by objective factors the betrayals of reformism and stalinism allowed capitalism to survive but their actions were made possible by the ability of capitalism to achieve a relative stability and to make certain concessions to the working class but this period is now at an end for decades we have been swimming against the stream just to maintain our forces intact in that period was a considerable feat but now the tide of history has begun to turn instead of swimming against the current we are beginning to swim with it all the old certainties are disappearing the old illusions are gradually being burnt out of the consciousness of the working class the masses are being forced at last to face reality they are slowly beginning to draw conclusions that is our great strength and the great weakness of capitalism and reformism our international lacks the huge financial resources of the reformist parties but in the most important field we are immeasurably stronger than any other tendency in the world we have the ideas of marxism and it is the power of ideas that can change the world we must have complete confidence in our ideas programme and perspectives and confidence in the working class the only class that can change society above all we must have confidence in ourselves for if we do not do this work nobody else will do it for us
washington ap federal reserve chairman jerome powell said friday that he will not resign if asked to do so by president donald trump and that he is prepared to be patient in deciding when to raise interest rates again both of those messages cheered stock market investors who had been worried about trump s repeated attacks on his hand picked choice to lead the nation s central bank and also the fed s seemingly inexorable march to higher rates there is no pre set path for policy powell said during an appearance at a conference of economists in atlanta with the muted inflation readings we have seen coming in we will be patient as we watch to see how the economy evolves private economists viewed powell s comments as a strong signal that the fed which in december had projected another two rate hikes in 2019 may end up deciding to pause hikes for several months with chairman powell s remarks today i would say they will do just one hike or maybe no hikes this year said sung won sohn chief economist at ss economics powell is definitely trying to calm the markets wall street which opened sharply higher after a report showing 312 000 jobs gained in december surged even higher during powell s appearance the dow jones industrial average finished the day up 746 points or 3 3 percent advertisement advertisement powell called the jobs report very strong and said he was also encouraged by the rise in the labor force participation rate and gains in wages which he said for me at this time does not raise concerns about too high inflation trump has complained that the fed has pushed rates higher despite the fact that there is no evidence that inflation was getting out of control the president s attacks had become so intense that they had raised concerns that he might be considering firing powell a development which could send the market into a tailspin trump would appear to be on shaky legal ground if he tried to fire powell under the law that governs the federal reserve a president can only remove a fed chairman for cause courts in cases that involved other agencies have interpreted that language to not cover policy differences advertisement advertisement asked if he would resign if trump asked him to do so powell responded with a short no powell s willingness to be flexible on interest rates was welcome news to investors many of whom worried that fed chair risked cutting off the current economic expansion by continuing to raise interest rates despite signs the u s economy was cooling off a little on friday powell said we are always prepared to shift the stance of policy and to shift it significantly if necessary to meet the goals of maximum employment and stable prices powell gave as an example the fact that in 2016 when janet yellen was fed chair the central bank began the year with a projection that it would raise rates four times that year but ended up raising rates only once because the economy hit a soft patch advertisement advertisement appearing on a panel with his two predecessors yellen and ben bernanke powell also said that the fed could alter its approach to trimming its huge balance sheet if it determines such a change is needed the pace of fed rate hikes and the lowering of the balance sheet which tends to put upward pressure on interest rates had both been concerns of investors in recent months the stock market has seen stomach churning declines since october a development that trump has blamed on the fed s continued rate hikes although the president s trade dispute with china as well as concerns about global economic growth also played a part in the market volatility the fed had increased the size of its balance sheet four fold to a record 4 5 trillion in an effort to push long term interest rates lower but it has been gradually reversing that stance over the past year although the balance sheet still remains above 4 trillion but some investors have worried that that process could push long term rates higher at a time when the economy was slowing powell on friday stressed that the fed was prepared to adjust the pace at which it trimmed the balance sheet if necessary to support economic growth advertisement advertisement while trump has sent out a number of tweets criticizing powell and calling the fed the biggest threat to the economy powell said that he had not received any direct pressure from the white house asked if he had had any face to face meetings with trump powell said he had not although he said previous fed leaders have had discussions from time to time with previous presidents asked if any future meeting with trump was scheduled powell said i have no news on that nothing is scheduled

stocks showed a substantial move to the upside over the course of the trading day on friday more than offsetting the sharp pullback seen in the previous session the major averages all moved significantly higher with the tech heavy nasdaq leading the way the major averages moved roughly sideways going into the close holding on to strong gains the dow surged up 746 94 points or 3 3 percent to 23 433 16 the nasdaq soared 275 35 points or 4 3 percent to 6 738 86 and the s p 500 spiked 84 05 points or 3 4 percent to 2 531 94 with the rally on the day the major averages also moved notably higher for the week while the dow jumped by 1 6 percent the nasdaq and the s p 500 shot up by 2 3 percent and 1 9 percent respectively the rebound on wall street partly reflected a positive reaction to a labor department report showing much stronger than expected job growth in the month of december the labor department said non farm payroll employment soared by 312 000 jobs in december after climbing by an upwardly revised 176 000 jobs in november economists had expected employment to increase by about 177 000 jobs compared to the addition of 155 000 jobs originally reported for the previous month paul ashworth chief u s economist at capital economics suggested the substantial job growth in december would seem to make a mockery of market fears of an impending recession admittedly employment is a coincident indicator whereas the ism manufacturing index which we learned yesterday fell sharply in december is a leading indicator ashworth said he added but even allowing for that distinction this employment report suggests the u s still has considerable forward momentum the report also said the unemployment rate rose to 3 9 percent in december from 3 7 percent in november while economists had expected the unemployment rate to come in unchanged however the unexpected uptick by the unemployment rate came as the labor force jumped by 419 000 people compared to a much more modest 142 000 person increase in the household survey measure of employment the labor department said average hourly employee earnings payrolls climbed by 11 cents to 27 48 in december reflecting a 3 2 percent increase compared to the same month a year ago the annual rate of growth in average hourly employee earnings in december accelerated from the 3 1 percent increase seen in november reaching its highest level since april of 2009 even as the jobs data offset recent concerns about the u s economy federal reserve chairman jerome powell noted the central bank will be patient with monetary policy as it watches the economy evolve powell stressed that monetary policy is not on a preset path after the fed raised interest rates four times in 2018 and forecast two rate hikes in the new year particularly with muted inflation readings that we ve seen coming in we will be patient as we watch to see how the economy evolves powell said the fed chief said the central bank is always prepared to significantly shift the stance of monetary policy if incoming economic data does not meet expectations powell s comments came as part of a joint discussion with former fed chairs janet yellen and ben bernanke at the american economic association and allied social science association annual meeting in atlanta the rally on wall street also came after china s commerce ministry said china and the u s would hold vice ministerial level trade talks in beijing next week sector news partly reflecting optimism about trade talks between the u s and china steel stocks turned in some of the market s best performances reflecting the strength in the sector the nyse arca steel index surged up by 6 4 percent considerable strength was also visible among biotechnology stocks as reflected by the 5 3 percent jump by the nyse arca biotechnology index regeneron pharmaceuticals regn posted a standout gain after guggenheim partners upgraded its rating on the biotech company s stock to buy from neutral oil service stocks also showed a substantial move to the upside on the day driving the philadelphia oil service index up by 4 6 percent the strength in the sector came as the price of crude oil for february delivery climbed 0 87 to 47 96 software semiconductor and computer hardware stocks also saw significant strength contributing to the rally by the tech heavy nasdaq most of the other major sectors also moved higher amid broad based buying interest other markets in overseas trading stock across the asia pacific region turned in a mixed performance during trading on friday japan s nikkei 225 index plummeted by 2 3 percent while hong kong s hang seng index soared by 2 2 percent meanwhile the major european markets all showed strong moves to the upside on the day while the german dax index spiked by 3 4 percent the french cac 40 index and the u k s ftse 100 index shot up by 2 7 percent and 2 2 percent respectively in the bond market treasuries pulled back sharply after trending higher in recent sessions as a result the yield on the benchmark ten year note which moves opposite of its price jumped by 10 5 basis points to 2 659 percent looking ahead next week s trading may be

acting as if a recession was on the horizon despite a lack of evidence that the u s economy is struggling it s hard to square recession worries with the strongest job growth we ve seen in years said alec young managing director of global markets research for ftse russell stocks rose even further after federal reserve chairman jerome powell said the central bank will be flexible in deciding if and when it raises interest rates he added that the fed is open to making changes in the way it shrinks its giant portfolio of bonds which affects rates on long term loans such as mortgages until recently the fed had suggested it planned to raise short term interest rates three times this year and next and powell said the fed s balance sheet was shrinking on auto pilot wall street feared that the fed might be moving too fast in raising borrowing costs said phil orlando chief equity market strategist at federated investors the fed s interest rate and bond portfolio policies were at the top of the

updated at 6 29 p m et facing staggering liability costs for its potential culpability in a series of deadly wildfires the parent company of california s largest utility is exploring whether to sell off a major part of the company npr has learned internally pacific gas electric has dubbed this strategy project falcon under the plan the company would sell its natural gas division this spring after years of deadly errors and safety violations the utility giant is looking for ways to cover liability costs and avoid bankruptcy a senior company official and a former employee with knowledge of the plan tell npr all net proceeds from the sale of pg e s gas division would be used to set up a fund to pay billions of dollars in potential claims from wildfires the sources said they requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly the company also is exploring selling key real estate assets including its san francisco headquarters and moving its operations elsewhere in the bay area the sources say on friday the company announced it would be reviewing structural options to best position the company to meet customer and operational needs in addition pg e said it is searching for new directors for its board to augment its existing expertise in safety pg e declined to make any senior leaders available to comment on project falcon a written statement from spokesman andy castagnola said safety is and will continue to be our top priority as we work to determine the best path forward for all of our stakeholders pg e remains fully committed to helping our customers and the affected communities recover and rebuild and to doing everything we can to reduce the risk of future wildfires wildfire damages in june the state s fire agency cal fire determined that pg e power equipment was responsible for sparking at least a dozen major fires across northern california in 2017 and now regulators are investigating whether pg e equipment sparked november s camp fire the deadliest and most destructive in state history the company could end up having to pay billions from legal action stemming from the 2017 and 2018 wildfire seasons equity analysts project that pg e s damages from the wildfires could exceed pg e s market value and its insurance coverage one citigroup analyst estimates the company could be on the hook forup to 15 billion in damages insurance companies allstate state farm and usaahave filed lawsuits against pg e blaming the utility for the camp fire the gas sale strategy would have to be approved by the state regulatory agency the california public utilities commission which has already expressed deep concerns about pg e s shoddy safety record lack of transparency and past efforts to pass liability costs on to the state s ratepayers so far state regulators and lawmakers have been kept out of pg e s planning loop for project falcon named for a group of peregrine falcons nesting on the roof of the company s headquarters the current and former pg e officials say they re speaking with npr out of concern that senior management is not acting in the best interests of ratepayers safety and the state there s a public trust element in being a utility monopoly said the senior company official bailout pg e is under no legal obligation to disclose its internal discussions about ways to stave off bankruptcy but given the potential impact on ratepayers and taxpayers if the utility eventually needs a bailout michael wara a lawyer and research scholar at stanford university calls the lack of transparency extremely disappointing they need to be thinking very hard about how to create safety for californians rather than how to make money for shareholders when they re not being totally transparent especially in the current context where there s a lack of trust and so many people that have been harmed by pg e s infrastructure wara said what california urgently needs and wants from its utilities right now is hard thinking about how to better protect communities from fire and it s hard to see that going on wara added what california urgently needs and wants from its utilities right now is hard thinking about how to better protect communities from fire and it s hard to see that going on wall street wants to see hard thinking too steve fleishman senior utilities analyst and a managing director at wolfe research said pg e s plan for dealing with fires in the future is unclear they clearly seem to be more at risk for that fleishman said this kind of risk profile is not sustainable pg e s stock is down about 50 percent since the camp fire broke out on nov 8 consumer watchdog groups want any big move done with transparency anything pg e wants to propose should be done in an open public manner and include a comprehensive coherent wildfire mitigation strategy says mark toney the executive director of the utility reform network there is widespread anger in the state over pg e s shoddy safety record protests broke out at recent public oversight meetings and at the company s san francisco headquarters where environmentalists and activists read the names of the more than 100 people combined who died in the camp fire and 2017 s wildfires in napa and sonoma counties at one customer service center the company has installed bulletproof glass serious safety problems in late december state regulators said they were considering several proposals in response to ongoing concerns about the utility s role in a deadly gas explosion in 2010 and in the more recent wildfires pg e has had serious safety problems with both its gas and electric operations for many years the california public utilities commission said in a statement possible changes put forth by the commission include splitting up the gas and electric divisions and either making the company a public utility or making the company s return on equity contingent on safety performance we must be careful and practical the commission s president michael picker said in a statement last month this process will be like repairing a jetliner while it s in flight crashing a plane to make it safer isn t good for the passengers the commission declined further comment for this story a spokesman said only that state regulators are looking at a range of options for the utility we must be careful and practical this process will be like repairing a jetliner while it s in flight crashing a plane to make it safer isn t good for the passengers in a separate development the state s top law enforcement official attorney general xavier becerra said in a court filingin late december that pg e could face criminal charges up to murder if it s found liable in any of the recent deadly california wildfires pg e was convicted of felony safety violations in a gas line explosion in 2010 in a san francisco suburb that killed eight people and destroyed a neighborhood the federal judge overseeing the utility s five year criminal probation in that case had asked becerra s opinion on whether pg e s possible role in the recent wildfires constitutes a probation violation the stakes a sale would have big implications for the company which supplies electricity and gas to more than 5 million california households and has more than 20 000 employees pg e s natural gas assets account for between 20 percent to 30 percent of the company the company sources who spoke to npr and provided supporting documents say the planning for project falcon began shortly after the 2017 wine country fires and picked up again in earnest this past june when cal fire determined that pg e was responsible for at least a dozen northern california fires the planning the sources say has accelerated since the camp fire the sources also said the company would like to present its own plan before one is imposed by regulators california applies inverse condemnation to utilities meaning they can be held liable for damage even if they are not found negligent structuring the deal pg e shareholders and institutional investors may welcome a gas sale as a way to cover at least in part wildfire liabilities as part of the gas sale plan all gross proceeds from the sale would go into the wildfire fund with no direct shareholder benefit from cash according to the pg e source but shareholders could get new shares in the company that purchases the gas arm regulators and lawmakers may argue that a deal should be structured to solely benefit wildfire victims and that any deal should come with protections for ratepayers we need to be asking ourselves hard questions as a state as to whether a settlement in bankruptcy might be better than something we get through this gas sale warns wara the stanford researcher the inside sources say the company is hoping to get between 10 7 billion and 15 5 billion for its gas assets given the company s safety liability and political challenges including new allegations last month that the company violated safety regulations analysts say it s not at all clear they would get that on the open market in mid december state regulators found that pg e had systematically falsified safety documents and broke safety rules related to its natural gas operations over a five year period at the time pg e spokesman matt nauman said in an emailed statement to npr that the company is committed to accurate and thorough reporting and record keeping and we didn t live up to that commitment in this case this comes on the heels of a 1 6 billion finefrom regulators the largest in state history and six felonyconvictions related to 2010 san bruno explosion travis miller senior utilities equity strategist at morningstar is skeptical that a potential gas sell off would fly with regulators or wall street he said he doesn t think another utility would step forward to buy the gas assets you may get a good price but it also carries with it a lot of regulatory and political risk miller says there s no good outcome for ratepayers under any scenario and not an ideal outcome for shareholders either project falcon and the camp fire the company s fiscal woes deepened in the wake of november s camp fire in butte county calif which killed at least 85 people and displaced tens of thousands who continue to face a desperate housing crisis paradise and neighboring towns were all but wiped out the cause of the fire is still under investigation by the state s fire agency cal fire pg e has told state regulators that it experienced problems on two sections of its electric system near where the camp fire erupted the company faces nearly two dozen lawsuits from fire victims over its possible culpability for the camp fire including allegations of possible equipment failures and poor maintenance in one lawsuit residents accuse the company of prioritizing advertising spending over fire and public safety now it s clear there are problems on both sides of the business says steve fleishman an analyst with wolfe research referring to the gas and electric divisions fleishman says a gas sale and new management on the electric side might allow pg e leaders to focus solely on improving safety i think the company is willing do anything structurally if they think it can help with safety fleishman says analysts warn that the company risks running out of access to capital not just because of present liability but also because of the risk of future catastrophic fires a specter sharpened by climate change and a century of fire suppression policy in the nation s forests the company in november said it had exhausted its revolving credit lines and the ratings agencies moody s investor service and s p have downgraded the company s credit rating to near junk status approval process will be complicated internal pg e planning documents on the potential sale labeled privileged and confidential show that company officials are concerned about regulatory approval the cpuc approval process will be complicated and lengthy so phasing the proceeding to obtain early decisions on matters that are crucial to the viability of the transaction is desirable one document reads while the gas sale would cover some liabilities the legislature also may be asked to step in state lawmakers partially shielded the company for liability claims in 2017 with a bill that critics called a bailout analysts and consumer advocates worry that lawmakers may expand that protection for this year and beyond putting taxpayers and ratepayers on the hook ultimately we re going to be left holding the bag says michael wara of stanford university if pg e can t pay all of these costs then it s the california taxpayer that ultimately will but some lawmakers are already balking state sen bill dodd who originally supported shielding pg e from liability costs related to fires in 2017 has lost patience with the company pg e has demonstrated a pattern of poor management and illegal conduct that has shattered lives across california dodd said in an emailed statement he called for systemic change which must include change on the board of directors and in the executive suite

if you think southern b c cities are the only ones experiencing declining sales and prices think again way out here on the best coast it s easy to think of ourselves living in something of a separated off bubble and that when it comes to real estate in the south of the province the bubble looks to be deflating but the fact is that b c s biggest cities are among many around the globe that are currently experiencing a real estate market slowdown most of us are aware that the greater toronto area is also in the property doldrums with sales in 2018 down 18 per cent year over year similar to that of greater victoria and vancouver island down 20 and 19 per cent respectively but not as steep as metro vancouver s 31 6 per cent annual decline the average 2018 home resale price in our country s biggest city is also down 4 7 per cent over the previous year but what about the rest of the world property markets in major global centres are also on the slide most notably in pricey cities such as hong kong shanghai beijing singapore london and sydney in hong kong and mainland china s biggest cities prices are steadily declining with prices in beijing and shanghai around five per cent off their peak of around six months ago largely due to a slowing chinese economy affected by trade wars with the u s in london and across the u k uncertainty over brexit has sidelined homebuyers and london property prices have fallen for two consecutive years in australia s biggest city unsustainably high prices along with a pullback in demand from mainland chinese buyers have combined to drag real estate markets down over the past year with prices down more than 11 per cent in sydney according to corelogic plus singapore s prices have been hit by increased taxation and new mortgage rules bloomberg published a fascinating story on this topic january 3 and identified that even as each slowing market has its own set of characteristics most of them also have a few factors in common 1 tougher government regulations on mortgages and finances these range from the mortgage stress test in canada to stricter loan to value ratios in singapore to limits on how much money can leave mainland china 2 rising interest rates canada is far from the only country to see increased borrowing costs the bank of england led by former bank of canada governor mark carney has been similarly making incremental hikes over the past year or so and rates in singapore have risen several times over the past year with more hikes predicted in 2019 australia s reserve bank however has maintained record low rates and prices are still dropping there too 3 unpredictable stock markets with the world s markets fluctuating wildly much of which uncertainty is linked to u s china trade wars investors around the globe are unsure where things will land and are keeping a low profile 4 diminishing demand from china property markets in most pacific rim cities whether in north america australasia or asia are affected by the wobbling chinese economy and a tightening of rules on how much money is allowed to flow out of mainland china bloomberg cites an april 2018 international monetary fund study which issued a warning on the effect of simultaneous global real estate market corrections the imf wrote that such a phenomenon could lead to financial and macroeconomic instability however a glimmer of hope for global economic stability was issued today january 4 as major stock markets made a sudden recovery on the news of renewed trade talks between china and the u s it may seem like some consolation that b c cities are not alone in their housing market decline after all it makes for a more level playing field globally speaking but from a macro economic viewpoint it s not such a good thing

new york ap global stocks are soaring friday and reversing the big losses they suffered just a day earlier the dow jones industrial average soared 700 points in the latest twist in a wild three months for markets hopes for progress in the u s china trade dispute a strong report on the u s jobs market and encouraging comments from the head of the u s central bank about its interest rate policy all combined to cheer investors china s commerce ministry said trade talks will be held monday and tuesday in beijing and investors will once again look for signs the world s largest economic powers will make progress toward resolving their dispute the tensions have dragged on for nearly a year slowing business and dragging down stock indexes worldwide meanwhile the labor department said u s employers added 312 000 jobs last month a far stronger result than experts had anticipated u s stocks have tumbled over the last three months as investors worried that the economy might slow down dramatically because of a variety of challenges including the trade dispute and rising interest rates the stock market s plunge also threatened to shake up the confidence and the spending plans of businesses and consumers some analysts said investors were acting as if a recession was on the horizon despite a lack of evidence that the u s economy is struggling it s hard to square recession worries with the strongest job growth we ve seen in years said alec young managing director of global markets research for ftse russell stocks rose even further after federal reserve chairman jerome powell said the central bank will be flexible in deciding if and when it raises interest rates he added that the fed is open to making changes in the way it shrinks its giant portfolio of bonds which affects rates on long term loans such as mortgages until recently the fed had suggested it planned to raise short term interest rates three times this year and next and powell said the fed s balance sheet was shrinking on auto pilot wall street feared that the fed might be moving too fast in raising borrowing costs said phil orlando chief equity market strategist at federated investors the fed s interest rate and bond portfolio policies were at the top of the list of things we were concerned about which is why the statement powell made today is so supportive of the market orlando said the fed understands that what they attempted to communicate last month was inartful that they didn t get the right message across and powell tried to reset the s p 500 index climbed 76 points or 3 1 percent

published on january 4 2019 12 41 pm written by 0 shares share tweet linkedin email ap federal reserve chairman jerome powell said friday that he will not resign if asked to do so by president donald trump and that he is prepared to be patient in deciding when to raise interest rates again both of those messages cheered stock market investors who had been worried about trump s repeated attacks on his hand picked choice to lead the nation s central bank and also the fed s seemingly inexorable march to higher rates there is no pre set path for policy powell said during an appearance at a conference of economists in atlanta with the muted inflation readings we have seen coming in we will be patient as we watch to see how the economy evolves private economists viewed powell s comments as a strong signal that the fed which in december had projected another two rate hikes in 2019 may end up deciding to pause hikes for several months with chairman powell s remarks today i would say they will do just one hike or maybe no hikes this year said sung won sohn chief economist at ss economics powell is definitely trying to calm the markets wall street which opened sharply higher after a report showing 312 000 jobs gained in december surged even higher during powell s appearance the dow jones industrial average was up around 700 points near the close powell called the jobs report very strong and said he was also encouraged by the rise in the labor force participation rate and gains in wages which he said for me at this time does not raise concerns about too high inflation trump has complained that the fed has pushed rates higher despite the fact that there is no evidence that inflation was getting out of control the president s attacks had become so intense that they had raised concerns that he might be considering firing powell a development which could send the market into a tailspin trump would appear to be on shaky legal ground if he tried to fire powell under the law that governs the federal reserve a president can only remove a fed chairman for cause courts in cases that involved other agencies have interpreted that language to not cover policy differences asked if he would resign if trump asked him to do so powell responded with a short no powell s willingness to be flexible on interest rates was welcome news to investors many of whom worried that fed chair risked cutting off the current economic expansion by continuing to raise interest rates despite signs the u s economy was cooling off a little on friday powell said we are always prepared to shift the stance of policy and to shift it significantly if necessary to meet the goals of maximum employment and stable prices powell gave as an example the fact that in 2016 when janet yellen was fed chair the central bank began the year with a projection that it would raise rates four times that year but ended up raising rates only once because the economy hit a soft patch appearing on a panel with his two predecessors yellen and ben bernanke powell also said that the fed could alter its approach to trimming its huge balance sheet if it determines such a change is needed the pace of fed rate hikes and the lowering of the balance sheet which tends to put upward pressure on interest rates had both been concerns of investors in recent months the stock market has seen stomach churning declines since october a development that trump has blamed on the fed s continued rate hikes although the president s trade dispute with china as well as concerns about global economic growth also played a part in the market volatility the fed had increased the size of its balance sheet four fold to a record 4 5 trillion in an effort to push long term interest rates lower but it has been gradually reversing that stance over the past year although the balance sheet still remains above 4 trillion but some investors have worried that that process could push long term rates higher at a time when the economy was slowing powell on friday stressed that the fed was prepared to adjust the pace at which it trimmed the balance sheet if necessary to support economic growth while trump has sent out a number of tweets criticizing powell and calling the fed the biggest threat to the economy powell said that he had not received any direct pressure from the white house asked if he had had any face to face meetings with trump powell said he had not although he said previous fed leaders have had discussions from time to time with previous presidents asked if any future meeting with trump was scheduled powell said i have no news on that nothing is scheduled

updated at 6 29 p m et facing staggering liability costs for its potential culpability in a series of deadly wildfires the parent company of california s largest utility is exploring whether to sell off a major part of the company npr has learned internally pacific gas electric has dubbed this strategy project falcon under the plan the company would sell its natural gas division this spring after years of deadly errors and safety violations the utility giant is looking for ways to cover liability costs and avoid bankruptcy a senior company official and a former employee with knowledge of the plan tell npr all net proceeds from the sale of pg e s gas division would be used to set up a fund to pay billions of dollars in potential claims from wildfires the sources said they requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly the company also is exploring selling key real estate assets including its san francisco headquarters and moving its operations elsewhere in the bay area the sources say on friday the company announced it would be reviewing structural options to best position the company to meet customer and operational needs in addition pg e said it is searching for new directors for its board to augment its existing expertise in safety pg e declined to make any senior leaders available to comment on project falcon a written statement from spokesman andy castagnola said safety is and will continue to be our top priority as we work to determine the best path forward for all of our stakeholders pg e remains fully committed to helping our customers and the affected communities recover and rebuild and to doing everything we can to reduce the risk of future wildfires wildfire damages in june the state s fire agency cal fire determined that pg e power equipment was responsible for sparking at least a dozen major fires across northern california in 2017 and now regulators are investigating whether pg e equipment sparked november s camp fire the deadliest and most destructive in state history the company could end up having to pay billions from legal action stemming from the 2017 and 2018 wildfire seasons equity analysts project that pg e s damages from the wildfires could exceed pg e s market value and its insurance coverage one citigroup analyst estimates the company could be on the hook for up to 15 billion in damages insurance companies allstate state farm and usaa have filed lawsuits against pg e blaming the utility for the camp fire the gas sale strategy would have to be approved by the state regulatory agency the california public utilities commission which has already expressed deep concerns about pg e s shoddy safety record lack of transparency and past efforts to pass liability costs on to the state s ratepayers so far state regulators and lawmakers have been kept out of pg e s planning loop for project falcon named for a group of peregrine falcons nesting on the roof of the company s headquarters the current and former pg e officials say they re speaking with npr out of concern that senior management is not acting in the best interests of ratepayers safety and the state there s a public trust element in being a utility monopoly said the senior company official bailout pg e is under no legal obligation to disclose its internal discussions about ways to stave off bankruptcy but given the potential impact on ratepayers and taxpayers if the utility eventually needs a bailout michael wara a lawyer and research scholar at stanford university calls the lack of transparency extremely disappointing they need to be thinking very hard about how to create safety for californians rather than how to make money for shareholders when they re not being totally transparent especially in the current context where there s a lack of trust and so many people that have been harmed by pg e s infrastructure wara said what california urgently needs and wants from its utilities right now is hard thinking about how to better protect communities from fire and it s hard to see that going on wara added what california urgently needs and wants from its utilities right now is hard thinking about how to better protect communities from fire and it s hard to see that going on wall street wants to see hard thinking too steve fleishman senior utilities analyst and a managing director at wolfe research said pg e s plan for dealing with fires in the future is unclear they clearly seem to be more at risk for that fleishman said this kind of risk profile is not sustainable pg e s stock is down about 50 percent since the camp fire broke out on nov 8 consumer watchdog groups want any big move done with transparency anything pg e wants to propose should be done in an open public manner and include a comprehensive coherent wildfire mitigation strategy says mark toney the executive director of the utility reform network there is widespread anger in the state over pg e s shoddy safety record protests broke out at recent public oversight meetings and at the company s san francisco headquarters where environmentalists and activists read the names of the more than 100 people combined who died in the camp fire and 2017 s wildfires in napa and sonoma counties at one customer service center the company has installed bulletproof glass serious safety problems in late december state regulators said they were considering several proposals in response to ongoing concerns about the utility s role in a deadly gas explosion in 2010 and in the more recent wildfires pg e has had serious safety problems with both its gas and electric operations for many years the california public utilities commission said in a statement possible changes put forth by the commission include splitting up the gas and electric divisions and either making the company a public utility or making the company s return on equity contingent on safety performance we must be careful and practical the commission s president michael picker said in a statement last month this process will be like repairing a jetliner while it s in flight crashing a plane to make it safer isn t good for the passengers the commission declined further comment for this story a spokesman said only that state regulators are looking at a range of options for the utility we must be careful and practical this process will be like repairing a jetliner while it s in flight crashing a plane to make it safer isn t good for the passengers in a separate development the state s top law enforcement official attorney general xavier becerra said in a court filingin late december that pg e could face criminal charges up to murder if it s found liable in any of the recent deadly california wildfires pg e was convicted of felony safety violations in a gas line explosion in 2010 in a san francisco suburb that killed eight people and destroyed a neighborhood the federal judge overseeing the utility s five year criminal probation in that case had asked becerra s opinion on whether pg e s possible role in the recent wildfires constitutes a probation violation the stakes a sale would have big implications for the company which supplies electricity and gas to more than 5 million california households and has more than 20 000 employees pg e s natural gas assets account for between 20 percent to 30 percent of the company the company sources who spoke to npr and provided supporting documents say the planning for project falcon began shortly after the 2017 wine country fires and picked up again in earnest this past june when cal fire determined that pg e was responsible for at least a dozen northern california fires the planning the sources say has accelerated since the camp fire the sources also said the company would like to present its own plan before one is imposed by regulators california applies inverse condemnation to utilities meaning they can be held liable for damage even if they are not found negligent structuring the deal pg e shareholders and institutional investors may welcome a gas sale as a way to cover at least in part wildfire liabilities as part of the gas sale plan all gross proceeds from the sale would go into the wildfire fund with no direct shareholder benefit from cash according to the pg e source but shareholders could get new shares in the company that purchases the gas arm regulators and lawmakers may argue that a deal should be structured to solely benefit wildfire victims and that any deal should come with protections for ratepayers we need to be asking ourselves hard questions as a state as to whether a settlement in bankruptcy might be better than something we get through this gas sale warns wara the stanford researcher the inside sources say the company is hoping to get between 10 7 billion and 15 5 billion for its gas assets given the company s safety liability and political challenges including new allegations last month that the company violated safety regulations analysts say it s not at all clear they would get that on the open market in mid december state regulators found that pg e had systematically falsified safety documents and broke safety rules related to its natural gas operations over a five year period at the time pg e spokesman matt nauman said in an emailed statement to npr that the company is committed to accurate and thorough reporting and record keeping and we didn t live up to that commitment in this case this comes on the heels of a 1 6 billion finefrom regulators the largest in state history and six felonyconvictions related to 2010 san bruno explosion travis miller senior utilities equity strategist at morningstar is skeptical that a potential gas sell off would fly with regulators or wall street he said he doesn t think another utility would step forward to buy the gas assets you may get a good price but it also carries with it a lot of regulatory and political risk miller says there s no good outcome for ratepayers under any scenario and not an ideal outcome for shareholders either project falcon and the camp fire the company s fiscal woes deepened in the wake of november s camp fire in butte county calif which killed at least 85 people and displaced tens of thousands who continue to face a desperate housing crisis paradise and neighboring towns were all but wiped out the cause of the fire is still under investigation by the state s fire agency cal fire pg e has told state regulators that it experienced problems on two sections of its electric system near where the camp fire erupted the company faces nearly two dozen lawsuits from fire victims over its possible culpability for the camp fire including allegations of possible equipment failures and poor maintenance in one lawsuit residents accuse the company of prioritizing advertising spending over fire and public safety now it s clear there are problems on both sides of the business says steve fleishman an analyst with wolfe research referring to the gas and electric divisions fleishman says a gas sale and new management on the electric side might allow pg e leaders to focus solely on improving safety i think the company is willing do anything structurally if they think it can help with safety fleishman says analysts warn that the company risks running out of access to capital not just because of present liability but also because of the risk of future catastrophic fires a specter sharpened by climate change and a century of fire suppression policy in the nation s forests the company in november said it had exhausted its revolving credit lines and the ratings agencies moody s investor service and s p have downgraded the company s credit rating to near junk status approval process will be complicated internal pg e planning documents on the potential sale labeled privileged and confidential show that company officials are concerned about regulatory approval the cpuc approval process will be complicated and lengthy so phasing the proceeding to obtain early decisions on matters that are crucial to the viability of the transaction is desirable one document reads while the gas sale would cover some liabilities the legislature also may be asked to step in state lawmakers partially shielded the company for liability claims in 2017 with a bill that critics called a bailout analysts and consumer advocates worry that lawmakers may expand that protection for this year and beyond putting taxpayers and ratepayers on the hook ultimately we re going to be left holding the bag says michael wara of stanford university if pg e can t pay all of these costs then it s the california taxpayer that ultimately will but some lawmakers are already balking state sen bill dodd who originally supported shielding pg e from liability costs related to fires in 2017 has lost patience with the company pg e has demonstrated a pattern of poor management and illegal conduct that has shattered lives across california dodd said in an emailed statement he called for systemic change which must include change on the board of directors and in the executive suite

washington white house officials and congressional staffers will continue negotiations saturday over the government shutdown even after u s president donald trump declared he could keep it going for months or even years trump met friday with congressional leaders from both parties as the shutdown hit the two week mark amid an impasse over his demand for billions of dollars for a border wall with mexico democrats emerged from the meeting which both sides said was contentious at times to report little if any progress trump has designated vice president mike pence homeland security secretary kirstjen nielsen and adviser jared kushner to work with a congressional delegation at a meeting set for 11 a m saturday trump is framing the upcoming weekend talks as progress while democrats are emphasizing families unable to pay bills the standoff has prompted economic jitters and anxiety among some in trump s own party but he appeared friday in the rose garden to frame the weekend talks as progress while making clear he would not reopen the government we won t be opening until it s solved trump said i don t call it a shutdown i call it doing what you have to do for the benefit and the safety of our country trump said he could declare a national emergency to build the wall without congressional approval but would first try a negotiated process trump previously described the situation at the border as a national emergency before he dispatched active duty troops in what critics described as a pre election stunt trump also said the hundreds of thousands of federal workers who are furloughed or working without pay would want him to keep going and fight for border security asked how people would manage without a financial safety net he declared the safety net is going to be having a strong border because we re going to be safe democrats called on trump to reopen the government while negotiations continue senate democratic minority leader chuck schumer said it s very hard to see how progress will be made unless they open up the government friday s white house meeting with trump included eight congressional leaders the top two democrats and republicans of both chambers people familiar with the session but not authorized to speak publicly described trump as holding forth at length on a range of subjects but said he made clear he was firm in his demand for 5 6 billion in wall funding and in rejecting the democrats request to reopen the government trump confirmed that he privately told democrats the shutdown could drag on for months or years though he said he hoped it wouldn t last that long said trump i hope it doesn t go on even beyond a few more days house democrats muscled through legislation thursday night to fund the government but not trump s proposed wall however senate majority leader mitch mcconnell has said those measures are non starters on his side of the capitol without the president s support a variety of strategies are being floated inside and outside the white house among them trading wall funding for a deal on immigrants brought to the country as young people and now here illegally or using a national emergency declaration to build the wall while trump made clear during his press conference that talk on daca the deferred action for childhood arrivals program would have to wait and that he was trying to negotiate with congress on the wall the conversations underscored rising republican anxiety about just how to exit the shutdown some gop senators up for re election in 2020 including cory gardner of colorado and susan collins of maine have voiced discomfort with the shutdown in recent days but with staff level talks there is always an open question of whether trump s aides are fully empowered to negotiate for the president earlier this week he rejected his own administration s offer to accept 2 5 billion for the wall that proposal was made when pence and other top officials met with schumer at the start of the shutdown during his free wheeling session with reporters trump also wrongly claimed that he d never called for the wall to be concrete trump did so repeatedly during his campaign describing a wall of pre cast concrete sections that would be higher than the walls of many of his rally venues he repeated that promise just days ago an all concrete wall was never abandoned as has been reported by the media some areas will be all concrete but the experts at border patrol prefer a wall that is see through thereby making it possible to see what is happening on both sides makes sense to me he tweeted dec 31 trump was joined by pence in the rose garden as well as house republican leaders kevin mccarthy and steve scalise mcconnell who went back to the capitol unaware of the press conference said it was encouraging that the white house officials and the congressional contingent would meet over the weekend to see if they can reach an agreement and then punt it back to us for final sign off schumer said that if mcconnell and senate republicans stay on the sidelines trump can keep the government shut down for a long time the president needs an intervention schumer said and senate republicans are just the right ones to intervene adding to national unease about the shutdown are economic jitters as analysts warn of the risks of closures that are disrupting government operations across multiple departments and agencies at a time of other uncertainties in the stock market and foreign trade associated press writers alan fram mary clare jalonick laurie kellman kevin freking matthew daly deb riechmann and eileen putman contributed
newly sworn in speaker nancy pelosi may have found a way to tame the savage beast that is donald trump the mother of five knows not to negotiate with an unreasonable child i am in the white house waiting for the democrats to come on over and make a deal on border security trump tweeted like the reality show host he was not long ago pelosi on vacation with family in hawaii hung out a do not disturb sign while the president was forced by the optics of the shutdown he named after himself to forego as much as a working round of golf with his sometime bro sen lindsey graham they were reduced to lunch two weeks is a long time to stew the ball had hardly fallen in times square before trump summoned the newly sworn in speaker and senate minority leader chuck schumer to the white house for a briefing which differs from a meeting in that the format is a lecture not a dialogue having lost the last encounter with cameras rolling trump presided over this one in the electronics free situation room so we may never know who said what to whom in the driveway right after pelosi speaking first said the house would pass a bill that the senate previously approved that would reopen the government and allow for a 30 day cooling off period to negotiate border security for its part the white house reiterated its position that pelosi s offer is a non starter whatever as pelosi warned in the oval office weeks ago she has the votes to pass her bill and intends to do so the upper chamber s republican leadership quickly did trump s bidding and announced they won t take up the house bill but individual members republican senators cory gardner and susan collins have already broken with trump know enough to want the shutdown over it s a new day there after trump s acolytes dropped like flies in the midterms trump may not have absorbed the shellacking he took but sen mitch mcconnell has that sound you hear is a back channel being dug between his office and pelosi s for the moment there are more cracks in the republican wall figuratively and literally than in pelosi s the white house is busy defining trump s wall down it s slatted it s virtual it s drones it s already provided by mother nature s impassable terrain mick mulvaney his acting chief of staff budget director and pastry chef should the current one suddenly resign once called shutdowns childish sen lamar alexander who usually sides with trump said government shutdowns should be as off limits to budget negotiations as chemical weapons are to warfare vice president mike pence and sen graham have floated modified proposals smart people want it to end even trump who has no exit strategy is starting to crack under the strain sometimes he says the wall s unbuilt and other times mostly built it s made of concrete but border guards will be able to see through it he ll build it round or flat steel or rebar just give him the money although trump said pelosi had to do what he wanted to be elected speaker he never had any such leverage true pelosi has new members walking on the left shoulder of the road to satisfy there s a desire to make trump pay for his egregious behavior and there are large gaps in trump and pelosi s respective views of the world witness the wall it s also hard to cut deals with someone who lies as he breathes she still feels the sting from their famous negotiations over chinese food when he promised protection for dreamers in a bill of love in exchange for money for his wall he reneged before they had time to get hungry again yet pelosi believes deeply that it s better to work with republican presidents as she s done before than against them she respects the office if not the man and you are unlikely to hear any more careless cracks about trump s manhood she s more protective of the office than he is suggesting that he ask the press to leave their oval office meeting before he took credit on camera for any shutdown trump hasn t taken after pelosi the way he pummels everyone else calling her nancy not cryin chuck schumer or low iq whomever amazingly he didn t start a war after she corrected his false claim at their first white house meeting that he d won the popular vote even after he heard she d questioned his manliness just before the holidays he said that the two of them could work together to avert a shutdown the strain on trump was obvious in a wild stream of consciousness performance before his sit down in the sit room he dispelled any doubt that he had a lot of pent up frustration as he described how isolated he felt rattling around over christmas in such a big house looking out the window only to see guards with machine guns who wouldn t wave back at him he proceeded to settle scores he couldn t believe that new senator mitt romney whom he endorsed had criticized him in a washington post op ed he took shots at the late sen john mccain and gen jim mattis who did a lousy job he loves his other generals and would make a great one himself he clarified that the worst december for the stock market since the great depression is a glitch syria lost long ago by obama is but sand and death he repeatedly said if he wanted he could win election in europe where they love him how bad can a wall be if the vatican has one and 5 billion is a pittance pelosi actually knows the art of the deal and knows more than trump from shutdowns past that eventually everyone gets blamed for the dysfunction in washington no matter who started it with the holiday over people are noticing the parts of government they like not working yosemite had to shut down due to human waste issues the panda cam s gone dark the union representing workers deemed essential like air traffic controllers who are showing up to land 747s safely but not being paid for it has filed suit against the government fifteen agencies are closed no one s complaining but calls to the irs aren t being answered as trump looks down from the truman balcony at overflowing trash cans on the mall where the smithsonian will soon close down how long can he insist he will keep the government closed as long as it takes to get his wall perhaps as long as it takes to ensure his manhood at the briefing when asked why he wouldn t just reopen government he said because it would make him look foolish pelosi has 30 years of experience getting people to do the right thing without making them eat crow longer if you count her years with five toddlers at about the same time trump paused in his rant about his wonderfulness to listen to acting attorney general matt whitaker read from a printed document about his wonderfulness filmmaker and daughter of alexandra pelosi said on cnn that her mother can cut your head off and you won t even know you re bleeding the president never made the long expected pivot from representing his base to representing his country pelosi is in the twilight of her career it s heartstopping to look around the chamber and see all those women who wouldn t have had a bathroom near the floor a decent committee assignment or to be heard when pelosi first walked those marble hallways at 78 she comes not to bury trump but to elevate the country there s hardly been an odder couple but just maybe pelosi s outstretched hand can save the president from himself she s the best chance he has not to look foolish margaret carlson is a columnist for

president donald trump declared friday he could keep parts of the government shut down for months or even years as he and democratic leaders failed in a second closed door meeting to resolve his demand for billions of dollars for a border wall with mexico they did agree to a new round of weekend talks between staff members and white house officials trump met in the white house situation room with congressional leaders from both parties as the shutdown hit the two week mark amid the impasse over his wall demands democrats emerged from the two hour meeting which both sides said was contentious at times to report little if any progress appearing in the rose garden trump spoke more positively calling it a very good meeting he confirmed he absolutely made the comment about the possible length of the shutdown but said he hoped it wouldn t last that long he also said he could declare a national emergency and authorize more wall funding on his own but would first try a negotiated process trump previously described the situation at the border as a national emergency before he dispatched active duty troops in what critics described as a pre election stunt asked if he was still proud to own the shutdown as he has previously declared trump said i don t call it a shutdown i call it doing what you have to do for the benefit and the safety of our country as anxiety mounts over the length of the shutdown trump said the hundreds of thousands who are furloughed or working without pay would want him to keep going and fight for border security he said these people in many cases are the biggest fan of his actions democrats on the other hand spoke of families unable to pay bills and called on trump to reopen the government while negotiations continue on border security senate democratic minority leader chuck schumer said it s very hard to see how progress will be made unless they open up the government friday s meeting came after house democrats muscled through legislation thursday night to fund the government but not trump s proposed wall senate majority leader mitch mcconnell has said those measures are non starters on his side of the capitol without the president s support as the impasse dragged on however some gop senators up for re election in 2020 voiced discomfort cory gardner of colorado said congress should pass bipartisan bills to fund government while we continue to fight for more border security money and susan collins of maine said her goal is to get government reopened as quickly as possible negotiations on border security should continue while a stopgap funding resolution is approved for the department of homeland security she said trump designated vice president mike pence homeland security secretary kirstjen nielsen and adviser jared kushner to work with a congressional delegation over the weekend he was joined by pence in the rose garden as well as house republican leaders kevin mccarthy and steve scalise mcconnell who went back to the capitol instead said it was encouraging that the working group of white house officials and the congressional contingent would meet over the weekend to see if they can reach an agreement and then punt it back to us for final sign off senate democratic leader schumer said that if mcconnell and senate republicans stay on the sidelines trump can keep the government shut down for a long time the president needs an intervention schumer said and senate republicans are just the right ones to intervene adding to national unease about the shutdown are economic jitters as analysts warn of the risks of closures that are disrupting government operations across multiple departments and agencies at a time of other uncertainties in the stock market and foreign trade

about a potential compromise package that would include wall money and some way to provide legal standing for the young immigrants here illegally but working or attending school under the deferred action for childhood arrivals program trump ended the program but a lawsuit to allow it to continue is making its way through the courts he s open minded to this graham said in an interview but he added the president hasn t committed pelosi has already said she opposes trading daca for the wall but graham said in the interview if you got a better off ramp i m all ears trump appeared cool to the prospect of a deal including daca saying we ll discuss it at another time and adding that he was waiting to see what happens to that issue in the courts in their first votes of the new congress house

as much of the u s government remains shut down over president donald trumps insistence on funding for his border wall nearly half of americans identify immigration as a top issue for the government to work on this year an associated press norc center for public affairs research poll conducted shortly before the shutdown began finds that both republicans and democrats are far more likely to include immigration in their list of top issues facing the country this year compared with a year ago overall 49 percent mentioned immigration in an open ended question as one of the top five problems they hoped the government addresses in 2019 by contrast 27 percent mentioned immigration in december 2017 partisan divides on the best solutions remain deep republicans continue to be more likely to cite immigration as a top issue than democrats an indication of the gops greater intensity on the issue but its an increasingly important issue to members of both parties the poll found that 65 percent of republicans say immigration is one of the top five problems facing the country up from 42 percent in 2017 among democrats 37 percent cite immigration as a top issue compared with just 2 in 10 a year ago roughly two thirds of those who named immigration as a top priority express little confidence in the government to make progress this year including a third who say they are not at all confident about a third say they are at least moderately confident in the government to make progress on immigration this follows a year of intermittent deadlocked negotiations and standoffs between trump and democrats in congress although both democrats and republicans are increasingly likely to name immigration related issues as top priorities for the government other polls show that their opinions on the issue diverge dramatically for example a december poll by cnn found that 78 percent of republicans and just 8 percent of democrats supported building a border wall and with their party still in control of the white house and the senate republicans are more optimistic about the government making progress on immigration this year among those who prioritize immigration republicans are more than three times as likely as democrats to express some confidence that the government will make progress that includes david hoyt a 77 year old retired school superintendent and registered republican in eastern iowa we waste too many resources with illegal aliens hoyt said if people want to come here lets have them do it legally i dont understand why people dont understand the word illegal hoyt says hes also focused on the economy and its healthy state is why hes satisfied with the countrys direction and trumps performance people are busy hoyt said i can tell the economy from the number of semis on the highway and its loaded chris butino 31 is a democrat and a firefighter in cortland new york whos been disappointed by trumps rhetoric and actions on immigration especially against refugees trump has sharply curtailed the number of refugees accepted by the u s and taken steps to limit who can claim asylum as more migrants from central america try to do so at the mexican border were america were the wealthiest nation in the world in terms of resources and saying were not going to take in the poor huddled masses butino said we can maintain our own safety but we can also be generous the economy remains a top priority for americans with 62 percent citing related issues including mentions of jobs unemployment taxes and trade nearly half of americans also identify health care as one of the top five issues facing the country unchanged from one year ago a traditionally democratic issue health care is named by democrats more than republicans 56 percent versus 43 percent there was a sharp rise in environmental and climate issues after a year of wildfires and hurricanes a change that is largely driven by democrats overall about a quarter of americans mention the environment as a top issue about 4 in 10 democrats include the environment as a priority compared with just 8 percent of republicans the share of democrats naming the environment has grown 11 percentage points since a year ago the poll was conducted in december before the stock market gyrations and government shutdown gil parks a retired cpa whos become a rancher in texas is fine with the shutdown its only 25 percent of the government he said parks a 59 year old republican is optimistic the country could be in for a long stretch of economic growth in part because of the partisan acrimony fueling the shutdown if you look back in history the economy did best when government couldnt get in the way he said with democrats assuming control of the house of representatives the inevitable gridlock could preserve the economic expansion parks argued republicans are more likely than democrats to be optimistic but feelings about the country are mixed even within the gop six in 10 americans are dissatisfied with the way things are going in the country as a whole including 79 percent of democrats and 42 percent of republicans among republicans thats a slight increase from 33 percent who were dissatisfied with the state of the country in october still republicans are far more likely than democrats today to say theyre satisfied with the way things are going in the country 39 percent to 9 percent the unhappiness on both sides of the aisle is palpable to john rossetti a 47 year old code enforcement officer in youngstown ohio theres a really different negative environment rossetti said everywhere you go its there just a very negative atmosphere rossetti describes himself as a moderate to conservative democrat who didnt support trump in 2016 but was rooting for him to succeed now hes disillusioned and pessimistic about the future and hes not alone americans are more likely to think things in the country will get worse in the next year than that they will get better 42 percent to 32 percent more americans do think 2019 will be a better year for them personally than think it will get worse 37 percent to 18 percent but another 45 percent say there wont be much difference rossetti has only had two small raises in the past 12 years hes worked for youngstown yet his health insurance premiums keep rising i dont think im doing better rossetti said i feel like im

potential impact on ratepayers and taxpayers if the utility eventually needs a bailout michael wara a lawyer and research scholar at stanford university calls the lack of transparency extremely disappointing they need to be thinking very hard about how to create safety for californians rather than how to make money for shareholders when they re not being totally transparent especially in the current context where there s a lack of trust and so many people that have been harmed by pg e s infrastructure wara said what california urgently needs and wants from its utilities right now is hard thinking about how to better protect communities from fire and it s hard to see that going on wara added what california urgently needs and wants from its utilities right now is hard thinking about

felony safety violations in a gas line explosion in 2010 in a san francisco suburb that killed eight people and destroyed a neighborhood the federal judge overseeing the utility s five year criminal probation in that case had asked becerra s opinion on whether pg e s possible role in the recent wildfires constitutes a probation violation the stakes a sale would have big implications for the company which supplies electricity and gas to more than 5 million california households and has more than 20 000 employees pg e s natural gas assets account for between 20 percent to 30 percent of the company the company sources who spoke to npr and provided supporting documents say the planning for project falcon began shortly after the 2017 wine country fires and picked up again in earnest this past june when cal fire determined that pg e was responsible for at least a dozen northern california fires the planning the sources say has accelerated since the camp fire the sources also said the

gas arm regulators and lawmakers may argue that a deal should be structured to solely benefit wildfire victims and that any deal should come with protections for ratepayers we need to be asking ourselves hard questions as a state as to whether a settlement in bankruptcy might be better than something we get through this gas sale warns wara the stanford researcher the inside sources say the company is hoping to get between 10 7 billion and 15 5 billion for its gas assets given the company s safety liability and political challenges including new allegations last month that the company violated safety regulations analysts say it s not at all clear they would get that on the open market in mid december state regulators found that pg e had systematically falsified safety documents and broke safety rules related to its natural gas operations over a five year period at the time pg e spokesman matt nauman said in an emailed statement to npr that the company is committed to accurate

fleishman an analyst with wolfe research referring to the gas and electric divisions fleishman says a gas sale and new management on the electric side might allow pg e leaders to focus solely on improving safety i think the company is willing do anything structurally if they think it can help with safety fleishman says analysts warn that the company risks running out of access to capital not

by nicholas riccardi and hannah fingerhut associated press as much of the u s government remains shut down over president donald trump s insistence on funding for his border wall nearly half of americans identify immigration as a top issue for the government to work on this year an associated press norc center for public affairs research poll conducted shortly before the shutdown began finds that both republicans and democrats are far more likely to include immigration in their list of top issues facing the country this year compared with a year ago overall 49 percent mentioned immigration in an open ended question as one of the top five problems they hoped the government addresses in 2019 by contrast 27 percent mentioned immigration in december 2017 partisan divides on the best solutions remain deep republicans continue to be more likely to cite immigration as a top issue than democrats an indication of the gop s greater intensity on the issue but it s an increasingly important issue to members of both parties the poll found that 65 percent of republicans say immigration is one of the top five problems facing the country up from 42 percent in 2017 among democrats 37 percent cite immigration as a top issue compared with just 2 in 10 a year ago roughly two thirds of those who named immigration as a top priority express little confidence in the government to make progress this year including a third who say they are not at all confident about a third say they are at least moderately confident in the government to make progress on immigration this follows a year of intermittent deadlocked negotiations and standoffs between trump and democrats in congress although both democrats and republicans are increasingly likely to name immigration related issues as top priorities for the government other polls show that their opinions on the issue diverge dramatically for example a december poll by cnn found that 78 percent of republicans and just 8 percent of democrats supported building a border wall and with their party still in control of the white house and the senate republicans are more optimistic about the government making progress on immigration this year among those who prioritize immigration republicans are more than three times as likely as democrats to express some confidence that the government will make progress that includes david hoyt a 77 year old retired school superintendent and registered republican in eastern iowa we waste too many resources with illegal aliens hoyt said if people want to come here let s have them do it legally i don t understand why people don t understand the word illegal hoyt says he s also focused on the economy and its healthy state is why he s satisfied with the country s direction and trump s performance people are busy hoyt said i can tell the economy from the number of semis on the highway and it s loaded chris butino 31 is a democrat and a firefighter in cortland new york who s been disappointed by trump s rhetoric and actions on immigration especially against refugees trump has sharply curtailed the number of refugees accepted by the u s and taken steps to limit who can claim asylum as more migrants from central america try to do so at the mexican border we re america we re the wealthiest nation in the world in terms of resources and saying we re not going to take in the poor huddled masses butino said we can maintain our own safety but we can also be generous the economy remains a top priority for americans with 62 percent citing related issues including mentions of jobs unemployment taxes and trade nearly half of americans also identify health care as one of the top five issues facing the country unchanged from one year ago a traditionally democratic issue health care is named by democrats more than republicans 56 percent versus 43 percent there was a sharp rise in environmental and climate issues after a year of wildfires and hurricanes a change that is largely driven by democrats overall about a quarter of americans mention the environment as a top issue about 4 in 10 democrats include the environment as a priority compared with just 8 percent of republicans the share of democrats naming the environment has grown 11 percentage points since a year ago the poll was conducted in december before the stock market gyrations and government shutdown gil parks a retired cpa who s become a rancher in texas is fine with the shutdown it s only 25 percent of the government he said parks a 59 year old republican is optimistic the country could be in for a long stretch of economic growth in part because of the partisan acrimony fueling the shutdown if you look back in history the economy did best when government couldn t get in the way he said with democrats assuming control of the house of representatives the inevitable gridlock could preserve the economic expansion parks argued republicans are more likely than democrats to be optimistic but feelings about the country are mixed even within the gop six in 10 americans are dissatisfied with the way things are going in the country as a whole including 79 percent of democrats and 42 percent of republicans among republicans that s a slight increase from 33 percent who were dissatisfied with the state of the country in october still republicans are far more likely than democrats

updated at 6 29 p m et facing staggering liability costs for its potential culpability in a series of deadly wildfires the parent company of california s largest utility is exploring whether to sell off a major part of the company npr has learned internally pacific gas electric has dubbed this strategy project falcon under the plan the company would sell its natural gas division this spring after years of deadly errors and safety violations the utility giant is looking for ways to cover liability costs and avoid bankruptcy a senior company official and a former employee with knowledge of the plan tell npr all net proceeds from the sale of pg e s gas division would be used to set up a fund to pay billions of dollars in potential claims from wildfires the sources said they requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly the company also is exploring selling key real estate assets including its san francisco headquarters and moving its operations elsewhere in the bay area the sources say on friday the company announced it would be reviewing structural options to best position the company to meet customer and operational needs in addition pg e said it is searching for new directors for its board to augment its existing expertise in safety pg e declined to make any senior leaders available to comment on project falcon a written statement from spokesman andy castagnola said safety is and will continue to be our top priority as we work to determine the best path forward for all of our stakeholders pg e remains fully committed to helping our customers and the affected communities recover and rebuild and to doing everything we can to reduce the risk of future wildfires wildfire damages in june the state s fire agency cal fire determined that pg e power equipment was responsible for sparking at least a dozen major fires across northern california in 2017 and now regulators are investigating whether pg e equipment sparked november scamp fire the deadliest and most destructive in state history the company could end up having to pay billions from legal action stemming from the 2017 and 2018 wildfire seasons equity analysts project that pg e s damages from the wildfires could exceed pg e s market value and its insurance coverage one citigroup analyst estimates the company could be on the hook forup to 15 billion in damages insurance companies allstate state farm and usaahave filed lawsuits against pg e blaming the utility for the camp fire the gas sale strategy would have to be approved by the state regulatory agency the california public utilities commission which has already expressed deep concerns about pg e s shoddy safety record lack of transparency and past efforts to pass liability costs on to the state s ratepayers so far state regulators and lawmakers have been kept out of pg e s planning loop for project falcon named for a group of peregrine falcons nesting on the roof of the company s headquarters the current and former pg e officials say they re speaking with npr out of concern that senior management is not acting in the best interests of ratepayers safety and the state there s a public trust element in being a utility monopoly said the senior company official bailout pg e is under no legal obligation to disclose its internal discussions about ways to stave off bankruptcy but given the potential impact on ratepayers and taxpayers if the utility eventually needs a bailout michael wara a lawyer and research scholar at stanford university calls the lack of transparency extremely disappointing they need to be thinking very hard about how to create safety for californians rather than how to make money for shareholders when they re not being totally transparent especially in the current context where there s a lack of trust and so many people that have been harmed by pg e s infrastructure wara said what california urgently needs and wants from its utilities right now is hard thinking about how to better protect communities from fire and it s hard to see that going on wara added what california urgently needs and wants from its utilities right now is hard thinking about how to better protect communities from fire and it s hard to see that going on wall street wants to see hard thinking too steve fleishman senior utilities analyst and a managing director at wolfe research said pg e s plan for dealing with fires in the future is unclear they clearly seem to be more at risk for that fleishman said this kind of risk profile is not sustainable pg e s stock is down about 50 percent since the camp fire broke out on nov 8 consumer watchdog groups want any big move done with transparency anything pg e wants to propose should be done in an open public manner and include a comprehensive coherent wildfire mitigation strategy says mark toney the executive director of the utility reform network there is widespread anger in the state over pg e s shoddy safety record protests broke out at recent public oversight meetings and at the company s san francisco headquarters where environmentalists and activists read the names of the more than 100 people combined who died in the camp fire and 2017 s wildfires in napa and sonoma counties at one customer service center the company has installed bulletproof glass serious safety problems in late december state regulators said they were considering several proposals in response to ongoing concerns about the utility s role in a deadly gas explosion in 2010 and in the more recent wildfires pg e has had serious safety problems with both its gas and electric operations for many years the california public utilities commission said in a statement possible changes put forth by the commission include splitting up the gas and electric divisions and eithermaking the company a public utility or making the company s return on equity contingent on safety performance we must be careful and practical the commission s president michael picker said in a statement last month this process will be like repairing a jetliner while it s in flight crashing a plane to make it safer isn t good for the passengers the commission declined further comment for this story a spokesman said only that state regulators are looking at a range of options for the utility we must be careful and practical this process will be like repairing a jetliner while it s in flight crashing a plane to make it safer isn t good for the passengers in a separate development the state s top law enforcement official attorney general xavier becerra said in a court filingin late december that pg e could face criminal charges up to murder if it s found liable in any of the recent deadly california wildfires pg e was convicted of felony safety violations in a gas line explosion in 2010 in a san francisco suburb that killed eight people and destroyed a neighborhood the federal judge overseeing the utility s five year criminal probation in that case had asked becerra s opinion on whether pg e s possible role in the recent wildfires constitutes a probation violation the stakes a sale would have big implications for the company which supplies electricity and gas to more than 5 million california households and has more than 20 000 employees pg e s natural gas assets account for between 20 percent to 30 percent of the company the company sources who spoke to npr and provided supporting documents say the planning for project falcon began shortly after the 2017 wine country fires and picked up again in earnest this past june when cal fire determined that pg e was responsible for at least a dozen northern california fires the planning the sources say has accelerated since the camp fire the sources also said the company would like to present its own plan before one is imposed by regulators california applies inverse condemnation to utilities meaning they can be held liable for damage even if they are not found negligent structuring the deal pg e shareholders and institutional investors may welcome a gas sale as a way to cover at least in part wildfire liabilities as part of the gas sale plan all gross proceeds from the sale would go into the wildfire fund with no direct shareholder benefit from cash according to the pg e source but shareholders could get new shares in the company that purchases the gas arm regulators and lawmakers may argue that a deal should be structured to solely benefit wildfire victims and that any deal should come with protections for ratepayers we need to be asking ourselves hard questions as a state as to whether a settlement in bankruptcy might be better than something we get through this gas sale warns wara the stanford researcher the inside sources say the company is hoping to get between 10 7 billion and 15 5 billion for its gas assets given the company s safety liability and political challenges including new allegations last month that the company violated safety regulations analysts say it s not at all clear they would get that on the open market in mid december state regulators found that pg e had systematically falsified safety documents and broke safety rules related to its natural gas operations over a five year period at the time pg e spokesman matt nauman said in an emailed statement to npr that the company is committed to accurate and thorough reporting and record keeping and we didn t live up to that commitment in this case this comes on the heels of a 1 6 billion finefrom regulators the largest in state history and six felonyconvictions related to 2010 san bruno explosion travis miller senior utilities equity strategist at morningstar is skeptical that a potential gas sell off would fly with regulators or wall street he said he doesn t think another utility would step forward to buy the gas assets you may get a good price but it also carries with it a lot of regulatory and political risk miller says there s no good outcome for ratepayers under any scenario and not an ideal outcome for shareholders either project falcon and the camp fire the company s fiscal woes deepened in the wake of november s camp fire in butte county calif which killed at least 85 people and displaced tens of thousands who continue to face a desperate housing crisis paradise and neighboring towns were all but wiped out the cause of the fire is still under investigation by the state s fire agency cal fire pg e has told state regulators that it experienced problems on two sections of its electric system near where the camp fire erupted the company facesnearly two dozen lawsuits from fire victims over its possible culpability for the camp fire including allegations of possible equipment failures and poor maintenance in one lawsuit residents accuse the company of prioritizing advertising spending over fire and public safety now it s clear there are problems on both sides of the business says steve fleishman an analyst with wolfe research referring to the gas and electric divisions fleishman says a gas sale and new management on the electric side might allow pg e leaders to focus solely on improving safety i think the company is willing do anything structurally if they think it can help with safety fleishman says analysts warn that the company risks running out of access to capital not just because of present liability but also because of the risk of future catastrophic fires a specter sharpened by climate change and a century of fire suppression policy in the nation s forests the company in november said it had exhausted its revolving credit lines andthe ratings agencies moody s investor service and s p have downgraded the company s credit rating to near junk status approval process will be complicated internal pg e planning documents on the potential sale labeled privileged and confidential show that company officials are concerned about regulatory approval the cpuc approval process will be complicated and lengthy so phasing the proceeding to obtain early decisions on matters that are crucial to the viability of the transaction is desirable one document reads while the gas sale would cover some liabilities the legislature also may be asked to step in state lawmakers partially shielded the company for liability claims in 2017 with a bill that critics called a bailout analysts and consumer advocates worry that lawmakers may expand that protection for this year and beyond putting taxpayers and ratepayers on the hook ultimately we re going to be left holding the bag says michael wara of stanford university if pg e can t pay all of these costs then it s the california taxpayer that ultimately will but some lawmakers are already balking state sen bill dodd who originally supported shielding pg e from liability costs related to fires in 2017 has lost patience with the company pg e has demonstrated a pattern of poor management and illegal conduct that has shattered lives across california dodd said in an emailed statement he called for systemic change which must include change on the board of directors and in the executive suite copyright 2021 npr to

matthew daly associated press washington days after reclaiming the house majority democrats are introducing gun control legislation timed for the anniversary of the shooting of former democratic rep gabby giffords speaker nancy pelosi and other democrats will introduce a bill to expand background checks for sales and transfers of firearms on tuesday the eighth anniversary of the day giffords was shot in the head at a constituent meeting in arizona giffords who co founded a gun safety group with her husband mark kelly said in a statement friday she was thrilled that her former house colleagues were responding to a gun violence epidemic that killed nearly 40 000 people in 2017 the bill expanding background checks marks a critical first step toward strengthening america s gun laws and making our country a safer place to live work study worship and play giffords said i stand ready to do everything in my power to get this legislation across the finish line democrats promised swift action on gun control after the party regained the house majority following eight years of republican rule pelosi called the bill on background checks a common sense measure and cited polls showing 97 percent of americans support background checks for all gun sales our democratic majority will press relentlessly for bipartisan progress to end the epidemic of gun violence on our streets in our schools and in our places of worship pelosi said enough is enough rep mike thompson d calif who leads a gun violence prevention task force in the house said he and other lawmakers from both parties have been pushing years to expand background checks and approve other gun related bills but have been stymied by republican leaders noting that many freshman democrats ran on the issue of preventing gun violence thompson said political momentum to address gun violence is growing the american people have been demanding we take action and this new congress will deliver he said the background checks measure is likely to face opposition from the republican controlled senate and the white house where president donald trump has promised to protect the second amendment jennifer baker a spokeswoman for the national rifle association said a federal background check did not prevent giffords shooting adding that so called universal background checks will never be universal because criminals do not comply with the law lawmakers should deal with the root cause of violent crime instead of trying to score political points and push ineffective legislation that doesn t stop criminals from committing crimes baker said the trump administration moved last month to ban bump stocks the firearm attachments that allow semi automatic weapons to fire like machine guns bump stocks became a focal point of the gun control debate after they were used in october 2017 by a gunman in las vegas who fired into a crowd at a country music concert killing 58 people and injuring hundreds more a new regulation gives gun owners until late march to turn in or destroy the devices
president donald trump has threatened to keep the us government partially shut for months or years after he and democratic leaders failed to resolve their dispute over trump s request for us5 6 billion a7 9 billion to build a wall on the mexican border after democratic congressional leaders refused trump s requests at a meeting in the white house situation room the republican president threatened to take the controversial step of declaring a national emergency and building the wall without congressional approval trump is withholding his support for a bill that would fully fund the government until he secures money for the wall as a result around 800 000 public workers have been unpaid with about a quarter of the federal government closed for two weeks us president donald trump has threatened to keep the government shut for months over his budget battle with the democrats ap national parks such as the everglades national park in florida have been affected by the government shutdown ap senate democratic leader chuck schumer said democrats had told trump during the meeting to end the shutdown he resisted schumer said in fact he said he d keep the government closed for a very long period of time months or even years trump confirmed that comment but painted a more positive picture of the meeting the first since a new era of divided government began when democrats took control of the house of representatives on thursday we had a very very productive meeting and we ve come a long way trump said senior democrat figures address the media after meeting with us president donald trump to discuss the government shutdown ap according to a source familiar with the white house discussion trump opened the meeting with a speech that lasted at least 15 minutes in which he insisted on the need for billions of dollars to fund a border wall the source also said trump brought up recent impeachment threats during those remarks arguing that he had notched a strong performance as president and should not be a target for impeachment the president later told reporters that nancy pelosi the new democratic speaker of the house of representatives said democrats were not looking to impeach him the shutdown is forcing hundreds of thousands of federal workers and contractors to stay home or work without pay and many are experiencing mounting stress from the impasse ap raising the stakes in his tussle with the newly emboldened democrats trump threatened extraordinary measures to build the wall which he says is needed to stem the flow of illegal immigrants and drugs into the united states a reporter asked trump whether he had considered declaring a national emergency to build the wall yes i have and i can do it if i want trump said we can call a national emergency because of the security of our country i may do it but we can call a national emergency and build it very quickly and it s another way of doing it but if we can do it through a negotiated process we re giving that a shot emergency powers have been invoked by previous us presidents during times of war senator jack reed the senior democrat on the senate armed services committee criticised the comments saying in a statement declaring a trumped up national emergency in order to skirt congressional approval is wrong the us constitution assigns congress the power to fund the federal government so trump likely would face legal challenges if he tried to bypass congress on financing the wall building a wall and having mexico pay for it was one of trump s main promises when he ran for president in 2016

matthew daly catherine lucey and jill colvin the associated press washington president donald trump declared friday he could keep parts of the government shut down for months or even years as he and democratic leaders failed in a second closed door meeting to resolve his demand for billions of dollars for a border wall with mexico they did agree to a new round of weekend talks between staff members and white house officials trump met in the white house situation room with congressional leaders from both parties as the shutdown hit the two week mark amid the impasse over his wall demands democrats emerged from the two hour meeting which both sides said was contentious at times to report little if any progress appearing in the rose garden trump spoke more positively calling it a very good meeting he confirmed he absolutely made the comment about the possible length of the shutdown but said he hoped it wouldn t last that long he also said he could declare a national emergency and authorize more wall funding on his own but would first try a negotiated process trump previously described the situation at the border as a national emergency before he dispatched active duty troops in what critics described as a pre election stunt asked if he was still proud to own the shutdown as he has previously declared trump said i don t call it a shutdown i call it doing what you have to do for the benefit and the safety of our country as anxiety mounts over the length of the shutdown trump said the hundreds of thousands who are furloughed or working without pay would want him to keep going and fight for border security he said these people in many cases are the biggest fan of his actions democrats on the other hand spoke of families unable to pay bills and called on trump to reopen the government while negotiations continue on border security senate democratic minority leader chuck schumer said it s very hard to see how progress will be made unless they open up the government friday s meeting came after house democrats muscled through legislation thursday night to fund the government but not trump s proposed wall senate majority leader mitch mcconnell has said those measures are non starters on his side of the capitol without the president s support as the impasse dragged on however some gop senators up for re election in 2020 voiced discomfort cory gardner of colorado said congress should pass bipartisan bills to fund government while we continue to fight for more border security money and susan collins of maine said her goal is to get government reopened as quickly as possible negotiations on border security should continue while a stopgap funding resolution is approved for the department of homeland security she said trump designated vice president mike pence homeland security secretary kirstjen nielsen and adviser jared kushner to work with a congressional delegation over the weekend he was joined by pence in the rose garden as well as house republican leaders kevin mccarthy and steve scalise mcconnell who went back to the capitol instead said it was encouraging that the working group of white house officials and the congressional contingent would meet over the weekend to see if they can reach an agreement and then punt it back to us for final sign off senate democratic leader schumer said that if mcconnell and senate republicans stay on the sidelines trump can keep the government shut down for a long time the president needs an intervention schumer said and senate republicans are just the right ones to intervene adding to national unease about the shutdown are economic jitters as analysts warn of the risks of closures that are disrupting government operations across multiple departments and agencies at a time of other uncertainties in the stock market and foreign trade house speaker nancy pelosi said trump and senate republicans should take yes for an answer and pass the house legislation without money for the wall that the senate approved on a voice vote last month we re not doing a wall does anyone have any doubt that we re not doing a wall pelosi said thursday night republican sen lindsey graham who is close to trump said he spoke to the president thursday about a potential compromise package that would include wall money and some way to provide legal standing for the young immigrants

courts he s open minded to this graham said in an interview but he added the president hasn t committed pelosi has already said she opposes trading daca for the wall but graham said in the interview

apple issued a rare revision to its earnings guidance earlier this week cautioning investors that the company is anticipating to generate a few billion dollars less in revenue than initially expected predictably shares of apple absolutely tanked as a result and are now trading at a level we haven t seen since mid 2017 in a letter to investors on the topic apple ceo tim cook squarely laid all the blame on a lower number of iphone sales for the quarter specifically cook said that poor iphone sales in china was the main reason behind apple s revised guidance in fact most of our revenue shortfall to our guidance and over 100 percent of our year over year worldwide revenue decline occurred in greater china across iphone mac and ipad cook said in the letter with apple s slumping stock taking a lot of the market down with it the white house seemingly felt compelled to chime in on the matter earlier today trump advisor larry kudlow who serves as the director of the national economic council made an absolutely baseless statement claiming that china stole proprietary apple technology with no evidence or context provided whatsoever it appears that kudlow is trying to deflect any blame for apple s poor stock performance away from trump and onto china i don t want to surmise too much here but apple technology may have been picked off by china and now china is becoming very competitive with apple kudlow sald earlier today in remarks picked up by cnbc you ve got to have rule of law there are some indications from china that they re looking at that but we don t know that yet there s no enforcement there s nothing concrete it s downright embarrassing to see someone of kudlow s stature make such a bold statement with absolutely no foundation of support whatsoever then again with the political environment being what it is today we can t realistically say that it s all that surprising
be as sniffy as you like about the booch but it s now a significant category in the beverage space so says alex campbell ceo of greerton based good buzz beverage co who founded the company alongside his wife and kids in 2014 functional beverages offer more according to alex and the more in kombucha s case is found in beneficial ingredients such as herbs vitamins minerals amino acids or raw fruit and vegetables and the significant part is explained by the fact that alex his wife amber and children kaylie lauren and nathan are cranking out 100 000 litres a month of the functional beverage from their maleme st booch barn it is known in other countries amongst a wealth of names as tea fungus manchurian mushroom tea hongo teekwass fungus japonicas and wunder pilz and if this reads like a thinly disguised advertisement it is also a story about a special services soldier and the undoing of saddam hussein as well as the bacteria that lurks in its trillions in the gut some love it some loathe it and some simply don t understand it but there s no doubting the global curiosity for kombucha the sort of sour sort of sharp sort of vinegary sort of tangy sort of addictive kombucha that has tickled the national taste buds of new zealand for starters alex balks at the word fad kombucha has been around in various incarnations for 200 years are teenagers drinking it because it s cool and because everyone else is doing it maybe he admits but what about all the people in their 50s 60s and 70s are they drinking it because it s cool my grandmother s drinking it and she s 93 my other grandmother made manchurian mushroom tea for 40 years she must have been very faddish it seems others in their droves are now supping the once hippy tipple in supermarkets bars cafes restaurants gyms and yoga studios there s a new acceptance a new respectability people are conscious of sugar in their diet and beverages certainly have a lot of bad heat says alex there s a surprisingly low two to eight grams of sugar in an eight ounce serving of kombucha compared to 39 grams of sugar in a regular can of coke people are also drinking less alcohol he adds there s no doubt about it the data is clear that would explain why new zealand breweries bought a chunk of the good buzz beverage co and has installed kombucha on tap alongside beers amber started tinkering with kombucha at home whilst living in wellington and there was a lot of experimentation some was too fizzy some wasn t fizzy enough it started tasting quite good she says when i stopped drinking alcohol eight years ago i would take kombucha to barbecues and social functions it looks like beer and makes you feel part of the party it got to the point where alex left his day job in software and peddled amber s kombucha from café to café vanilla café in thorndon always said if we started commercial production they would be first to stock it we did and they were production went from the campbell s kitchen to a facility up the road in wainuiomata to a 600m2 plant in greerton just up the road from a contract bottling plant where they re currently contributing a bit of fizz to tauranga s economic boom it has plenty of capacity for quick growth says alex he s not your normal ceo there s 40 year old youthful good looks a beard that lives its own life the undercut man bun shorts and a t shirt that reads get in my belly he wears his leg tat well and has a mellow american accent which is very easy to listen to appearances aren t everything says alex and we created a brand that s supposed to be fun when i was a special forces operator i blended in because you had to special forces born in the united states and raised in kaikohe alex left school with barely a fifth form certificate but became an unconventional warfare specialist in the american army and latterly a software professional before the booch got him it s boys own stuff he was stationed at fort bragg home of the airborne he went to jump school learned arabic and german and became a demolition engineer along the way he went to survival evasion resistance and escape school you learn interrogation techniques how to withstand them and come out alive he was involved with taking out a terrorist organisation during operation iraqi freedom to rid the country of the tyrant saddam hussein a precis of his service doesn t do him service he also did bomb forensics and weapons intelligence gathering in baghdad in between times he met and married amber and ended up back in wellington with a software company and a kitchen full of cultures the most menacing thing he deals with these days is a blob of microbes called a scoby an acronym for a symbiotic culture of bacteria and yeast also known as the mother it s the living heart of kombucha while the jury may still be out on the hard and fast health benefits of this magic in a bottle the drink s gut friendly bacteria and antioxidants make it a good alternative to more sugary drinks the health benefits we are led to believe come from a probiotic status that the fermented foods like kombucha and the probiotics they contain are not only good for you but excellent for digestion alex says the short answer to the fact or fallacy question is yes kombucha is good for you the fermented category in the food space is growing too he says adherents claim kombucha can increase energy and awareness decrease headaches and fatigue and have a positive impact on balancing moods paying particular attention to gut health is also a great way to promote optimal overall health both physically and mentally and hey our ancestors lived on bacteria they weren t thinking of bacteria there weren t a lot of microscopes sterilisation or pasteurisation canning package foods or refrigeration they just figured if they kept this cabbage under water then something happens that enables them to keep eating this stuff for years so kombucha is probably back to the future
washington federal reserve chairman jerome powell said today that he will not resign if asked to do so by president donald trump a message that heartened investors who had been concerned by trump s repeated attacks on his hand picked choice to lead the nation s central bank appearing on a panel in atlanta with his two predecessors janet yellen and ben bernanke powell said the central bank intends to be flexible going forward in determining when to hike its key policy rate he also said that the fed could alter its approach to trimming its huge balance sheet if it determines such a change is needed the pace of fed rate hikes and the lowering of the balance sheet which tends to put upward pressure on interest rates had both been concerns of investors in recent months the stock market has seen stomach churning declines since october a development that trump has blamed on the fed s continued rate hikes although the president s trade dispute with china as well as concerns about global economic growth also played a part in the market volatility trump s attacks had become so intense that they had raised concerns that he might be considering firing powell a development which could send the market into a further tailspin asked if he would resign if trump asked him to do so powell responded with a short no the dow jones industrial average added about 200 points during powell s appearance and was up about 600 points around 11 20 a m a strong u s jobs report and hopes that upcoming talks between the u s and china could pave the way for an end to the trade dispute also buoyed investors while trump has sent out a number of tweets criticizing powell and calling the fed his biggest threat powell said that he had not received any direct pressure from the white house asked if he had had any face to face meetings with trump powell said he had not although he said previous fed leaders have had discussions from time to time with previous presidents asked if any future meeting with trump was scheduled powell said i have no news on that nothing is scheduled powell s remarks came on a day when the government reported that the economy created a sizzling 312 000 jobs in december despite all the problems last month in terms of a falling stock market rising trade tensions with china and at the end of the month a partial government shutdown
washington ap with no shutdown resolution in sight president donald trump and democratic leaders agreed friday to additional staff level talks over the weekend during a white house meeting at which trump indicated he could keep parts of the government closed for months or even years trump met with the congressional leaders for the second time in three days amid an impasse over trump s funding demands for his proposed wall at the u s mexico border democrats emerged from the lengthy meeting to report little if any progress we told the president we needed the government open he resisted in fact he said he d keep the government closed for a very long period of time months or even years said democratic senate minority leader chuck schumer trump spoke more positively about the session which lasted roughly two hours calling it a very good meeting but he confirmed he made the comment about the possible length of the shutdown absolutely i said that trump said but he added that he hopes it won t be that long the meeting on the 14th day of the shutdown came after house democrats muscled through legislation to fund the government but not trump s proposed wall as the impasse over border funding dragged on some gop senators up for re election in 2020 voiced discomfort but trump dug in ahead of the meeting writing in a letter to congress walls work that s why rich powerful and successful people build them around their homes senate majority leader mitch mcconnell said even though the new congress has convened since the last session at the white house the basic steps that are needed to end this unfortunate standoff really haven t changed at all mcconnell has said measures approved by the house are non starters on his side of the capitol without the president s support any viable compromise will need to carry the endorsement of the president before it receives a vote he said as progress has stalled some republican senators want action cory gardner of colorado said congress should pass bipartisan bills to fund government while we continue to fight for more border security money and susan collins of maine said her goal is to get government reopened as quickly as possible we have bipartisan agreements on six of the remaining funding bills and i d like to see those signed into law collins said negotiations on border security should continue while a stopgap funding resolution is approved for the department of homeland security senate democratic leader chuck schumer said that if mcconnell and senate republicans stay on the sidelines trump can keep the government shutdown for a long time the president needs an intervention schumer said and senate republicans are just the right ones to intervene adding to the unease are economic jitters as analysts warn of the risks of closures that are disrupting government operations across multiple departments and agencies at a time of other uncertainties in the stock market and foreign trade house speaker nancy pelosi said trump and senate republicans should take yes for an answer and pass the legislation without money for the wall that the senate approved on a voice vote last month we re not doing a wall does anyone have any doubt that we re not doing a wall pelosi said thursday night republican sen lindsey graham who is close to trump said he spoke to the president thursday about a potential compromise package that would include border wall money and some way to provide legal standing for the young immigrants here illegally but working or attending school under the deferred action for childhood arrivals program trump ended the program but a lawsuit to allow it to continue is making its way through the courts he s open minded to this graham said in an interview but he added the president hasn t committed graham said he has been talking with other senators about a deal that would include 5 billion in wall funding coupled with two measures to shield immigrants from deportation one is the bridge act bipartisan legislation that would extend daca protection to some 700 000 young immigrants already in the program the other component would be a fix for nearly 400 000 immigrants in the temporary protective status program whose status has been jeopardized by the administration s decision to roll back that program which is for arrivals from certain countries facing disaster and war torn conditions pelosi has already said she opposes trading daca for the wall and it s unclear if other democrats and republicans would be willing to engage in immigration negotiations but graham called such a compromise the best way out of the shutdown if you got a better off ramp i m all ears he said trump ally sean hannity on his fox news show thursday said the president is willing to negotiate daca but vice president mike pence told fox news late thursday bottom line if there s no wall there s no deal in their first votes of the new congress house democrats approved bills thursday night to re open government at previously agreed upon levels several republicans crossed over to join them friday s white house meeting with trump includes eight leaders the top two democrats and republicans of both chambers a session earlier in the week produced finger pointing with no breakthroughs republicans said the new round of talks might be more productive now that pelosi is speaker but democrats said the problem isn t with them but with trump who once boasted of the shutdown but now must try to explain blocking the effort to re open government with bills republicans had earlier approved trump on wednesday told the leaders he would look foolish for conceding without money for the wall along the u s mexico border on thursday trump made a surprise appearance at the white house briefing room pledging to keep up the fight for his signature campaign promise you can call it a barrier you can call it whatever you want trump said but essentially we need protection in our country we re going to make it good the people of our country want it trump is demanding billions of dollars to build his wall along the u s border with mexico asked if she would give trump 1 for a wall to reopen the government pelosi said one dollar yeah one dollar the fact is a wall is an immorality it s not who we are as a nation polls show a majority of americans oppose the border wall although republicans strongly support it white house and department of homeland security officials have spent recent days trying to make both a public and private case that the situation at the border has reached a crisis point that demands more money than democrats have offered trump tweeted an ominous video thursday with images of what appeared to be migrants trying to rush the border and clashing with law enforcement beneath the words crisis at the border drugs and crime the video concludes with footage of trump at the border along with audio from one of his rallies in which he vows to build his promised border wall and the crowd chants build the wall associated press writers eileen putman lisa mascaro laurie kellman kevin freking alan fram and mary clare jalonick contributed
around christmas day karl krause and daan colijn started receiving emails from their fans telling them their pictures were being used to promote pedophilia in several viral posts on twitter they were outraged emails krause said they were saying how can that be you are not pro pedophilia i know that krause and colijn are gay travel bloggers who tell their followers of gay friendly and lgbtq owned businesses and communities throughout the world they had no idea their faces were being used to promote an idea they found abhorrent one of their pictures which features krause and colijn kissing in front of a rainbow flag had been stolen by a twitter troll who went by the name alex an account that was created in december the account then tweeted messages promoting pedophilia it s frustrating to see someone misusing our image for political purposes basically supporting an argument against the lgbtq community with our work krause said the account successfully spread across twitter the deliberately defamatory idea that pedophilia is an acceptable part of lgbtq life over the last half decade that concept has become a staple of far right internet trolls on websites like the fringe message board 4chan and the troll s message quickly gained internet traction some far right news websites wrote articles based on the tweet including the federalist papers which published a post with the headline resistance member says pedophilia is sexual orientation claims bigotry one tweet from the troll s account which used the handle vaceyi stated that pedophilia is a sexual orientation you bigots that tweet has drawn more than 16 000 replies and received attention on far right parts of the internet drawing scathing responses from right wing commentator and former major league baseball pitcher curt schilling and pizzagate conspiracy theorist jack posobiec among others they took the fake message seriously and used it to suggest that the lgbtq community supports the sexual abuse of children they are actually trying to argue that pedophiles are an oppressed minority posobiec wrote on twitter attaching screenshots of vaceyi s tweets many warned this day would come various efforts to tie the lgbtq community to pedophilia have been linked back to 4chan including the creation of a fake rainbow flag for gay pride month that supposedly was designed to show acceptance of pedophilia the flag and a fake lgbtp acronym were debunked by the fact checking organization snopes in 2016 a 4chan post stated if they want to demand that society accept their horses identities then it s time we slip in one of our own and implored users to convince them pedos deserve rights too shortly after vaceyi s tweets went viral one 4chan user posted posobiec s tweet mentioning the account wondering if posobiec knew that vaceyi is a troll does know he s being trolled by you guys and just going with it to look good or does he think the person tweeting this is serious the user asked the user behind vaceyi did not respond to a request for comment the vaceyi account used strategies that have become common among efforts to spread misinformation and propaganda on social media building up a small following by tweeting pro lgbtq hashtags and retweeting gay and lesbian aid organizations before sending the pro pedophilia messages krause said he and his followers repeatedly reported the vaceyi account using his identity to twitter which insisted he provide proof of his identity the account later changed its profile picture to a stock photo of two black men kissing twitter permanently suspended vaceyi on thursday night after nbc news asked about the account twitter rules do not allow the promotion of child sexual exploitation the company s rules also bars impersonation and hateful conduct this type of deliberate attempt to undermine and disrupt the health of the public conversation has absolutely no place on our service a twitter spokesperson said in an emailed statement coordinated activity of this nature including running multiple accounts and adopting fake personae is a violation of the twitter rules we are aggressively taking action pursuant with our policies zeke stokes the vice president of programs for the lgbtq advocacy group glaad told nbc news that platforms need to work faster to cut down on this sort of defamation against the lgbtq community social media platforms have the right and the responsibility to protect their products from being weaponized and their users from being targeted by those who wish to spread hate misinformation and malicious rhetoric stokes said anti lgbtq leaders have long tried to surface these debunked lies about lgbtq people despite the fact that our culture knows these fear tactics are blatantly false smears that have attempted to tie the lgbtq community to pedophilia are decades old according to thomas g plante a psychologist and professor at santa clara university who has studied the psychopathology behind pedophilia for more than 30 years the critical thing is that sexual orientation in and of itself is not a risk factor for psychopathology for anything let alone pedophilia plante said in an interview the majority of people who are pedophiles are step fathers older brothers next door neighbors or others like that it has to do with access impulse control problems and other kinds of psychopathology the recent spate of anti science talking points about pedophilia from extremists drives me kind of crazy plante said you ve got plenty of people out there who are experts in this stuff who treat and evaluate people plante said all of that gets discarded because there s someone out there who has an anonymous twitter account who s much louder in the meantime krause said this experience has emboldened him to continue his work showing spaces gay travelers can go without harassment through out the world we see our work as activism said krause people should know about this part of our work don t fall for this other thing we try to tell people that we just want to be treated equally
elon musk s ex girlfriend grimes and rapper azealia banks may testify in a lawsuit brought by tesla investors against musk a lawsuit sparked by the billionaire s august tweet wherein he declared his intention to privatize tesla at a price of 420 per share this delicious sentence is brought to you by banks extensive reporting last year on her failed attempts to record music with grimes during which the rapper shared a screenshot of an alleged message from the indie singer that stated musk chose the 420 price because grimes got him into marijuana jokes and he s super entertained by 420 because it s the weed number as previously reported musk is in this mess because his tweet which also claimed that funding to take tesla private was secured potentially constitutes fraud musk had not in fact secured said funding and was therefore misleading investors the securities and exchange commission argued the suit seeks to bar musk from serving as c e o of any publicly traded company musk stepped down as tesla s c e o after the suit was filed but remains the company s chairman musk tried to explain his conspicuous choice of number in an interview last august with the new york times he said he chose 420 because he wanted to value tesla about 20 percent higher than where the company s stock was then trading a calculation that would have put the price at 419 per share it seemed like better karma at 420 than at 419 he said but i was not on weed to be clear tesla investors apparently believe grimes and or banks may be able to verify that claim and otherwise shed light on musk s state of mind when he hit publish banks also claimed that while visiting musk s home she saw him tweeting on acid she later apologized shareholders have reportedly expressed interest in subpoenaing both artists as well as newspapers and blogs that reported on the events surrounding the tweet whether we ll actually be treated to these two beloved weirdos testifying in a high profile securities fraud case remains to be seen bloomberg reports today that musk s attorney is arguing against the potential subpoenas writing in a filing it is readily apparent that this is more of an effort to sensationalize these proceedings than a legitimate attempt to preserve evidence ideally this saga never ends correction a previous version of this post claimed grimes and banks might be subpoenaed in a lawsuit filed by the sec the subpoenas were requested in a separate lawsuit bought by tesla investors
san jose calif rizi manzon lives in the heart of silicon valley in a modest looking neighborhood of garden apartments and one story houses on small lots his own home is five minutes from apple s headquarters in what is by some measures the most expensive housing market in the country average rent in santa clara county is over 3 500 if manzon a culinary arts teacher at a nearby high school had to pay market rates for his one bedroom apartment housing costs would eat up 75 percent of his 65 000 salary he estimated luckily for him he pays just 1 450 per month manzon 38 is getting this bargain only because his employer the santa clara unified school district owns his apartment complex and rents to its teachers at below market rates it is an uncommon arrangement employer as landlord that is starting to catch on elsewhere as school employees say they cannot afford to live comfortably in regions awash in tech dollars and it is just one of several radical solutions for struggling educators in the nation s economic boom towns from san francisco to seattle to denver to los angeles some are spending four hours per day commuting or have relied on charitable funding for mortgage assistance while several districts have tried to make it easier for teachers to live where they work their efforts are not always welcomed by local homeowners opening up new debates over gentrification and what obligations the expanding tech sector has to the cities that host its offices the santa clara apartments are considered a model by school district officials in san jose the large city a few miles southeast the san jose unified school district has its own plan raze aging school buildings send their students to new facilities and turn that land into affordable rental housing for at least 300 teachers and school workers but in a city that is rolling out the red carpet for google employees the city council recently voted to approve a major land sale to the tech giant the teacher housing idea has drawn a backlash some parents in almaden valley a suburban style enclave on the outskirts of san jose are not eager to see two of their schools leland high school and bret harte middle school relocated about 2 miles away in order to build affordable rental housing for educators they are both very very high end schools with lots of parental involvement said greg braley a leader of the opposition to the district s proposal and a resident of the neighborhood honestly the schools are so good people pay a premium to live in this area braley works in finance and sends his own 9 year old daughter to private school but said she may attend public school in the future rather than disrupting a high achieving community he argued it would make more sense to provide teachers with a housing allowance of some kind something the district says it cannot afford to do hundreds flocked to an october community meeting to vent their frustration with the district s plan and over 6 000 people have signed an online petition started by braley against it low income housing doesn t belong in almaden one resident commented on the petition this would devalue home prices in the area significantly wrote another the school district with 30 000 students is losing 1 out of every 7 teachers each spring some high need students like those with disabilities are being taught by long term substitutes or contractors like many other districts across the country with teacher shortages it has begun recruiting educators from the developing world starting salaries for teachers here range between 55 000 and 79 000 that kind of money does not go far in an area where the median home price is over 1 million and the district cannot easily raise compensation to account for housing costs despite being one of the nation s richest states california s education spending about 11 000 per student was slightly below the national average in 2016 land is the most valuable asset the district has district owned housing would have interested jesse escobar 33 an academic counselor at a middle school in san jose he and his girlfriend shana riehart a high school teacher were priced out of town and moved 25 miles away to hayward california riehart quit her job to take a position closer to their new home traffic means escobar s commute sometimes takes an hour and 45 minutes each way he said it had been hurtful to hear parents oppose the housing plan for educators instead of saying teachers if you had said engineers from google or doctors from kaiser would the tone have been different escobar asked families trust us with their kids from 8 to 3 every day i don t know why it wouldn t be the case that they would trust us in their communities supporters of the housing plan have a long fight ahead on election day a ballot initiative to approve a city bond that could have helped pay for the proposal fell just short of passing the plan now needs the approval of the district board of education and eventually a property tax assessment would have to pass at the ballot box it could be a yearslong process and opponents warn it could cost hundreds of millions of dollars stephen mcmahon the district s deputy superintendent blamed much of the neighborhood opposition on the stigma against affordable housing standing outside of leland high school one of the campuses that could be torn down in the proposal mcmahon said they re closing their eyes and seeing a 10 story apartment complex with people smoking pot on the doorsteps that s not at all what we discussed doing out here mcmahon said that each of the proposed housing sites would match existing housing stock high rise apartments downtown single family houses in almaden valley he acknowledged that the school district lacked expertise in real estate but said partner organizations would be brought on to help this isn t the work we want to do mcmahon said we have to do the housing thing because not being able to get employees compromises everything we want to do with our instruction and learning other school districts including san francisco los angeles and some in colorado and north carolina are trying similar solutions in santa clara the district owned apartment where manzon lives has a long waiting list of teachers but even that is not a full solution manzon a former chef will have to leave his home in three years because each resident is allowed to stay in the district apartments only seven years he is considering leaving teaching he has received higher paying offers to work as an executive chef or moving to nevada where much of his family has relocated there my brother was able to purchase a home on a honda mechanic s salary he said teachers who can come up with at least half of a down payment can turn to landed a startup that helps educators buy homes holly gonzalez 34 a kindergarten teacher in east san jose and her husband daniel a school district it specialist were able to buy a three bedroom apartment for 610 000 this summer with help from their parents and from landed when they sell the home they will owe landed 25 percent of any gain in its value the company is financed partly by the chan zuckerberg initiative mark zuckerberg s charitable arm gonzalez who has two sons said that she and her husband were grateful but that they had given up a lot like a backyard to be willing to pay what we paid for this you have to be desperate she said they remain anxious about their economic future especially since san jose s land sale to google which the city council approved in december over the shouts of anti gentrification activists and is expected to bring in 20 000 mostly high income tech jobs gentrification gonzalez said could push out even more low income families in her district and declining school enrollment could mean layoffs for teachers supporters of the google deal like mayor sam liccardo of san jose say the company will help finance affordable housing as part of the agreement any new apartment buildings constructed near the campus will set aside a quarter of the units as affordable liccardo said it was unfortunate that anxiety about closing schools had gotten mixed up with the debate over cost of living in the city but he projected that within a few years some of the same parents who opposed san jose unified s plan for teachers would grasp the importance of affordable housing when people see their own children can no longer afford to live in the community as young adults he said it will change
if you think southern b c cities are the only ones experiencing declining sales and prices think again way out here on the best coast it s easy to think of ourselves living in something of a separated off bubble and that when it comes to real estate in the south of the province the bubble looks to be deflating but the fact is that b c s biggest cities are among many around the globe that are currently experiencing a real estate market slowdown most of us are aware that the greater toronto area is also in the property doldrums with sales in 2018 down 18 per cent year over year similar to that of greater victoria and vancouver island down 20 and 19 per cent respectively but not as steep as metro vancouver s 31 6 per cent annual decline the average 2018 home resale price in our country s biggest city is also down 4 7 per cent over the previous year but what about the rest of the world property markets in major global centres are also on the slide most notably in pricey cities such as hong kong shanghai beijing singapore london and sydney in hong kong and mainland china s biggest cities prices are steadily declining with prices in beijing and shanghai around five per cent off their peak of around six months ago largely due to a slowing chinese economy affected by trade wars with the u s in london and across the u k uncertainty over brexit has sidelined homebuyers and london property prices have fallen for two consecutive years in australia s biggest city unsustainably high prices along with a pullback in demand from mainland chinese buyers have combined to drag real estate markets down over the past year with prices down more than 11 per cent in sydney according to corelogic plus singapore s prices have been hit by increased taxation and new mortgage rules bloomberg published a fascinating story on this topic january 3 and identified that even as each slowing market has its own set of characteristics most of them also have a few factors in common 1 tougher government regulations on mortgages and finances these range from the mortgage stress test in canada to stricter loan to value ratios in singapore to limits on how much money can leave mainland china 2 rising interest rates canada is far from the only country to see increased borrowing costs the bank of england led by former bank of canada governor mark carney has been similarly making incremental hikes over the past year or so and rates in singapore have risen several times over the past year with more hikes predicted in 2019 australia s reserve bank however has maintained record low rates and prices are still dropping there too 3 unpredictable stock markets with the world s markets fluctuating wildly much of which uncertainty is linked to u s china trade wars investors around the globe are unsure where things will land and are keeping a low profile 4 diminishing demand from china property markets in most pacific rim cities whether in north america australasia or asia are affected by the wobbling chinese economy and a tightening of rules on how much money is allowed to flow out of mainland china bloomberg cites an april 2018 international monetary fund study which issued a warning on the effect of simultaneous global real estate market corrections the imf wrote that such a phenomenon could lead to financial and macroeconomic instability however a glimmer of hope for global economic stability was issued today january 4 as major stock markets made a sudden recovery on the news of renewed trade talks between china and the u s it may seem like some consolation that b c cities are not alone in their housing market decline after all it makes for a more level playing field globally speaking but from a macro economic viewpoint it s not such a good thing
president trump speaks to reporters in the rose garden on friday as vice president mike pence looks on photo jim young reuters washington president trump floated the possibility he could declare a national emergency in order to build a wall on the southern border during a freewheeling press conference at the white house on friday i can do it if i want we can call a national emergency because of the security of our country absolutely trump said adding we can do it i haven t done it i may do it i may do it but we could call a national emergency and build it very quickly trump s comments confirmed an earlier report from abc that he has considered making an emergency declaration the president s press conference was held in the rose garden and followed a meeting with congressional leaders from both parties about the government shutdown which began on dec 22 the shutdown was sparked by trump s demand for over 5 billion for a border wall democrats have refused to provide the funding and argued that a wall would be ineffective though he suggested he could build the wall without authorization from congress under emergency powers trump said he is still trying to make a deal with the democrats if we can do it through a negotiated process we re giving that a shot the president said in response to a question asking if he meant that as a threat trump said raising an emergency declaration shouldn t be taken by democrats as intimidation i d never threaten anybody but i am allowed to do that yes trump said a presidential declaration of a national emergency to construct a border wall would likely face legal challenges trump and other administration officials have argued there is a crisis on the border and made dubious claims that terrorists have been apprehended there at his press conference trump was joined by department of homeland security secretary kirstjen nielsen who repeated his claim that terrorists have been caught at the border although without providing conclusive details prior to trump s press conference newly minted democratic house speaker nancy pelosi and democratic senate minority leader chuck schumer made brief remarks in front of the west wing about their meeting with trump pelosi characterized it as a lengthy and sometimes contentious conversation schumer said trump expressed willingness to keep the government closed for a very long period of time months or even years in the rose garden trump said schumer s report was accurate but that he had set up working groups to negotiate throughout the coming weekend and expressed optimism a deal could be reached as early as next week the president took questions for over a half hour at the press conference among many other things he also addressed controversial comments made by a freshman congresswoman who called for his impeachment and recent dramatic declines in the stock markets tied to the ongoing trade tensions with china trump also said he discussed potentially making a deal to revive the daca protections for young immigrants as part of an agreement to end the shutdown but he reiterated his view that this could not be done until the legal challenges to his attempts to end that program were resolved and trump addressed the federal workers who are missing paychecks due to the shutdown he said he is confident they are supportive of his position since a lot of them want to see border security trump also discussed some of the details of his vision for a wall he said his administration is already using eminent domain to secure needed territory along the border and said the government has made generous offers to people whose land is being taken trump said this process would not slow down wall construction it s not going to hold it up because under the military version of eminent domain and under actually homeland security we can do it before we even start we have already purchased a lot of it trump said whatever happens the finished product will not match trump s signature campaign promise which was a concrete border wall that would be paid for by mexico trump has recently modified his rhetoric and said he is open to steel slats or another type of barrier at his press conference trump insisted this would only be a stronger version of the wall than what he promised steel is stronger than concrete if i build this wall or fence or anything the democrats need to call it if i build a steel wall rather than a concrete wall it will actually be stronger than concrete trump said trump has recently claimed mexico would pay for the wall through his new usmca trade pact yahoo news asked trump to describe the specific mechanism in that agreement that would lead to mexico paying for the wall trump initially did not directly answer the question and instead declared you re going to be seeing it very soon the president went on to suggest the country will be making billions and billions of dollars a year in more money through his trade deal as businesses return to the u s and that this would be paying for the wall many many times over however the usmca has yet to be approved by congress even if the pact is approved and does indeed lead to increased tax revenue that money could not be used for a border wall without congressional approval nevertheless trump said these funds would be coming in a period of a year two years and three years absolutely mexico is paying for the wall trump said read more from yahoo news

washington federal reserve chairman jerome powell said friday that he will not resign if asked to do so by president donald trump and that he is prepared to be patient in deciding when to raise interest rates again both of those messages cheered stock market investors who had been worried about trump s repeated attacks on his hand picked choice to lead the nation s central bank and also the fed s seemingly inexorable march to higher rates there is no pre set path for policy powell said during an appearance at a conference of economists in atlanta with the muted inflation readings we have seen coming in we will be patient as we watch to see how the economy evolves private economists viewed powell s comments as a strong signal that the fed which in december had projected another two rate hikes in 2019 may end up deciding to pause hikes for several months with chairman powell s remarks today i would say they will do just one hike or maybe no hikes this year said sung won sohn chief economist at ss economics powell is definitely trying to calm the markets wall street which opened sharply higher after a report showing 312 000 jobs gained in december surged even higher during powell s appearance the dow jones industrial average finished the day up 746 points or 3 3 per cent powell called the jobs report very strong and said he was also encouraged by the rise in the labour force participation rate and gains in wages which he said for me at this time does not raise concerns about too high inflation trump has complained that the fed has pushed rates higher despite the fact that there is no evidence that inflation was getting out of control the president s attacks had become so intense that they had raised concerns that he might be considering firing powell a development which could send the market into a tailspin trump would appear to be on shaky legal ground if he tried to fire powell under the law that governs the federal reserve a president can only remove a fed chairman for cause courts in cases that involved other agencies have interpreted that language to not cover policy differences asked if he would resign if trump asked him to do so powell responded with a short no powell s willingness to be flexible on interest rates was welcome news to investors many of whom worried that fed chair risked cutting off the current economic expansion by continuing to raise interest rates despite signs the u s economy was cooling off a little on friday powell said we are always prepared to shift the stance of policy and to shift it significantly if necessary to meet the goals of maximum employment and stable prices powell gave as an example the fact that in 2016 when janet yellen was fed chair the central bank began the year with a projection that it would raise rates four times that year but ended up raising rates only once because the economy hit a soft patch appearing on a panel with his two predecessors yellen and ben bernanke powell also said that the fed could alter its approach to trimming its huge balance sheet if it determines such a change is needed the pace of fed rate hikes and the lowering of the balance sheet which tends to put upward pressure on interest rates had both been concerns of investors in recent months the stock market has seen stomach churning declines since october a development that trump has blamed on the fed s continued rate hikes although the president s trade dispute with china as well as concerns about global economic growth also played a part in the market volatility the fed had increased the size of its balance sheet four fold to a record 4 5 trillion in an effort to push long term interest rates lower but it has been gradually reversing that stance over the past year although the balance sheet still remains above 4 trillion but some investors have worried that that process could push long term rates higher at a time when the economy was slowing powell on friday stressed that the fed was prepared to adjust the pace at which it trimmed the balance sheet if necessary to support economic growth while trump has sent out a number of tweets criticizing powell and calling the fed the biggest threat to the economy powell said that he had not received any direct pressure from the white house asked if he had had any face to face meetings with trump powell said he had not although he said previous fed leaders have had discussions from time to time with previous presidents asked if any future meeting with trump was scheduled powell said i have no news on that nothing is scheduled

catherine lucey lisa mascaro and jill colvin the associated press washington with no shutdown resolution in sight democratic leaders urged president donald trump to reopen the government friday in a white house meeting during which they said he indicated he could keep it closed for months or even years trump met with the congressional leaders for the second time in three days amid an impasse over trump s funding demands for his proposed wall at the u s mexico border democrats emerged from the lengthy meeting to report little if any progress we told the president we needed the government open he resisted in fact he said he d keep the government closed for a very long period of time months or even years said democratic senate minority leader chuck schumer the meeting on the 14th day of the shutdown came after house democrats muscled through legislation to fund the government but not trump s proposed wall as the impasse over border funding dragged on some gop senators up for re election in 2020 voiced discomfort but trump dug in ahead of the meeting writing in a letter to congress walls work that s why rich powerful and successful people build them around their homes senate majority leader mitch mcconnell said even though the new congress has convened since the last session at the white house the basic steps that are needed to end this unfortunate standoff really haven t changed at all mcconnell has said measures approved by the house are non starters on his side of the capitol without the president s support any viable compromise will need to carry the endorsement of the president before it receives a vote he said as progress has stalled some republican senators want action cory gardner of colorado said congress should pass bipartisan bills to fund government while we continue to fight for more border security money and susan collins of maine said her goal is to get government reopened as quickly as possible we have bipartisan agreements on six of the remaining funding bills and i d like to see those signed into law collins said negotiations on border security should continue while a stopgap funding resolution is approved for the department of homeland security senate democratic leader chuck schumer said that if mcconnell and senate republicans stay on the sidelines trump can keep the government shutdown for a long time the president needs an intervention schumer said and senate republicans are just the right ones to intervene adding to the unease are economic jitters as analysts warn of the risks of closures that are disrupting government operations across multiple departments and agencies at a time of other uncertainties in the stock market and foreign trade house speaker nancy pelosi said trump and senate republicans should take yes for an answer and pass the legislation without money for the wall that the senate approved on a voice vote last month we re not doing a wall does anyone have any doubt that we re not doing a wall pelosi said thursday night republican sen lindsey graham who is close to trump said he spoke to the president thursday about a potential compromise package that would include border wall money and some way to provide legal standing for the young immigrants here illegally but working or attending school under the deferred action for childhood arrivals program trump ended the program but a lawsuit to allow it to continue is making its way through the courts he s open minded to this graham said in an interview but he added the president hasn t committed graham said he has been talking with other senators about a deal that would include 5 billion in wall funding coupled with two measures to shield immigrants from deportation one is the bridge act bipartisan legislation that would extend daca protection to some 700 000 young immigrants already in the program the other component would be a fix for nearly 400 000 immigrants in the temporary protective status program whose status has been jeopardized by the administration s decision to roll back that program which is for arrivals from certain countries facing disaster and war torn conditions pelosi has already said she opposes trading daca for the wall and it s unclear if other democrats and republicans would be willing to engage in immigration negotiations but graham called such a compromise the best way out of the shutdown if you got a better off ramp i m all ears he said trump ally sean hannity on his fox news show thursday said the president is willing to negotiate daca but vice president mike pence told fox news late thursday bottom line if there s no wall there s no deal in their first votes of the new congress house democrats approved bills thursday night to re open government at previously agreed upon levels several republicans crossed over to join them friday s white house meeting with trump includes eight leaders the top two democrats and republicans of both chambers a session earlier in the week produced finger pointing with no breakthroughs republicans said the new round of talks might be more productive now that pelosi is speaker but democrats said the problem isn t with them but with trump who once boasted of the shutdown but now must try to explain blocking the effort to re open government with bills republicans had earlier approved trump on wednesday told the leaders he would look foolish for conceding without money for the wall along the u s mexico border on thursday trump made a surprise appearance at the white house briefing room pledging to keep up the fight for his signature campaign promise you can call it a barrier you can call it whatever you want trump said but essentially we need protection in our country we re going to make it good the people of our country want it trump is demanding billions of dollars to build his wall along the u s border with mexico asked if she would give trump 1 for a wall to reopen the government pelosi said one dollar yeah one dollar the fact is a wall is an immorality it s not who we are as a nation polls show a majority of americans oppose the border wall although republicans strongly support it white house and department of homeland security officials have spent recent days trying to make both a public and private case that the situation at the border has reached a crisis point that demands more money than democrats have offered trump tweeted an ominous video thursday with images of what appeared to be migrants trying to rush the border and clashing with law enforcement beneath the words crisis at the border drugs and crime the video concludes with footage of trump at the border along with audio from one of his rallies in which he vows to build his promised border wall and the crowd chants build the wall associated press writers eileen putman lisa mascaro laurie kellman kevin freking alan fram and mary clare jalonick contributed
josh boak the associated press washington u s employers dramatically stepped up hiring in december adding 312 000 jobs in an encouraging display of strength for an economy in the midst of a trade war slowing global growth and a partial government shutdown the labor department said friday that the unemployment rate rose slightly to 3 9 percent but that reflected a surge in job seekers a positive for growth average hourly pay improved 3 2 percent from a year ago up from 2 7 percent at the end of 2017 the jolt in hiring offered a dose of reassurance after a tumultuous few months on the financial markets stocks surged on the news along with word that the u s and china will hold trade talks next week and comments from federal reserve chairman jerome powell that the u s central bank will be flexible in judging whether to raise interest rates the dow jones industrial average climbed roughly 700 points in early afternoon trading an increase of about 3 percent job growth at this pace is a sign that the economy will continue to expand for a 10th straight year even if overall growth slows somewhat because of the waning stimulus from president donald trump s tax cuts the labor market is very strong even though the economy appears to be slowing said eric winograd senior u s economist at the investment management firm alliancebernstein those two things cannot coexist for very long either weakening demand will lead firms to dial back the pace of hiring or the robust pace of hiring will lead firms to ramp back up production in recent weeks financial markets have been increasingly worried about the path of economic growth this year the dow suffered its worst december decline since the middle of the depression in 1931 as surveys of economists and business leaders suggested the united states could be in a recession by 2020 major companies such as apple say their sales are being jeopardized by the trade war between washington and beijing factory activity in both china and the united states has weakened with the institute for supply management s u s manufacturing index on thursday posting its steepest decline in a decade china the world s second largest economy is also mired in a slowdown as its consumers have become cautious losing much of their appetite for real estate iphones ford vehicles and jewelry from tiffany co the u s government is about to enter its third week of a partial shutdown with negotiations stalled over trump s insistence that democrats agree on funding for a border wall the president s attacks on the fed and powell over the central bank s interest rate increases have also worried investors powell stressed at a panel in atlanta on friday that he would not resign if the president asked him to do so the expected continuation of steady job growth suggests that some of the risks might be for the moment anyway overblown however the stock market will have to weigh whether the strong job growth will lead the fed to raises rates even more than anticipated trump called the job growth great on twitter but kevin hassett chairman of the white house council of economic advisers told reporters on thursday that the next jobs report for january could be weak if the government shutdown continues hundreds of thousands of government employees put out of work would lower the job totals so when we see the january jobs number it could be a big negative hassett said the health care food services construction and manufacturing sectors were the primary contributors to last month s hiring health care and education services added 82 000 jobs the biggest jump since february 2012 restaurants and drinking places posted a net gain of 40 700 jobs builders added 38 000 construction jobs while manufacturers increased their payrolls by 32 000 workers businesses are still searching for more workers fresh coat painters based in cincinnati plans to nearly double the 300 employees who paint homes and businesses as it expands this year across this country the franchiser is also launching an apprenticeship program to attract workers in addition to providing higher pay and benefits tara riley president of fresh coat said that franchise owners are having to actively search for workers instead of simply posting ads we realized it was a mindset change you have to be recruiting rather than hiring riley said in 2018 employers added 2 6 million jobs or an average of nearly 217 000 a month according to the labor department at some point even if the economy remains healthy monthly job gains will likely downshift to a more gradual pace this is because there is a dwindling pool of unemployed people there were 6 3 million people looking for a job in december down from 6 5 million a year ago people should not get used to numbers like the one we saw this month said martha gimbel director of economic research at the jobs site indeed eventually job growth is going to start slowing down when that happens we shouldn t panic

if you think southern b c cities are the only ones experiencing declining sales and prices think again way out here on the best coast it s easy to think of ourselves living in something of a separated off bubble and that when it comes to real estate in the south of the province the bubble looks to be deflating but the fact is that b c s biggest cities are among many around the globe that are currently experiencing a real estate market slowdown most of us are aware that the greater toronto area is also in the property doldrums with sales in 2018 down 18 per cent year over year similar to that of greater victoria and vancouver island down 20 and 19 per cent respectively but not as steep as metro vancouver s 31 6 per cent annual decline the average 2018 home resale price in our country s biggest city is also down 4 7 per cent over the previous year but what about the rest of the world property markets in major global centres are also on the slide most notably in pricey cities such as hong kong shanghai beijing singapore london and sydney in hong kong and mainland china s biggest cities prices are steadily declining with prices in beijing and shanghai around five per cent off their peak of around six months ago largely due to a slowing chinese economy affected by trade wars with the u s in london and across the u k uncertainty over brexit has sidelined homebuyers and london property prices have fallen for two consecutive years in australia s biggest city unsustainably high prices along with a pullback in demand from mainland chinese buyers have combined to drag real estate markets down over the past year with prices down more than 11 per cent in sydney according to corelogic plus singapore s prices have been hit by increased taxation and new mortgage rules bloomberg published a fascinating story on this topic january 3 and identified that even as each slowing market has its own set of characteristics most of them also have a few factors in common 1 tougher government regulations on mortgages and finances these range from the mortgage stress test in canada to stricter loan to value ratios in singapore to limits on how much money can leave mainland china 2 rising interest rates canada is far from the only country to see increased borrowing costs the bank of england led by former bank of canada governor mark carney has been similarly making incremental hikes over the past year or so and rates in singapore have risen several times over the past year with more hikes predicted in 2019 australia s reserve bank however has maintained record low rates and prices are still dropping there too 3 unpredictable stock markets with the world s markets fluctuating wildly much of which uncertainty is linked to u s china trade wars investors around the globe are unsure where things will land and are keeping a low profile 4 diminishing demand from china property markets in most pacific rim cities whether in north america australasia or asia are affected by the wobbling chinese economy and a tightening of rules on how much money is allowed to flow out of mainland china bloomberg cites an april 2018 international monetary fund study which issued a warning on the effect of simultaneous global real estate market corrections the imf wrote that such a phenomenon could lead to financial and macroeconomic instability however a glimmer of hope for global economic stability was issued today january 4 as major stock markets made a sudden recovery on the news of renewed trade talks between china and the u s it may seem like some consolation that b c cities are not alone in their housing market decline after all it makes for a more level playing field globally speaking but from a macro economic viewpoint it s not such a good thing
