us central bankers are trying to cool the hottest inflation in 40 years without tilting the economy into a recession most federal reserve officials agreed at their gathering this month that the central bank needed to tighten in half point steps over the next couple of meetings continuing an aggressive set of moves that would leave policy makers with flexibility to shift gears later if needed most participants judged that 50 basis point increases in the target range would likely be appropriate at the next couple of meetings minutes of the fed s may 3 4 meeting released wednesday in washington showed many participants judged that expediting the removal of policy accommodation would leave the committee well positioned later this year to assess the effects of policy firming and the extent to which economic developments warranted policy adjustments treasury yields fluctuated stocks rose and the dollar pared its gain following the report markets continued to show traders pricing in 100 basis points of rate hikes over the next two meetings there s no disagreement in the committee they ve got to get moving here so it s not a big surprise the real question is going to come later when we get into the fall and when they decide whether to slow down or pause ethan harris head of global economics research at bank of america corp said during an interview on bloomberg television i think the fed has to risk a downturn he said they ve let things run out of control after raising interest rates by a half percentage point at the may meeting the minutes confirmed support by most officials to continue such increases over at least their next two gatherings with their inflation battle far from won fed officials noted that a restrictive stance of policy may well become appropriate depending on the evolving economic outlook and the risks to the outlook the minutes said they said that labor demand continued to outstrip available supply in the weeks since the meeting financial market volatility has spiked as investors fret over the risk of a downturn stocks have plummeted treasuries have rallied and investors have pared back bets on how quickly policy rates will rise atlanta fed president raphael bostic suggested on monday that a september pause might make sense if price pressures cooled the minutes showed officials attentive to financial conditions as they prepare to raise rates further several participants who commented on issues related to financial stability noted that the tightening of monetary policy could interact with vulnerabilities related to the liquidity of markets for treasury securities and to the private sector s intermediation capacity the minutes said worry about the outlook for corporate profits and rising interest rates has also roiled financial markets the standard and poor s 500 stock index was down 17 year to date through tuesday while u s treasury two year notes yielded 2 48 versus about 0 8 in early january at the meeting officials also finalized plans to allow their 8 9 trillion balance sheet to begin shrinking putting additional upward pressure on borrowing costs starting june 1 holdings of treasuries will be allowed to decline by 30 billion a month rising in increments to 60 billion a month in september while mortgage backed securities holdings will shrink by 17 5 billion a month increasing to 35 billion the minutes showed that the fed staff revised up their inflation forecast they estimated that the personal consumption expenditures price index would rise 4 3 in 2022 before decelerating to a 2 5 increase next year u s central bankers are quickly pulling back monetary stimulus as they attempt to curb the highest inflation rates in decades price gains have been fueled by low interest rates knotted supply chains and higher food and energy costs in the wake of russia s invasion of ukraine the fed s target for its preferred inflation gauge the commerce department s personal consumption expenditures price index is 2 a year the measure rose 6 6 for the 12 months ending march while the labor department s consumer price index rose 8 3 in april high inflation has angered americans and hurt president joe biden s approval ratings with ire also directed at the fed even so jerome powell was confirmed by the senate to a second term as chair this month in an 80 19 vote so far the rise in borrowing costs has yet to significantly dent consumer demand retail sales rose at a solid pace in april although with the 30 year mortgage rate now above 5 the pace of home sales has slowed adds analyst reaction in fourth paragraph with assistance from jordan yadoo liz capo mccormick jonnelle marte and vince golle

trump campaign collusion with russia to prevent hillary clinton s election is a fantasy says donald jeffries yet the corporate media continues to push the discredited theory as fact by donald jeffries the mainstream media and high profile democratic party politicians continue to push the fantasy that russia colluded with the trump presidential campaign in order to deny deep state favorite hillary clinton the oval office as princeton professor stephen f cohen noted in a recent article in the nation this has served to all but shackle donald trump as a crisis negotiator with russian president vladimir putin this past july trump was widely blasted by the establishment for committing treason simply by meeting with putin in helsinki special counsel robert mueller has been investigating alleged connections between the trump campaign and russian officials since may 2017 however recently even a source as unfriendly to trump as national public radio had to admit that mueller s case looks weaker than ever and journalist michael isikoff author of the fanciful book russian roulette the inside story of putin s war on america and the election of donald trump admitted that many of the allegations in the so called steele dossier which claimed that russia possessed incriminating material about trump will never be proven and are likely false trump quickly took to twitter in the wake of isikoff s comments and declared michael isikoff was the first to report dossier allegations and now seriously doubts the dossier claims the whole russian collusion thing was a hoax while the mainstream media and its late night sycophantic talk show hosts continue to harp on russiagate fantasies much more credible evidence linking the previous obama administration to efforts at disseminating material designed to link trump to russian officials has been routinely ignored by them in late december judicial watch released two different batches of state department documents which were heavily redacted in customary u s government manner the documents revealed that classified information was sent to several members of the senate just prior to trump s inauguration these documents demonstrate how the obama state department was frantically handing out this information to democratic senators like ben cardin of maryland and mark warner of virginia as well as friendly republicans like tennessee s robert corker a chain of emails in early january 2017 revealed that obama assistant secretary of state for european and eurasian affairs victoria nuland was attempting to send documents supposedly linking trump and the russians to warner in one email later that month the herculean effort was acknowledged with comments literally only hours before trump was inaugurated like we made the deadline and thank you everyone for what was truly a department wide effort these documents show remarkable evidence of the non stop unethical effort in the obama state department to gather and send its own dossier of classified information on russia in an effort to discredit the incoming trump administration judicial watch president tom fitton stated as far back as feb 13 even the washington post could declare in an op ed headline the media is ignoring ties between the clinton campaign and russians the article pointed out the fact that christopher steele author of the notorious dossier was paid with money from the clinton campaign steele was known to be closely allied with bill clinton aide sidney sid vicious blumenthal and jonathan winer a former staffer to john kerry these alliances received scant attention in the mainstream media when compared to the press given to donald trump jr meeting once with a russian lawyer or the highly dubious allegations of collusion against trump supporters like roger stone paul manafort and jerome corsi to quote from the story when the democrats and their allies in the media insist that we need to know what the russians did to influence the election and interfere in the democratic process it is fair to ask which russians are they talking about are they talking about the russians who were solicited by steele and his democrat paymasters what were the russians interests and were any of them paying steele in 2015 the establishment s newspaper of record the new york times reported that uranium one a canadian company that had been acquired by the russian atomic energy agency rosatom in a merger approved by a consortium of government agencies including hillary clinton s state department had donated over 2 million to the clinton foundation which was not publicly disclosed by the clintons in another instance a russian bank with ties to the kremlin which was promoting uranium one stock paid bill clinton 500 000 for a speech in moscow as trump himself noted hillary clinton gave them 20 of our uranium gave russia for a big payment it shouldn t be a crime to talk with private citizens or even public officials from another country that used to be called diplomacy and mainstream inferences of impropriety or illegality in this regard have been inconsistent to say the least donald jeffries is a highly respected author and researcher whose work on the jfk rfk and mlk assassinations and other high crimes of the deep state has been read by millions of people across the world jeffries is also the author of two books currently being sold at the afp online store
philadelphia a federal judge on thursday ordered a custodian to oversee the management of the republic bank s parent firm after the death of a bank board member brought the battle for control of the company to a fever pitch prior to the death of longtime director theodore flocco at age 77 on may 10 republic first bancorp inc s board was split 4 4 over control of the company half supported keeping the current chairman vernon hill ii and the other half sought to oust him the evenly split board has largely ignored the interests of the institution and its shareholders in warring for control of republic first wrote judge paul s diamond in his decision to appoint a custodian the custodian alfred w putnam jr must convene a special shareholders meeting to elect flocco s replacement on or before july 10 per the decision he is also responsible for managing the company in the best interest of shareholders and can elect a ninth board member without appointing a custodian the chaotic and destructive circumstances public accusations of self dealing fraud and gross mismanagement and attempts to exploit the sudden death of a director will continue according to diamond this comes a week after the judge issued a status quo order preventing the board from using the broken tie to appoint a new chairman within hours of flocco s death hill s adversaries on the board now with a 4 3 majority moved to appoint republic bank president harry madonna as the interim chairman according to a federal complaint filed by hill and his associates three days later republic first announced that madonna who founded republic bank in 1988 would succeed hill effective immediately hill would remain a director and the company s ceo according to the announcement a vote to permanently replace hill would occur at an annual meeting that has not been scheduled yet previously norcross group proposes takeover of republic first bancorp on may 17 hill along with fellow directors brian tierney and barry spevak filed a federal lawsuit against the rest of the board claiming they waged a campaign to seize control of republic first s board so that they can sell or refinance republic first at any price and on any terms to their benefit and that of their allies but to the detriment of the vast majority of republic first shareholders the complaint alleges that madonna s employment agreement gives him a powerful incentive to sell republic first it also says that he is entitled to a transaction bonus of no less than 1 million in the event of a merger or sale or transfer of a majority of the stock of the bank or company however madonna also alleged hill of wrongdoing according to the custodian order madonna accused hill of self dealing by circumventing the board and approving a highly lucrative contract with his wife s architectural design firm continuing bank expansions without board approval and by taking poison pill type steps to entrench his leadership other sj business news port based manufacturing jobs on horizon in paulsboro two steel plants under construction also on may 17 an investment group led by south jersey businessman george norcross iii and former td bank executive greg braca withdrew two lawsuits against the company and some of its directors the first regarded alleged efforts to modify employment and compensation agreements in order to entrench hill as chairman and ceo and disenfranchise the republic first shareholders according to a news release the second suit sought to compel republic first to make its books and records available for inspection the norcross braca group which owns 9 6 of republic first expressed dissatisfaction with hill s performance in the past and signaled their support for replacing him according to the custodian order both norcross braca and another investment group driver opportunity partners i lp which owns about 1 of the company appear to have aided madonna and his allies in their attempt to wrest control of republic first from the hill faction the status quo order issued may 19 prohibited the board from engaging in any actions outside the ordinary course of day to day management of republic first or republic bank without unanimous consent from all members until may 26 it also required at least five board members to be present at any business meeting during this period for the board to transact business new south jersey restaurants from cherry hill to ocean city 10 places to dine out this is the latest development in an ongoing battle for control of the philadelphia based bank which has 33 offices in philadelphia south jersey and new york city the company also operates oak mortgage co in march the norcross braca group offered to invest 50 million in republic first and to spend as much as 106 million to acquire a majority stake in the company the proposal also included a demand to remove hill as chairman and ceo in april auditor requests independent investigation

humble potatoes are a rich source not only of dietary carbohydrates for humans but also of starches for numerous industrial applications texas a m agrilife scientists are learning how to alter the ratio of potatoes two starch molecules amylose and amylopectin to increase both culinary and industrial applications for example waxy potatoes which are high in amylopectin content have applications in the production of bioplastics food additives adhesives and alcohol two articles recently published in the international journal of molecular sciences and the plant cell tissue and organ culture journals outline how crispr technology can advance the uses of the world s largest vegetable crop both papers include the work done by stephany toinga ph d who was a graduate student in the lab of keerti rathore ph d agrilife research plant biotechnologist in the texas a m institute for plant genomics and biotechnology and department of soil and crop sciences also co authoring both papers was isabel vales ph d an agrilife research potato breeder in the texas a m department of horticultural sciences toinga is now a texas a m agrilife research postdoctoral associate with vales the information and knowledge we gained from these two studies will help us introduce other desirable traits in this very important crop rathore said potato facts potatoes are the no 1 vegetable crop worldwide and the third most important human food crop only behind rice and wheat in global production potatoes are grown in over 160 countries on 40 8 million acres and serve as a staple food for more than a billion people with a medium size potato supplying approximately 160 calories mostly derived from starch the tubers constitute an important energy source for many people worldwide rathore said potatoes also provide other necessary nutrients including vitamins and minerals potatoes are a cool season crop that is relatively sensitive to heat and drought stress the crop also suffers from pests such as colorado beetle aphids and nematodes as well as diseases including early and late blight zebra chip fusarium dry rot and a number of viral diseases late blight was the cause of the irish potato famine starch is key for both dietary and industrial uses the amount of starch in potato tubers is the main factor that determines a potato s use high starch potatoes are often used to make processed foods such as french fries chips and dehydrated potatoes vales said potatoes with low to medium starch levels are frequently used for the fresh or table stock market she said for the fresh market additional important considerations are tuber appearance including skin texture skin color flesh color and tuber shape recently specialty potato types with different shapes such as fingerlings smaller sizes and red purple or yellow skin and flesh colors are becoming popular because of their convenience in cooking and increased nutritional value potato tuber shape is less important for industrial purposes than it is for human consumption vales said potato tubers with external deformities caused by heat or drought stress or other factors can be re directed to myriad uses including food for dogs and cattle in addition potato starch can produce ethanol for fuel or in beverages like vodka a biodegradable substitute for plastics or adhesives binders texture agents and fillers for the pharmaceutical textile wood and paper industries and other sectors for industrial applications the amount and type of starch in a potato are important considerations toinga said starches higher in amylopectin are desirable for processed food and other industrial applications due to their unique functional properties for example such starches are the preferred form for use as a stabilizer and thickener in food products and as an emulsifier in salad dressings because of its freeze thaw stability amylopectin starch is used in frozen foods additionally potatoes rich in amylopectin starch yield higher ethanol levels compared to those with other starches the benefits of breeding potatoes with select starches developing potato cultivars with modified starch could open new opportunities toinga said potatoes with high amylopectin and low amylose like the gene edited yukon gold strain she described in the international journal of molecular sciences have industrial applications beyond traditional uses in contrast potatoes with high amylose levels and low amylopectin would be desirable for human consumption vales said the amylose acts like fiber and does not liberate glucose as easily as amylopectin thus resulting in a lower glycemic index and making potatoes more acceptable for people with diabetes crispr cas9 creates new options crispr cas9 technology has expanded the toolset available to breeders vales said and it represents a more direct faster means to incorporate desired traits into popular commercial crop varieties conventional breeding is a lengthy process that can take 10 15 years in addition she said due to the complex nature of the potato genome generating new cultivars with the right complement of desirable traits is challenging for conventional breeding molecular breeding has enhanced breeding efficiencies and gene editing using the crispr cas9 technology adds another level of sophistication we utilized the agrobacterium method to deliver the crispr reagents into potatoes because it is reliable efficient and least expensive compared to all other delivery methods rathore said in the first study highlighted in the plant cell tissue and organ culture article a potato line containing four copies of gfp a jellyfish gene that allows a fluorescence based visualization of the gene s activity was targeted for mutation using the crispr cas9 system toinga said in essence this project provided an easy to see trait that enabled researchers to optimize the methodology loss of the characteristic green fluorescence and sequencing of the gfp gene following crispr treatment indicated that it is possible to disrupt all four copies of the gfp gene thus confirming that it should be possible to mutate all four alleles of a native gene in the tetraploid potato rathore said an improved yukon gold cultivar among the various potato cultivars evaluated in the first study the yukon gold strain regenerated the best and so it was used for the second study in the second knockout study described in the international journal of molecular sciences the native gene gbss in the tetraploid yukon gold strain was targeted to effectively eliminate amylose the result was a potato with starch rich in amylopectin and low in amylose one of the knockout events t2 7 showed normal growth and yield characteristics but was completely devoid of amylose toinga said that tuber starch t2 7 could find industrial applications in the paper and textile sectors as adhesives binders bioplastics and ethanol industries tuber starch from this experimental strain because of its freeze thaw stability without the need for chemical modifications should also be useful in producing frozen foods potatoes with amylopectin as the exclusive form of starch should also yield more ethanol for industrial use or to create alcoholic beverages as the next step for these studies the t2 7 strain has been self pollinated and crossed with the yukon gold strain donor and other potato clones to eliminate the transgenic elements references stephany toinga villafuerte maria isabel vales joseph m awika keerti s rathore crispr cas9 mediated mutagenesis of the granule bound

in the wake of tuesday s school shooting in texas democratic lawmakers in florida called on their republican colleagues to use time remaining in a special legislative session on property insurance to address firearm related measures such as imposing universal background checks on gun buyers house leaders offered prayers as a response to the latest series of mass shootings while some republicans maintained opposition to any efforts to restrict access to firearms rep randy fine a south brevard county republican on wednesday told reporters it was completely inappropriate for president joe biden to politicize the situation referring to a shooting tuesday in uvalde texas in which 19 children and two adults died we should be focused on those families fine said we should be focused on understanding what happened biden tuesday night called for tougher gun controls and for americans to stand up to powerful gun lobbyists why are we willing to live with this carnage why do we keep letting this happen where in god s name is our backbone to have the courage to deal with it and stand up to the lobbies biden remarked it s time to turn this pain into action fine s response to biden s remarks raised eyebrows i have news for the embarrassment that claims to be our president try to take our guns and you ll learn why the second amendment was written in the first place fine tweeted rep anthony sabatini a howey in the hills republican who is running for congress used tuesday s massacre at an elementary school to continue his push for a constitutional carry proposal which would allow people to carry concealed weapons without first getting a license from the state florida must pass constitutional carry now number 1 fastest way to secure our public spaces and institutions also re open the mental asylums that liberals closed in the 1970s and get these psychos out of society asap make the edu crats secure our schools for once sabatini tweeted during wednesday s floor session other house members were more restrained rep dana trabulsy who delivered the opening prayer said lawmakers are heartbroken yet again in the wake of another mass shooting lord words of outrage are not enough to express our hatred of this evil that was done to children who simply went to school yesterday trabulsy r fort pierce said lord we pray that you guide us to turn ourselves and our hearts and minds to those that are suffering including our friends here in this chamber who are replaying the trauma of the past from parkland and pulse calling for a moment of silence house speaker chris sprowls noted that we ve witnessed some horrible murders since the florida legislature s mid april special session on congressional redistricting mass shootings occurred on may 14 at a tops market in buffalo n y at the irvine taiwanese presbyterian church in laguna woods calif on may 15 and tuesday at robb elementary school in ulvalde texas i know that we all see the faces of our own loved ones and the faces that we saw yesterday and unspeakable grief sprowls r palm harbor said and throughout the course of these other tragedies our hearts are with these communities as they continue to suffer we know all too well what it looks like for a community to be suffering the way that they are suffering the pulse nightclub in orlando was the scene of a massacre in june 2016 where 49 people were killed and another 53 individuals were wounded in february 2018 a former student opened fire at marjory stoneman douglas high school in parkland killing 14 students and three faculty members following the parkland shootings florida lawmakers quickly enacted a gun control proposal that raised the minimum age from 18 to 21 to purchase rifles and other long guns the 2018 measure signed by former gov rick scott also imposed a three day waiting period for buying long guns banned so called bump stocks and established what is known as a red flag system which allows law enforcement agencies to seize firearms from people who may pose a threat to themselves or others at the time lawmakers tabled proposals backed by gun rights groups including a measure that would allow people with concealed weapons licenses to carry guns at churches and other religious institutions that share property with schools gov ron desantis signed a similar bill into law last year the governor who is running for re election this year has said he expects to sign a constitutional carry proposal before he leaves office but democrats on wednesday continued to express concern about such a plan what we don t need is to move in the other direction to allow permitless carry which could snowball into open carry in the state of florida rep carlos guillermo smith d orlando told reporters during a press conference at the capitol on wednesday that will cost lives other democrats at the press conference pledged to continue to push for gun related regulations including universal background checks safe storage laws id checks on ammunition purchases restrictions on large capacity magazines and assault weapons and expanded red flag mental health programs the republican controlled legislature has failed to advance such proposals in recent years we could do all of these things and not touch a single legally owned firearm by a responsible gun owner it is time to have that conversation in florida and for america house minority leader designate fentrice driskell d tampa said

startups of tomorrow are being built today we ll also dig into the unique and downright turbulent startup market that 2022 has brought 2021 was all about the ascent with startup valuations shooting higher powered by a buoyant stock market ipos aplenty and funding rounds going off like firecrackers things have changed and we want to understand the real landscape that startups have to navigate this year as 2022 has progressed we ve taken an eraser and pencil to our planned topics and themes meaning that we re approaching some well trod areas like fundraising but from an updated perspective and we re not done yet but to get started we re providing an early and not quite yet complete rundown of sessions that are coming to the techcrunch stage this october yes disrupt is a few months out but don t let that slow you down come hang it s going to be a blast enough throat clearing here s the list as we have it now how to raise first dollars in a more difficult market the venture perspective with annie case kleiner perkins and sheel mohnot better tomorrow ventures it is clear by now that the venture market has changed this year that means that founders looking to raise first capital for their startup can t follow last year s playbook and expect results so what do founders need to know and how can they best snag investor attention in a market where the rules are changing we re bringing a few venture capitalists that we know well and trust to share the real nuts and bolts of early fundraising in 2022 how to raise first dollars when investors are more cautious the founder perspective with amanda doamaral fiveable sara du alloy automation and arman hezarkhani parthean while it s always good to hear from venture capitalists when it comes to dollars and cents how founders are navigating the capital market is just as important so we re gathering amanda doamaral of fiveable sara du of alloy automation and arman hezarkhani of parthean to talk us through what worked for them and how their perspective has been updated in light of the changing economy how to build your early vc network turning social capital into financial capital with nik milanovic this week in fintech josh ogundu heart to heart and gefen skolnick couplet coffee if you haven t heard of nik josh or gefen where have you been they are founders that are not only building very interesting companies but have taken a forward approach toward making noise on social media we want to dive into how being a public person can help founders build a future public company this should be a panel that will be not only informative but also lots of fun how to raise in 2022 if you are not located in a major hub with mike asem m25 rich wong accel and elizabeth yin hustle fund sure you no longer have to be located in silicon valley let alone california to build a startup or raise money but there are still areas where there are more venture capitalists per square mile and areas where there are fewer to get to grips on raising outside of traditional startup hubs we re bringing together vcs who either live and invest or simply invest in more up and coming geographies mike asem of m25 rich wong of accel and hustle fund s elizabeth yin are joining us for this particular chat it s going to rock how to secure those hard to find hires with chris herd firstbase kate ryder maven and emil yeargin gusto hiring is not easy even in the best of times with a tight tech talent market and an increasingly remote friendly and therefore globally competitive corporate landscape founders have never had more places to hire from and more competitors to measure up against so we re going to have chris herd from firstbase who is an advocate for remote work kate ryder who has built a global healthcare startup and emil yeargin vp of talent at gusto which is not only hiring itself but also helps other companies manage their staff with the three we ll go deep on hiring today with an especial focus on hard to fill roles negotiating your first term sheet with mandela sh dixon all raise kevin liu techstars and james norman black operator ventures it s always a good time to sit down and chat about the mechanics of term sheets and the give and take between investors and founders it s an especially good time now as the balance of power between founders and investors has shifted from a period in which founders never had great ability to demand friendly terms to an era in which it feels like investors have more power than in recent history so we ll get the latest from investors on term sheets negotiations and terms to help founders navigate the current climate how to manage staff in a remote asynchronous reality with mathilde collin front and adriana roche mural companies big and small are figuring out how they are going to distribute and manage their workforces in 2022 after a few years when even the most traditional company was forced to go remote startups are now having to choose between remote setups hybrid teams or a return to the office but no matter what they choose all companies are going to have more remote staff than ever before to help founders understand how to manage those staffers front s mathilde collin and mural s adriana roche are joining us to talk about what works how to compete without losing your mind or runway when cash is expensive with eric glyman ramp and thejo kote airbase we love a competitive startup category here at techcrunch watching startups go head to head is fascinating and illuminating but for startups in hot sectors with big markets competing can be very expensive so how should startups that have incumbents to take on other startups to best or both approach the balance between growth and spend this year we re gathering some ceos with a little bit of experience on the matter to help guide more early stage founders taking the bs out of your tam with aydin senkut felicis and more speakers to be announced a common refrain from venture capitalists last year was that software valuations weren t too high as the tam or total addressable market for tech companies was simply larger than folks had originally thought sure but some of those startups are now stuck comparing high burn rates with future tam so how should founders and their backers really think about tam to avoid fooling themselves or their colleagues parts of this panel are in the last stage of finalization but we can share that felicis aydin senkut is taking part more to come what does product market fit mean when hype tanks with pali bhat reddit and more speakers to be announced this is another panel we re still finalizing but reddit chief product officer pali bhat is coming to disrupt to help founders hone their definitions of product market fit the concept often shortened to pmf is tricky as it s not easily defined for all startups at once but one thing that happens when market sentiment takes a dive is that definitions tighten so how should founders measure pmf in a more difficult market from both a fundraising and customer perspective we ll find out winning the war on ransomware with speakers to be announced ransomware attacks are escalating at an alarming rate we ll hear from experts about what winning the war on ransomware looks like and how startups can play their part and a number of

a law enforcement personnel lights a candle outside of robb elementary school in uvalde texas on wednesday may 25 2022 following a mass shooting at the elementary school sen mitt romney said wednesday that background checks and updating background check technology is something that is an appropriate federal responsibility the mass shooting at a texas elementary school that left 19 children and two teachers dead tuesday has reignited the debate in congress over gun laws sen mitt romney weighed in on the issue wednesday when asked about it at the capitol background checks and updating our background check technology is something that i think is an appropriate federal responsibility he told reporters the utah republican said he ll review legislation to expand universal background checks prior to gun sales that sen pat toomey r pa and sen joe manchin d w v proposed in 2013 in response to the shooting massacre at sandy hook elementary school in newtown connecticut following the mass shooting in buffalo new york on may 14 manchin said he still supports his proposal with toomey but without 60 votes in the senate he questioned the practicality of bringing it to the floor for a vote according to the hill i ll be looking at toomey manchin and seeing how that would apply and whether or not i could support that or whether there might be some amendments to that that would make it more acceptable romney said related utah lawmaker wants to raise the firearm purchase age from 18 to 21 after texas elementary school shooting romney also said red flag laws make a lot of sense the law allows police or family members to petition a state court to order the temporary removal of firearms from a person who may present a danger to others or themselves i think states are wise to adopt those he said i think they d have to be effectively administered at the state level senators in both parties say red flag legislation which already exists as law in at least 19 states has the best chance of securing enough bipartisan support to make it to president joe biden s desk in the wake of the mass shootings in buffalo and uvalde texas the hill reported wednesday efforts to pass a red flag law in utah have failed related these states have the weakest gun control laws in the country a number of senators now see red flag legislation as perhaps having a better chance of becoming law than proposals to expand background checks reforms the house passed in march 2021 but have sat in senate limbo for more than a year after several school shootings in 2018 romney said states not the federal government should establish gun laws and school safety measures he said then that he did not support new federal gun control legislation except banning the sale of bump stocks and an updated background check system romney told the deseret news in 2019 that if states want to ban assault weapons they should do so saying wednesday that he s sick and tired of what s going on biden called for commonsense gun law reforms during an event at the white house the idea that an 18 year old can walk into a store and buy weapons of war designed and marketed to kill is i think just wrong it just violates common sense he said the president said the second amendment is not absolute when it was passed you couldn t own a cannon you couldn t own certain kinds of weapons there s just always been limitations he said as a nation we have to ask when in god s name are we going to stand up to the gun lobby the washington post reported that 19 current or recent republican senators including senate minority leader mitch mcconnell and sens rob portman of ohio and joni ernst of iowa have taken at least 1 million each in campaign contributions from the national rifle association over their careers according to data compiled by the brady campaign to prevent gun violence in 2019 among the others is romney who expressed how grief overwhelms the soul in an attack like the one in texas and acknowledged on twitter that his offer of prayers and condolences were grossly inadequate and that answers were needed the post reported critics and liberals slammed romney who was the 2012 gop presidential nominee and who spoke at the nra s annual convention that year for taking more than 13 million in nra contributions according to the brady campaign but federal election commission filings show romney received only 40 000 in direct nra contributions in 2012 two 5 000 donations to romney for president and 30 000 to romney victory inc a fund that could be allocated to other pacs had he won the election the more than 13 million referenced in the brady campaign reflects the money the nra spent on television and online ads to defeat president barack obama and elect romney romney took no nra money during his senate campaign no one owns sen romney s vote as evidenced by his record of independence in the senate said romney spokeswoman arielle mueller
technically the title 42 legal barrier on the border is still up but pro migration judges and agency officials are quietly cutting numerous loopholes for an unlimited number of wage cutting migrants to enter ordinary americans job markets on monday for example president joe biden s progressive deputies told border officers to welcome family groups as they cross the border even though many are seeking to join their illegal migrant husbands and fathers already working u s jobs nbc reported on may 24 the new guidance issued to customs and border protection and immigration and customs enforcement went into effect at 12 01 a m monday according to documents obtained by nbc news it states that if cbp officers notice at least one member of the family showing a verbal or nonverbal manifestation of fear of being expelled they should either be released into the u s with a court date or sent to an asylum officer who can determine whether the noncitizen is more likely than not to be persecuted or tortured in the country to which they would be expelled a department of homeland security official speaking on condition of anonymity told nbc news that while there is still some confusion among border agents and officials over the conflicting orders the new ruling protecting migrant families is the first nail in the coffin of title 42 the new loophole was opened three days after a federal judge ordered officials to preserve the title 42 barrier which allows officials to exclude migrants during an epidemic however the judge did not curb officials ability to cut loopholes in the barrier officials have already been allowing many family groups to enter under the claim that mexico s regional government cannot support the migrants in the huge cities butting up against the u s border yet u s officials have applied no visible pressure to mexico to get them to accept more of the migrants nor have u s officials sought to fly the rejected migrants back to their home countries in contrast former president donald trump and his deputies strongly pressured mexico to accept rejected migrants and also flew migrants back to their home countries agency officials are also minimizing network tv coverage of the migration by working with a nationwide network of pro migrant groups the taxpayer aided groups help to hide the migration by housing and feeding the migrants and by helping to bus and fly them to their desired jobs sites the deliberately lax enforcement of the border is imposing huge economic costs on native americans for example the migrant inflow cuts their wages boosts their housing prices and sidelines them in their own nation s politics and culture in april the department of homeland security dhs recorded 244 000 encounters with migrants and allowed 137 000 of them to cross the border in 2022 while title 42 was operational dhs allowed 641 000 migrants to cross the border in 2021 officials allowed 630 000 migrants to cross the total inflow is boosted by the perhaps 1 million got always who sneaked across the border plus the annual inflow of roughly 1 million legal immigrants and one million visa workers overall the legal and illegal inflow adds up to more than two migrants for every four americans who turn 18 the vast legal and illegal inflow cuts wages for ordinary americans according to a may analysis by new york s leading wall street firm goldman sachs the report suggested that 2 5 million foreign workers would cut roughly 100 billion from americans wages so boosting stock values by roughly 2 trillion biden s pro migration cuban born border chief alejandro mayorkas previously exempted children youths and young men who claim to be younger than 18 from the border barrier mayorkas unaccompanied alien children exemption has allowed many young job seekers to walk through the border and has allowed illegal migrants in the united states to import their children and place them in overcrowded american schools mayorkas has also helped single male migrants sneak across the border for example he diverts most border agents from border duties to instead help families get registered and transported to their destinations also migrants who are caught crossing the border are often trucked back to mexico instead of being flown home so they can try again a few days later roughly 60 000 migrants sneak across the border each month the migrants are coming to work partly because u s jobs pay far more than jobs in their poor autocratic countries such as cuba or nicaragua in may 2021 reuters described one of mayorkas s imported workers a guatelaman migrant named nicolas under mayorkas watch nicolas tried six times to sneak into the united states and each time was returned by mayorkas to the five yard line in mexico instead of to his home 2 000 miles away but nicolas s desperation guided him over mayorkas s obstacle course according to reuters i thought i cannot return to guatemala i m going to fight nicolas said remembering the promise to provide for his three children and wife he had used her land as collateral to pay for the trip but the migrant brings their poverty with them by allowing u s employers to cut wages ignore heartland communities minimize technology investments and boost investors wealth also mayorkas is refusing to deport migrants caught in the interior unless they have been found guilty of violent crimes mayorkas is also laying the bureaucratic groundwork to bar border agents from chasing coyotes cars as they carry illegal migrants north from the border the associated press reported on may 24 shaw drake an attorney for the aclu of texas said the policy review was certainly a welcome step in the right direction but that it was difficult to comment without specifics

why did big lots gain 12 today short covering we were pleasantly surprised to see shares of big lots nyse big up 12 but could not understand why until we saw the short interest the stock has been in a downtrend for some time driven by dwindling analysts sentiment fear of slowing sales and an ever growing short interest that reached lofty levels above 25 in the weeks ahead of the q2 report with the report still due out and the analysts still downgrading the stock the only thing left to drive it higher is short covering and that makes us think this downtrend is over the analysts have set the bar so low that big lots should easily outperform and even if it doesn t trading at 5 8x its earnings and yielding 4 6 it s a buy in our book regardless of the reason the shorts are starting to get scared and feel it s time to get out of the stock get the full henry singleton series in pdf get the entire 4 part series on henry singleton in pdf save it to your desktop read it on your tablet or email to your colleagues q1 2022 hedge fund letters conferences and more the analysts ignored big lots for nearly two years and then came out with a series of downgrades and price target reductions in q1 and q2 the 8 current ratings those less than 1 year old all came out in that time and have the stock pegged at a very weak hold verging on sell with a price target only 10 above the recent price action the latest commentary comes from bank of america analyst jason haas who maintained an underperform rating while cutting the price target he cut the price target to 25 or below the current price action on an expectation for a big miss this reporting season in his view challenging weather conditions tough comps late easter and increased promotions will all cut into the results and drive shares lower although management has done a good job improving the big lots concept we re concerned that these changes won t be enough to offset a challenging macro environment he told clients in fact many of the changes made over the past 5 years have shifted big away from food consumables and towards big ticket furniture making the company less defensive in a downturn the institutions are buying big lots as sour as the analysts are on big lots the institutions are buying this cheap dividend growth stock the activity in the ytd portion of 2022 is worth a net 5 1 of the market cap and has total institutional holdings up to nearly 95 this is a very significant factor for share prices and should put a floor in the market assuming the results are not too far off the consensus add in the fact the short interest was running at 26 this could lead to a very sharp short covering rally if not a short squeeze the risk of course is that results will be worse than expected which may lead to institutional selling looking at the numbers big lots should not have a bad quarter in terms of sales the analysts are expecting sequential and yoy decline but that is both seasonal and expected given last year s unnatural strength in regards to the 2020 and prepandemic comps the analysts are expecting flat and up 12 which we view as very positive the risk is in the earnings the analysts are expecting only 1 00 compared to last year s 2 62 and 1 26 in 2020 but we view it as an upside risk the technical outlook big lots might be at the bottom shares of big lots might be at the bottom but we ve seen short covering rallies like this before in this market if the results are good and the market follows through on the move we ll start to be more bullish until then we view this as a relief rally within a bear market and one that may hit resistance a the short term moving average should you invest 1 000 in big lots right now before you consider big lots you ll want to hear this marketbeat keeps track of wall street s top rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis marketbeat has identified the five stocks that top analysts are quietly whispering to their clients to buy now before the broader market catches on and big lots wasn t on the list while big lots currently has a hold rating among analysts top rated analysts believe these five stocks are better buys article by thomas hughes marketbeat

between 2019 and 2020 the number of homicides in america grew by more than 5 000 the number of homicides with victims aged 12 and under rose by about 80 sporadic calls for gun control were made in response but nothing like what we re hearing now mass shootings tend to do that especially when horrifyingly they involve children no matter how statistically rare they concentrate violence in a single shocking public indiscriminate event focusing the entire country on the problem and bringing unfortunate fame to the perpetrators they keep parents awake at night far from the place where they occurred no matter how much more logical it would be to worry about say car accidents as someone who has covered and participated in the gun debate since the mid 2000s i can offer a brief overview of the options for addressing mass shootings and interpersonal gun violence in general i ll stick to policies that have some chance of being enacted no gun bans coupled with confiscation for example and discuss them in order of political plausibility i ll start by noting a discouraging fact many of these policies have been tried at the state or even federal level before and researchers have had a hard time pinning down their effects on homicides and mass shootings see this rand corporation report for a thorough and scientifically exacting review this doesn t mean that there are no effects only that we should expect improvements to be marginal and hard to measure not transformative and obvious work to identify threatening individuals ahead of time and address their problems there are two broad ideas here stemming from the fact that many mass shooters leave a long trail of warning signs before they attack one is the red flag law which allows family members school officials or law enforcement to seek a temporary court order barring an individual from owning guns and requiring the surrender of any guns already owned the other the subject of a recent book by mark follman of mother jones is threat assessment in which law enforcement and institutions such as schools identify individuals showing troubling behavior and then intervene by monitoring these usually men encouraging them to seek treatment or counseling and working with their families both of these approaches raise due process concerns because they target people who despite their troubling behavior may not yet have done anything illegal but with the proper guardrails they can stop and help menacing individuals without infringing on the liberties of others step up security in public places including schools a security guard or police officer is no guarantee that a shooting can t take place and hiring new employees is expensive but many mass shootings end when armed professionals show up and confront the gunman and in many locations extra security can have benefits beyond mass shootings some states have taken to letting teachers have guns as well with training owing to massive cultural differences within the united states districts will vary in terms of how willing they are to take these steps especially arming teachers but stepping up professionally trained security at least would be a reasonably middle ground idea more tightly restrict how guns are sold and transferred universal background checks have been a mainstay of the gun debate under current law people who repeatedly buy and sell guns for profit have to get a federal license and conduct background checks on their buyers but private individuals who sell from their personal collections do not these individuals can t knowingly sell a gun to a felon or other prohibited individual but they also don t have to do anything to investigate the buyer most mass shooters buy their guns legally and can pass background checks but the same isn t true of criminals in general in theory at least tighter restrictions on private gun transfers could stop some guns from entering the illegal market and make it easier to prosecute people who give guns to criminals in return for some inconvenience imposed on legal buyers and sellers important questions would remain about which types of transfers would be exempt from checks what records would be generated and stored and how to enforce the requirement given that these are transfers between private individuals so this is an idea with promise but many complexities as well some states go one step further requiring a permit to purchase a gun and allowing local police significant discretion to deny permits though that brings us back to due process issues restrict certain types of guns any semiautomatic gun with a removable magazine can fire a lot of rounds very quickly as quickly as the shooter can pull the trigger and as needed swap the magazine which takes just a second or two these weapons include the standard modern handguns that americans routinely buy for self defense i own two myself as well as many hunting rifles those seeking to ban assault weapons tend to target features like magazine size or tactical accoutrements such as pistol grips on long guns these may matter in some instances but they don t make a drastic difference to a gun s lethality especially against unarmed helpless victims between the debate about which features make a gun an assault weapon the existing stock of these firearms and the ease of adjusting gun designs to avoid or restore banned features assault weapon bans are also difficult to put into practice many shootings involving guns that could plausibly be called assault weapons have occurred in jurisdictions with bans in place columbine happened during the period of the federal assault weapons ban connecticut had such a ban at the time of sandy hook and expanded it after the massacre the buffalo shooter bought his rifle legally in new york and illegally modified it to hold more rounds assault weapon bans poll well so a new one is politically feasible but it s an idea with limited potential most gun murders and most mass shootings too involve normal handguns not assault weapons and the differences in lethality between an assault weapon and other semiautomatic guns are not so great practically speaking perhaps a better idea would be both broader in terms of the guns it applied to and narrower in terms of the individuals targeted america already has a separate policy for long guns which individuals can purchase at age 18 and handguns which are restricted until age 21 given their greater concealability and use in violence moving some long guns perhaps even all semiautomatics to the age 21 category is an idea worth considering ross douthat once proposed an even more staggered approach let 18 year olds own hunting rifles make revolvers available at 21 semiautomatic pistols at 25 and semi automatic rifles like the ar 15 could be sold to 30 year olds but no one younger thirty years old is too high for any cutoff both politically and constitutionally speaking but 18 is too young to buy an ar 15 is a far less controversial notion there are hundreds of millions of guns in america and our constitution protects gun rights we re also a violent country in general with elevated rates of non gun homicide to go along with all the shootings despite most american homicides being committed with guns we kill one another without guns at a rate of about 1 5 per 100 000 per data from the centers for disease control exceeding the total homicide rates in much of northern and western europe and regardless of whether an aggressive gun ban would greatly reduce homicides it s simply not on the table numerous options remain however many could help to some degree but none will completely solve the problem or satisfy those horrified and disgusted by it photo by allison dinner afp via getty

triblive s daily and weekly email newsletters deliver the news you want and information you need right to your inbox washington federal reserve officials agreed when they met earlier this month that they might have to raise interest rates to levels that would weaken the economy as part of their drive to curb inflation which has reached a four decade high at the same time many of the policymakers also agreed that after a rapid series of rate increases in the coming months they could assess the effects of their rate hikes and depending on the economy s health adjust their policies after their meeting this month the policymakers raised their benchmark short term rate by a half point double the usual hike according to minutes from the may 3 4 meeting released wednesday most of the officials agreed that half point hikes also would likely be appropriate at their next two meetings in june and july chair jerome powell himself had indicated after this month s meeting that half point increases would be on the table at the next two meetings all the officials believed that the fed should expeditiously raise its key rate to a level at which it neither stimulates or restrains growth which officials have said is about 2 4 some policymakers have said they will likely reach that point by the end of this year the minutes suggest though that there may be a sharp debate among policymakers about how quickly to tighten credit after the june and july meetings the economy has showed more signs of showing and stock markets have dropped sharply since the fed meeting government reports have shown for example that sales of new and existing homes have slowed sharply since the fed meetings and there are signs that factory output is growing more slowly gennadiy goldberg senior rates strategist at td securities suggested that the minutes released wednesday might reflect a more hawkish fed that is more focused on rate hikes to restrain inflation than may actually be the case now some officials particularly raphael bostic president of the federal reserve bank of atlanta have indicated since this month s meeting that the fed could reconsider its pace of rate hikes in september at the meeting fed officials agreed to raise their benchmark rate to a range of 0 75 to 1 their first increase of that size since 2000 the officials also announced that they would start to shrink their huge 9 trillion balance sheet which has more than doubled since the pandemic the balance sheet swelled as the fed steadily bought about 4 5 trillion in treasury and mortgage bonds after the pandemic recession struck to try to hold down longer term rates on june 1 the fed plans to let those securities start to mature without replacing them that should also heighten the cost of long term borrowing powell has said the fed is determined to raise rates high enough to restrain inflation leading many economists to expect the sharpest pace of rate hikes in three decades this year powell says the central bank is aiming for a soft landing in which higher interest rates cool borrowing and spending enough to slow the economy and inflation but most economists are skeptical that the fed can achieve such a narrow outcome without causing an economic downturn stock prices have plunged on fears that the fed s rate hikes will send the economy into recession the s p 500 has fallen for seven straight weeks the longest such stretch since the aftermath of the dot com bubble in 2001 the stock index nearly fell into bear market territory last week defined as a 20 drop from its peak but rallied wednesday the minutes also showed that some policymakers decided it was appropriate to consider selling some of its holdings of mortgage backed securities rather than simply letting them mature sales would make it easier for the fed to transition to a portfolio composed mainly of treasurys the minutes said the fed did not mention any timing of such sales but said they would be announced well in advance the fed has said that by september it would allow up to 30 billion of mortgage backed securities to mature each month along with 60 billion in treasurys many analysts doubt that the cap will be reached for mortgage backed bonds because mortgage rates having jumped more than 2 percentage points since the start of the year that means that fewer homeowners will refinance their mortgages because their current loan rates are lower than what is now available in the mortgage market fewer refinancings would force the fed to sell mortgage backed securities to maintain its plans to reduce its balance sheet

july 1905 by frank haigh dixon sixty six years ago and but a few years after railways had demonstrated their practicability william harnden met what seemed to him to be a real economic need by offering to carry valuable packages from new york to boston and for a consideration to assume responsibility for loss harnden valise carried by steamboat from new york to providence and thence by rail to boston was the beginning of a service which has advanced hand in hand with the railway industry with which it is necessarily closely associated recognition of the economic value of the service was immediate companies were organized which selected particular sections of the country as their special fields of activity until now an express service is found wherever transportation facilities exist whether it be railway steamboat or stagecoach a service which handles almost every form of traffic that can bear the charges imposed of this large transporting agency whose receipts reach the enormous sum of seventy five million dollars yearly and which for certain kinds of service has become apparently an indispensable part of our industrial mechanism the general public knows almost nothing the companies neither make reports themselves nor are reports required of them by any governmental department it is the purpose of this article to bring together such information as can be gathered from existing sources and thus make clear the necessity for the provision of means by which these facts may be supplemented and the information required by the public supplied the express business of the country was conducted for many years by a large number of companies operating within limited fields but it was natural if not inevitable that consolidation should eventually take place it is sufficient for our purposes to state that at present there are in the country six large express companies and a few smaller ones the four largest are the adams american united states and wells fargo companies the first three are joint stock companies organized under a new york law that grants them the right to issue transferable shares representing a beneficial interest in the company and subjects the members to full personal liability as partners while the fourth is a colorado corporation the adams express company operating on about 35 000 miles of railway has 120 000 shares valued on the market at 14 000 000 upon which it pays at present a regular dividend of 4 per cent and an extra dividend of the same amount in 1898 it distributed to its members a 100 per cent extra dividend consisting of 12 000 000 in 4 per cent debentures to dispose of a surplus which had been accumulating for nearly fifty years to protect stockholders against the personal liability due to the form of their organization the capital of the american express company is given a face value of 18 000 000 upon which regular dividends of 6 per cent are paid with usually an extra dividend of 2 per cent it has no bonded debt its business extends over about 45 000 miles of railway the united states express company has a capital valued at 10 000 000 upon which a 4 per cent dividend is paid and has no bonded debt it has contracts covering 30 000 miles of railway wells fargo and company a corporation with power to do an express and banking business has a capital stock of 8 000 000 paying a 6 per cent regular dividend and a 2 per cent extra dividend and has no bonded debt it operates on more than 48 000 miles of railway steamship and stage lines besides these four companies there are the southern express company and the pacific express company both corporations the one operating in southern territory the other largely west of the mississippi the national a joint stock company on the vanderbilt roads two canadian express companies whose business extends into the united states and several companies organized by the railways themselves operating on single systems or jointly over connecting lines these last named such as the denver and rio grande great northern and northern pacific are similar to the fast freight lines in their relation to the railways served in that the corporation performing the express service is merely nominal and the business is in every sense railway business to this list should be added a large number of local companies which confine their business to the cities or to the territory immediately adjoining them it is frequently asserted that the express companies have divided the country among them delimiting their spheres of influence and maintaining a monopoly within their chosen territory and this assumed division of the field is often referred to as an illustration of what will be the ultimate outcome of the present tendency in railway diplomacy however careful examination of the conditions reveals the fact that except in one or two cases it is difficult to determine whether or not a single express company exercises a predominant influence in any particular section for example new england is commonly said to be the home of the adams express company and new england and new aork business its chief reliance as a matter of fact while it controls the business of southern new england it operates over extensive systems in the south such as the louisville and nashville and the queen and crescent is found on the new york central and the new york ontario and western moves west over the pennsylvania to chicago and continues its influence still farther by way of the chicago burlington and quincy and the st louis and san francisco in new england it operates over only half as much mileage as the american express company the latter has virtual control of northern new england spreads out over the west and northwest on the lines of the vanderbilt system and the chicago and northwestern and south on the illinois central the united states express company has contracts in the east with a number of the coal roads including the reading lehigh valley and lackawanna reaches chicago over the baltimore and ohio and the lake shore and michigan southern serves many small systems in the middle west and reaches trans mississippi territory by way of the chicago milwaukee and st paul and the chicago rock island and pacific the southern express company is predominant in the section of the south east of the mississippi it shares a few of the railways with the adams but operates all the rest exclusively the pacific express company while choosing the southwest as its special field at the beginning and operating at present in this section over the lines of the missouri pacific and other smaller railways reaches pittsburg over the wabash and the west and extreme northwest over the union pacific oregon railway and navigation company and oregon short line wellsfargo and company controls most of the pacific coast traffic but it does not by any means confine its activities to this section it comes east over the atchison topeka and santa fe and the southern pacific has contracts with the st louis and san francisco and the chicago great western and reaches the coast over the erie the national express company has contracts with some of the vanderbilt lines with the grand trunk and the wisconsin central thus instead of operating in sections exclusively their own different express companies often serve the same territory and transport their traffic on parallel railways reaching the same termini and in some few cases even work side by side on the same railway system instead of a necessary monopoly therefore there is in many sections opportunity for competition does competition appear with the opportunity for it the relation of the companies to one another and the composition of their directorates may assist us to answer the question it is generally known that the adams express company controls the southern express company they operate side by side on several southern railway systems the national express company is regarded as but an offshoot of the american and an examination of the directorates of the two companies confirms the general impression president james c fargo of the american is a director of the national while president livingston and vicepresident ledyard of the national are both directors of the american again it is to be noticed that president fargo of the american and president weir of the adams are both directors of the united states express company the appointment of these gentlemen started rumors of the prospective consolidation of the three companies and mr weir is quoted as saying in reply a consolidation of the three companies is no more possible than a consolidation of all the newspapers in new york these companies have different territories and serve different railroads we can t consolidate the adams and the american companies used to have directors in common this new move is simply an investment on our part by which we hope to make a little more money it is evident that an invitation to these gentlemen to places on the board of directors of the united states express company meant either that they represented a considerable investment in the stock or else that a community of interest plan was to be worked out among the three companies or possibly both we have no means of settling the question definitely but we do know that when the adams issued its debentures among the securities which it pledged with the mercantile trust company was 100 000 of american express company stock a merger of the pacific and wells fargo companies has been predicted because of the fact that the harriman interests possess large holdings in both companies all this would argue against the probability of vigorous competition between the various companies but it is not necessary to rest the question on a basis of probability it is a matter of common knowledge that the companies agree among themselves upon the rates to be charged and that their agreements are as a rule carefully observed rate wars are practically unknown notices of changes in rates agreed to in conference between express companies appear as news items in the financial journals president ingalls of the big four testified before the industrial commission they manage their own business by making agreements i should be sorry to have them put on the same basis as railroads so they could not agree it has been a common belief that the exclusive use of a railway system secured by means of a written contract is granted to the highest bidder among the express companies but in view of the facts already presented such competition must be regarded as purely perfunctory and the refusal of the express companies to make their contracts public on the ground that such action would benefit their competitors and correspondingly injure them is obviously a mere subterfuge these contracts vary to some extent in their details but in general are similar they are not as a rule made public and only in a few instances where demanded by state railway commissions are they publicly on file the general terms are obtainable however from the testimony of officials before various investigating commissions the railway companies provide baggagecars heat and light them attach them to passenger trains and haul them over their lines together with the messengers needed to care for the traffic en route they carry at their risk all equipment of the express companies needed at the various points on the road they grant free approach to all stations and reasonable time in which to load and unload express matter at the way stations they permit gratuitous use of a part of the station houses for the temporary storage of goods they agree not to transport on their passenger trains in competition with the express companies any matter except passengers baggage milk and railway matter carried free and to grant to the express companies the exclusive use of their lines including any additions to their operated mileage during the life of the agreement the express companies on their part assume all risk for damage to express matter and all liability for injury to their own employees while engaged in their employment they load unload and handle all express matter and when the services of railway employees such as train baggagemen and station agents are utilized they pay a portion of their salaries they transport all valuable packages of the railway companies such as money and tickets free of charge in fact they accept any property of the railway companies below a specified weight for free transportation and property exceeding this weight at a reduced rate at the terminals they provide their own storerooms they permit the railway companies to determine the trains upon which express matter shall be carried in times of heavy traffic this matter is often delayed for many hours and then goes by the slower trains frequently it is carried on night trains and in bulk and seldom if ever is it distributed over a large number of trains per day only in a few instances are express cars operated in solid trains they agree to fix the minimum rate at one and one half times the freight rate of the railways except where competition compels reduction and then the permission of the railway companies must be secured finally they pay the railway companies from 40 per cent to 60 per cent of their gross earnings with a guaranteed minimum annual rental and give the railways access to their books and records in some instances the contracts call for the payment of a definite sum based upon tonnage or space occupied but the gross earnings plan is much the more common such contracts would appear to grant very favorable terms to the railways and might suggest that they had taken advantage of their position to drive a hard bargain were it not for the very important fact that they place no limit on the charge which the express companies may exact from the public available facts would tend to show that the railways instead of regarding the express companies as legitimate objects of exploitation are becoming through stock ownership and representation on the directorates personally interested in the management of the express business a few illustrations from the present situation will make this point clear the morgan influence predominant in so many railway systems is represented on the board of the adams express company by charles steele on that of the united states express company by francis lynde stetson vice president ledyard of the national express company is a director of the boston and maine and of the maine central charles m pratt is a director of the american express company and of the boston and maine m f plant chairman of the board of directors of the southern express company is a director of the atlantic coast line president fargo of the american is a director of the chicago and northwestern president weir of the adams is on the board of the iowa central and of the minneapolis and st louis the chairman of the board of wells fargo and company is e h harriman of the southern pacific and union pacific and president underwood of the erie is a member as examples of stock ownership it may be noted that in 1902 the new york central purchased 3 000 000 of the capital stock of the american express company while the union pacific owns 2 400 000 of the 6 000 000 capital stock of the pacific express company and the southern pacific possesses 1 530 000 of wells fargo stock on may 1 1900 the american express company held 29 000 shares of boston and maine stock a tenth of the total capital and among the stocks pledged as collateral for its debenture issue by the adams are a large number of railway shares including pennsylvania new york new haven and hartford chicago milwaukee and st paul boston and albany boston and new york air line and chicago and northwestern other illustrations such as the joint ownership of express companies and fast freight lines might be given on the authority of financial circles but they are omitted because definite proof of such alliances is impossible one may infer much or little from such facts but certainly they would hardly support any claim of serious rivalry or hostility between the two agencies it seems reasonable to assume that conditions are fairly satisfactory to the railway companies they prefer to divide traffic with the express companies and obtain half the earnings from express traffic rather than attempt to handle it all themselves the need of an agency that would transport packages of great value was the occasion for the appearance of the express business but the whole character of the business is now changed while almost anything is accepted for transportation upon which the shipper will pay the charges yet the greatest development has been in traffic which demands speedy delivery such for instance as live stock fresh fruit vegetables fish and oysters the individual now has the option between slow shipment by freight at reasonable cost with an added charge for cartage at destination and transportation on passenger trains with store door delivery for the superior service he pays on the average four times as much there is no indication that the railways except in the products of the packing and fruit industries in which they have been prodded by the private car owners have any intention of developing this traffic and displacing the express service yet it is difficult to determine whether the railways are doing their full duty without having some definite information regarding express traffic it is pertinent therefore to inquire what attempts have been made to secure information upon which the public might base judgment as to the necessity of the service performed by this agency over which no control has ever been exercised immediately after its organization the interstate commerce commission in pursuance of the requirement that all common carriers subject to the act should file their tariffs with the commission was compelled to decide whether its jurisdiction extended to the control of express companies the commission deemed it wise to include express companies under the provisions of the act and accordingly ordered that their tariffs should be filed a few of the smaller companies complied but most of the companies refused and an opportunity was given them to present their objections it was argued by them in defense of their attitude that the history of the agitation for railway legislation showed that other traffic than that of the express companies had been in the mind of the public that they were innocent of the evil practices which the act was intended to punish and eradicate and that an unjustifiably broad construction of the statute would be necessary to include them within its provisions that they had not practiced secret rebates nor had they frequently made greater charge for the short than for the long haul nor had they practiced unjust discriminations between persons and places finally they argued their practical inability to meet the wishes of the commission for so numerous were the points to which their business extended that a collection of tariffs such as the law required would be beyond the capacity of any washington building in answer to the last objection it was properly pointed out by the commission that the companies seemed to have no difficulty in putting such printed tariffs into the hands of their agents as were necessary for the conduct of the business and that it was a fair assumption that what the agents could understand the public could comprehend sufficiently well for their purposes as for the claim to exemption on the plea that they were not guilty of the evil practices legislated against it is a sufficient answer to say that the public was without facts on which to base judgment and that these assertions of innocence rested solely on the testimony of the companies themselves to be sure there have been few complaints against express companies on the ground of unjust discrimination but the act was intended to take cognizance of excessive rates as well and complaints of this character have been numerous the contention that the history of railway legislation argued against the inclusion of the express companies within the statute had more force and was evidently the determining factor with the commission it was held that the express business when conducted by a railway company itself as a branch of its business was subject to the act but when conducted by an independent organization which acquired its rights by contract it was exempt because the terms of the act were not sufficiently precise to warrant the commission in taking jurisdiction justice to the express business demanding that any action by the commission should have general application the commission declined to discriminate against express companies operated by railway companies in every report from that time up to 1900 the commission through its statistician has urged that legislation be enacted which would make it possible to secure from express companies reports similar to those now returned by the railways but congress has turned a deaf ear to these repeated requests the result is that nothing more is known of these great transportation agencies by either national or state government than is known of the operations of a corner grocery in rural new england moreover it is evident from the testimony of express company officers and managers in various legislative investigations that without a complete reform in their statistical methods the companies would be unable to give any satisfactory account of the extent or character of their traffic or of the reasonableness of their charges testimony given before the railway mail pay commission in 1898 and 1899 brought out the fact that with the exception of the american express company no company attempted to keep any traffic statistics and it is understood that the agents of this company on january first of this year were ordered to discontinue the practice as might be expected therefore the testimony of officers before investigating commissions has been invariably vague and unsatisfactory testimony as to the average weight of packages carried the typical kind of merchandise the proportion of express traffic which is mailable and the average charge per package appear to be merely individual opinions based on observation and are frequently contradictory statistics of express business published in the census of 1890 and including besides figures relating to mileage equipment employees and expenditures the number of packages carried and their weight have often been used to determine the character of express traffic and the reasonableness of the charges yet general manager julier of the american express company testified before the railway mail pay commission that the statistics furnished by him after repeated requests of the census agents were merely estimates hastily prepared in view of the fact that none of the other companies keeps any traffic statistics whatever the census figures may be cast aside as worthless public knowledge of express charges is of the most superficial character it is known that express tariffs are not so complicated as railway tariffs because there is but a rough classification of traffic that the tariffs are based largely on the rate per hundred pounds with greater proportional charges for less weights that the element of distance affects the rate but not proportionately as the principle of group rates prevails that the element of risk is recognized in the practice of charging a higher rate for traffic of more than ordinary value that peculiar forms of traffic are given arbitrary rates that when competition prevails between mail and express service rates are given that will ensure the business especially if the shipper is a large one that this competition is more apt to prevail in the east where the traffic is denser and the shipments are made on the average for shorter distances these few facts give us no basis for judging of the method of computation of rates or of reasonableness of express charges either in themselves or in comparison with other forms of service nothing is known of the amount of money invested in the business or of the expense of conducting it only in a few individual instances under pressure from investigating bodies have the contracts with the railways been made public we know that under their contracts the express companies paid the railway companies for the year ending june 30 1903 over 38 000 000 which represented from 40 per cent to 60 per cent of their gross earnings but this is the sum total of our information from the standpoint of the express companies this failure to keep adequate statistics is entirely justifiable most of their contracts with the railways are on the basis of gross earnings a few on the basis of the space occupied and almost none on that of the traffic handled railway compensation is figured by the express company s auditor from the original way bills and no necessity for tonnage statistics exists but from the public standpoint the case is far otherwise that the express companies are common carriers is no longer an open question their relation to the public has been many times judicially established congress has recognized their character by including them in legislation affecting common carriers engaged in interstate commerce in such acts for example as that prohibiting the transportation of obscene literature and that for expediting the delivery of imported parcels upon this common carrier the public relies for the performance of a particular service the shippers have no dealings with railway companies in case of loss or damage to property in transit they look for relief to the express company and this agency enjoys an immunity from interference all the more extraordinary when contrasted with the policy of government toward the railways upon which express companies operate in return for their franchises the railways are subjected to control both as to the reasonableness and the equality of their rates they are required to make reports which throw the business open in large part to the inspection of the public the express companies likewise common carriers engaged in interstate commerce secure by contract with railway companies all the privileges which railways enjoy but because of a slight variation in the character of their business are exempt from that control to which railways submit in return for advantages secured from the competition between express companies to secure these railway privileges even if it is genuine the public derives no benefit it simply results in an increased revenue to the railway competition between express companies on the same railway system does not exist and is probably impossible if the railway elects to prevent it while the laws of a few states upheld by their courts have required that railways shall extend equal facilities and accommodations to all persons and companies doing an express business the united states supreme court in 1885 in the express cases held that railways are not common carriers of common carriers and are not obliged either by common law or usage to do more than to provide the public with reasonable express accommodations this decision has been recognized as establishing the principle of exclusive privilege competition between express companies operating on different railways serving the same termini is never heard of there has been occasional friction in the interchange of through traffic but it has been only temporary the public usually paying the charges of two express companies instead of one as already noted rates are scrupulously observed and the semblance of competition leads to the maintenance by each company at many points of facilities far beyond the need of the community served entailing an unnecessary burden upon the public three considerations then would seem to argue in favor of greater publicity for the express business in the first place this great transporting agency is being permitted to derive all the advantages of a common carrier and to assume none of its obligations justice to other agencies of transportation which have been brought under control and the absolute necessity of publicity in the affairs of public service companies demand that action should be taken in the second place as has been urged by the statistician to the interstate commerce commission it is impossible to make thoroughly effective the working of the interstate commerce law if this important agency is exempt from investigation it has frequently been charged that railways have found it to their advantage to withdraw facilities for fast freight in order to divert business to the express companies from whom they receive nearly half of the gross return what unreasonable or discriminating practices may exist as the result of this contractual relation cannot be known without fuller knowledge of express company matters finally there is an increasing agitation in this country for the introduction of a parcelspost it is probable that the united states government could not constitutionally make this extension of its mail service a monopoly but that it could create an effective and salutary competition with the express companies is undoubted it is a very great question whether the express business has not become in these last years an unnecessary agency and a public burden whether a reasonable extension of the fast freight service of the railways on the one hand already to some extent developed in the milk fruit and meat traffic and the inclusion in the mail service of a parcels post would not make it possible with a slight increase of their present facilities to do away with the express service altogether the only function of real social utility performed by this agency not already covered by the other two is its delivery service by wagons and english experience has shown that this may be made an efficient part of the railway service but such a large problem as this is not to be settled out of hand more must be known of the detailed working of the express business before judgment on this question would be warranted from whatever standpoint therefore the question be approached the first step seems to be clear to require of express companies reports similar to those required of railways would seem to be the immediate duty of congress the express business is from every point of view an industry which should be subjected to the principle of publicity

school colors episode 3 the battle of forest hills enlarge this image la johnson la johnson in the early 1970s forest hills queens became a national symbol of white middle class resistance to integration instead of public schools this fight was over public housing it was a fight that got so intense the press called it the battle of forest hills how did a famously liberal neighborhood become a hotbed of reaction and backlash and how did a small group of angry homeowners change housing policy for the entire country forest hills gardens the model neighborhood the story of housing within forest hills begins in an enclave within the neighborhood called forest hills gardens the gardens looks like an american s imagination of an english village most of the houses are tudor style instead of a grid the streets are curved and unlike most of new york city you need to have a permit to park here toggle caption cassandra giraldo forest hills gardens was built in the first decade of the 20th century as an urban oasis to prove that you could live the good life within the city limits away from the chaos and the riff raff it was designed by city planners not just for the people who were going to live here but to serve as an example of a model neighborhood for the rest of the country the gardens had always been an intentionally exclusive community you had to go through a background check and an interview to get in and everyone who got in was white around the time the gardens was created the field of city planning was beginning to take off in the united states one of these early city planners was a man named clarence perry who lived in forest hills gardens and was inspired by the gardens to create something called the neighborhood unit toggle caption regional plan of new york and its environs new york regional plan association 1929 vol vii 88 the neighborhood unit was a little map of what perry believed was the ideal neighborhood it certainly looked like forest hills gardens curved streets clear boundaries on the outside and a school at the center the central idea of the diagram was that the school is the thing that sets the geographic parameters for the neighborhood additionally perry also advocated for a high degree of sameness in communities he claimed that the great foe to community life is heterogeneity the new method to which i refer produces homogeneity put like people together and give them common facilities to care for and associations among them are bound to spring into existence toggle caption cassandra giraldo the neighborhood unit turned out to be so successful that one planning historian called it the most influential diagram in american city planning over the following decades hundreds of cities and towns across the u s used the neighborhood unit as a template to define neighborhood boundaries in relation to schools then use those boundaries to preserve racial separation john lindsay shakes things up in forest hills the homogeneity of forest hills gardens was not only about race for decades forest hills gardens remained elite white and christian but the gardens was only one part of forest hills ironically as the rest of forest hills grew up around the gardens it became famously jewish toggle caption cassandra giraldo like other groups of so called ethnic whites many jewish new yorkers saw higher incomes after world war ii and started to leave their old neighborhoods in brooklyn and the bronx if you couldn t yet afford the suburbs you moved to queens and for many jews that meant forest hills by 1970 the neighborhood was estimated to be two thirds jewish and 97 percent white it s not that all jews were like the anarchists and labor organizers who moved to rochdale village as described in episode two but there was a connotation of liberalism associated with american jews at the time this put forest hills on the city s radar when they went looking for places to build new public housing previously the new york city housing authority had gotten into a pattern of building almost exclusively in neighborhoods that were in the throes of white flight and disinvestment places like south jamaica however when john lindsay became the mayor in 1966 he wanted to change things up in his first year in office lindsay announced his intention to build 11 scatter site housing projects essentially build projects in neighborhoods scattered throughout the city which didn t yet have public housing one of them would be in forest hills although the program had good intentions to break down the walls of racial and social segregation in the city through housing it wasn t very popular with the neighbors the landlord takes on the champion of public housing the initial plan for forest hills was that nycha would build 840 apartments with 40 percent of them reserved for the elderly once word got out the resistance started at the forefront of the opposition was a man named jerry birbach toggle caption eddie hausner the new york tim es redux birbach worked in real estate one journalist back in the day described his business like this he buys old tenement buildings evicts the tenants renovates the buildings and rents them at a higher rate he says that he is thereby helping to improve the city s housing stock his enemies called him a slumlord galvanizing his fellow middle class tax paying neighbors birbach headed the forest hills residents association not a week went by without his association putting on some kind of protest or parade they would interrupt public meetings shouting and chanting and marching around they d storm the stage commandeer the microphone on the other side of this fight was the chairman of the new york city housing authority simeon golar when golar s father lost his job his family came to new york part of the great migration of black people moving north looking for opportunity one of the opportunities they found there was public housing in fact simeon golar was the first person ever to run the housing authority who had actually lived in public housing toggle caption neal boenzi the new york times redux golar took his job seriously if nycha had been its own city it would have been bigger than pittsburgh and golar was like the mayor when he took over the agency in 1970 there were 600 000 people living in public housing and 150 000 more trying to get in the scatter site housing program may have started with mayor lindsay but simeon golar became its public face so it was up to golar to take the heat from the press counter all the misinformation flying around and try to make some friends in forest hills but jerry birbach and his constituents made things pretty difficult for golar on november 18 1971 the housing authority announced that construction of public housing in forest hills would begin that night birbach rallied hundreds of his followers in a march through the neighborhood they blocked traffic in the streets and on the highway armed with picket signs and flaming torches toggle caption michael evans the new york times redux one of their signs read lindsay is trying to destroy queens now queens will destroy lindsay when they got to the project site they started throwing rocks and bricks and even hurled their torches over the chain link fence the next day jerry s torchlight parade was on the front page of the new york times mayor lindsay called the demonstrators deplorable forest hills was now officially a national story forest hills becomes a national story this was a national story because it had national stakes if new york city gave into these protests forest hills could become a template for other middle class communities who wanted to stop any use of government housing for the purpose of integration birbach and his allies swore this had nothing to do with racism it wasn t black people they were afraid of it was poor people as one demonstrator put it i want to live with decent people whether they be black white yellow or what have you but i don t want to live with welfare recipients that are leeches that live from decent hard working people and i don t want to live here so i m moving this was a constant theme people talked about public housing like an infection so called welfare people move in everybody else moves out there goes the neighborhood just like in south jamaica after world war ii there were vultures circling in the sky over forest hills ready to profit off of people s fears in late 1971 it was reported that blockbusting had already begun in forest hills that is real estate agents were going around the neighborhood trying to scare people into selling their property for cheap even so that doesn t fully explain the intensity of these protests you just can t separate all this talk about welfare and crime from race where were all the liberals jews were supposed to be synonymous with liberalism and forest hills was supposed to be a liberal neighborhood so where were all the liberals in fact there were some people in the neighborhood who supported the plan but the opposition had stifled their voices some local jewish leaders claimed that forest hills was proof that the mayor was targeting jewish communities for destruction that hardworking middle class jews were under attack by what might now be called the woke liberal establishment picket signs referred to the mayor as adolf lindsay mario cuomo comes onto the scene at seemingly the final moment before the project would begin mayor lyndsay shifted facing increasing opposition lyndsay had called in mario cuomo who was then a lawyer in private practice to negotiate in forest hills when cuomo finally published his report he called for cutting the size of the project in half twelve story towers instead of 24 400 apartments instead of 800 toggle caption n a cuomo made a lot of different arguments for reducing the size of the project but one was strategic if the housing authority didn t cut the number of units in forest hills the backlash might jeopardize scatter site housing in this city for many years to come after a 10 hour public hearing the cuomo compromise was finally approved the end of public housing as we knew it policy dictated by fear has consequences sure those buildings went up in forest hills but the devil s in the details after 10 000 people applied for 432 apartments they found ways to cherry pick the first crop of tenants such that 70 percent of them were white and the example of forest hills had ripple effects across the country just as many civil rights leaders had feared at the end of 1972 president nixon froze all federal funds for new public housing construction which brought the scatter site program in new york to a grinding halt then he announced that in the future instead of building homes for poor people the federal government would give them subsidies and let them find housing for themselves nixon s top housing official in new york said this would allow for integration at a more gradual pace and prevent battles like the one in forest hills forest hills didn t just mark the end of attempts to use public housing to integrate neighborhoods it marked the beginning of the end of large scale public housing period in the 30 years before forest hills 150 000 units of public housing had been built in new york city in the 30 years after forest hills only about 30 000 units were added and most of those were renovations or reserved for the elderly listen to code switch on apple podcasts and spotify correction school colors

nevertheless local investors still need to consider how rising energy costs flow through to asx stocks for industrial companies the question is essentially one of costs how high will energy bills go and how much of this can be passed through to customers in the form of higher prices so far signs are relatively good big industrial energy users to have reported in recent weeks such as orica and incitec pivot have generally seen their profit margins hold steady whether they eventually see an element of demand destruction remains to be seen but it should be pointed out that the prices for the commodities they help produce minerals and food are holding up well the question of how consumers will cope from rising energy prices which of course come amid broad based inflation and rising interest rates is trickier and retail analysts are growing increasingly worried that consumer spending could suddenly fall away in a note titled is retail rolling over barrenjoey analyst tom kierath argued this week that the tone from local retailers appears to have shifted until now trading feedback had been overwhelmingly positive with consumers still spending and limited down trading but as cost of living pressures and the federal election came into focus trading slowed he wrote it s difficult to separate the election impact from more lasting pressures but our sense is it s the latter the consumer environment could be about to get more difficult advertisement kierath s discussions with retailers suggest spending has fallen by about 10 per cent compared with march and april even despite more than 2 million households receiving the coalition s 250 cost of living subsidy further kierath believes the stock shortages that have beset retailers recently appear to have resolved as such promotional programs are likely to revert back to normal which we think will crimp retailers gross margins signs of changing conditions would marry with what the analysts are seeing out of the united states where the combination of higher costs and slowing sales stained the recent results of walmart and target on wednesday night dick s sporting goods joined this pity party reporting inventory is up more than 40 per cent on a year ago jarden s veteran retail analyst ben gilbert sees several key trends from the us retail reporting season that asx investors should note first top line sales are strong although with inflation running at more than 8 per cent this isn t exactly a surprise second consumers appear to be trading down both from discretionary items to food but also to discount retailers promotions and discounts are increasing making it harder to pass on increasing costs but perhaps most notable is how quickly conditions have changed target gave an upbeat outlook in march but warned conditions had turned in may we believe this in part could be reflective of what is to come in australia into the third and fourth quarters of calendar 2022 gilbert says however we see risk as lower given higher average income lower competition and higher savings we see food as least impacted followed by hardware given trade strength with household goods recreation and fashion most at risk advertisement asx investors appear cautious kierath says retail stocks have outperformed the broader market by an average of 12 5 per cent over the last two and a half years but more recently retailers have seen some selling woolworths is down 9 8 per cent in the last month while wesfarmers is down 4 5 per cent and coles is down 3 9 per cent discretionary retail has been hit harder with premier investments down 15 5 per cent in the last month jb hi fi down 12 3 per cent and harvey norman down 14 2 per cent with power bills now likely to eat a bit more of household budgets the weakness in retail may stocks may persist
tesla and spacex chief executive officer elon musk speaks at the satellite conference and exhibition in washington monday march 9 2020 twitter s regularly scheduled shareholder meeting wednesday may 25 2022 won t include a vote on musk s 44 billion bid for the social platform that vote will take place at a yet undetermined date in the future credit ap photo susan walsh file twitter s regularly scheduled shareholder meeting wednesday didn t include a vote on tesla billionaire elon musk s 44 billion bid for the social platform that vote will take place at a yet undetermined date in the future ceo parag agrawal said at the outset that executives won t be answering any questions surrounding the proposal even a question from a stockholder asking what will happen to his shares if someone buys twitter and takes it private was shot down if this happens the stockholder would be paid the agreed upon purchase price for each share and the stock would be delisted musk did not join the meeting although he could have being one of twitter s largest shareholders but the drama surrounding his offer almost all of it created by musk himself threatened to spill over into wednesday s proceedings shareholders raising proposals for a vote frequently invoked his name one proposal by the new york state common retirement fund called for a report on twitter s policies and procedures around political contributions using corporate funds it passed in a preliminary vote two proposals brought by conservative leaning groups failed to garner enough votes to pass one called for an audit on the company s impacts on civil rights and non discrimination and referred to anti racism programs that seek to establish racial social equity as themselves deeply racist the other sought more disclosure on the company s lobbying activities several proposals spoke to the deep existential conflict that s been playing out among twitter s users employees shareholders and employees while shareholders on one side lambasted the company for what they see as too liberal politics and a bias against conservatives for which there is no reliable evidence others said the company is failing to protect users from harassment abuse and misinformation musk s free speech edict which he has indicated would govern the company if he takes over without offering details has only inflamed the conflict musk had promised that taking over twitter would enable him to rid the social media platform of its annoying spam bots but he s been arguing without presenting evidence that there might be just too many of those automated accounts for the deal to move ahead the sharp turnaround by the world s richest man makes little sense except as a tactic to scuttle or renegotiate a deal that s becoming increasingly costly for him experts said last week the fact that the whole thing is playing out publicly on twitter no less only adds to the chaos that s been a constant in musk s bid even before he made it earlier in may the mercurial billionaire tweeted that the deal was on hold because he wanted to pinpoint the number of spam and fake accounts on the social media platform after claiming that twitter s own estimate is too low experts say musk can t unilaterally place the deal on hold although that hasn t stopped him from acting as though he can if he walks away he could be on the hook for a 1 billion breakup fee alternatively twitter could sue musk to force him to proceed with the deal although experts think that s highly unlikely the uncertainty has weighed on twitter s shares broader investor worries about the social media sector have dragged shares down this year then late monday snap which runs the snapchat app that features vanishing messages and video special effects issued a dire profit warning saying that the macroeconomic environment has deteriorated further and faster than anticipated since just last month social media companies are competing for the same pool of advertising money that is increasingly under threat from spiking inflation and also changes at apple inc that can restrict the information social media platforms can collect on users a big selling point for advertisers shares of snap inc plunged 43 tuesday though they recovered some of the loss wednesday climbing nearly 12 to 14 31 shares of twitter were up 1 09 or 3 at 36 83 in early afternoon trading on wednesday musk has agreed to pay 54 20 per share at its own annual shareholder meeting wednesday facebook s corporate parent meta platforms and its founding ceo mark zuckerberg faced heated criticism from shareholder the fusillade targeted facebook algorithms slipshod controls over misinformation and hateful content that unhappy shareholders contended have undermined democracy provoked murder and mayhem and had a corrosive effect on children the discontent inspired a series of proposals seeking to require meta to submit to more independent oversight of facebook instagram and its other products while lessening the power of zuckerberg whose controlling stake in the company prompted one outraged shareholder to lambaste him as an elitist oligarch during the 70 minute meeting but none of the 12 proposals received more than 30 support based on the preliminary results announced wednesday the lopsided outcome largely reflects the ironclad grip that zuckerberg holds through his majority stake in a company that he famously started in a harvard dorm room nearly 20 years ago zuckerberg meta s chairman as well as ceo and the company s other eight directors on the board also received more than 90 backing to continue in their roles the resounding support came just days after a major new york pension fund that owns meta stock said it would vote against the directors in

share facebook twitter linkedin pinterest by doug tenney leist mercantile the may 12 wasde report supply and demand provided several positive surprises and higher grain prices for producers first the u s corn yield for 2022 was pegged at 177 bushels in a rare move usda s first supply and demand tables for the 2022 crop year project the corn yield for this year as different compared to the february outlook forum that report estimated the u s 2022 corn yield at 181 bushels this compares to past years when in consecutive fashion from 2014 to 2021 the may corn yield was the same as the february outlook forum the u s corn yield last year was 177 bushels for months the market has been filled with various private reports that the u s corn yield had to be a record due to the tightness of corn supplies around the world in addition some had already suggested that a record u s corn yield for 2022 would not be large enough to alleviate shrinking supplies of corn around the world and that production from the 2023 crop year would be needed to remove the concept of tight supplies world corn supplies continue to be tight due to dry weather and lower production in south america in addition the reality that ukraine corn stocks cannot be readily available for export due to the ongoing russian invasion further restricts world corn supplies china cannot import 6 million tons of corn purchased from ukraine with the huge wild card being when will it ship numerous private analysts point out that usda could be 200 million bushels too low in their u s old corn export estimates currently u s corn exports are pegged at 2 5 billion bushels and should be increasing in future usda monthly wasde reports another surprise from that may 12 report is that u s wheat production was below trade expectations marking the sixth consecutive year of declining production the dry u s southern plains continue to point to even further declines in wheat production adding further insult to injury the wet conditions in the u s upper plains are slowing the planting of spring wheat and corn north dakota had not one but two freakish blizzards take place in april when just one event dumped up to 30 inches of snow mid may weather forecasts indicated several rain events likely to take place in the following 10 day period in addition new crop 2022 world wheat ending stocks were less than expected the second surprise had wheat prices sharply higher on that may 12 report day kc wheat made new contract highs as july kc wheat closed at 12 70 up 69 ½ cents chicago july wheat that day closed up 65 ¾ cents at 11 78 ¾ well below its contract high at 11 95 ¼ which was made early march u s wheat bakers and world wheat buyers are estimated to have only booked 25 of their third and fourth quarter needs they continue to hope prices will drop but for them yet prices are not cooperating in addition note that india and pakistan typically jointly export about 10 million tons of wheat yearly drought conditions suggest that instead they could be importing 2 million tons of wheat this only adds even more fuel to the growing fire of uncertainty of available world supplies of wheat corn and soybeans china continues to be a sporadic buyer of u s soybeans mid may following the may 12 report china bought two cargoes of u s old crop soybeans while that represents a miniscule portion of their soybean import needs that purchase takes place amid rising brazil export selling values during early may it looked like brazil would be unable to export soybeans after early august in addition at the time of purchasing those two u s soybean cargoes china had booked just 25 of june and july soybean imports look for big price changes and plenty of price volatility well into august remember the new cbot daily price limits are 50 cents for corn and 1 15 for soybeans until oct 31
kuper s own accent made him seem different to most people he met as he explained it he comes across as posh to working and middle class people and decidedly unposh to the wealthy to the latter he would be classified at oxford as a stain which is to say a former pupil of a public school a rung on the social ladder below a tug the term for a graduate of one of the lesser private schools the prep school with the most cachet was eton founded in 1440 which bestowed diplomas on key figures in chums kuper classifies them as toffs a term they occasionally use to describe themselves and one that suggests aristocratic types who are insulated smug and snobby in hindsight even johnson described himself and his peers as somewhat odious what a sharp elbowed thrusting and basically repellent lot we were he wrote in his 2006 collection of essays have i got views for you kuper made friends played cricket fell in love and ate as well as he could at a university that put little premium on cuisine he did not overlap with johnson who graduated with a degree in classics in 1987 much of chums is reportage based on interviews with the main characters as well as observations of contemporaries and knowledge of oxford acquired while attending classes kuper was only vaguely aware of these panjandrums in training and never imagined that they would acquire national significance simon cuper s book chums how a tiny caste of oxford tories took over the uk will be published in australia in july they seemed too absurd he said for the book i spoke to a friend i worked with at cherwell who said i thought they were from the past and that modernity would wipe out these ridiculous etonians with their white ties and their speeches it didn t occur to me that they had identified the route to power meritocrat v toff part of it was simply getting to oxford which has produced 11 of the united kingdom s 15 prime ministers since world war ii the rest was joining the oxford union a debating society founded in 1823 housed in a large gothic revival building with a library snooker room bar and a debating chamber that seats 450 people it has long served as a proving ground for the politically ambitious of every ideological stripe a public venue to demonstrate a gift for extemporaneous speaking and wit kuper had never heard of the union before enrolling the toffs on the other hand had been dreaming of the chamber since adolescence he said and trained to strut before its packed wooden pews in places like eton s political society essentially the union s feeder team advertisement the union s most coveted bauble was the title of president and previous holders of that office included prime ministers william gladstone edward heath and h h asquith johnson s father stanley had tried and failed to attain this prize in the late 1950s and it was inevitable that his son would make a similar effort given his outsize aspirations boris johnson is the most compelling personality in chums the shambolic style the self deprecating humour the gift for zingers it was all there in university as was the elitist s ambivalent approach to achievement the goal was to strive without seeming to exert effort which was considered a bit vulgar effortless superiority was then oxford s well known unofficial motto so his first campaign for the top job at the union as described by kuper was a conspicuously low energy affair his rival was a public school graduate named neil sherlock who recalls that johnson did not bother to campaign and never so much as hinted at his plans were he to prevail sherlock had promised to revive the union by recruiting more members to kuper sherlock described the campaign as meritocrat versus toff as sherlock said of johnson in a recent video interview it was easy to paint him as a very establishment and right wing person who expected to win and who had no sense of what was needed to run an organisation sherlock garnered a clear majority of some 1200 votes and went on to become a lobbyist for kpmg and pwc johnson took stock of the setback and won the presidency the next year kuper argues in chums that had this cadre been rejected by oxford brexit never would have happened one of its original proponents was a student and future member of parliament daniel hannan who created the oxford campaign for an independent britain at an oxford coffee shop in 1990 when euroscepticism was highly unfashionable except among the chums they re going to run the country and they don t want people in brussels in charge kuper says their whole destiny is to go to westminster and they have in mind a great country like the one their fathers and grandfathers ran most britons don t care about the eu but if you think you re going to run the country it matters kuper also has an oxford rooted explanation for partygate the catch all term for illegal festivities at no 10 downing street which johnson attended breaking laws about socialising that his own government had passed at the height of the pandemic in kuper s telling indifference to law was and remains a prominent feature of the all male bullingdon club a raucous group of wealthy undergrads who gather occasionally to eat drink and break things at a restaurant of their choosing cameron and johnson both bullingdon members attended a 1987 dinner at which someone tossed a potted plant through a restaurant window the message of the bullingdon kuper says is we make the rules we can do whatever we want this article originally appeared in the new york times

financial crisis in 1961 with proceeds from the sale used for minority scholarships as long as the university is involved with the chase manhattan bank it is the enemy of concerned black people cbp leader willie edwards says if you don t sell we ll take further action the regents deliberate in closed session for about ninety minutes and decline to comply the students actively consider a hostile occupation of the room but are dissuaded by edwards and other black leaders who warn of the predictable adverse consequences of such an action instead they go occupy the empty administration building

the long failed history of gun control legislation law enforcement personnel outside robb elementary school in uvalde tex after a shooter killed 19 children and 2 teachers at the school on tuesday may 24 2022 photo by ap photo dario lopez mills public safety the long failed history of gun control legislation terrorism domestic violence school shootings 3d printed guns none of them have been enough to win the support of republicans resistant to gun control reforms it has come to this volodymyr zelensky ukraine s heroic president who is in the midst of a brutal and deadly war sends his condolences to america deeply saddened by the news of the murder of innocent children in texas zelensky tweeted after what is already known as the texas school massacre tuesday s murders of 19 children and 2 teachers in a uvalde tex elementary school by a teenager wielding an assault rifle has reignited the gun control debate just days after it was supposedly reignited by the racist killings of 10 african american customers at a supermarket in buffalo n y also by a teenager wielding an assault rifle as of wednesday morning according to the nonprofit gun violence archive 17 198 people had been killed by guns in america so far in 2022 more than half by suicide and there had been 213 mass shootings such tragedies might prompt some countries to change to pass new gun control laws in an effort to avoid future massacres but america has a long history of failed attempts at such legislation despite approaching it from various angles domestic violence 3d home printed guns the rapid fire of semiautomatic weapons longer background checks keeping guns away from terrorists opposition from second amendment hard liners and the deep pocketed national rifle association nra has kept gun control legislation from passing since the 1994 assault weapons ban which sunsetted in 2004 and was not renewed not one major gun control bill has passed congress since the 2012 sandy hook massacre states however have been more successful in passing laws to both tighten or loosen regulations being reasonably close to people who are out in the field working on gun violence prevention and people who are survivors of gun violence themselves i am thinking especially about what it s like for them to see these incredibly painful traumatic events says jonathan jay a boston university school of public health assistant professor of community health sciences who studies the causes of gun violence in cities and racial disparities in gun violence exposure these are retraumatizing and reminders of the ways in which our public policy has not put community safety above some other roles he emphasizes that gun violence costs thousands of lives per year beyond mass shootings and that the easy availability of guns has ripple effects spreading trauma across communities of all demographics because guns are so widely available it is pretty easy for people to bring a gun to a situation for a gun to be involved at a moment when someone is at their worst jay says whether that s a teenager who has been bullied or a person who is contemplating suicide or an argument in a neighborhood that gets out of hand those momentary states of mind can become lethal with a gun disputes that might not have ended in a fistfight or any physical violence at all can become lethal or life changing with a gun the case for these measures is much much wider than these really traumatic mass shooting events he says after the uvalde massacre senator chuck schumer d n y senate majority leader said he s going to bring background checks up for a vote again but there is little chance it will pass meanwhile texas republican governor greg abbott senator ted cruz r tex and former president donald trump are set to speak at a nra gun rights conference in houston on friday here are some of the most notable failures of gun control legislation over the last decade and one or two very small successes post sandy hook regulations after 20 first graders and 6 others were murdered at sandy hook elementary school in december 2012 president barack obama and democrats attempted to tighten regulations on assault weapons limit the capacity of magazines and tighten background checks all their bills failed in the senate in april 2013 on what obama called a pretty shameful day domestic gun violence prevention bills in 2014 senate republicans defeated a bill that would have funded states efforts to keep guns out of the hands of domestic abusers and a law that would have banned those under temporary restraining orders from buying or possessing guns home printed gun scrutiny that same year 2014 the republican controlled house stopped a proposal that would have required serial numbers on homemade guns such as those made with 3d printers the bill never even got out of committee keeping guns away from terrorists in 2015 the republican led senate defeated a bill that would have banned people on a federal terrorism watch list from buying firearms opponents of the no fly no buy bill noted the many errors and inconsistencies on the watch list gun trafficking as a federal crime in 2015 and 2021 democrats proposed making gun trafficking a federal crime and increased penalties for those who buy guns for felons and others prohibited from owning them known as straw buyers none of the proposals passed expanding background checks in 2015 and 2016 after mass shootings in san bernardino calif and at the pulse nightclub in orlando fla democrats proposed applying background checks to gun shows and private sales where many gun transactions happen without scrutiny all failed as did weaker measures proposed by republicans a similar bill on gun shows also failed in 2017 and several subsequent proposals have gone nowhere against nra opposition record reporting improvements after a shooter killed 26 at a church in sutherland springs texas in 2017 with guns he was able to buy in spite of a domestic violence conviction even the nra backed a set of minor improvements to the reporting of criminal and mental health records to the background check system the changes passed congress as part of a larger spending bill signed into law by president trump smart gun requirements a bill introduced by democrats in 2017 after the mass shooting at a country music festival in las vegas would have required gun manufacturers to equip their product with available technologies ensuring that only the proper owner could fire the gun this would keep children and other family members from firing them as well as render them useless if stolen it failed bumpstock ban the las vegas shooter used devices known as bump stocks that allow semiautomatic weapons to fire essentially as fast as fully automatic ones he killed 60 people with semiautomatic rifles equipped with bump stocks the legislation never passed but the trump administration banned the devices through regulation extending background check time limit multiple attempts have been made to extend the three day maximum on federal background checks after which sales are allowed to proceed the gunman who killed nine members of a bible study group at a black church in charleston s c in 2015 was able to purchase his handgun thanks to this loophole none of the bills have passed

barbara ortutay and michael liedtke the associated press san francisco ap tesla ceo elon musk on wednesday revised the financing plan for his proposed 44 billion purchase of twitter raising investor hopes that the unpredictable billionaire still intends to pull off a deal roiled by market turbulence and musk s not entirely explicable concerns about the number of fake accounts on twitter the news overshadowed twitter s regularly scheduled annual shareholder meeting earlier wednesday shareholders didn t address the musk deal directly that vote will be scheduled for an as yet undetermined future date should the deal proceed twitter shares jumped 5 5 to 39 22 in after market trading building on a 3 9 rise during regular trading the financing changes outlined in a regulatory filing would shave 6 25 billion from the lending package musk had previously lined up for the twitter buyout that means musk will need to raise that sum in stock commitments instead of debt that would bring the equity that is stock based portion of the deal to 33 5 billion up from the 27 25 billion musk disclosed three weeks ago the filing with the securities and exchange commission didn t go into much detail on where musk will get the additional equity but emphasized he is still trying to persuade his friend and former twitter ceo jack dorsey a supporter of the buyout to throw his stock into the financing package dorsey also a twitter cofounder owns a 2 4 stake currently worth about 700 million based on the company s closing stock price wednesday according to factset research musk owns a nearly 9 6 stake worth 2 7 billion wednesday was also dorsey s last day as a member of twitter s board a date established when he resigned as ceo last november the nuts and bolts of the financing package weren t as significant to investors as the news that musk apparently still plans to complete his twitter buyout serious doubts about musk s resolve have hung over the deal since he announced he was putting it on hold something experts say he can t really do unilaterally until twitter provide public proof to support its claims that fewer than 5 of its accounts are fakes powered by spam bots even assuming the share price rise continues into regular trading thursday twitter is still changing hands well below the 54 20 per share that musk agreed to pay just a month ago wedbush securities analyst dan ives said the persistent gap between musk s offer price and twitter s stock price indicates that most investors still believe the billionaire will walk away from the deal unless the company agrees to a lower price twitter s board has so far insisted it won t do that earlier this week ives estimated that there was a 60 chance that musk would call off the twitter deal and pay a 1 billion breakup fee risking a potential lawsuit by the company with musk now trying to secure a new financing package ives believes there is a 50 50 chance of the deal happening but only if twitter s board is willing to sell for significantly less than the agreed upon price musk is hedging his bets here but the big elephant in the room remains ives said twitter dealt with another potential headache wednesday by agreeing to a 150 million penalty to settle allegations that it violated its users privacy to help sell advertising from 2013 to 2019 in a case brought by the u s department of justice and federal trade commission earlier at the shareholder meeting ceo parag agrawal stated up front that that executives wouldn t be answering any questions surrounding the musk bid even a question from a stockholder asking what will happen to his shares if someone buys twitter and takes it private was shot down if this happens the stockholder would be paid the agreed upon purchase price for each share and the stock would be delisted musk did not join the meeting although he could have being one of twitter s largest shareholders but the drama surrounding his offer almost all of it created by musk himself threatened to spill over into wednesday s proceedings shareholders raising proposals for a vote frequently invoked his name one proposal by the new york state common retirement fund called for a report on twitter s policies and procedures around political contributions using corporate funds it passed in a preliminary vote two proposals brought by conservative leaning groups failed to garner enough votes to pass one called for an audit on the company s impacts on civil rights and non discrimination and referred to anti racism programs that seek to establish racial social equity as themselves deeply racist the other sought more disclosure on the company s lobbying activities several proposals spoke to the deep existential conflict that s been playing out among twitter s users employees shareholders and employees while shareholders on one side lambasted the company for what they see as too liberal politics and a bias against conservatives for which there is no reliable evidence others said the company is failing to protect users from harassment abuse and misinformation

emotions right now including feeling distraught numb confused unsafe out of control terrified helpless and outraged she adds it s a mixture of feelings that leave you feeling helpless and despondent and that s a lot to carry it s more than any parent should have to carry greenberg says these feelings of helplessness are normal particularly for parents it s a parent s job to protect our children she says anybody any loving parent is going to feel that eric storch professor and vice chair in the menninger department of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at baylor college of medicine tells yahoo life that others may be experiencing feelings of anxiety and struggling to concentrate or focus on work feeling really raw and without some direction he points out that many may also be feeling powerless or frustrated over the inaction or ineffective action that tends to follow each mass shooting in the u s when similar patterns keep repeating themselves and leaders consistently fall short of enacting meaningful change to address the problems and control the controllables it can be difficult to avoid feeling powerless says galligher it s also common to feel overwhelmed by the depth and breadth of the problem storch explains there s also a domino effect happening with one trauma on top of another noting the dozens of shootings in the past couple of months while coming off of a difficult pandemic which we re still not out of he says it s like squirting some lighter fluid on something that was already burning kind of robustly so what can people do to take care of themselves experts suggest checking in with yourself and figuring out what your needs are for example that might mean getting extra hugs from your kids or partner other parents might need quiet time greenberg says others might need exercise and movement others might need to talk to other people such as a group of friends above all be intentional about engaging in activities that soothe you and replenish your energy says galligher experts also recommend being mindful of your media consumption both for your own mental health and for children who might overhear the news set limits around when and how much news you re consuming on this topic at one time says galligher if you re feeling understandably stressed be mindful of that around your children do the best you can not to overwhelm them with your anxiety because they will feel that says greenberg i know that s hard but part of being a parent is attending to your children s needs and sometimes that means dealing with your anxiety in another place storch suggests that parents check in with their kids as well and see what they know about the news correct what may be inaccurate and provide confident reassurance of their safety even if you don t feel that way inside he says he shares that many people are feeling shaken by the tragic news but stresses that it s important for parents to let their kids see them as a role model of confidence and self assurance even if inside you re sort of struggling what actions can people take to feel less powerless one of the best ways to counter feelings of helplessness and hopelessness is to do something as galligher puts it the antidote to despair is action however she points out that one person isn t likely to be able to solve the problem all on their own all at once but that doesn t mean we should do nothing galligher recommends taking the initiative to learn about the gun violence problem from different angles and perspectives and then taking stock of your own strengths and resources consider what you could do to make the problem better even if it s a very small thing she says choose one or two priorities that you really want to have an impact around and think about actions you can realistically take to affect those priorities focus on things you can control or influence whether it s with your voice your wallet or your personal effort storch says that can mean anything from protesting to volunteering trying to do your part to make the world a little better you can volunteer at or donate to gun violence prevention organizations such as everytown for gun safety moms demand action a grassroots movement that s part of everytown and sandy hook promise greenberg also recommends contacting your child s school to ask about its safety protocols some have doors locked and safety officers who check people in she says other schools don t have that be active reach out to the school about their protocols she also suggests calling or emailing local lawmakers you can find your representative here to make sure they support sensible gun legislation and raise the roof on this as greenberg puts it this is a life or death situation and persistence

minutes before he attacked governor greg abbott said on wednesday as harrowing new details of the massacre emerged the gunman whose rampage ended when police killed him also had sent a message on tuesday saying he was going to shoot his grandmother followed by another internet post confirming he had done so abbott said at a news conference the suspect s grandmother shot in the face before her grandson left the home they shared and attacked the school survived and called police the gunman identified as salvador ramos 18 otherwise gave no warning he was about to commit what now ranks as the deadliest u s school shooting in nearly a decade authorities said fleeing the shooting of his grandmother he crashed his car near robb elementary school in uvalde texas about 80 miles 130 km west of san antonio then managed to evade a school police officer who approached him before running inside no gunfire was exchanged at that point according to police but authorities offered few details of the encounter likely to become a focus of investigations except to say that the suspect dropped a bag full of ammunition and ran toward the school when he saw the officer ramos then entered the school through a back door carrying an ar 15 style rifle and made his way to a fourth grade classroom where he shot all of the people who were slain authorities said he had legally purchased two rifles and 375 rounds of ammunition days before the shooting meanwhile police surrounded the building breaking windows to help children and staff escape u s border patrol agents also responded and entered the building to confront the shooter with one agent wounded in the crossfire homeland security officials said eventually ramos a high school dropout with no known criminal record or history of mental illness was shot dead by law enforcement abbott said 17 people suffered non life threatening injuries the wounded included multiple children who survived the gunfire in their classroom texas department of public safety spokesperson chris olivarez said the shooter s online posts were made on facebook nasdaq the governor said but spokespeople for facebook s parent company meta platforms

son of a bitch who would come to a deal like this to make a political issue one of them said though it was not clear who o rourke was escorted from the building and spoke to reporters outside he said

on tuesday robb elementary school in uvalde texas joined the long list of names that have been violently inscribed on the collective consciousness columbine newtown parkland blacksburg and many more over the last 25 years flowers and candles are placed outside robb elementary school in uvalde texas wednesday may 25 2022 to honor the victims killed in tuesday s shooting at the school for reasons which may never be known the shooter 18 year old high school student salvador ramos first shot his grandmother before driving to the elementary school dressed in all black and armed with an ar 15 assault rifle and a handgun ramos shot his way past an armed school district police officer and made his way into the school within two minutes 19 children and two teachers were dead making it the deadliest school shooting in texas history and third in the us surpassing parkland and columbine ramos was killed in a shootout with police grieving parents were taken to the local civic center where they were swabbed for dna the bodies of the children between the ages of seven and 10 were in some cases so mutilated by ar 15 fire that they can only be identified through genetic testing a few details are beginning to emerge according to media reports ramos born in north dakota was bullied in school for a stutter and lisp frequently getting into fist fights with classmates he apparently had few friends and kept to himself and often missed class he made posts on social media about guns including posting images of his two legally purchased semi automatic rifles just three days before the attack on robb elementary whatever the individual psychological issues involved however they do not explain the routine outbursts of mass violence that plague american society the problem is much deeper little exposes the pretense of the us as the land of milk and honey as much as the regularity of such horrors the massacre at robb elementary was the 19th school shooting so far this year according to the gun violence archive there have been more than 17 000 gun deaths so far this year the majority by suicide there have been 213 mass shootings where four or more people were killed or injured of these 10 have been mass murders with four or more killed the politicians in both the democratic and republican parties have responded to uvalde with their typical trite and empty platitudes that explain nothing president joe biden gave a perfunctory nine minute speech tuesday night in which he postured against the gun lobby while calling on the country to do nothing but pray on wednesday biden called for action on gun laws on wednesday democratic senate majority leader chuck schumer threw cold water on the president s pretenses noting that the prospect of any new federal gun laws was all too slim even though the democrats control both houses of congress and suggested that horrified americans should vote in the november midterms the republicans while offering up hollow concerns about mental health insist that the solution is more guns and brute violence so that the good guys can kill the bad guys before they carry out their attacks they argue for turning schools into armed garrisons more akin to maximum security prisons than institutions of learning these fascistic solutions are the rhetoric and justifications of the so called war on terror which resulted in torture chambers drone assassinations and the destruction of entire societies in the middle east brought home nowhere from within the political establishment and the media is there any serious examination of the underlying social and political conditions that find expression in the homicidal actions of individuals american capitalism in fact is suffused with violence promoted by a ruling class that normalizes death and trivializes life the attack on columbine high school on april 20 1999 in which eric harris and dylan klebold murdered 12 of their classmates and one teacher shocked the world and was seen as a significant turning point at the time it was the fifth deadliest act of mass murder in the us since world war ii the wsws drew attention to the social factors ignored and covered up at the time the concentration on individual warning signs will be of little help in preventing further tragedies attention should be focused rather on the social warning signs that is the indications and indices of social and political dysfunction which create the climate that produces events like the columbine hs massacre vital indicators of impending disaster might include growing polarization between wealth and poverty atomization of working people and the suppression of their class identity the glorification of militarism and war the absence of serious social commentary and political debate the debased state of popular culture the worship of the stock exchange the unrestrained celebration of individual success and personal wealth the denigration of the ideals of social progress and equality since then mass shootings have become more common and more deadly columbine now ranks as only the sixth deadliest school shooting in american history the students who survived that shooting now have children of their own who must deal with the prospect of being victims themselves across the country children are put through active shooter drills where they are taught to run hide fight the social political and cultural factors underlying the growth of malignant tendencies including school shootings have only grown more extreme social inequality has grown to almost incomprehensible levels with the 400 richest americans claiming more than 3 trillion in wealth while half of adults report they would have difficulties covering a 400 emergency the republican party one of the two principal parties of the ruling class has been transformed into a semi fascistic organization that sought to overturn the constitution through a violent coup on january 6 2021 the massacre in texas came only 10 days after a gunman politically and ideologically inspired by the fascistic conceptions promoted by significant factions of the republican party murdered 10 people in buffalo new york the growing phenomenon of school shootings and mass shootings in general is a symptom of the advanced decay and breakdown of american society life has become exceedingly cheap under capitalism the united states is now in the third year of the covid 19 pandemic which has already claimed the lives of more than 1 million people children and educators have been forced back into schools that are known to be primary vectors of the disease offered up as sacrifices for profit more than 1 500 children have died from covid 19 as a direct result of the homicidal herd immunity policy pursued first by trump and now biden at the same time the biden administration is pursuing a reckless and aggressive foreign policy that has opened up a war against russia in ukraine pouring billions of dollars worth of guns ammunition and missiles into that country biden made his remarks about the uvalde shooting on tuesday after returning from a trip to asia where he threatened to wage war against china a direct conflict between the us russia and china would inevitably result in nuclear war killing millions a prospect that the american ruling class is clearly prepared to accept meanwhile police roam the streets of america harassing beating and killing workers with impunity an average of three people are killed every day by the police adding up to more than 1 000 deaths every year far above the total from school shootings in even the deadliest years hundreds of thousands of students educators and parents participated in walkouts and protests after the parkland florida shooting in 2018 demanding that action be taken to end school shootings however this mass outpouring of anger and determination was subordinated to the democratic party and illusions in gun reform legislation through the march for our lives organization millions continue to look for a way forward with students and educators discussing the possibility of walkouts on social media in the aftermath of uvalde finding a solution must begin with identifying the cause any explanation of the massacre at robb elementary that does not point to the ruling class its political leaders its military police machinery its homicidal policies and above all the socio economic system of capitalism over which it presides is nothing more than a cover up that prepares the way for the next horror
