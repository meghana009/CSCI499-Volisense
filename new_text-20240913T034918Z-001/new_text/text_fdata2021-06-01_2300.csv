president joe biden must decide what share of doses should be given to the neediest countries and how many should be reserved for u s partners washington in april the biden administration announced plans to share millions of covid 19 vaccine doses with the world by the end of june five weeks later nations around the globe are still waiting with growing impatience to learn where the vaccines will go and how they will be distributed to president joe biden the doses represent a modern day arsenal of democracy serving as the ultimate carrot for america s partners abroad but also as a necessary tool for global health capable of saving millions of lives and returning a semblance of normalcy to friends and foes alike the central question for biden what share of doses should be provided to those who need it most and how many should be reserved for u s partners the answer so far at least appears to be that the administration will provide the bulk of the doses to covax the u n backed global vaccine sharing program meant to meet the needs of lower income countries while the percentage is not yet finalized it would mark a substantial and immediate boost to the lagging covax effort which to date has shared just 76 million doses with needy countries the biden administration is considering reserving about a fourth of the doses for the u s to dispense directly to individual nations of its choice the growing u s stockpile of covid 19 vaccines is seen not only as a testament to american ingenuity but also its global privilege more than 50 of americans have received at least one dose of the vaccine and more than 135 million are fully vaccinated helping bring the rate of cases and deaths in the u s to the lowest level since the earliest days of the pandemic scores of countries have requested doses from the united states but to date only mexico and canada have received a combined 4 5 million doses the u s also has announced plans to share enough shots with south korea to vaccinate its 550 000 troops who serve alongside american service members on the peninsula the broader u s sharing plan is still being finalized a white house official said having been the subject of policy debate inside the white house and across the federal government and also involving covax and other outside stakeholders like drug manufacturers and logistics experts our nation s going to be the arsenal of vaccines for the rest of the world biden said on may 17 when he announced the u s pledge to share more doses he added that compared to other countries like russia and china that have sought to leverage their domestically produced doses we will not use our vaccines to secure favors from other countries still the partnership with the south korean military points to the ability of the u s to use its vaccine stockpile to benefit some of its better off allies it was not clear whether south korea would pay for its doses from the u s most of the other doses were expected to be donated samantha power the new usaid administrator provided the first indication of the likely allocation last week in testimony on capitol hill she told the senate appropriations committee that 75 of the doses we share will likely be shared through covax twenty five percent of whatever our excess supply is that we are donating will be reserved to be able to deploy bilaterally administration officials cautioned that biden had not yet signed off on the precise split and that it could still change the white house official who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal plans said the administration would be working in coming days to synchronize its supplies with the global vaccine sharing organizations biden has committed to providing other nations with all 60 million domestically produced doses of the astrazeneca vaccine that vaccine has yet to be authorized for use in the u s but is widely approved around the world the u s produced doses will be available to ship as soon as they clear a safety review by the food and drug administration the president also has promised to share 20 million doses from existing production of pfizer moderna and johnson johnson vaccine stocks even more doses are expected to be made available to share in the months ahead as part of its purchase agreements with drug manufacturers the u s controlled the initial production by its domestic manufacturers pfizer and moderna are only now starting to export vaccines produced in the u s to overseas customers the u s has hundreds of millions more doses on order both of authorized and in development vaccines it s obviously challenging because so many countries face this need right now power said calling the decision of where to send doses an urgent question the decision she continued hinges on some combination of the relationship we have with the countries the public health and epidemiological scientific trajectory of the disease and a sense of where the vaccines can do the most good the infrastructure and readiness of countries to receive vaccines the u s under biden also has pledged 4 billion to covax led by gavi the vaccine alliance the coalition for epidemic preparedness innovations and the world health organization to help it procure and distribute vaccines covax has committed to sharing the doses with more than 90 countries including many with which the u s has tumultuous relations leaving it to covax to decide how the bulk of the u s provided doses are distributed is seen by the administration as the most equitable way to determine who benefits it also could allow the u s to avoid any political fallout that might come from sharing the vaccine directly with adversaries it s not only a symbol of american values it s smart global health policy said tom hart acting ceo of the one campaign which has pressed the biden administration to move faster to develop its global sharing plan an outbreak in north korea or iran or somewhere else where we might have tensions viruses travel no matter where they re flourishing and i don t want a variant cooking up in some remote part of the world anywhere in the world which then might get around the current vaccines that we ve got even if the bulk of the u s shared doses are distributed through covax power told senators it will be very clear where those doses are coming from people will be very clear that these are american doses coming as a result of american ingenuity and the generosity of the american people she added

no introduction for halston is better than fashion institute and technology s museum s own in their spring 2015 exhibition yves saint laurent halston fashioning the 70s the 1970s was a time of momentous change in fashion not only in the look of clothes but also in the way they were designed made distributed and consumed this dichotomous decade sandwiched between the counterculture 1960s and the opulent 1980s witnessed the demise of haute couture s majestic reign and the simultaneous ascension of designer led conglomerates the shifting sands of style during the 1970s accelerated the relaxation of fashion codes eclectic individuality blended with a somber modernity that mirrored the dour economic mood of the decades early years perhaps because the 1970s was a period of such transition and uncertainty its fashions are among the most challenging in modern fashion history to assess no two designers defined and dominated the decade more than yves saint laurent and halston they were the era s most influential and celebrated clothing creators becoming celebrities in their own right both have been the subject of countless books articles films and exhibitions but whereas yves saint laurent has earned eternal repute and awe halston remained somewhat obscured at least to non usa audiences who rarely if ever see his designs and buy his perfumes even though a host of women in the spotlight was once upon a time called the halstonettes famous women wearing his designs and mirroring his image notably liza minnelli and lauren bacall most of them were young beautiful aloof vibrant and glamorous immortalised in francesco scavullo magazine covers dripping with glam and poise sometimes too much poise as recreational drugs were a standard as noted by andy warhol in a 1978 diary entry he recalled minnelli arriving at halston s house and imploring the host to give me every drug you ve got a tv show recently changed this injustice rekindling an interest in the prolific designer who changed fashion and embodied the studio 54 fashion momentum like no other and his perfumes of course one youtube commenter had it right halston walked so tom ford could run adapted from the 1991 book simply halston by steven gaines a tv mini series of five episodes was ordered by netflix in september 2019 and it premiered on may 14 2021 starring ewan mcgregor in the eponymous role of roy halston frowick the man who invented himself came from a dreadful midwestern background a childhood spent in a farmhouse with an abusive father who yelled and a mother who was cheered up by the boy s own handicraft a feathered hat so he started as a milliner much like chanel for that matter as exhibition curator patricia mears notes on halston s style one of the great aspects of his success was his ability to balance beauty and modernity nowhere is this more evident than in his eponymous fragrance halston for women also referred to nowadays as halston classic photo by kated via fragrantica com there is a great scene in episode three sweet smell of success in which halston sits down with a respected woman perfumer called adèle played by vera farmiga to talk about developing his first fragrance halston he is asked to select things which are meaningful to him in the script the designer selects orchids because they re beautiful tobacco because he s constantly drawing from a cigarette and his lover s jockstrap because he s a semi closeted gay man we re even shown the alleged perfumer sniff the used jockstrap deeply at some point at the time the lover referred to was victor hugo a venezuelan student who arrived at halston s studio to work as an assistant and who became his lover for a decade but great as the perfume making scene might be dramatically giving a glimpse into the consulting process with a client replete with tiny bottles of essences and blotters being dipped into them and sniffed it fails to convey the true spirit of the fragrance in question it was a tall order no doubt as a passing mention of three things that seem to serve as symbols rather than tales in themselves is no more revealing than the fragrance industry s recent tendency to drop three notes to consumers and expect them to get crazy over their newest launch there was definitely ground for exploration and tense dramatic antithesis serving as a psychological outlet for the hero letting us glimpse his repressed emotions but it s mainly that there is no really controversial element in the actual perfume as i recall it s actually one of the starchiest and loveliest of the classic chypres of the 1970s as for his men s halston z 14 and halston 1 12 issued in the same year more fragrances to discover if you haven t yet they re great please note these have been re orchestrated in the silver bottles of halston woman and halston man in the late 2000s the actual halston fragrance is not about orchids which have no smell of their own in perfumery although the natural blossoms do have various scents not about tobacco and certainly not about jockstraps however beloved the wearer was but it did rely on newly minted no pun oils which helped it sell 1 5 million bottles in the first two weeks it s all historical inaccuracy for the sake of pushing specific fantasies onto the viewer and serving the psychological display of his personality so what is it like what does the halston perfume really smell like you ask i first became interested in halston classic sometime in the late 1990s while reading a magazine clipping citing the favorite fragrances of famous people oddly enough there were candid snippets of greek socialites and celebrities one of them agapi vardinoyanni one of the female members of a famous local tycoon family always presented as a lovely expansive personality with innate brunette beauty and brilliant blue eyes revealed her favorite as halston for women i had heard of the designer voracious vogue eater that i was but had never heard of a greek woman owning a bottle of his fragrances they were the loot ransomed by relatives travelling abroad i was intrigued the design of the bottle was brought into focus in that article i read too the well known elsa peretti design with the curvaceous shape leaning to one side which was originally met with distrust during the max factor boardroom talks when they objected to its organic shape maybe they viewed it as phallic the mind plays dirty tricks after all and the famous guerlain quatrilobe flacon is also somewhat humanoid in shape halston according to the vice president of max factor at the time paul wilmot backed the difficult design with his own money finding a technical way to fill it and redesigning the nozzle elsa peretti was one of the original halstonettes at the time a very close friend of halston himself and best known for her work for tiffany s she was paid for her design she recalled in a 2014 interview in vanity fair before her death that he proposed 25 000 or a sable coat she said she opted for the sable only for it to be burned in the fireplace during a heated argument later on when she left new york for spain at any rate thankfully her design prevailed and thus we have a hallmark to commemorate all these years later for more on 1970s perfume bottles design refer to our collective article at the time there was mostly spray cologne stock which seemed an odd concentration for youngsters accustomed to eau de parfum and there was parfum there were also the american ads depicting a naked cindy crawford citing cindy in her halston this was a very monroesque allusion which also referenced a legendary ad from the 1970s i was aware of the one with brooke shields in her calvin klein jeans it was therefore a deal that i simply had to investigate the design perfectly matched the scent as i soon found out for myself hunting down my bottle minty on top floral chypre in the heart very much like the perfumes i recall older glamorous relatives wearing a hint of aldehydes in the process my formidable grandma was a devotee of rive gauche and madame rochas to the end of her days and finally a woody soapy backdrop which was deliciously sexy in an unassuming way the formula was developed with one of the truly greats but not by a woman by a man bernard chant is a legendary perfumer at iff who is revered for the majority of aramis men s fragrances and most estee lauder women s fragrances from the starchy aldehydic estee to the big floral beautiful as well as seminal chypre fragrances such as cabochard gres clinique aromatics elixir imprevu coty and lauren ralph lauren halston classic was one that cemented his good taste and excellence of execution there is something creamy warm and intimate about halston classic although one would never in a million years classify it as animalic but it s definitely a product of its time still relevant after all these years because it s streamlined feels high class and exudes good taste one can never offend in halston but it s much more memorable than innocuous office friendly fragrances the oakmoss while there is never in your face much like the case with caleche making it an easy to adopt woody chypre even for chypre phobics halston classic edition 1975 perfumer bernard chant top notes green leaves mint melon bergamot and peach middle notes marigold carnation cedar orris root rose jasmine and ylang ylang base notes oakmoss amber vetiver incense patchouli sandalwood and musk nevertheless there was tragedy in the halston plot too keen to expand the halston name onto everything and become a legend he lost sight of the need to retain his name a bit more closely to his heart in that regard his plight was similar albeit worse to that of pierre cardin the licensing of the halston brand is a mingled affair halston signed a six year licensing deal worth a reported 1 billion with retail chain j c penney in 1983 a novel move at the time the line called halston iii consisted of affordable clothing accessories cosmetics and perfumes ranging from 24 to 200 but his cachet was mangled high end fashion retailers felt the brand lost part of is exclusivity getting into a mid range department store and the halston limited was dropped from luxe bergdorf goodman the later brand halston limited was acquired by esmark inc the same year only to change ownership four more times to the point that the designer lost all claims to his name halston enterprises was eventually bought by revlon inc in 1986 with halston himself a salaried employee revlon was not keen to keep him for long and after catching hiv and later being diagnosed with aids in 1988 he moved to san francisco where he was taken care of by his family by 1990 when halston died the proprietors had stopped the fashion line and only kept the production of perfumes under the revlon aegis many more owners and relaunch efforts were made in the coming decades with the latest being halston heritage signing a deal with the majid al futtaim group for distribution of its products in the united arab emirates while that company sold h by halston and h halston to the company xcel that specializes in bringing fairly known brands to mass market outlets a couple of years later thirty one years after halston s death we re again exploring his formidable course in fashion and perfumery

stock market summer correction review crypto crash bitcoin bear market initial targets this article is an excerpt from my recent extensive analysis that concludes in my latest biotech stock picks with the potential to x10 over the coming years five more small cap bio and tech stocks to invest for 2021 and beyond that has first been made available to patrons who support my work topics include invest and forget stock market early summer correction review ai stocks strength vs weakness rampant money printing inflation big picture high risk stock buying levels risk ratings western digital wdc 71 chia risk 1 life sciences biotech smaller cap high risk stocks investing binge biotech stock 1 cheap low risk pharma risk 1 biotech stock 2 high risk gene editing risk 9 biotech stock 3 low risk 2 biotech stock 4 x10 for max risk 10 high risk stocks portfolio buying levels covid india black mold epidemic bitcoin and raven coin buying levels so for immediate first access to all of my analysis and trend forecasts then do consider becoming a patron by supporting my work for just 3 per month five more small cap high risk stocks with the potential to x10 to invest in for 2021 and beyond which follows on from my analysis of 9th of april how to invest in high risk tech stocks for 2021 and beyond featuring 5 stocks as i am seeking to replenish my portfolio after many former small cap high risk stocks have either been taken over or migrated into becoming safe stocks such as nvidia amd and tsmc where the best of the new stocks in terms of current valuations was corsair disclaimer the analysis in this article is a matter of opinion provided for general information purposes only and is not intended as investment advice information and analysis derived from sources and utilising methods believed to be reliable but i cannot accept responsibility for any trading or investing losses that may be incurred as a result of this analysis individuals should consult with their personal financial advisors before engaging in any investing or trading activities invest and forget firstly do check out my earlier analysis how to invest in high risk tech stocks for 2021 and beyond so as to understand the mechanisms of investing and holding small cap high risk stocks where the basic strategy is to allow the winners to run to x10 so as to offset those stocks that fail to take off which means a hands off approach is a must else huge mistakes could be made such as exiting stocks too early that take off and thus fail to capitalise upon x10 growth which means one will be left only holding those stocks that failed to takeoff during this process i have screened over 200 stocks in attempts to identify smaller cap stocks that i am personally seeking to invest in for the long run at the right price and the primary screening tool i used during this exercise was the website simply wall street which allowed me to skim through stocks at the rate of about 6 per hour to identify those that could increase their market caps by several multiples whilst also seeking to limit the risk of failure and the stocks going to zero stock market early summer correction review the stock market is in the midst of my forecast time window for an early summer correction of approx 10 decline as illustrated by my trend forecast graph 9th feb 2021 dow stock market trend forecast 2021 charts courtesy of stockcharts com the stock market correction began shortly after my last analysis with the first down leg terminating at just under 33 500 followed by rally to the lose close of 34 394 my expectation are for the correction to run for several more weeks so there should be at least one more down leg to below the 33 500 towards my target of 32 500 meanwhile the correction in tek stocks has been far more severe which has taken the nasdaq to a low of 13000 from its high of 14 200 for a 9 correction before the recent bounce to 13 681 the nasdaq like the dow should also see another leg lower to new lows to target a trend to 12600 bitcoin and ravencoin crypto s crash initial bear market price targets whilst my in depth analysis is pending completion however i have been flagging for several months that the crypto s are in a bubble that will burst crash plunge enter into a bear market for which we received a taste of what to expect a few days ago so my message and strategy has been not to hold any meaningful amount of crypto i e the only crypto i have is what i have mined with a couple of existing desktop pc s and even then most of the funds generated 80 have been spent because i know that the price of most of not all crypto s is going to head a lot lower so in response to patron requests and in advance of my more in depth analysis on the crypto space that is about 50 complete then here are the approx range of buying levels that i have had penciled in for bitcoin for sometime of where i would be tempted to look at actually buying bitcoin with fiat though attempts to fund my coinbase account with fiat has so far failed but i will leave that for my next analysis so 19k to 22k is where i would consider accumulating bitcoin which i will develop further in my next analysis that i aim to complete before the end of this month to include a strategy of what to do during an anticipated crypto bear market of what crypto s i will be looking to accumulate at much lower prices than where they trade today with a significant amount of holdings generated via gpu mining but for which we have plenty of time as i expect the bear market for most crypto s to run for a good year or so from peak to trough so i am in no rush to panic buy on chaotic price action though saying that setting limit orders at levels well below where the crypto s are trading can and did get me filled on some more raven coins that i have been seeking to accumulate as i have flagged in several preceding articles so very volatile price action can get one crypto s much cheaper than where they are actually trading at most of the time that is the nature of the volatile crypto space imagine all of the perma bull crypto maniac traders trading on margin who just got nuked on the various wild wild west exchanges as their stops were hit and remember folks crypto s for me are a low priority so frequency of articles focused on the crypto space will remain low i e i don t see myself ever holding more than about 1 of total assets in crypto s people talk about parking their excess funds in crypto would instead be much better served by parking excess cash in the likes of google is the crypto chia a scam for an 100 billion ipo chia the so called green crypto that is fast gobbling up all available hard disk storage space with many hundreds of thousands busily farming away 100gb plots in attempts to win the elusive chia coins that has in the past couple of weeks commanded prices as high as 1600 per coin so very enticing to sucker in many crypto enthusiasts into it s event horizon including me though i soon realised after a weeks farming plotting that the chances of winning were virtually zero so i stopped plotting chia on the 14th of may which is where my plot count has remained static at 142 or 14tb of storage used as the maths does not stack up furthermore 2 weeks on my decision to stop farming proved correct as the ponzi game that chia is has become apparent one of a mass of unfarmed chia coins that will go into an ipo chia inc so as to get the fools on wall street to plow upwards of 100 billion into in valuation terms thus allowing the chia

dead tissue hospitals in india are reporting a surge in patients infected with black mold disease across 29 states for instance 1 large state hospital maharaji yehswantrao is reporting 185 cases during the weekend alone when the hospital was used to experiencing 2 cases per year and has become more challenging than covid 19 in terms of hospital resources this illustrates the broader danger of covid in that it can allow opportunist killers to gain a foothold on a population where the healthcare system has been brought to a state of collapse meanwhile india continues to under report the true extent of the pandemic with actual deaths likely 5 times official numbers so around 15 deaths per million people per day as does likely most of africa to an even greater extent the pandemic also continues to worsen in most of the south american nations so covid looks like becoming a permanent income stream for pharma s both in terms of vaccines and treatments such as anti fungal s for the emerging consequences such as black mold disease again this article is an excerpt from my recent extensive analysis that concludes in my latest biotech stock picks with the potential to x10 over the

noel king host a small activist hedge fund called engine no 1 last week won two seats on the board of exxon mobil by convincing other investors that the company s plan to deal with climate change was not much of a plan at all with me now is nell minow she s the vice chair of valueedge advisors and she s also an exxon shareholder good morning nell nell minow good morning king who is engine no 1 minow well it s just a group of investors it s people who and it s small by wall street standards so their investment in an exxon mobil was only about 54 million and if you compare that to other people who have had big fights with major corporations people like carl icahn those people i want you to think about michael douglas as gordon gekko in wall street those are people who had hundreds of billions of dollars and they invested and they went in and they said greed is good and in a very very tiny fraction of cases sometimes they were able to defeat the management sponsored candidates but this is the first time that a tiny little fund has been successful they had 0 002 of the stock this is the biggest upset since david and goliath king ok so to ask you an obvious question if they have such a tiny tiny percentage of the stock no 1 why do they care what exxon mobil does and no 2 how did they get this done minow well no 1 they care what exxon mobil does because they think that by making these changes they ll make a lot of money on the stock and that is why they succeeded they succeeded because they made an absolutely incontrovertible business case and because exxon mobil pretty much did everything wrong and engine no 1 did everything right exxon mobil lost a record 25 billion with a b dollars last year nevertheless they keep raising the ceo s pay that s the kind of thing that makes investors very angry and more important than having a big block of stock a carl icahn gordon gekko block of stock is having angry shareholders because somebody will get out front you can get a lot of support king why is exxon losing so much money minow well because unlike some of their competition they are not pivoting to more renewable resources they are just pretending that the world is always going to be the way it always has been and things have changed i mean just last week president biden issued a major executive order that is going to put a lot more pressure on fossil fuel companies if they don t adjust to that they re going to go the way of buggy whip manufacturers king and so when engine no 1 votes or pushes to get two of its people on the board that s not about being altruistic that s about saying we are investors we want this company to be profitable and in order to be profitable it has to change with the times minow exactly right that is what they did right they came out with a very detailed very organized and very i m going to just say green eyeshade kind of business analysis they said this is why the business lost all this money and this is what they need to do to get money and then they put up also very credible candidates people who had a lot of background in the energy business and that made it very successful you know it s a little bit ironic that one of the groups that decided to vote with engine no 1 is the largest investment fund in the world it s the norwegian pension fund which was created by the oil business in norway and yet even they thought that exxon mobil was going in the wrong direction king so engine 1 ph got to people onto a board of 12 still a minority what does this actually change for exxon if anything minow that s what we re waiting to see we don t expect to see any major changes immediately but here s how we ll know what the impact has been very quickly one will they put these new directors on the key committees i want to see them on the audit committee i want to see them on the nominating committee which selects new directors and i want to see them on most important the compensation committee and will they change the compensation so that all of the incentive goals are based on making a change rather than doing what they ve done in the past that s how we ll know how effective that they have been if the company tries to shut them out of the major committees if they don t make changes in the compensation then you can expect another proxy contest next year until they get a majority king david and goliath which you mentioned is a great story but ordinarily smaller voices do not win smaller investors do not win you ve been writing and speaking about corporate governance for years how big a deal is this do you see a knock on effect happening or is this a one off minow oh this is definitely a monumental shift king oh minow they ll be studying this one in business schools for years and remember that exxon mobil didn t even meet with the people from engine no 1 i can guarantee you the next company that engine no 1 goes after will return their phone calls king how does exxon feel about all of this what have they said what has the company said minow well let me tell you in a series of incredibly bad decisions including spending 35 million to fight engine no 1 instead of talking to them and compromising with them they actually did something also completely crazy and unprecedented they halted the annual meeting in the middle to try to get people to change their votes it was too little too late so i think i hope that they understand this is a major wake up call and if they don t believe me they will be getting another wake up call very soon king what are the lessons then here for corporations and for smaller investors minow well this is really capitalism 101 i always say capitalism is not named after the ceo capitalism is named after the people who provide capital and remember these are people who manage money for the pension funds for firefighters for teachers for people who work in offices and they are trying to do what is best so that you can retire sometime in the future and get paid so if they don t listen to their shareholders they re going to see a lot more of this these shareholders like the california pension fund the norwegian pension fund they re enormous so now is the time to make friends with them before things go wrong king nell minow is the vice chair of valueedge advisors thanks for being with us nell minow bye bye soundbite of emancipator s all in here transcript provided by npr copyright npr
don t miss out on the headlines from economy followed categories will be added to my news china has revealed its intentions to diversify its supply of iron ore and now experts are warning that not if but when they do pull the pin on australia s biggest export earner our house prices will go tumbling with it in its monthly briefing a fortnight ago the national development and reform commission ndrc recommended chinese firms boost domestic exploration for the steelmaking input explore overseas ore resources and widen their sources of imports adding iron ore australia s biggest export earner to the raft of curbs already in place on commodities like coal and wine could be a risky move energy research and consultancy firm wood mackenzie told bloomberg at the time given the near record prices and china s dependence on australia s high quality supply for about two thirds of its imports while an outright ban would be almost unimaginable various forms of restrictions delays or increased administrative burdens on australian iron ore imports could yet happen wood mackenzie warned mb fund and mb super chief strategist david llewellyn smith echoed a similar sentiment in a piece for his publication macrobusiness today whether china cuts off australian iron ore is not in question he wrote only the timing of it is as well as what it will do to the australian economy when it does related china s threat could wipe 32 billion from economy three main drivers behind cut off according to llewellyn smith there are three main drivers behind the cut off first he writes is the us china cold war which is dividing the world into liberal and illiberal economic blocs australia siding with america makes chinese reliance upon our iron ore strategically unviable second the chinese economic development model is running out of rope its urbanisation is all but complete in construction volume terms he wrote it can continue to overbuild but this is now hurting its long term growth prospects as misallocated capital and debt kill off productivity it must shift away from building as its primary growth driver china which buys 60 per cent of our iron ore is buying it up like never before to create steel for its massive infrastructure projects in a bid to recover from the pandemic related china s mind bending megadam plan china is buying up australian iron ore like never before to create steel for its massive infrastructure projects picture vincent du reuters the third driver he says is the combination of these two factors most forcibly in chinese politics ccp legitimacy will fail as the economy slows it is already being replaced with deliberately stoked nationalism this makes external conflict inevitable most particularly in taiwan llewellyn davis said yet australia has a virtual veto over chinese military aggression so long as china relies upon it for iron ore the ccp must therefore he said probably over the second half of the 2020s break the chinese economy s reliance via a combination of structural decline in steel output a shift towards a greater share of scrap output and by seeding new iron ore developments worldwide what will happen to australia then as unimaginable quantities of aussie iron ore flood ex china markets global iron ore prices will collapse writes llewellyn davis china absorbs more than a billion tonnes of seaborne iron ore australia ships around 700mt there every year some large slice of this will be progressively dumped on other markets he added the bigger hit however will be to national income australia will reap at least 150 billion this year in export revenue from iron ore nearly all of which will be wiped out by the combination of volume and price pressure while the hit to our total exports will be big he advises it will remain manageable likely returning to 2015 external conditions related seeking to divide pm swipes china what australian trade without iron ore to china will look like picture macro business that also gives us a very good guide to what will happen nominal growth will be crunched inflation and wages will be hit for years the budget will be a sea of red mining stocks will fall bonds yields will plunge aud will crash llewellyn davis warned on top of that australian house prices would tumble radically devaluing versus the world via the collapsing currency how long that would last is the more interesting question presuming that aud can keep on falling without creating inflation then there is no obvious immediate limit to it he said china warns of australia s pain currently skyrocketing iron ore prices are putting china s economic recovery from the pandemic at risk with companies and everyday chinese citizens bearing the cost chinese government mouthpiece the global times said companies have already raised prices for a wide range of products including refrigerators washers and bicycles citing rising costs however analysts told the paper that china s latest moves to crack down on speculations and other market manipulation is about to send chilling waves across the globe the global times singled out australia as the nation that will be hit hardest by the crackdown given iron ore is such a dominant force in our exports and accused us of profiteering from the rising prices among the most affected could be iron ore exports from australia which has benefited massively from the sky high prices in its main export emboldening officials in canberra to continue on their relentless provocation against china the paper stated while china s reliance on australian iron ore will likely continue in the foreseeable future despite its efforts to diversify sources sharp drops in iron ore prices would mean heavy losses in export revenue for australia which is already seeing declining trade with china in areas such as wine and seafood it said that iron ore prices have dropped us9 25 a11 93 per tonne since beijing took action earlier this month that could translate into a loss of over us2 billion a2 58 billion in extra revenue for australia based on the amount of exports to china in the first four months of 2021 with ben graham originally published as iron ore price fears australian property will suffer after china move

according to senior political and economic sources who work closely with the current iranian government exclusively spoken to by oilprice com last week the u s has agreed to a tentative removal of key sanctions in the oil gas petrochemicals and automotive sectors plus some of those on iran s banking sector however supreme leader ali khamenei and the senior figures of the islamic revolutionary guards guard corp irgc are also demanding the additional removal of individuals and their businesses from the u s s sanctions list although khamenei fully supported by the senior irgc generals has repeatedly stated that iran will not and legally is not required to renegotiate any elements of the joint comprehensive plan of action nuclear deal from which the u s unilaterally withdrew in may 2018 the iran sources believe that they may yield on this intransigent stance tehran may be folding with nationwide power outages and rising food shortages rising inflation and depreciation of the rial raising the prospect of widespread civil unrest across the country one of the iran sources said last week despite the comments of many who have never traded anything in the financial markets corroborated by those who have but who are talking up their own long crude positions that there will be little effect on the oil price when at least 2 5 million barrels per day of iranian crude oil returns to the market this is highly unlikely to be the case the fact that global trading giant goldman sachs is still targeting brent crude oil to hit us 80 per barrel at some point this year however is significant in three ways first it means that goldman itself has already authorised its mighty proprietary trading vehicles to buy brent in a market that has nowhere near the liquidity of say the global foreign exchange fx market meaning that traders can get a lot more trading effect for a lot less money in oil than in fx the price action of this sort of activity by a true trading giant such as goldman has been sufficient in and of itself on many occasions in the past to significantly move and sustain prices at certain key levels second given goldman s stellar trading reputation in many financial markets not only will its own major clients also be buying brent but so will all of those in the markets who are aware of what a recommendation from goldman can do to as asset s price so producing a self fulfilling trading prophecy scenario this said though there is only so long that the fundamentals of supply and demand can be bucked especially in the oil market and even more so when the u s government does not want oil prices higher related china boasts successful nuclear fusion as was very clearly demarcated under the government of former president donald trump but pertains to all u s presidencies of recent years washington simply does not want oil prices on the higher side in general the economic reason for this is that for every us 0 01 that the u s s national average price of gasoline rises more than us 1 billion per year in discretionary additional consumer spending is estimated to be lost as a general historical rule of thumb it is estimated that every us 10 per barrel change in the price of crude oil results in a us 0 25 change in the price of a gallon of gasoline based on more recent historical precedent a us 90 95 per barrel of brent oil price equates to around us 3 per gallon of gasoline and a us 125 130 per barrel of brent equates to around us 4 per gallon of gasoline the danger zone for u s presidents starts at around us 3 00 per gallon and at us 4 00 per gallon they are being advised to pack their bags in pennsylvania avenue or start a war to divert the public s attention the point was underlined by bob mcnally the former energy adviser to the former president george w bush that few things terrify an american president more than a spike in fuel prices for trump the early warning for brent oil pricing was anywhere above us 70 per barrel which is why whenever brent looked like it was going to trade decisively above there and towards us 75 80 per barrel he started to tweet veiled threats to opec members especially saudi arabia specifically for example when the saudis with the help of russia were pushing oil prices up over the us 80 per barrel of brent level in the second half of 2018 trump said in a speech before the u n general assembly opec and opec nations are as usual ripping off the rest of the world and i don t like it nobody should like it he said we defend many of these nations for nothing and then they take advantage of us by giving us high oil prices not good we want them to stop raising prices we want them to start lowering prices and they must contribute substantially to military protection from now on the oil markets do not yet know what brent price level would trigger concern from biden s administration but it is fair to assume that it is somewhere close to this us 70 80 per barrel range with the same floor price of us 35 40 per barrel to safeguard the shale oil sector given the negative effect on the u s s post covid 19 economic recovery that rising and higher trending oil prices will have related oil prices rise at the start of driving season two and a half million barrels per day of oil coming into the global markets from iran is certainly going to weigh on oil prices over time but it may be a lot more than this very quickly it is wise to remember that despite the widespread but erroneous reports that iranian crude oil exports had dropped to exceptionally low levels due to u s sanctions the reality was that iran was still exporting large quantities of oil to china as exclusively revealed by oilprice com this constant stream of exports to china meant that iran never had to shut down wells and this is why according to industry figures iran pumped 2 43 million barrels per day bpd of crude oil in april this said immediately prior to the u s re imposing sanctions in 2018 iran pumped around 3 8 3 9 million bpd of crude with realistic plans to increase this to at least 5 7 million bpd within two years of the implementation day for the jcpoa on 16 january 2016 although this target was shelved due to deals with western oil companies not being finalised over the last two weeks though iran has released various statements outlining plans to dramatically increase its oil volumes initially very quickly from key fields in west karoun comprising the major fields of north azadegan south azadegan north yaran south yaran and yadavaran which together are estimated to contain at least 67 billion barrels of oil in place for every one per cent increase in the rate of recovery that can be achieved the recoverable reserves figure would increase by 670 million barrels or around us 34 billion in additional revenues for iran even with oil at us 50 a barrel the focus on the west karoun fields also neatly ties in to the very recent completion of the goreh jask oil export pipeline last week iranian officials stated that the azadegan fields are top of the list of fields for further fast track development and although officially this is to be managed by domestic iranian companies in reality it will heavily figure chinese companies china national petroleum corporation cnpc is still the key foreign developer at north azadegan and the understanding agreed between iran and china when france s total pulled out of south pars phase 11 was that china would eventually take over the development in exchange for which it would also be allowed to go into south azadegan to create a unified field development programme with its north azadegan activities currently north azadegan is producing around 80 000 bpd but the phase 2 plan including the spudding of the new wells is aimed at boosting this output to at least 100 000 bpd more specifically china is expected by iran to ensure that the output from north azadegan when combined with the output from south azadegan currently being developed by iranian firms is at least 250 000 bpd south azadegan is now producing a steady 105 000 bpd with spikes to 115 000 bpd or so according to iranian oil industry sources longer term iran s plan is to increase the recovery rate from all of its oil fields beginning with those in west karoun to at least 25 per cent from the current 4 5 per cent it was 5 5 per cent before u s sanctions were re imposed by comparison the average recovery rate from saudi arabia s oil fields is around 50 per cent with plans to raise that to 70 per cent by simon watkins for oilprice com

new housing units in the smith ranch neighborhood in silverthorne are under construction monday may 31 summit county municipalities are considering emergency declarations related to housing photo by sawyer d argonne sdargonne summitdaily com summit county and local towns are considering an emergency declaration to help address the local affordable housing shortage and emphasize the increasingly dire circumstances of the issue to state and federal partners commissioner tamara pogue said the county is already drafting language for a declaration and is hoping to make the move in conjunction with local towns i ve been working on housing in summit county for 15 years and this is far and away the worst i ve ever seen it said pogue the former executive director of the family intercultural resource center i think it actually is connected to things that happened in our community during the pandemic we know that a lot of folks moved into our community full time i think that has significantly impacted our housing stock and has contributed to the tightness in the market and the availability of workforce housing that we currently don t have so i think we have to call it what it is this isn t a new problem for us but it is significantly worse than it s ever been prices are higher availability is lower and there are more people living here according to the most recent summit county housing needs update published in march 2020 there is a countywide gross gap of more than 1 200 housing units a number that s expected to more than double by 2023 officials said the issue has been further exacerbated by the covid 19 pandemic which spurred an exodus of seasonal workers who were later priced out by a record breaking year in the real estate market as more remote workers and second home owners took up residence frisco mayor hunter mortensen said despite frisco s best efforts in recent years to combat the lack of affordable housing for members of the town s workforce the problem has persisted to the point where it s become a real and dangerous threat to our way of life in frisco mortensen said he doesn t blame the newcomers frisco is a great place to live but the housing shortage has created an overly competitive landscape were the town and local businesses are pitted against each other for employees given the government s reliance on local businesses to succeed the situation is far from ideal we can t get any bigger mortensen said we ve built to our outer limits our ability to get more units is extremely limited by that and that s part of what s facilitating this push for a declaration and looking at this as an emergency i think seeing that then creates the issue of how do we get from 60 second home owners and bring that number down get some more rental units get more real estate that forever was where people lived and now are getting squeezed out by the folks who are coming in and can work a really high paying job remotely that then affects all of our local businesses because we are losing that workforce right now it s set us up in a position where all of the towns are competing with all of our businesses for workers and that s a terrible setup to be in as a community because the town doesn t exist without successful businesses graphic by taylor sienkiewicz tsienkiewicz summitdaily com breckenridge is also supportive of an emergency declaration or anything that will help with the current housing situation according to breckenridge town council member dick carleton we re going to assess the best way to do it whether it s individually or together with other governments carleton said but we re certainly supportive we re working really hard with housing and we want to do anything that may help with funding or to get some support from the state or the feds towns have developed programs over recent years to help keep the workforce in the county such as the housing helps programs developed by breckenridge and frisco that pay new or existing property owners to place deed restrictions on their units but the initiatives may have been too little too late we lost the race and the buying power of people coming to town became way more powerful than we could keep up with mortensen said while areas like frisco are out of land to develop building more housing is still a key tactic for other towns like silverthorne town manager ryan hyland said the town is in conversations with contractors to bring more rental units to the smith ranch area and the fourth street north development that would target specific community members based on income as the county and other towns prepare for an emergency declaration silverthorne is expected to pursue other options hyland said he noted that the silverthorne town council could consider other avenues to further bring the issue to light such as a proclamation that would stop short of declaring a formal emergency but the town hasn t downplayed the housing issues that have developed of late silverthorne used to be a bit more affordable than some of the other areas hyland said it s just caught up really quickly willowbrook is the type of neighborhood that historically we would look at as something a lot of locals were considering maybe a first home is something that would be possible and we re seeing prices at 800 000 and up now while it s not maybe at the same level as it would be in breckenridge it s still really out of touch there could be at least a couple hundred rental units that we could bring online but the challenge is you re a couple years away from getting folks into units so while we re excited about those opportunities they re not anything that s immediate the entrance to smith ranch in silverthorne is pictured may 14 2020 the silverthorne town council recently gave the green light to phase 5 of the workforce housing neighborhood photo by liz copan summit daily archives it s also unclear if dillon will join in the declaration mayor carolyn skowyra said the dillon town council hasn t formally broached the topic but council members do intend to have the conversation at some point skowyra spoke for herself saying that she was disinclined to make any sort of declaration unless it would lead to an actionable response it makes all the sense in the world if it helps us to an end product that helps the situation skowyra said if we re not going to be taking any measurable action i m not sure it s a wise use of an emergency declaration but we re going to talk about it officials planning to move forward with an emergency declaration are hoping that it will bring more people to the table to find solutions including short term rental owners who might be swayed to try long term renting once the impacts of the workforce shortage begin to manifest this summer or business owners who might work with developers to build more housing for their own employees local leaders also hope the declaration would better highlight the need for state and federal support to address the issue state rep julie mccluskie who serves summit county and the rest of colorado s district 61 said housing solutions have become a top priority for legislators at the capitol mccluskie is a sponsor of house bill 21 1271 a bill meant to remove barriers and provide incentives for the development of affordable housing by local governments if passed the bill would allocate 13 million potentially up to 48 million if an amendment to the bill is passed to create grant programs for governments that adopt policies and regulations that promote affordable housing development but the bigger boon will come from 3 8 billion in federal stimulus money coming to colorado as part of the american rescue plan act mccluskie said the state is planning to set aside between 400 million and 500 million to invest in housing initiatives throughout the state there s no set plan for how exactly that money will be spent those details would likely be finalized in the next legislative session but mccluskie said that amount of money represents a once in a lifetime opportunity to change the long term housing conversation in colorado we have never had 400 million or 500 million to invest in something as critical as housing mccluskie said to have this opportunity to make real lasting impact on the affordable housing supply and inventory i think is very powerful a moment that deserves the time the attention the conversation and collaboration with all of the key partners and leaders across the state who are intimately aware of what the problems are
administrators for the national facebook group badass teachers association bats have voted in secret to uphold their ban on world socialist web site writer and socialist equality party sep member evan blake this decision was made without any personal communication with blake himself and was only made public in a comment by bats administrator michael flanagan on a post in the facebook group teachers against dying responding to the post which encouraged members to express their views on the banning flanagan commented i appreciate the enthusiasm in bats and the publicity of a second article in wsws i did advocate for evan s reinstatement but it was a vote and the vote was no not at this time we are not here to be demanded of you got the wrong people for that but best of luck peace flanagan is the same administrator who wrote an article that falsified what led to the banning and sought to smear blake using language associated with sexual predators he also allowed a slanderous post to be made in bats which smeared the wsws and teachers against dying as racist and sexist which he then liked and defended it was a transparent lie to say that he advocated for blake s reinstatement the ban on blake was clearly a politically motivated act of censorship it took place within days of him posting an article he wrote that was deeply critical of american federation of teachers aft president randi weingarten which provoked a flood of opposition and calls for her immediate resignation as the national union president weingarten herself remains a member of bats and faces no criticism from the group s leadership who are themselves tied to the union bureaucracies and support the democratic party the wsws educators newsletter continues to demand the readmission of blake into the national bats facebook group and for the ability of socialists to voice their opinions in the group which claims to be left wing we received the following statements from educators and other workers in the us opposing the banning of blake kathy a school bus driver from the philadelphia region and member of the pennsylvania educators rank and file safety committee connected the banning of blake to the broader growth of opposition within the working class which the unions and their pseudo left backers seek to contain including through threats of violence by leaders of the democratic socialists of america dsa who are themselves deeply connected to the democratic party she commented this is not right evan blake should not be sanctioned evan and the rank and file committees are defending teachers and students against the pandemic by trying to silence them you might as well be with the administration supporting the murder of teachers and students what the rank and file committees are doing is good it is for the working class it is making significant gains i think the capitalists are getting scared they are starting to realize the impact that the committees are having upon the workers the workers are starting to realize that they have an alternative source than the unions they see what the unions have done and that they don t stand for workers and they see that the sep is standing for them bats see what is happening they realize the momentum and they see the impact that we are having and are afraid of it the same is the case with the dsa twitter supporting stalin s murder of trotsky showing ice picks they are threatening those who are seeking to build an opposition a teacher from maryland s eastern shore stated it s clear that the main goal of our unions is to actually keep us from uniting in solidarity to demand better treatment now the corporate leadership is even infiltrating our social media spaces and trying to censor and squash any criticism of how they have failed to represent our best interests for years now and especially during this pandemic michael hull a former teacher from texas who was victimized and driven out of the profession after founding the opposition group teachers against dying wrote i am highly disappointed that the leadership of bats decided to uphold the ban on evan blake i ve been nothing but supportive of bats in the past but i believe this ban deprives their audience of important perspectives not to mention his coverage of stories facing teachers that would otherwise go unheard in fact evan is one of the only journalists who interviewed me regarding my traumatic experiences as an educator during the pandemic moreover few outlets or journalists have made the accurate connection between unsafe school reopenings and the corporate state s desire to prop up the stock market through a subsidized daycare i have come under criticism for not censoring the wsws from my group teachers against dying and for being featured in some of their articles however i support their advocacy of teachers and their unapologetic exposure of corruption as a democratic space committed to good faith discussion we will continue to feature evan blake and allow members to voice conflicting opinions and perspectives as well i applaud anyone on the bats board of directors who voted in favor of lifting evan blake s ban but ultimately this was an unsettling decision especially considering randi weingarten is still a member of the group despite lying to me a cancer survivor and caretaker about helping with an accommodation and dismissing safety concerns facing teachers on a forum that bats sponsored if evan broke any group rules as they allege i know it was either inadvertent or out of a passion for advocacy more importantly it could not have caused anywhere near the harm weingarten has which evan blake has exposed i call on bats to ban randi weingarten from the group and to write a story exposing her lies and capitulation with the same amount of vigor that they devoted to writing about evan blake s purported rule breaking deja dorrough a member of teachers against dying commented it s absolutely disgusting that evan blake has been censored and even more disgusting that he has been lied on just because sad ass teachers doesn t agree with his political beliefs despite his accurate reporting during the pandemic a fellow teacher s character was slandered because they can t differentiate between political dissent and personal attacks these fake leftists get offended when someone speaks facts that don t align with their truth and that s messed up evan blake has done nothing but report on the realities facing teachers exposing the establishment and their capitulators which has nothing to do with his political background this looks like a personal vendetta to me michael hull who is not even a socialist has been in many of their articles because they recognize the same problem with the system that we have sadass teachers association sees the problem and then turns their heads they recorded the exchange between randi weingarten and michael hull but they didn t release it or even talk about it however they were very quick to slander evan blake with lies they don t seem too interested in educating teachers about the crimes that have been perpetrated against them evan has done that but they write a hit piece on him and ban him with no evidence that he did anything wrong michael and his group members have fought valiantly against the political establishment and sellout national union bosses who herded teachers to their deaths bats should remove the vile post that slanders the wsws and teachers against dying and by implication all their members and supporters as racist and sexist also where is their article on what happened in bats between michael hull and randi weingarten she lied to him and basically told texas teachers to pound the sand as their homicidal governor herds them back into deadly conditions you know who did report on that evan blake bats have been silent though but i guess violating some group rules is worse than selling out dues paying teachers they should get their priorities straight on this bridget a teaching credential student at a southern california university commented bats should not censor anyone who tells the truth their prevention of democratic discussion manufactures consent the consent to reopening schools without listening to the science this is the sort of thing that gets people killed bats seems really pro union i noticed one of the admins had a unions work sticker as her facebook profile before i learned about how blatantly the aft was backstabbing actual workers i was pro union mainly because i thought they still had the interests of workers in mind and historically they did get things like the 8 hour workday i just hadn t read any more recent history the fact that they censored the wsws writer shows that they are trying to push a liberal agenda by refusing to allow political discussion if someone disagrees with them and gets censored or banned that just shows you that the bats is just doing what democrats do wsws writer evan blake must be allowed to post on bats james a mental health care worker sent the following comment as a key worker in mental health i wholeheartedly oppose the banning of evan blake from the badass teachers association bats facebook group it is an act of draconian political censorship based on nothing but disagreement with evan s socialist politics to which the bats administrators wish to deny access lest educators and other workers should become radicalized through it in that case these educators and other workers would cease to subordinate themselves to the democratic party and the union apparatus whose rightwing politics are masked as progressiveness through their compulsive insistence on the dictates of identity politics it is this political independence of educators and other workers that the bats administrators are concerned above all to preempt through banning evan and they won t make this agenda clear in their membership rules since it would remove the cover that enables their anti socialist reaction to operate with secure impunity that is under the radar beverly a retired public service employee in northern california wrote bats administrators have refused to readmit evan blake to their group or to engage with any of the political issues involved with his banning one administrator simply responded to blake s demand for readmission by stating ithout knowing the particulars of what the issues were i wouldn t want to countermand the people who made the decision anyway as if ignorance is sufficient to justify blind obedience to authority it seems to me that a response more in keeping with the goals and methods of the educational profession would be to educate oneself about those issues and attempt to factually rebut the wsws article if indeed facts in rebuttal can be found but this is not what you did in a move reminiscent of joseph stalin s tactics you chose instead to censor any views that deviate from the bats political line and to purge their author from your group i must conclude that if this is how badass teachers model intellectual inquiry and critical debate for their students our educational system is in a condition more deplorable than i imagined i look forward to having you prove me wrong stop the censorship of world socialist web site articles immediately and readmit evan blake to the national bats facebook group

sen sherrod brown d ohio hasn t forgotten the great recession in the first half of 2007 brown recalls there were more foreclosures in his hometown than anywhere else in the country it was a period that led to the global financial crisis millions of americans lost their homes while banks and other corporate sectors were rescued by billions of dollars in bailouts more than a decade later democrats control the white house the u s senate and the u s house of representatives and brown and fellow populists like sen elizabeth warren d mass and rep maxine waters d calif are in powerful perches to oversee the big banks and brown like many of these top democrats believes that too many americans are still getting the short end of the stick they never get bailed out brown says in an interview with npr they never get a second chance they re just not in a position in an economy like this where wall street writes the rules where they can get ahead that anger has been magnified at a time when banks have seen their profits soar during the pandemic in part thanks to strong actions by the federal reserve to support markets and top democrats believe they are justified in pushing for change at big banks they want to push the country s largest financial institutions to be agents of social change and they have specific goals like expanding access to loans and impose fewer fees for average americans or more outreach to unbanked and underserved communities they did very well during the pandemic brown notes about the banks we ve seen stratospheric compensation levels we see stock buybacks and dividend distribution yet wages throughout our economy are essentially flat brown is the chairman of the senate committee on banking housing and urban affairs which also includes warren another democrat with a reputation for being tough on wall street the massachusetts senator played a key role in the creation of the consumer financial protection bureau cfpb in the aftermath of the global financial crisis you know most people think of congress in terms of passing legislation and yeah that s part of the job she tells npr but the other part of the job is oversight that was in evidence when brown s committee this past week brought in the chief executives of the country s top six banks for questioning as part of an annual oversight during that hearing warren asked jamie dimon the chairman and ceo of jpmorgan chase about overdraft fees the bank charged its customers during the pandemic which she estimated at nearly 1 5 billion the heated exchange ended when warren asked dimon if he would volunteer to refund that money he declined warren is unapologetic about pushing banks to do more given their roles as critical institutions in society bank executives warren says have a responsibility to execute on making their banks part of the solution to our economic and racial problems across this nation but republican lawmakers disagree with that very premise they criticize executives for comments they have made about voting rights in particular and they are critical of companies making business decisions based on environmental considerations that ought to be left to elected lawmakers says sen pat toomey r penn the ranking republican on the senate banking committee bankers aren t naïve to the politics at play democrats have a small majority in the house of representatives and a razor thin majority in the senate and the midterm elections are less than two years away but even with a change in power in congress analysts warn banks are likely to face continued pressure from democrats and society on key aspects of their operations from whom they lend money to where they invest banks have no choice but to address these issues because it impacts their communities their customers and their employees says mike mayo a banking analyst at wells fargo securities you have to live in the real world and the real world has these issues as part of the banks businesses that message was made clear by waters a california lawmaker in a powerful position to influence banks as chair of the house financial services committee you know what i have discovered about the banking community is that they have had a way of operating traditionally historically and they don t change easily waters tells npr but waters adds she will still demand changes on wall street i think that many of them have come to understand that i can be dealt with but i cannot be tricked i cannot be fooled she says and i don t accept being undermined

in a matter of five days last week two workers at the tire factory of the argentine company fate died of covid 19 after the tire worker union sutna led by the partido obrero po workers party collaborated with management and the peronist government to keep the plant operating despite growing outbreaks víctor sotelo 42 passed away on tuesday and javier gimenez died on saturday both due to covid 19 workers immediately called attention to the sutna s responsibility with one writing on the union s facebook page gentlemen adopt different measures don t come looking for votes from your co workers they are risking their lives and those of their families i m greatly saddened by what happened to javier a great friend and co worker who passed away today from covid with hundreds more that have been infected at the fate pirelli and bridgestone plants where the sutna is present the pandemic has exploded the claims of the partido obrero and its pseudo left partners in the union leadership that they represent a combative left and even revolutionary alternative to the right wing peronist bureaucrats that dominate the argentine unions at the service of the multinationals and the argentine oligarch and owner of fate javier madanes quintanilla whose net worth was listed as 1 6 billion in 2018 the sutna and its pseudo left leaders used their radical phraseology as a tool to better suppress opposition among workers to keeping the factories during almost the entire pandemic this week beyond a minute of silence for giménez the union refused to even shut down the plant where there is clearly an ongoing outbreak just like the openly right wing unions the sutna not only failed to mention that gimenez died of covid 19 in its official statement but the union did not even report the death of sotelo who worked as a contractor for a third party while competing for the sutna leadership from the partido obrero even the union officials that belong to the morenoite partido de los trabajadores socialistas pts socialist workers party have joined the union s secretary general alejandro crespo a longtime partido obrero official in seeking to deflect blame from the union on saturday the pts members of the sutna steering committee victor ottoboni and enzo pozi along with the union delegate at fate hernán minguez wrote a piece reporting both deaths and indicating that giménez got infected inside the plant the position adopted by the national leadership of the sutna and the san fernando branch controlled by the black list was to guarantee production they wrote adding that the union does not place as its first priority protecting the lives and health of the families of its members and does everything possible to prevent disrupting production without providing any explanation the pts website la izquierda diario took down the article shortly after it was posted and uploaded a new version on sunday without the above cited passages or any mention of the active role of the union in herding workers into the plant instead the article complains of the lack of intervention by the union and its grave error in not convoking an assembly of members and a meeting of the steering committee this month a complaint that shamelessly seeks to provide an alibi for the pts and other forces on the steering committee after over a year of keeping the plant open the pts union officials cynically write that tires are not only nonessential but these companies have enough stock for months they add many co workers think that we should not be working instead of fighting for these demands of the rank and file however the pts officials ultimately propose another avenue that may ultimately be acceptable to the corporations a 15 day shutdown to disinfect the plant and test all workers only to send them back into the factories under the promise of vaccinations while mouthing slogans about workplace democracy and opposing the union bureaucracy the argentine pseudo left organized in the po and pts and their electoral alliance the so called left workers front fit have been thoroughly exposed by the pandemic constituting an instrument for preventing workers from freeing themselves from the shackles of the union bureaucracy and their pro corporate policies they have assumed a direct role in enforcing a policy of mass social murder while the sutna leadership seeks to pin the blame solely on the government the union s drive to reopen began last april 2020 even before the government lifted its brief and initial lockdown last year bowing to pressures by the corporate and financial oligarchy peronist president alberto fernández ordered the gradual reopening of workplaces starting on april 13 2020 while extending the official quarantine until april 26 ht sought to mask this homicidal policy by asking companies to demonstrate that they could guarantee the isolation and distancing among workers before re opening anticipating this the sutna leader alejandro crespo issued an open letter as early as april 3 2020 with a short protocol to re start the activity in conditions that will protect the health of all workers the measures did not go beyond those that were already proving to be fatally inadequate at workplaces all over the world the list included temperature screening distancing rules in the entrances workstations changing rooms and transportation frequent cleaning masking hand sanitizer sending workers home with symptoms and notifying workers about positive cases while knowingly endangering the lives of workers for profits the partido obrero repeatedly declared in its publications union and party activities that the sutna protocol provided an example for the safe reopening of other nonessential workplaces most recently of schools as the partido obrero wrote last august when the government was initiating its campaign to reopen schools the solution to this crisis is easily implemented and with effective results safety protocols in every workplace and activity just like the sutna comrades have been doing a few days earlier on august 5 a fate worker wrote on the union s facebook page that these measures are worthless more than 50 infected the only thing that can save us is to shut down the factory for a while whenever anger surged over infections however the sutna implemented one day hollywood strikes as a safety valve while isolating the tire workers from other sectors in argentina and internationally facing the same situation to no effect a mere 24 hour strike was even carried out when bridgestone fired two workers in january to intimidate growing opposition over the refusal of the company to even follow the existing protocols last august 14 with a euphemism worthy of management the partido obrero wrote that these partial strikes had achieved the isolation of more than 700 cases at the tire factories most recently on may 20 2021 the government decreed a new lockdown while classifying several manufacturing sectors as essential but not tire production this measure was not taken until daily cases and deaths in the country had already increased fivefold since march workers refused to work on friday may 21 only to be ordered by the union to return to work after a lightning hearing with pirelli bridgestone and fate along with government officials in a cynical statement dated may 23 after the government issued a special decree to include tire production as essential the sutna rushed to place the responsibility for future infections and deaths on the workers themselves in these complex times all tire co workers must keep acting with the greatest responsibility and compromise understanding that the worker organization is the one that has guaranteed and will continue to guarantee the safety purchasing power respect and interests of all workers in the tire union the sutna wrote this statement greatly angered the workers with several expressing on social media the need to shut down the plant and denouncing sutna for betraying them health is what matters now we must stay home there are infections every day at the factories it takes them a weekend to turn the tables against workers one wrote on the union s facebook page facing this growing opposition within the plant the sutna unwisely took a page from their fit comrades in the teachers unions who have been using the demand of priority vaccinations to enforce a homicidal return to school policy similarly the sutna posted a series of illustrations demanding vaccines for their members but workers were quick to identify this not only as an attempt by the union to deflect responsibility but also to divide the tire workers from workers in other sectors a fate worker anibal wrote even immunized we could still take the virus to our homes that already happened to a lot of us another commenter wrote truck delivery drivers like me are also essential and we are out on the streets every day without a vaccine and another added what is the difference with my husband who works in construction or my sons in law or those in the markets etc etc all of us workers are in the same situation workers need new forms of organization that will take it as given that the interests of workers are not compatible with those of management or the trade union bureaucracy and will oppose capitalist exploitation and its imperative of lining the pockets of the financial oligarchy these committees will not base their demands on what the corporations claim they can afford but on what is necessary to protect the lives and well being of the entire working class the international committee of the fourth international which publishes the world socialist web site has issued a call for an international workers alliance of rank and file committees iwa rfc such committees have already been established in auto plants and among amazon workers teachers bus drivers tea plantation workers and other sectors in the united states europe australia and sri lanka these committees are fighting to take the response to the pandemic out of the hands of the ruling class and its lackeys in the unions and into the hands of the working class on an explicitly scientific and international that is socialist basis we urge workers in argentina and internationally who agree with the necessity of this initiative to get involved today
washington johnson johnson is asking for supreme court review of a 2 billion verdict in favor of women who claim they developed ovarian cancer from using the company s talc products file in this image from video kenneth starr speaks during former president donaldtrump s impeachment trial in the senate at the capitol in washington january 27 2020 the case features an array of high profile attorneys some in unusual alliances including former independent counsel kenneth starr who is representing the women who sued johnson johnson the nation s largest business groups are backing the company and a justice s father also makes an appearance because of his long association with the trade group for cosmetics and personal care products the court could say as soon as tuesday whether it will get involved at the root johnson johnson argues that the company didn t get a fair shake in a trial in state court in missouri that resulted in an initial 4 7 billion verdict in favor of 22 women who used talc products and developed ovarian cancer state appeals court ruling a state appeals court cut more than half the money out of the verdict and eliminated two of the plaintiffs but otherwise upheld the outcome in a trial in which lawyers for both sides presented dueling expert testimony about whether the company s talc products contain asbestos and asbestos laced talc can cause ovarian cancer the jury found for the women on both points after which judge rex m burlison wrote that evidence at the trial showed particularly reprehensible conduct on the part of the defendants the evidence burlison wrote included that the company knew there was asbestos in products aimed at mothers and babies knew of the potential harm and misrepresented the safety of these products for decades nine of the women have died from ovarian cancer lawyers for the plaintiffs said johnson johnson denies that its talc products cause cancer and it called the verdict in the missouri trial at odds with decades of independent scientific evaluations confirming johnson s baby powder is safe is not contaminated by asbestos and does not cause cancer the company also is the maker of one of three covid 19 vaccines approved for use in the united states thousands of lawsuits over talc health concerns about talcum powders have prompted thousands of u s lawsuits by women who claim asbestos in the powder caused their cancer talc is a mineral similar in structure to asbestos which is known to cause cancer and they are sometimes obtained from the same mines the cosmetics industry in 1976 agreed to make sure its talc products do not contain detectable amounts of asbestos last year a u s government led analysis of 250 000 women found no strong evidence linking baby powder with ovarian cancer in the largest analysis to look at the question though the study s lead author called the results very ambiguous the findings were called overall reassuring in an editorial published with the study in january 2020 in the journal of the american medical association the study wasn t definitive but more conclusive research probably isn t feasible because a dwindling number of women use powder for personal hygiene the editorial said removing product from market a few months later the company announced it would stop selling its iconic talc based johnson s baby powder in the u s and canada citing declining demand driven by what it called misinformation about health concerns the disputed link between cancer and talc is not really a part of the high court case instead the company said it should have not been forced to defend itself in one trial against claims by women from 12 states differing backgrounds and with varying histories of using johnson johnson products containing talc file this april 25 2018 file photo shows attorney neal katyal speaking to members of the media outside the supreme court in washington the 1 6 billion in punitive damages is out of line and should be reduced the company also argued in a brief that was written by neal katyal a washington lawyer who aligns with progressive causes and also represents corporate clients katyal who was the acting top supreme court lawyer for a time in the obama administration declined an on the record interview the u s chamber of commerce and trade associations for manufacturers insurers and the pharmaceutical industry are among the business organizations backing johnson johnson s appeal tiger joyce president of the american tort reform association pointed to how long it took the trial judge to read the jury its instructions as an indication of how unfair the trial was to johnson johnson when a defendant is facing a case where it takes over five hours for the judge to read the instructions to the jury you just have to ask yourself what are we doing here said joyce whose group generally backs limits on liability lawsuits starr said in an interview with the associated press that none of johnson johnson s legal arguments is worth the court s time as the jury found and as every judge to review this six week trial record has concluded johnson johnson s conduct over decades was reprehensible starr said notable names in addition to starr other members of the women s legal team are former attorney general john ashcroft and washington lawyers david frederick and tom goldstein frequent advocates before the supreme court justice brett kavanaugh worked for starr when he investigated the affair between president bill clinton and monica lewinsky which led to clinton s impeachment another name that pops up in some documents in the case is e edward kavanaugh who was the longtime president of the cosmetic toiletry and fragrance association and is the justice s father kavanaugh s group fought efforts to list talc as a carcinogen or attach warning labels to talc products kavanaugh is retired and the group now is called the personal care products council ethicists contacted by ap said they haven t seen anything that would warrant the justice having to step aside from the case already one justice almost certainly won t take part justice samuel alito reported last year that he owned 15 000 to 50 000 in johnson johnson stock federal law prohibits judges from sitting on cases in which they have financial interest

president joe biden assumes significance the rest are only a reiteration of the usual subjects on the us agenda including china president biden s foreign policy priorities as adumbrated from the start of his presidency are china climate change us withdrawal from afghanistan despite a paltry face saver and reaffirmation of the trans atlantic alliance now the israel palestine standoff has got added due to the sudden outbreak of hostilities in the middle east mr blinken not even being in washington for much of mr jaishankar s stay in the us capital underscores the sudden importance of the mideast crisis they met literally on the last day of mr jaishankar s visit mr jaishankar in turn described his meeting with mr blinken as having further solidified our strategic partnership and enlarged our agenda of cooperation ignoring the usual hyperbole it s unclear how the agenda has enlarged when all the issues are old india has been cautious to prioritise keeping in mind the need not to provoke china while working with the us and its partners in the four nation quad and carefully balancing india s traditional ties with russia with closer us engagement mr jaishankar also met the defence secretary us trade representative and congressional leaders but there was no contact with either president biden who has been known to dropby when key ministers are at the white house to meet the nsa or indian origin vice president kamala devi harris with whom mr jaishankar has had differences during the trump presidency over india s handling of kashmir what then was the real purpose behind the visit as indeed its timing prime minister narendra modi and his government have been on the backfoot since the bjp s embarrassing defeat in west bengal and the covid 19 second wave which the government clearly did not foresee or simply ignored despite warnings to mr modi s consternation he has also lost face internationally damaging his carefully nursed post godhra image as a statesman the government seriously erred in resting its covid handling strategy on the premise that neither the kumbh mela nor the endless election rallies would exacerbate the lingering pandemic the vaccination strategy was tailored to this assumption with increased vaccine supply treble the current production capacity of the two indigenous manufacturers becoming available only after august the aim was to ratchet up the daily vaccination rate in the period september december to 10 million jabs a day to in theory vaccinate the entire 45 plus and bulk of the over 18 population before the uttar pradesh election in february next year this tendency to have even our health policy bend to electoral priorities rather than medical science has proven disastrous a c voter survey indicates that for the first time since the prime minister assumed office seven years ago those dissatisfied with his performance exceed those who are satisfied with pictures of overflowing cremation grounds and even bodies dumped in the ganga or buried along its banks and the international media carrying those pictures on their front pages the government s immediate need was twofold get an emergency supply of vaccines to bridge the gap till september and mend the prime minister s shattered image mr jaishankar began his visit to address these two issues in particular but instead of facing the editorial boards of major newspapers like the new york times and the washington post he chose the easier option of a calibrated chat at a thinktank to answer the critics of his government unlike someone like late pm atal behari vajpayee who would have allowed an urbane jaswant singh leeway to meet the media halfway to allay their concerns mr jaishankar simply dug in stubbornly he went on the offensive on the modi government being portrayed in a certain way in a tweet i asked if the minister understood whether this way was actually the media simply speaking truth to power which is their right if not their duty in a democracy the us state department released its 2020 report on religious freedom on may 12 as the bjp appointed administrator of lakshadweep was busy imposing the hindutva agenda on the muslim majority islands the minister may pummel the indian media all he wants but such actions bring international focus back on whether india under today s bjp any longer shares values with the us mr jaishankar s other agenda item was the emergency procurement of vaccines out of the 80 million doses the us promised to release for international use two hurdles are in the way one some astrazeneca stock is feared contaminated during production and thus needs an audit two the us may not divert the bulk to one nation to maintain equity and its image interestingly not a word was heard about the us pressing for a waiver at the world trade organisation on intellectual property in the coming days america s willingness to bail out india will be known global times the chinese government s english mouthpiece is taunting that mr jaishankar s us visit was just fanfare and blank checks the us will help but may extract greater alignment with its interests in the indo pacific against china on climate change and trade it may also force india to curtail its russian arms purchases especially the s 400 missile system the us would also want india to not rock the boat in afghanistan and meet pakistan halfway on kashmir meanwhile the us is silent on restoring the generalised system of preferences revoked by president trump thus the vaccines may come at a strategic cost as global hegemons don t run charities mr modi s image is another matter to recover which he needs more than aggressive wolf ministers he needs a reality check

washington johnson johnson is asking for supreme court review of a 2 billion verdict in favor of women who claim they developed ovarian cancer from using the company s talc products file in this image from video kenneth starr speaks during former president donaldtrump s impeachment trial in the senate at the capitol in washington january 27 2020 the case features an array of high profile attorneys some in unusual alliances including former independent counsel kenneth starr who is representing the women who sued johnson johnson the nation s largest business groups are backing the company and a justice s father also makes an appearance because of his long association with the trade group for cosmetics and personal care products the court could say as soon as tuesday whether it will get involved at the root johnson johnson argues that the company didn t get a fair shake in a trial in state court in missouri that resulted in an initial 4 7 billion verdict in favor of 22 women who used talc products and developed ovarian cancer state appeals court ruling a state appeals court cut more than half the money out of the verdict and eliminated two of the plaintiffs but otherwise upheld the outcome in a trial in which lawyers for both sides presented dueling expert testimony about whether the company s talc products contain asbestos and asbestos laced talc can cause ovarian cancer the jury found for the women on both points after which judge rex m burlison wrote that evidence at the trial showed particularly reprehensible conduct on the part of the defendants the evidence burlison wrote included that the company knew there was asbestos in products aimed at mothers and babies knew of the potential harm and misrepresented the safety of these products for decades nine of the women have died from ovarian cancer lawyers for the plaintiffs said johnson johnson denies that its talc products cause cancer and it called the verdict in the missouri trial at odds with decades of independent scientific evaluations confirming johnson s baby powder is safe is not contaminated by asbestos and does not cause cancer the company also is the maker of one of three covid 19 vaccines approved for use in the united states thousands of lawsuits over talc health concerns about talcum powders have prompted thousands of u s lawsuits by women who claim asbestos in the powder caused their cancer talc is a mineral similar in structure to asbestos which is known to cause cancer and they are sometimes obtained from the same mines the cosmetics industry in 1976 agreed to make sure its talc products do not contain detectable amounts of asbestos last year a u s government led analysis of 250 000 women found no strong evidence linking baby powder with ovarian cancer in the largest analysis to look at the question though the study s lead author called the results very ambiguous the findings were called overall reassuring in an editorial published with the study in january 2020 in the journal of the american medical association the study wasn t definitive but more conclusive research probably isn t feasible because a dwindling number of women use powder for personal hygiene the editorial said removing product from market a few months later the company announced it would stop selling its iconic talc based johnson s baby powder in the u s and canada citing declining demand driven by what it called misinformation about health concerns the disputed link between cancer and talc is not really a part of the high court case instead the company said it should have not been forced to defend itself in one trial against claims by women from 12 states differing backgrounds and with varying histories of using johnson johnson products containing talc file this april 25 2018 file photo shows attorney neal katyal speaking to members of the media outside the supreme court in washington the 1 6 billion in punitive damages is out of line and should be reduced the company also argued in a brief that was written by neal katyal a washington lawyer who aligns with progressive causes and also represents corporate clients katyal who was the acting top supreme court lawyer for a time in the obama administration declined an on the record interview the u s chamber of commerce and trade associations for manufacturers insurers and the pharmaceutical industry are among the business organizations backing johnson johnson s appeal tiger joyce president of the american tort reform association pointed to how long it took the trial judge to read the jury its instructions as an indication of how unfair the trial was to johnson johnson when a defendant is facing a case where it takes over five hours for the judge to read the instructions to the jury you just have to ask yourself what are we doing here said joyce whose group generally backs limits on liability lawsuits starr said in an interview with the associated press that none of johnson johnson s legal arguments is worth the court s time as the jury found and as every judge to review this six week trial record has concluded johnson johnson s conduct over decades was reprehensible starr said notable names in addition to starr other members of the women s legal team are former attorney general john ashcroft and washington lawyers david frederick and tom goldstein frequent advocates before the supreme court justice brett kavanaugh worked for starr when he investigated the affair between president bill clinton and monica lewinsky which led to clinton s impeachment another name that pops up in some documents in the case is e edward kavanaugh who was the longtime president of the cosmetic toiletry and fragrance association and is the justice s father kavanaugh s group fought efforts to list talc as a carcinogen or attach warning labels to talc products kavanaugh is retired and the group now is called the personal care products council ethicists contacted by ap said they haven t seen anything that would warrant the justice having to step aside from the case already one justice almost certainly won t take part justice samuel alito reported last year that he owned 15 000 to 50 000 in johnson

president joe biden must decide what share of doses should be given to the neediest countries and how many should be reserved for u s partners washington in april the biden administration announced plans to share millions of covid 19 vaccine doses with the world by the end of june five weeks later nations around the globe are still waiting with growing impatience to learn where the vaccines will go and how they will be distributed to president joe biden the doses represent a modern day arsenal of democracy serving as the ultimate carrot for america s partners abroad but also as a necessary tool for global health capable of saving millions of lives and returning a semblance of normalcy to friends and foes alike the central question for biden what share of doses should be provided to those who need it most and how many should be reserved for u s partners the answer so far at least appears to be that the administration will provide the bulk of the doses to covax the u n backed global vaccine sharing program meant to meet the needs of lower income countries while the percentage is not yet finalized it would mark a substantial and immediate boost to the lagging covax effort which to date has shared just 76 million doses with needy countries the biden administration is considering reserving about a fourth of the doses for the u s to dispense directly to individual nations of its choice the growing u s stockpile of covid 19 vaccines is seen not only as a testament to american ingenuity but also its global privilege more than 50 of americans have received at least one dose of the vaccine and more than 135 million are fully vaccinated helping bring the rate of cases and deaths in the u s to the lowest level since the earliest days of the pandemic scores of countries have requested doses from the united states but to date only mexico and canada have received a combined 4 5 million doses the u s also has announced plans to share enough shots with south korea to vaccinate its 550 000 troops who serve alongside american service members on the peninsula the broader u s sharing plan is still being finalized a white house official said having been the subject of policy debate inside the white house and across the federal government and also involving covax and other outside stakeholders like drug manufacturers and logistics experts our nation s going to be the arsenal of vaccines for the rest of the world biden said on may 17 when he announced the u s pledge to share more doses he added that compared to other countries like russia and china that have sought to leverage their domestically produced doses we will not use our vaccines to secure favors from other countries still the partnership with the south korean military points to the ability of the u s to use its vaccine stockpile to benefit some of its better off allies it was not clear whether south korea would pay for its doses from the u s most of the other doses were expected to be donated samantha power the new usaid administrator provided the first indication of the likely allocation last week in testimony on capitol hill she told the senate appropriations committee that 75 of the doses we share will likely be shared through covax twenty five percent of whatever our excess supply is that we are donating will be reserved to be able to deploy bilaterally administration officials cautioned that biden had not yet signed off on the precise split and that it could still change the white house official who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal plans said the administration would be working in coming days to synchronize its supplies with the global vaccine sharing organizations biden has committed to providing other nations with all 60 million domestically produced doses of the astrazeneca vaccine that vaccine has yet to be authorized for use in the u s but is widely approved around the world the u s produced doses will be available to ship as soon as they clear a safety review by the food and drug administration the president also has promised to share 20 million doses from existing production of pfizer moderna and johnson johnson vaccine stocks even more doses are expected to be made available to share in the months ahead as part of its purchase agreements with drug manufacturers the u s controlled the initial production by its domestic manufacturers pfizer and moderna are only now starting to export vaccines produced in the u s to overseas customers the u s has hundreds of millions more doses on order both of authorized and in development vaccines it s obviously challenging because so many countries face this need right now power said calling the decision of where to send doses an urgent question the decision she continued hinges on some combination of the relationship we have with the countries the public health and epidemiological scientific trajectory of the disease and a sense of where the vaccines can do the most good the infrastructure and readiness of countries to receive vaccines the u s under biden also has pledged 4 billion to covax led by gavi the vaccine alliance the coalition for epidemic preparedness innovations and the world health organization to help it procure and distribute vaccines covax has committed to sharing the doses with more than 90 countries including many with which the u s has tumultuous relations leaving it to covax to decide how the bulk of the u s provided doses are distributed is seen by the administration as the most equitable way to determine who benefits it also could allow the u s to avoid any political fallout that might come from sharing the vaccine directly with adversaries it s not only a symbol of american values it s smart global health policy said tom hart acting ceo of the one campaign which has pressed the biden administration to move faster to develop its global sharing plan an outbreak in north korea or iran or somewhere else where we might have tensions viruses travel no matter where they re flourishing and i don t want a variant cooking up in some remote part of the world anywhere in the world which then might get around the current vaccines that we ve got even if the bulk of the u s shared doses are distributed through covax power told senators it will be very clear where those doses are coming from people will be very clear that these are american doses coming as a result of american ingenuity and the generosity of the american people she added
in the serene woodlands of the northeastern united states the champlain lake valley meanders through the landscape dividing the adirondack and green mountain ranges as the champlain basin ends the hudson river valley begins passing through mountain ranges and into the atlantic ocean modern headlines and history books may neglect to mention but the forested mountains of this valley keep ancient and disturbing secrets this area is littered with mysterious stone structures like cairns balancing rocks and megalithic chambers century and a half year old news reports claim many large and abnormal skeletons were excavated here as well today many hunters and travelers have vanished in these forests under very strange circumstances skeptics understandably offer theories about glacial drifts colonial constructions and potential homicides or animal attacks however no comfortably conventional explanations stand up under the pressure of objective scrutiny the mainstream history of the valley the conventional historic narrative holds that this valley was first inhabited seasonally by archaic native americanswho hunted and migrated through the area this is believed to have occurred in the archaic period around 10 000 7 000 bc at this time lake champlain was part of a larger body of water a temporary inlet to the atlantic known today as the champlain sea the ice sheets from the last glacial period had depressed the landscape filling the st lawrence and ottawa river valleys along with the champlain and hudson river valleys with sea water lake champlain valley annacecchini cc by sa 4 0 as the glacial sheets retreated the climate warmed and the land gradually expanded a process known as isostatic rebound the waters of the atlantic receded leaving behind the series of lakes and river valleys then in the woodland period beginning around 1 000 bc native americans established villages and inhabited these valleys until they encountered european explorers these tribes include the abenaki sokoki pennacook peoples mohawk mohican iroquois and algonquin by the 17 th century ad these peoples formed alliances in a series of wars between english and french colonists this eventually lead to a rebellion by the native americans against the english who defeated disenfranchised and scattered them cairns early constructions cairns are piles of stone made by human beings across the neolithic world archaic people built stacks or heaps of stones for what seems to be a variety of reasons ranging from trail markers to battle memorials to ceremonial sites in 2020 a welsh historical group unearthed a string of cairns dating back to 4 500 bc believed to have been erected by the mysterious archaic culture known as the beaker people cairns can be elaborate structures such as here in county wicklow ireland joe king cc by sa 3 0 the archaeologists of the project speculate that these cairns marked a burial ground however while they have found some neolithic artifacts it seems to date they have not found any human remains believing they may simply be long gone due to their extreme age ancient highland tradition in the british isles carries that before a battle each warrior would place a stone on the pile then after the battle those who survived would remove their stones creating a shrine comprised of a stone for every soldier who perished hawaii and peru modern hawaiians still today create cairns which they call ahu according the school of hawaiian knowledge an ahuis an altar shrine or cairn utilized for spiritual and ceremonial purposes in both the past and the present usually and of varied forms these stone structures were constructed using hawaiian dry stack stone masonry techniques ahu are often the focal points of ceremonies horning hawaiian spirituality and ancestral spirits in peru near the colca canyon ancient cairns can be found known as apachetas apacheta translated from quechua means the source where the flow begins and they exist at high points along the mountain trail but the true value of apachetas was spiritual and the stones were used to commune with or appease a higher power present in the mountains the cairns were built up as more travelers passed the spot stones were gathered along the trail and then left on an apacheta as an offering to the deities an apacheta guidipat cc by sa 3 0 apachetas were believed to be charged with supernatural powers and transmitting a prayer through them was said to bring good fortune and otherworldly protection while on the path prayers were often directed toward pachamama the deity of the soil sky and underworld other belongings were often left behind as a sacrificial tribute including tobacco coca leaves shells sweet treats and even alcohol hundreds of apachetas were erected functioning as altars to guide people along the path and so that they too may win the blessings of the beings who inhabit these mountains cairns in north america refocusing the lens onto northeastern north america the indigenous archaic cultures of the arctic recognize very ancient cairns that they call inuksuit many of these stretch from greenland down into alaska northern canada and all the way down into america s great lakes region while the stone structures of these valleys are mostly unstudied there was some archaeological interest in these various stone workings in the 80s an alaskan inuksuk bernard spragg cc0 1 0 an article from the early sites bulletin of 1981 reports on the excavation of a stone cairn at master s lake ny it reads the structure was found to have a distinct teardrop shape four circular depressions were found beneath loose foliage the oval shaped pile was constructed of local field slabs between 24 36 inches 60 90cm in length primarily shist and weighing between 25 and 50 pounds 11 23kg the slabs were not randomly thrown together in an assorted pile as was frequently done in field clearance rather the slabs had been carefully placed one on top of the other to form a crude but somewhat effective support structure each stone was dependent upon one below for support movement of any slabs would results in partial collapse of the structure this building construction was repeatedly brought to the attention of the field teams during excavation pit depression x yielded the most intriguing items at a depth of 36 inches 90cm two round boulders were uncovered below a heavy concentration of roots from a nearby tree beneath these boulders team member mr pingotti uncovered a 10 inch 25cm layer of moist soil various chips of lithic material were found in the sifter the balancing stones in north salem new york along route 116 sits balanced rock this is a 180 ton 163 metric ton red granite boulder that is strangely perched atop five smaller conical stones bear rock another nearby structure has similar features balanced rock ny daniel case cc by sa 3 0 in kinnelon new jersey within the interestingly named pyramid mountain natural historic area there was a similar boulder atop a ridgeline balanced on three small stones according to bruce scofield in an article in neara journal 1983 this one known as tripod rock and was aligned with the summer solstice but one year after the survey was completed the site was sold and the boulder was moved with heavy machinery many have observed that these boulders balanced atop supporting stones is a recurring archaic culture phenomenon across the globe from korea to the british isles we find archaic structures called dolmens that reflect this very same design geologists such as steven schimmrich claim that the boulders are a natural occurrence they call a glacial erratic there certainly are natural processes whereby over millions of years a boulder can be transported by ice floats and find themselves precariously perched however this only explains some of the structures and it is unavoidable that the european eurasian dolmen and cairns were from a neolithic if not a paleolithic culture in other words it is unlikely that glacial forces would deposit so many perfectly balanced megaliths in close proximity to cairns and other neolithic sites when we know for certain in other areas of the world these dolmens and cairns were all archaic man made features a typical dolmen france jmathieupoirier adobe stock strange discoveries in the valleys as you may have read here before american news reports of the late nineteenth to early twentieth century were filled with strange accounts of abnormal ancient skeletons being unearthed some of these news reports place the findings directly within these same valleys that contain many of these rock structures for example in november 1901 in the minneapolis journal recounts that hunters from pennsylvania were in shohola s glen new york when they discovered a cave within the cave the report states that the hunters found the skeleton of a man of gigantic size it was swathed in rawhide trappings that kept it in a sitting posture near the skeleton were several bowls of reddish clay but almost as hard as flint a rude stone tablet was found near the skeleton s side covered with rude pictures of birds and beasts among them one of a monster half beast half reptile a number of implements were also found in the cave among them a huge ax made of stone and stone spear heads of unusual size this report is not alone there are many others like it and while modern historians are quick to dismiss this as fanciful yellow journalism it is again hard to imagine that such fictions would be conjured that correspond to sites we now believe to be linked to a mysterious archaic culture stranger than fiction as if these forested mountain valleys and their ancient secrets were not strange enough already there is more strangeness that carries on today in this very same region over the past century there is a very odd pattern of disappearances a string of disappearances in the 1940s occurred in a focused area near bennington vermont and the psychological impact of these events was so great that even now people refer to this area as the bennington triangle the bennington triangle is centered on the green mountain national forest vt rich moffitt cc by 2 0 as recent as november of 2015 two totally unrelated elderly men vanished without a trace in a truly bizarre circumstance a massive search and rescue operation was cut short in order to launch a second entirely new search only ten days apart both searches which involved some fifty organizations and some three hundred searchers came up utterly and completely empty they found absolutely nothing of either of these elderly men both of whom vanished within ten days and about forty miles of each other there are many other such incidents that seem to happen frequently in this area of course it is convenient to suspect that these are just unfortunate or ugly occurrences of people getting lost or being attacked by an animal or perhaps criminal mischief but the pattern stretches back decades even centuries and it remains constant people vanish in these woods too many unanswered questions in the champlain and hudson valleys just north of the new york metropolis ancient and disturbing mysteries are waiting for us to find them archaic cairns rock structures and balancing rocks are sprinkled throughout the highlands the only hard clues we have to these old forgotten secrets of the forests and the mountains in our own backyard the native americans place value and importance on names especially names given to places these names usually sum up the essence of a place the natives call these mountains the adirondacks which comes from the mohawk ha de ron da which means tree eaters according to french missionaries this was a derogatory reference to their primitive predecessors who did not grow crops and when the winters became brutally harsh would eat tree bark to survive beneath the earth in the adirondack green and shawangunk mountain forests there are archaeological and anthropological discoveries to be made but beware if you go there never go alone and always in the warm seasons top image some of the stone structures

no more mr hawk at the shadow rba cash rate should stay on hold for at least another year shadow board the lockdown in victoria serves as a potent reminder that covid 19 can affect the domestic economy unexpectedly at any time at least until a large proportion of the australian population is vaccinated the recent economic recovery has been gathering pace leading to favourable outcomes in the labour market in particular nonetheless there remains significant slack in the economy and cpi inflation equals a mere 1 1 year on year q1 of 2021 well below the rba s official target band of 2 3 the rba shadow board is convinced that the cash rate should remain at the historically low rate of 0 1 for at least another year it confidently expects that the cash rate will need to be higher than its current level in three years from now the most recent readings of the australian labour market surprised analysts yet again the official abs unemployment rate dropped from 5 6 in march to 5 5 in april however total employment unexpectedly declined by just over 30 000 while the labour force participation rate also dropped from 66 3 to 66 encouragingly the youth unemployment rate fell by another full percentage point for the third consecutive month to 10 6 the labour market will have to tighten considerably more before there is any major upward pressure on wages

who claim they developed ovarian cancer from using the company s talc products the case features an array of high profile attorneys some in unusual alliances including former independent counsel kenneth starr who is representing the women who sued johnson johnson the nation s largest business groups are backing the company and a justice s father also makes an appearance because of his long association with the trade group for cosmetics and personal care products the court could say as soon as tuesday whether it will get involved at the root johnson johnson argues that the company didn t get a fair shake in a trial in state court in missouri that resulted in an initial 4 7 billion verdict in favor of 22 women who used talc products and developed ovarian cancer a state appeals court cut more than half the money out of the verdict and eliminated two of the plaintiffs but otherwise upheld the outcome in a trial in which lawyers for both sides presented dueling expert testimony about whether the company s talc products contain asbestos and asbestos laced talc can cause ovarian cancer the jury found for the women on both points after which judge rex m burlison wrote that evidence at the trial showed particularly reprehensible conduct on the part of defendants the evidence burlison wrote included that the company knew there was asbestos in products aimed at mothers and babies knew of the potential harm and misrepresented the safety of these products for decades nine of the women have died from ovarian cancer lawyers for the plaintiffs said johnson johnson denies that its talc products cause cancer and it called the verdict in the missouri trial at odds with decades of independent scientific evaluations confirming johnson s baby powder is safe is not contaminated by asbestos and does not cause cancer the company also is the maker of one of three covid 19 vaccines approved for use in the united states health concerns about talcum powders have prompted thousands of u s lawsuits by women who claim asbestos in the powder caused their cancer talc is a mineral similar in structure to asbestos which is known to cause cancer and they are sometimes obtained from the same mines the cosmetics industry in 1976 agreed to make sure its talc products do not contain detectable amounts of asbestos last year a u s government led analysis of 250 000 women found no strong evidence linking baby powder with ovarian cancer in the largest analysis to look at the question though the study s lead author called the results very ambiguous the findings were called overall reassuring in an editorial published with the study in january 2020 in the journal of the american medical association the study wasn t definitive but more conclusive research probably isn t feasible because a dwindling number of women use powder for personal hygiene the editorial said a few months later the company announced it would stop selling its iconic talc based johnson s baby powder in the u s and canada citing declining demand driven by what it called misinformation about health concerns the disputed link between cancer and talc is not really a part of the high court case instead the company said it should have not been forced to defend itself in one trial against claims by women from 12 states differing backgrounds and with varying histories of using johnson johnson products containing talc the 1 6 billion in punitive damages is out of line and should be reduced the company also argued in a brief that was written by neal katyal a washington lawyer who aligns with progressive causes and also represents corporate clients katyal who was the acting top supreme court lawyer for a time in the obama administration declined an on the record interview the u s chamber of commerce and trade associations for manufacturers insurers and the pharmaceutical industry are among the business organizations backing johnson johnson s appeal tiger joyce

defendant is facing a case where it takes over five hours for the judge to read the jury instructions to the jury you just have to ask yourself what are we doing here said joyce whose group generally backs limits on liability lawsuits starr said in an interview with the associated press that none of johnson johnson s legal arguments is worth the court s time as the jury found and as every judge to review this six week trial record has concluded johnson johnson s conduct over decades was reprehensible starr said in addition to starr other members of the women s legal team are former attorney

board in september 2010 after serving as the vice president of business development for astrazeneca in london where he was responsible for developing corporate strategy and delivering external growth mr condomine s tenure as chairman of the nanobiotix supervisory board coincided with several significant milestones for the company including its listing on euronext paris in 2012 the 2014 launch of the first pivotal registration study for first in class radioenhancer nbtxr3 in soft tissue sarcoma market authorization in europe of nbtxr3 hensify for the treatment of soft tissue sarcoma in 2019 and listing on the nasdaq global select market in 2020 many thanks to the marvelous people committed to making a difference for humanity on the nanobiotix team said laurent condomine it has been a great pleasure to help guide this company that could potentially save many lives through a novel physics based approach when i joined the company over a decade ago we were in the early stages of transforming disruptive concepts into clinical applications and i am proud of the progress we have made in bringing our technology toward broad availability for patients around the world it was particularly rewarding to publish the interim results from the company s first pivotal registration study providing proof of concept for our science and the foundational support for european market approval in soft tissue sarcoma i am leaving nanobiotix as i believe it is good corporate practice to pass the baton of supervisory board chairmanship after 10 years however the team will always have a special place in my heart and i look forward to the company s ongoing success about nbtxr3 nbtxr3 is a novel potentially first in class oncology product composed of functionalized hafnium oxide nanoparticles that is administered via one time intratumoral injection and activated by radiotherapy the product candidate s physical mechanism of action moa is designed to induce significant tumor cell death in the injected tumor when activated by radiotherapy subsequently triggering adaptive immune response and long term anti cancer memory given the physical moa nanobiotix believes that nbtxr3 could be scalable across any solid tumor that can be treated with radiotherapy and across any therapeutic combination particularly immune checkpoint inhibitors nbtxr3 is being evaluated in locally advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma hnscc as the primary development pathway the company sponsored phase i dose escalation and dose expansion study has produced favorable safety data and early signs of efficacy and a phase iii global registrational study is planned to launch in 2021 in february 2020 the united states food and drug administration granted regulatory fast track designation for the investigation of nbtxr3 activated by radiation therapy with or without cetuximab for the treatment of patients with locally advanced hnscc who are not eligible for platinum based chemotherapy the same population being evaluated in the planned phase iii study nanobiotix has also prioritized an immuno oncology development program beginning with a company sponsored phase i clinical study evaluating nbtxr3 activated by radiotherapy in combination with anti pd 1 checkpoint inhibitors for patients with locoregional recurrent or recurrent metastatic hnscc and lung or liver metastases from any primary cancer eligible for anti pd 1 therapy given the company s focus areas and balanced against the scalable potential of nbtxr3 nanobiotix has engaged in a strategic collaboration strategy with world class partners to expand development of the product candidate in parallel with its priority development pathways pursuant to this strategy in 2019 nanobiotix entered into a broad comprehensive clinical research collaboration with the university of texas md anderson cancer center to sponsor several phase i and phase ii studies to evaluate nbtxr3 across tumor types and therapeutic combinations about nanobiotix nanobiotix is a late stage clinical biotechnology company pioneering disruptive physics based therapeutic approaches to revolutionize treatment outcomes

sign up for daily news updates from cleantechnica on email or follow us on google news by jeremy deaton by making it easier for people to migrate to the united states president biden could give a much needed boost to countries hard hit by climate change the united states has generated more heat trapping carbon pollution than any other nation but it has not felt the impact of climate change in equal measure poorer countries in warmer latitudes are enduring the most devastating droughts heat waves and violent storms and seeing more poverty disease and mass migration as a result by doing so much to fuel climate change the united states has incurred a massive debt to the developing world and there is no easy way to pay down the balance president biden is trying but in a country that is largely opposed to more foreign assistance he faces significant hurdles to ramping up aid he recently promised to spend 5 7 billion a year to help developing countries cope with climate change but that sum is far from sufficient as critics were quick to point out the white house however is also exploring other less direct means of providing relief among them a major change to immigration policy that could give a measurable boost to countries hard hit by climate disasters biden recently directed his national security adviser to study ways to resettle people displaced by climate change while democrats in congress introduced a bill that would create a pathway for climate migrants to make a new home in the united states such protections would not only benefit the migrants themselves but also the countries they left behind by relocating to wealthier countries in cooler regions migrants have the opportunity to make more money and to send a portion of their paycheck to family back home research shows that through remittances they can help people in developing countries better navigate the fallout from climate disasters for a 2018 study researchers at the university of ghana asked locals how they were using remittances to cope with climate change fishers facing diminishing fish stocks used remittances to buy new nets and repair canoes while growers coping with less predictable rainfall built water tanks and purchased fertilizer one man used the money his nephew sent him to buy a cell phone so he could get weather updates and know when to plant his crops another used money his son sent him to make small loans to cashew farmers allowing him to help local growers while turning a small profit the findings authors wrote should provoke a new global debate on climate refugees by making regular cash transfers climate migrants can provide relatives with a basic income allowing them to pay for food shelter and medical care even in the midst of a disaster or an economic downturn migrants can also directly fund projects to guard against climate change such as new wells to help farmers cope with droughts or levees to protect against floods a recent study from princeton university modeled future migration in a world with more open borders and a world with closed borders to compare the movement of people and the flow of remittances predictably they found that in a world with more open borders more people would migrate from africa asia central america and the pacific to europe and the united states to escape climate change the effect of the resulting remittances would be profound while climate change is expected to stunt gdp in developing countries allowing people to move more freely around the world would soften the blow the study determined that more open borders could boost gdp per capita in central america and southeast asia by more than 2 percent as migrants wire money home of course remittances are far from a perfect or even sufficient means of helping poorer countries cope with climate disasters so long as climate migrants are sending money home they will have to work harder to build wealth in their adoptive countries they will in effect continue to bear the burden of climate change but given that climate migration is inevitable and already underway remittances are just one more reason to allow people uprooted by disasters to immigrate to the united states by 2050 climate change could dislocate as many as 3 9 million people in mexico and central america in a new white paper on migration from central america experts from harvard law school yale law school and the university network for human rights call on lawmakers to create a temporary visa for people displaced by climate change and that visa could offer a pathway to a green card or citizenship biden could champion this model politically such a move would be difficult on few other issues are democrats and republicans more divided than on climate change and immigration republicans are highly skeptical to put it mildly of both making it easier for climate migrants to move to the united states would likely spark harsh republican opposition and in an era of negative partisanship democrats success in the 2022 midterm elections may depend less on mobilizing friendly voters than on not giving republicans a reason to head to the polls at the same time biden has promised to take a government wide approach to the climate crisis that means using every available lever of power to tackle the issue including updating immigration policy crucially by offering refuge to climate migrants he would be able to reassert u s leadership on a key issue a un panel ruled last year that countries cannot deport refugees who are facing immediate threats from climate change in their home country but the ruling is nonbinding and it s not clear who should be counted as a climate refugee the question is so thorny that currently no country offers formal protections to people displaced by climate change the united states could be the first creating a model for other wealthy nations to follow doing so would likely be administratively challenging and politically costly but it would also go some way to settling america s climate debt article courtesy of nexus media featured image immigrants becoming american citizens in a naturalization ceremony at the

some users speculate that airbnb selectively removes negative reviews to protect its top sellers credit airbnb my family visited hudson new york for a couple of days in march for the same reason everyone goes there it s a cool little town surrounded by the hudson valley and stocked with wonderful food crafts shops and people we used airbnb com to rent a place for our stay the rental was the only bad part of our visit garbage was piled in front of the driveway when we arrived the patio that looked quaint and cozy online was a mess and ringed with construction equipment the hot water didn t work a load of clothes was in the laundry machine the pedestal sink in the bathroom needed only a gentle nudge to tip over the ladder to the loft bedroom was too steep for kids and so on we decided to hang in there and not request a refund the host was a nice guy and when i told him about the hot water he called and walked me through a reboot of his system but my online review of his place which cited its good location its kind communicative host and its disappointments was mediocre it was the first poor rating i ve given to an airbnb host and i felt vaguely guilty about it my wife and i rationalised that away by agreeing that an honest review would help future travellers make better decisions besides most of the reviews of the hudson property were positive how much of a difference could ours make i forgot about the review until a few days ago when an airbnb resolution support ambassador emailed me out of the blue to inform me that my evaluation of the hudson rental violated its review policy and was taken down i looked at the review policy and nothing i wrote seemed like a transgression i said i didn t understand the decision and asked to have a supervisor look at it my support ambassador said no

the threat of climate change and warming oceans looms large over the world s coral reefs which are struggling to adapt to increasingly inhospitable waters scientists at the university of pennsylvania have demonstrated a new way we may be able to limit the damage by taking coral species that have already survived severe heat stress and transplanting them to degraded reefs to sow the seeds for restoration we are seeing a lot of focus from environmental scientists on how vulnerable corals can be made more resistant to heat stress some creative solutions include implanting them with helpful bacteria developing more durable species through an innovative technique known as directed evolution and feeding them probiotics to boost their chances of survival all of this is part of the effort to prevent the changes brought upon coral by abnormal sea temperatures which causes algae living in their tissues to become stressed and break free this leaves the coral without a key source of sustenance and causes them to turn white whither and in a lot of cases die off as seen in the bleaching events to plague australia s great barrier reef in recent years the solution being explored by the university of pennsylvania team focuses on coral that has already proved itself in the face of severe bleaching events the scientists combed hawaii s coral reefs which endured severe bleaching in 2015 in search of species that resisted the bleaching all together with the intention of studying how they respond to being placed in an entirely different environment the big thing that we were really interested in here was trying to experimentally test whether you an take a coral that seems to be resistant to climate change and use that as the seed stock to propagate and put out on a different reef that might be degraded says katie barott who led the research team the cool thing was we didn t see any differences in their bleaching response after this transplant this is similar to strategies being explored at the great barrier reef where we have seen underwater robots reseed damaged areas with larvae captured during unpredictable coral blooms or turbo charged larvae raised to have a higher thermal tolerance this new research is designed to inform these kinds of strategies by investigating whether transplanted coral collected from affected reefs can maintain their resilience after transplantation if you take a coral that is resistant to bleaching in its native habitat it could be that the stress of moving to a new place might make them lose that ability barott says factors like water flow rate access to food and nutrients and light could all impact whether or not transplanted corals are as resilient as they were in their original habitat to investigate these possibilities the scientists gathered heat resistant corals from two impacted reefs one with a higher flow of water farther from shore and one closer to shore with more stagnant waters the heat resistant corals were taken from one reef and transplanted to the other while some were also placed in tanks where the scientists simulated bleaching events the researchers tracked their health over six months after transplantation through metrics like photosynthesis rates metabolism calcification rates and the health of the algae and found that they retained their resistance to bleaching what was really novel is that we had this highly replicated experiment barott says and we saw no change in the coral s bleaching response one thing that the experiments did appear to impact was the corals reproduction rates the corals from the happy site the outer lagoon that had higher growth rates prior to the bleaching event generally seemed a little happier and their fitness was higher barott says that tells us that if you re going to have a coral nursery you should pick a site with good conditions because there seems to be some carryover benefit of spending time at a nicer site even after the corals are outplanted to a less happy site while the findings bode well for the idea of targeting vulnerable reefs for seeding strategies as is the case with other approaches to coral transplantation scaling these techniques up to address the broader problem isn t a viable solution i think techniques like this can buy us a little bit of time but there isn t a substitute for capping carbon emissions says barott we need global action on climate change because even bleaching resistant corals aren t going to survive forever if ocean warming keeps increasing as fast as it is today the research was published in the journal proceedings of the national academy of sciences source university of pennsylvania

wyoming mich memorial day is usually the first holiday where many people choose to set off fireworks yet many stores are reporting shortages as the summer begins prior to july 4th hundreds of customers purchased fireworks ahead of memorial day at the fireworks superstore on division avenue in wyoming owner greg johnson was one of the few stores that still had product on the 4th of july last year when other stores had sold out he typically keeps a two year supply in stock and he sold his two year s worth on or before the 4th last year in total about 70 of his stock had been purchased the high demand last year can be attributed to a few factors johnson says the cancellation of big shows prompted some to put on their own firework displays in their neighborhood or home and shipping is now taking twice as long from china where most fireworks are manufactured shipping is taking about 50 days rather than the previous 25 days from china the high demand led to a shortage last year and is again causing shortage problems for some stores in the grand rapids area and across the country johnson began purchasing his supply for this year about 12 months ago and took a proactive approach i told my wife that it s impossible for them to manufacture ship and get back into the country the amount of product that was sold so we just spent everything that we had and bought fireworks from july 4 last year all the way until now just to have enough said johnson johnson once again has a full stock but expects sales to ramp up in the next month or so already customers are purchasing for the 4th like father son duo tom and jaron buschert it is a great experience a great project a father son project to work on it s just fun for the whole family said jaron the family puts on displays for memorial day the fourth of july and labor day in their neighborhood they recommend shopping early to not only catch deals but to also beat the crowds before product sells out shop early find the deals in march april may don t wait until july to find stuff because that s when the deals start to slip off and you have to pay full price on everything so always shop early said jaron
as the united states further considers full federal legalization of marijuana and therefore cannabis based products canadian israeli biotech start up innocan pharma cse inno fse ip4 otcqb innpf prepares to enter the highly competitive american market as a new american administration settles in political and financial analysts await president joe biden s first major domestic policy initiatives while some on wall street are gearing up to deal with expected economic reforms there are many optimistic brokers shareholders and recreational traders eagerly awaiting ground breaking legalization of recreational marijuana and therefore thousands of cannabis based products for more than a decade there has been high consumer confidence that the american cannabis industry could entail significant economic growth in the long term now some innovative companies are exploring and internally adapting as the potential moment comes closer in the united states one of the largest high quality consumer bases in the world the ongoing process to finalize an increased status for cannabis has moved at a snail s pace due to the country s size and wide ranging diversity of opinion the american government has left most of the decisions regarding marijuana unlike most drug related classifications up to individual states while more liberal washington and oregon allow fully recreational marijuana and more conservative states like alabama and mississippi hold most cannabis related businesses to be criminal swings states like florida and virginia have embraced limited medicinal laws and are in limbo on if and how to move forward in the future in the midst of all of the excitement over potentially upcoming administrative announcements companies across the united states and beyond from start ups to fortune 500s are promptly preparing to fulfill prospective regulatory requirements one of these companies is canadian israeli biotech start up innocan pharma which specializes in combining cbds cannabinoids and other beneficial ingredients to produce pain relief healing and soothing products in 2018 innocan pharma was founded by a group of industry professionals including from some of israel s most successful pharmaceutical companies such as ceo iris bincovich ron mayron from teva international and yoram drucker from nasdaq listed pluristem psti and brainstorm bcli the company also holds research and commercial partnerships to develop cbd loaded smart delivery systems with two of israel s prestigious universities tel aviv university ramot lab and the hebrew university of jerusalem due to the warming climate regarding regulatory reforms in the american cannabis industry and the high potential for marijuana legalization innocan pharma has sought to acquire top tier members from the biotech world in order to compete with well known and connected global brands in addition the company has taken a rigorous scientific approach to its pain relief products since a survival of the fittest situation seems likely to unfold in the future market in april innocan added richard serbin former vice president of corporate development and fda counsel at johnson johnson to its scientific advisory committee serbin also served on the board of directors of johnson johnson s sixteen of the company s american and foreign subsidiaries a prominent advantage that distinguishes innocan from most of the new competitors adapting to a highly dynamic field within the european market innocan is also perfectly poised to benefit from this competitive trend to outperform existing competitors this expectation is due to the company s hybrid approach to developing cbd loaded pharmaceutical solutions as well as cosmetic therapeutics last month innocan signed a distribution agreement with the well established french pharmaceutical supplier polyflame europe meant to provide the young company a critical commercial edge prior to the company s entrance into the otc venture market this past month innocan shipped over 40 000 units of their relief go cbd spray earmarked for the north american market with the branding synony in addition to 35 000 units to portugal for distribution throughout europe with the branding shir over the preceding year innocan has strategically positioned itself to become open to public investment and is now listed on the canadian securities exchange cse inno frankfurt stock exchange fse ip4 and most recently the otc venture market otcqb innpf today given the contemporary american legal structure in place the cannabis industry is primarily defined by a profusion of smaller companies microcaps and penny stocks trading on non american exchanges though due to the currently defined regulatory structure in the united states any changes in policy could suddenly transform the market in the survival of the fittest in the united states only time will tell if the biden administration will take dramatic action to form revolutionary legislation regarding cannabis regulatory reform though with midterm elections coming up in 2022 an election which usually favors the opposition party the opportunity will disappear quickly as of today seventeen u s states including california new york michigan and other highly populated states have decided within their state constitutions to enact changes on cannabis though federal action would enlarge the number to fifty states with tens of millions of more prospective consumers while the american people continue to debate policy innovative companies like innocan pharma are acting by strengthening their teams with experienced pharma professionals and preparing for the future with a comprehensive commercialization strategy
tris rating affirms the company rating on cp all plc cpall and the ratings on its senior unsecured debentures at a with a stable outlook the ratings continue to reflect cpall s strong business fundamental supported by its proven record as the dominant operator of convenience stores in thailand the cash based nature of its business the strength of its nationwide store network and well established support facilities nevertheless the ratings are constrained by the company s elevated leverage the impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 covid 19 fallout which deteriorated domestic purchasing power as well as a slow pace of economic recovery key rating considerations significant drop in revenue following covid 19 cpall s operations have been impacted materially by the covid 19 pandemic the national lockdown and travel restriction measures during the first wave of outbreak and economic slump led to a significant drop in cpall s sales and volume of transactions cpall s operating revenue dropped by 4 3 year on year y o y to thb546 2 billion in 2020 and declined further by 8 5 y o y to thb133 3 billion in the first quarter of 2021 same store sales of 7 eleven stores declined sharply posting a contraction of 14 5 in 2020 and 17 1 in the first quarter of 2021 revenue of 7 eleven stores took a significant hit from the absence of foreign tourists and weak domestic purchasing power makro as a food wholesaler posted more favorable results than those of convenient stores despite the decrease in revenue from food service operators makro benefited from home cooking trends during the pandemic same store sales of makro edged up by 1 9 in 2020 before slipping slightly by 1 2 in the first quarter of 2021 for the remaining of 2021 we expect cpall s operations will continue to face challenges the new wave of infections which is more severe and hard to contain than the first and the second wave together with the slow pace of the country s vaccine rollout continues to cloud the prospects of tourism and economic recovery we expect the recovery to begin in late 2021 with the domestic economy approaching pre covid 19 levels in 2022 when a certain degree of public vaccinations has been administered with the easing of cross border travel restrictions as well as a return of social and economic normality nevertheless we believe the company s strategies to focus on omni channels together with new service offerings and the synergy from the recent acquisition should help the company sustain strong operating performance over the next few years deteriorated profit margin but gradual recovery expected cpall s operating profit weakened following the substantial drop in the number of customers and change in revenue mix earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization ebitda slipped by 7 1 y o y to thb48 6 billion in 2020 and plunged by 17 7 y o y to thb11 3 billion in the first quarter of 2021 ebitda margin was 8 9 in 2020 and 8 5 in the first quarter of 2021 down from 9 2 9 5 during 2017 2019 the drop in margin was due mainly to pricing and promotion strategies amid a sluggish economy together with a lower sales contribution from 7 eleven stores which yields higher margin than that of makro additionally the company has benefited less from economy of scale owing to lower sales volume apart from the decline in revenue cpall s profitability has been affected by a surge in interest burden from its recent acquisition cpall posted interest expenses and financial costs of thb2 9 billion in the first quarter of 2021 a thb1 billion surge from the same period of the previous year that resulted in a dive in net profit by 54 y o y to thb2 6 billion in the first quarter of 2021 our base case forecast projects cpall s ebitda margin to stay below 9 in 2021 following its strategies to drive sales volume we project ebitda margin to ramp up to the pre covid level of 9 3 9 5 in 2022 2023 cpall s ebitda is projected to be flat at thb48 7 billion in 2021 before climbing to thb55 thb60 billion in 2022 2023 however we expect minimal equity income and no dividend upstream from its newly acquired equity stakes in lotus over the next few years this is due to lotus s weakened operations affected by the pandemic as well as high transformation and rebranding expenses together with sizable interest burden from usd4 billion loan at the level of the acquiring company c p retail development co ltd cprd a surge in leverage from debt funded acquisition cpall s financial leverage has risen significantly following its recent debt funded acquisition adjusted debt was thb284 1 billion at the end of march 2021 compared with thb183 6 billion in 2019 the ratio of debt to capitalization ratio rose to 75 from 67 5 in 2019 while the adjusted debt to ebitda increased to 6 2 times from 3 5 times in 2019 going forward in the next three years we expect cpall s capital expenditures to be around thb18 thb21 billion per year including the expansion of 700 7 eleven stores and 6 8 makro branches per year domestically and overseas despite sizable capital expenditures lying ahead we expect cpall s leverage to improve gradually we project its debt to ebitda ratio to stay below 5 times in 2023 while the debt to capitalization ratio is projected to hover around 70 during the same period sufficient liquidity we assess cpall s liquidity to be at an adequate level over the next 12 months at the end of march 2021 cpall s had cash on hand of thb36 5 billion we forecast the company s funds from operations ffo to be around thb33 billion in 2021 we assess the company s cash on hand plus ffo is sufficient to cover scheduled debt repayments of approximately thb24 billion capital spending of around thb18 billion and dividend payments of thb8 billion additionally cpall has bridge loans outstanding of thb61 billion maturing in mid 2022 which the company intends to refinance by debentures issuance in june 2021 the financial covenant on cpall s debentures requires the company s net interest bearing debt to equity ratio excluding lease liability to remain below 2 times as of march 2021 cpall s net interest bearing debt to equity ratio was 1 6 times we expect the company will remain in compliance with this covenant over the forecast period base case assumptions cpall s operating revenue to edge up by 1 in 2021 and increase by 7 8 annually in 2022 2023 the adjusted ebitda margin to stay in the range of 8 9 9 5 in 2021 2023 total capital spending of around thb18 thb21 billion per year during 2021 2023 rating outlook the stable outlook reflects tris rating s expectation that cpall will sustain its leading position and competitive edge and continue to deliver sound financial results we expect its high cash balance and stable cash flow will provide financial strength to support its future expansion plans rating sensitivities cpall s ratings and or outlook could be revised upward should the company materially improve its capital structure and cash flow protection however the ratings and or outlook would be revised downward if the operating performance is weaker than expected or there are sizable debt funded investments which are expected to result in material weakening of capital structure and debt serviceability company overview cpall was established in 1988 by the charoen pokphand group

however that epithet echoes past decades of climate change global warming mitigation plans one after another all failures the world s continuing failure to come to grips with the dilemma led three notable climate scientists deeply involved at the highest levels to publicly ridicule past and future attempts to fix climate change in a blockbuster article entitled climate scientists concept of net zero is a dangerous trap the conversation april 22 2021 that article is a must read exposé of failed schemes that unintentionally hoodwink the general public and scientists and policymakers into believing in the merits of feel good proposals to save the planet but in reality the scientists expose these projects as foolhardy in part based upon their own personal experience in actually helping to formulate some of the proposals in the first instance it is a thought provoking article that cannot be dismissed as it essentially implies we re screwed unless global policymakers face up and react immediately they suggests foregoing the conceptual net zero by 2050 instead cut to the chase by cutting fossil fuels now as a follow up to the stirring article dr alison green of scientistswarning interviewed the authors may 8th 2021 the authors not pulling any punches take academia and international policymakers to the woodshed for decades of fairytale fixit schemes that always always always hold out hope great promise to save civilization from burning up in a self afflicted earthly hades but never deliver postage required the message behind the scathing article is simple straightforward enough is enough we re fooling ourselves and getting nowhere fast stop the madness get real here s how the authors see it collectively we three authors of this article must have spent more than 80 years thinking about climate change why has it taken us so long to speak out about the obvious dangers of the concept of net zero in our defence the premise of net zero is deceptively simple and we admit that it deceived us ibid a net zero search on goggle brings up 1 630 000 000 hits within 0 89 seconds and that s just for starters deferring to the authors we have arrived at the painful realisation that the idea of net zero has licensed a recklessly cavalier burn now pay later approach which has seen carbon emissions continue to soar it has also hastened the destruction of the natural world by increasing deforestation today and greatly increases the risk of further devastation in the future ibid their article goes on to describe steps towards net zero starting with james hansen as administrator of nasa s goddard institute for space studies june 1988 testimony to congress demonstrating how humans were warming earth s climate famously stating the greenhouse ghg effect has been detected then four years later at the 1992 earth summit in rio all nations pledged to stabilize ghgs and the 1997 kyoto summit re emphasized these goals but at the time when something very constructive should have could have been accomplished the parties failed subsequently fossil fuels never looked back zooming ahead in the face of nations of the world agreeing to stabilize ghgs but continuing to fail as follows the next approach was to link economic activity to climate change via integrated assessment models which became and remain to this day the principal guidance for climate policy implicitly implying that market based approaches work thereby removing any requirement for deep critical thinking this has been and according to the authors remains a huge mistake the next step to solving the problem was introduction of carbon capture and storage a feel good plan for policymakers but one that failed to address increasing levels of fossil fuel usage by the copenhagen 2009 summit it was clear that carbon capture and storage did not exist in the real world it was another big bust thereafter a new magic bullet bioenergy carbon capture and storage beccs became the new savior technology burning biomass instead of coal however beccs which is very much in favor today carries manifold issues including the insanity of burning trees that absorb store co2 if left alone according to the authors alas beccs just like all the previous solutions was too good to be true ibid the following information about beccs was not included in the relevant article but has been included herewith as beccs has become the rage especially in the eu which generates more energy from burning wood than from wind and solar combined biomass is now a 50b global industry the title of a recent article tells the story of beccs the green energy that might be ruining the planet politico march 26 2021 for example solar panels can produce 100 times as much power per acre as biomass ibid and here s another snippet in february more than 500 scientists and economists wrote to president joe biden and other leaders to warn that converting wood into power is a carbon disaster a forest destroyer and an absurdly inefficient way to generate energy trees are more valuable alive than dead ibid according to earth institute woody biomass power plants actually produce more global warming co2 than fossil fuel plants i e 65 more co2 per megawatt hour than modern coal plants and 285 more co2 than natural gas meanwhile canada and the u s deliver wood to europe like there s no tomorrow according to lsa university of colorado boulder wood accounts for 79 of biomass production and accounts for 3 2 of energy production wood dominates the worldwide biomass industry today 50 of eu renewable energy is based upon biomass and it is on the rise for example in the uk the drax group converted 4 of 6 coal generating units to biomass powering 12 of uk electricity for 4 million households the drax biomass plant has an enormous appetite for wood e g in less than two hours an entire freight train of wooden pellets goes up in smoke easily qualifying for ripley s believe it or not according to drax s pr department their operation has slashed co2 by over 80 since 2012 claiming to be the largest decarbonization project in europe source biomass energy green or dirty environment energy feature article jan 8 2020 however when scientists analyze drax s claims they do not hold up when wood pellets burn drax assumes the released carbon is recaptured instantly by new growth that is a fairy tale according to john sherman an expert on complex systems analysis at mit the carbon debt payback time for forests in the eastern us where drax s wood pellets originate compared to burning coal under the best case scenario when all harvested land regrows as a forest the wood pellet payback time is 44 to 104 years which is mindboggling thus prompts a query whoever did the research on biomass fire them study after study proves that burning coal instead of woody biomass reduces the impact of co2 atmospheric emissions coal is the clear winner but problematically coal has already been cast into no man s land as a horrific polluter therefore a massive complexity is at work as countries commit to using trees to meet carbon neutral status but the end results are appallingly diametrical to their own stated intentions and flat out wrong ccording to scientist bill moomaw co author of several ipcc reports and widely recognized as one of the world s leading experts on carbon sinks if we let some of our forests grow we could remove an additional 10 to 20 percent of what we emit every year instead we re paying subsidies to have people cut them down burning them in place of coal and counting it as zero carbon source europe s renewable energy policy is built on burning american trees vox mar 4 2019 dr moomaw led a group of 800 scientists that petitioned the eu parliament in jan 2018 to end its support for biomass nevertheless in june 2018 the eu commission voted to keep biomass listed as a renewable energy joined in their position by the support of the u s and britain is this conclusive proof that policymakers at their peril ignore science answer yes back to the original article for this story by 2015 with co2 emissions still skyrocketing paris 15 brought the world together to limit warming to 2 c hopefully 1 5 c vs pre industrial levels at the end of negotiations predictably worldwide media celebrated an alleged marvelous achievement by the nations of the world to limit global warming actually implying a halt to global warming full stop at 2 c oh please yet the bitter truth about paris 15 but dig a little deeper and you could find another emotion lurking within delegates on december 13 doubt we struggle to name any climate scientist who at that time thought the paris agreement was feasible we have since been told by some scientists that the paris agreement was of course important for climate justice but unworkable and a complete shock no one thought limiting to 1 5 c was possible rather than being able to limit warming to 1 5 c a senior academic involved in the ipcc concluded we were heading beyond 3 c by the end of this century ibid but at the conclusion of paris 15 policymakers and the world s media focused on a celebration with bright colored streamers and champagne popping and lots of backslapping continuing the false narrative that a fixit was orchestrated by the nations of the world by simply keeping temperatures below 2 c and maybe even 1 5 c it s that simple but getting there may be very complex accordingly atmospheric co2 emissions since 2015 399 89 ppm january 2015 versus 419 05 ppm april 2021 and increasing at twice the rate of the last century which makes paris 15 a laughing stock furthermore the three author scientists discount all of the current proposals on the table like direct air capture beccs and solar radiation management to control and reduce the impact of global warming the problems come when it is assumed that these can be deployed at vast scale this effectively serves as a blank cheque for the continued burning of fossil fuels and the acceleration of habitat destruction ibid rather than acknowledge the seriousness of our situation we instead continue to participate in the fantasy of net zero what will we do when reality bites the time has come to voice our fears and be honest with wider society current net zero policies will not keep warming to within 1 5 c because they were never intended to they were and still are driven by a need to protect business as usual not the climate if we want to keep people safe then large and sustained cuts to carbon emissions need to happen now that is the very simple acid test that must be applied to all climate policies the time for wishful thinking is over source climate scientists

almost 5 000 kilometres long the paraná is one of the longest lowland rivers in the world yet it has less and less water prompting uncertainty among experts as to the causes of a phenomenon that hampers many of the river s biological and commercial functions lower rainfall in the region has impacted the river s flow which has dropped to less than half of historical averages this affects its navigability and concerns agribusiness since a large part of grain crop harvests from argentina southern brazil and paraguay are exported via the ports of santa fe in northeast argentina the low water level considered the most severe in 50 years cost exporters us 244 million in 2020 as vessels were unable to operate or load normally according to the rosario stock exchange this has meant argentine exporters are failing to capitalise on high global prices for agricultural commodities there is no certainty as to whether this water scarcity is temporary or marks the beginning of a new cycle of low water as was witnessed last century nor is there unanimity about the causes although experts have variously pointed to deforestation damming in southern brazil and climate change to complicate the situation further the reduced river flow coincides with the end of a concession for dredging and signalling processes necessary for its navigability belgian company jan de nul had the concession for 25 years and will now compete to retain it paraná new river or historical cycle the paraná is much more than its main channel it is a river system with a vast network of secondary channels valleys and floodplains that are modified by the pulses of floods and low flows typical of this ecosystem it is a giant whose extensive basin covers 2 6 million square kilometres as much as the surface area of continental argentina said carlos ramonell a geologist specialising in the evolution of the fluvial landscape at the universidad nacional del litoral 17 000 cubic metres of water usually flow down the upper reaches of the paraná every second its characteristic brown colour is due to the sediment it carries from the rivers of northwestern argentina such as the bermejo in addition to transporting these solids an impressive 17 000 cubic metres of water flow per second mainly via the upper reaches of the basin located in brazil and also the paraguay river it was this flow of rainwater from the upper paraná and the paraguay that ceased in the southern hemisphere s spring of 2019 due to unusually low rainfall ramonell explained however ramonell said that records for the 20th century show significant variation while between 1930 and 1970 there was a period of markedly lower flow from 1970 to 2000 they remained high climate change ramonell says generates more doubt than certainty about the reasons for the reduced levels it is an exaggeration to link this drop to anthropogenic climate change i think that this could displace other issues that do have a superlative impact on the river system such as deforestation canalisation and dams he added however juan borus a researcher at the national water institute says that the causes are of a clearly climatic order the rainfall pattern began to alter in mid 2019 and periods of scarce precipitation have become more frequent ever since he said the end of the drought and low water is not yet in sight it is likely that the la niña will return later and we know that this does not favour the production of near normal rainfall in our region let alone that the rainfall will be significant enough to produce a noticeable recovery borus says low water and trade in the paraná the lower flow of water in the paraná affects navigation makes port manoeuvres more difficult and reduces the loading capacity of large ships translating into higher costs gustavo idígoras president of the argentine oilseed industry chamber ciara said he was very concerned about the low water level adding it has negative effects on navigability which causes delays ships get stuck and there are stoppages idígoras said some 4 500 large ships enter and leave the paraná every year taking out most of argentina s agricultural production the low flow puts the flow of exports at risk he said the energy and other sectors are also affected 70 of the compressed natural gas imported by argentina comes through the waterway the automotive and steel industries also rely on it 70 of the natural gas argentina imports travels down the waterway ciara is aware that a new climate scenario could affect how it does business we see that there are cycles of drought returning with great force in south america this is going to affect the region and works have to meet these needs while protecting environmental aspects we stress the need for more in depth and detailed studies idígoras said alfredo sesé an analyst at the rosario stock exchange said that the low flows make it necessary to be more careful when loading generating logistical cost overruns that are difficult to quantify the low flows also affect land locked south american countries paraguay and bolivia for whom the paraná is the main channel for commercial river transit commercial navigation is at its most intense during the harvest peak s of the southern hemisphere s autumn ships and barges require the greatest possible depths as well as a generous channel width for safe navigation an export fluvial highway amid these challenges argentina is discussing a new concession for the management of the waterway the commercial name given to the paraná of its total length from the source in brazil to its mouth in the rio de la plata 3 500km of the paraná s river are managed waterways the concession covers a 1 300 km stretch this part consists of a port hub made up of some 25 terminals

in april the biden administration announced plans to share millions of covid 19 vaccine doses with the world by the end of june five weeks later nations around the globe are still waiting to learn where the vaccines will go and how they will be distributed it s obviously challenging because so many countries face this need right now to president joe biden the doses are not only the ultimate carrot for america s partners abroad but also a necessary tool for global health capable of saving millions of lives and returning a semblance of normalcy to friends and foes alike the question is what share of doses should be provided to those who need it most and how many should be reserved for us partners so far the answer appears to be that the administration will provide the bulk of the doses to covax the un backed global vaccine sharing programme meant to meet the needs of lower income countries while the percentage is not yet finalised it would mark a substantial and immediate boost to the lagging covax effort which to date has shared only 76 million doses with needy countries the biden administration is considering reserving about a fourth of the doses for the us to dispense directly to individual nations of its choice the growing us stockpile of covid 19 vaccines is seen not only as a testament to american ingenuity but also its global privilege more than 50 per cent of americans have received at least one dose of the vaccine and more than 135 million are fully vaccinated helping to bring the rate of cases and deaths in the us to the lowest level since the earliest days of the pandemic scores of countries have requested doses from the us but to date only mexico and canada have received a combined 4 5 million doses the us also plans to share enough doses with south korea to vaccinate its 550 000 troops who serve alongside american service members on the peninsula the broader us sharing plan is still being finalised a white house official said having been the subject of policy debate inside the white house and across the federal government and also involving covax and other outside stakeholders such as drug manufacturers and logistics experts our nation s going to be the arsenal of vaccines for the rest of the world mr biden said on may 17 when he announced the us pledge to share more doses he added that compared to other countries like russia and china that have sought to leverage their domestically produced doses we will not use our vaccines to secure favours from other countries an employee looks at the installation the spirits of the pumpkins descended into the heavens by yayoi kusama in berlin germany the exhibition is temporarily closed to the general public due to increased coronavirus restrictions getty images still the partnership with the south korean military points to the ability of the us to use its vaccine stockpile to benefit some of its better off allies it was not clear whether south korea would pay for its doses from the us most of the other doses were expected to be donated covax boost samantha power the new usaid administrator provided the first indication of the likely allocation last week in testimony to the senate she told the senate appropriations committee that 75 per cent of the doses we share will likely be shared through covax twenty five per cent of whatever our excess supply is that we are donating will be reserved to be able to deploy bilaterally administration officials cautioned that mr biden had not yet signed off on the precise split and that it could still change one said the administration would be working in coming days to synchronise its supplies with the global vaccine sharing organisations mr biden has committed to providing other nations with all 60 million domestically produced doses of the astrazeneca vaccine that vaccine has yet to be authorised for use in the us but is widely approved around the world the us produced doses will be available to ship as soon as they clear a safety review by the food and drug administration the president has also promised to share 20 million doses from existing production of pfizer moderna and johnson johnson vaccine stocks even more doses are expected to be made available to share in the months ahead as part of its purchase agreements with drug manufacturers the us controlled the initial production by its domestic manufacturers pfizer and moderna are only now starting to export vaccines produced in the us to overseas customers the us has hundreds of millions more doses on order both of authorised and in development vaccines it s obviously challenging because so many countries face this need right now ms power said calling the decision of where to send doses an urgent question she said it hinged on a combination of the relationship we have with the countries the public health and epidemiological scientific trajectory of the disease and a sense of where the vaccines can do the most good the infrastructure and readiness of countries to receive vaccines the us has pledged 4 billion to covax to help it procure and distribute vaccines covax has committed to sharing the doses with more than 90 countries including many with which the us has tumultuous relations leaving it to covax to decide how the bulk of the us provided doses are distributed is seen by the administration as the most equitable way to determine who will benefit that could allow the us to avoid any political fallout that might come from sharing the vaccine directly with adversaries it s not only a symbol of american values it s smart global health policy said tom hart acting ceo of the one campaign which has pressed the biden administration to move faster to develop its global sharing plan i don t want a variant cooking up in some remote part of the world anywhere in the world which then might get around the current vaccines that we ve got globally more than 3 5 million people are confirmed to have died from the coronavirus the us has seen the largest confirmed loss of life from covid 19 with more than 594 000 deaths

washington in april the biden administration announced plans to share millions of covid 19 vaccine doses with the world by the end of june five weeks later nations around the globe are still waiting with growing impatience to learn where the vaccines will go and how they will be distributed to president joe biden the doses represent a modern day arsenal of democracy serving as the ultimate carrot for america s partners abroad but also as a necessary tool for global health capable of saving millions of lives and returning a semblance of normalcy to friends and foes alike the central question for biden what share of doses should be provided to those who need it most and how many should be reserved for us partners the answer so far at least appears to be that the administration will provide the bulk of the doses to covax the un backed global vaccine sharing program meant to meet the needs of lower income countries while the percentage is not yet finalised it would mark a substantial and immediate boost to the lagging covax effort which to date has shared just 76 million doses with needy countries the biden administration is considering reserving about a fourth of the doses for the us to dispense directly to individual nations of its choice the growing us stockpile of covid 19 vaccines is seen not only as a testament to american ingenuity but also its global privilege more than 50 per cent of americans have received at least one dose of the vaccine and more than 135 million are fully vaccinated helping bring the rate of cases and deaths in the us to the lowest level since the earliest days of the pandemic scores of countries have requested doses from the united states but to date only mexico and canada have received a combined 4 5 million doses the us also has announced plans to share enough shots with south korea to vaccinate its 550 000 troops who serve alongside american service members on the peninsula the broader us sharing plan is still being finalised a white house official said having been the subject of policy debate inside the white house and across the federal government and also involving covax and other outside stakeholders like drug manufacturers and logistics experts our nation s going to be the arsenal of vaccines for the rest of the world biden said on may 17 when he announced the us pledge to share more doses he added that compared to other countries like russia and china that have sought to leverage their domestically produced doses we will not use our vaccines to secure favours from other countries still the partnership with the south korean military points to the ability of the us to use its vaccine stockpile to benefit some of its better off allies it was not clear whether south korea would pay for its doses from the us most of the other doses were expected to be donated samantha power the new usaid administrator provided the first indication of the likely allocation last week in testimony on capitol hill she told the senate appropriations committee that 75 per cent of the doses we share will likely be shared through covax twenty five per cent of whatever our excess supply is that we are donating will be reserved to be able to deploy bilaterally administration officials cautioned that biden had not yet signed off on the precise split and that it could still change the white house official who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal plans said the administration would be working in coming days to synchronise its supplies with the global vaccine sharing organisations biden has committed to providing other nations with all 60 million domestically produced doses of the astrazeneca vaccine that vaccine has yet to be authorised for use in the us but is widely approved around the world the us produced doses will be available to ship as soon as they clear a safety review by the food and drug administration the president also has promised to share 20 million doses from existing production of pfizer moderna and johnson johnson vaccine stocks even more doses are expected to be made available to share in the months ahead as part of its purchase agreements with drug manufacturers the us controlled the initial production by its domestic manufacturers pfizer and moderna are only now starting to export vaccines produced in the us to overseas customers the us has hundreds of millions more doses on order both of authorised and in development vaccines it s obviously challenging because so many countries face this need right now power said calling the decision of where to send doses an urgent question the decision she continued hinges on some combination of the relationship we have with the countries the public health and epidemiological scientific trajectory of the disease and a sense of where the vaccines can do the most good the infrastructure and readiness of countries to receive vaccines the us under biden also has pledged us 4 billion to covax led by gavi the vaccine alliance the coalition for epidemic preparedness innovations and the world health organization who to help it procure and distribute vaccines covax has committed to sharing the doses with more than 90 countries including many with which the us has tumultuous relations leaving it to covax to decide how the bulk of the us provided doses are distributed is seen by the administration as the most equitable way to determine who benefits it also could allow the us to avoid any political fallout that might come from sharing the vaccine directly with adversaries it s not only a symbol of american values it s smart global health policy said tom hart acting ceo of the one campaign which has pressed the biden administration to move faster to develop its global sharing plan an outbreak in north korea or iran or somewhere else where we might have tensions viruses travel no matter where they re flourishing and i don t want a variant cooking up in some remote part of the world anywhere in the world which then might get around the current vaccines that we ve got even if the bulk of the us shared doses are distributed through covax power told senators it will be very clear where those doses are coming from people will be very clear that these are american doses coming as a result of american ingenuity and the generosity of the american people she added globally more than 3 5 million people are confirmed to have died from the coronavirus the us has seen the largest confirmed loss of life from covid 19 at more than 594 000 people download our app or subscribe to our
