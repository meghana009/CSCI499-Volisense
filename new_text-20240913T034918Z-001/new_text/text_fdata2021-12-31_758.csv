menafn asia times amazon s stock rose 6 5 during 2021 while its closest chinese equivalent alibaba lost nearly half its market capitalization so why is alibaba investing more in its business than amazon the american retailing and computing behemoth is worth more than five times its chinese competitor but by 2022 alibaba will invest about 60 more than amazon according to the consensus of securities analysts polled by bloomberg in fact alibaba s capex is expected to double between 2018 and 2022 and tencent china s other computing giant is expected to nearly triple its capital spending the analyst forecast for capex among the msci china tech top 100 companies shows a jump from 10 billion to 70 billion between 2020 and 2022 most of this will be financed from internal resources according to analyst forecasts despite its aggressive capital investment program alibaba is expected to maintain strongly positive free cash flow amazon now trades at 60 times forward earnings as compared with 13 times for alibaba evidently alibaba s management view of the company s prospects differs from that of equity investors who fled the company s stock after chinese regulators cracked down on ant financial the alibaba s payments and consumer credit arm and imposed stiff fines for monopoly practices the regulatory rampage against chinese tech companies will abate during 2022 in the view of most of the major brokerage houses and investors will return to undervalued chinese tech stocks the combination of strong prospective growth and low valuations makes china s tech sector one of wall street strategists top recommendations for 2022 that s a rational argument the chinese communist party s single minded focus on high productivity manufacturing and services driven by artificial intelligence can t succeed without the country s biggest pools of computational talent at tech leaders like tencent baidu jd com and alibaba some well informed observers of the politics of china s state council argued that the regulatory reign of terror would ease after president xi jinping was confirmed for a third term but it isn t so simple alibaba s stock took a glancing blow last week when the ministry of industry and information technology suspended information sharing with the company after alibaba failed to disclose risks arising from the apache log4j bug a global concern in the cybersphere tension with the united states heightens chinese concern about network and data security reflected in the crackdown on the ride hailing app didi in june 2021 just after it floated an ipo in new york beijing s regulators claimed that didi had failed to comply with data privacy and national security laws the company s stock traded on dec 30 at 5 25 less than a third of its ipo price of 16 sanctions on chinese companies by us regulators have also dragged down the share prices of chinese tech companies although their impact is likely to be temporary the chinese artificial intelligence unicorn sensetime had planned an ipo in new york in early december but the us treasury put the firm on a blacklist of chinese military industrial complex companies alleging that its face recognition software could be used to identify members of china s uighur minority it took sensetime two weeks to move its ipo to hong kong where its stock jumped 23 above the ipo price in initial trading tougher regulation for tech companies has an economic rationale in both countries as i explained in a 2021 essay for american affairs the flourishing of america s information technology industry hasn t done much for the productivity of the rest of the economy there are strong arguments that the american tech giants suppress innovation and entrepreneurship more than they promote it abuses are frequent among tech companies that have achieved what economists call natural monopolies in the case of ant financial whose projected record breaking ipo was scuttled by chinese regulators in november 2020 the chinese government made a credible case that the company used high tech razzle dazzle to disguise excessive leverage and exorbitant fees as noted there is also a national security dimension any firm whose it systems reach into the tendrils of the economy represents a potential weak point in a cyberwar and there is a political dimension the participation of 100 billionaires at the 2020 national people s congress rankles a supposedly egalitarian society in which most citizens have only obtained a bare minimum of prosperity xi jinping s watchword common prosperity opens the possibility of populist attacks on china s ultra rich jaws dropped when so many billionaires turned up as delegates to the national people s congress photo xinhua china has very good reasons to restore the chastened tech sector to the good graces of the market as the wall street consensus forecasts but we may not have seen the end of regulatory shocks to the market but managements of china s high tech companies don t appear worried about the short term behavior of their stock prices the global market for e commerce will grow by between 1 and 2 trillion between now and 2025 and alibaba which delivers to 190 countries is investing in automated warehouses and smart logistics to outperform amazon its main global competitor china is ahead of the united states in automating ports and warehouses a precondition for fast global delivery despite the mishap with the ministry of industry and information technology over the apache bug alibaba like baidu and tencent counts on cloud computing as a growing source of revenue alibaba s cloud division earned its first profit in the fourth quarter of 2020 it is still number in the world cloud market behind amazon and microsoft but its home advantage in the growing chinese market should support growth along with competitors like huawei and tencent like 5g broadband cloud computing provides infrastructure that enables small businesses to get big quickly rather than investing in proprietary it departments with steep startup costs cloud services allow growing companies to pay for the computer services they need at any point in time the productivity turnaround that china s state council wants to promote can t occur without the infrastructure created by its own big tech there is an american precedent for alibaba s wilting stock price under regulatory stress in 1999 and 2000 the us justice department tried to break up microsoft the software giant ultimately settled the case but the incident so rattled investor confidence that msft did not regain its 1999 peak stock price until 2015 between 2015 and the present the stock price quintupled china s regulators lack the ideological fervor and the scorched earth approach of the clinton administration s justice department and the regulatory actions they have taken against alibaba and its peers are far less severe nonetheless the pattern of investor panic in the face of a government crackdown followed by recovery is likely to repeat itself but in compressed time follow david p goldman on twitter davidpgoldman
global stock markets reversed gains after a day long rally on thursday even as fresh u s economic data indicated that a recent uptick of omicron covid 19 variant related infections has not yet led to a surge in layoffs a positive sign for the economy thin trading volumes which led to a dip in oil and a climb in the dollar have outweighed earlier investor sentiment that high vaccination rates and signs of milder symptoms caused by the variant mean the economy will avoid a repeat of the disruption seen at the start of the pandemic msci s gauge of stocks across the globe shed 0 15 while the pan european stoxx 600 index rose 0 15 on wall street the dow jones industrial average fell 0 25 while the s p 500 lost 0 30 the nasdaq composite dropped 0 16 despite concerns investors cheered a u s labor department report that the number of americans filing for new unemployment claims dropped to a seasonally adjusted 198 000 in the week leading up to christmas from a revised 206 000 a week earlier economists polled by reuters had forecast weekly applications would rise to 208 000 the fact that nonseasonally adjusted claims were unchanged at a time when they typically tend to deteriorate suggests that there has been no impact from omicron as of yet economists thomas simons and aneta markowska at jefferies wrote there was also relief in asia where south korea s 5 1 industrial output surge may indicate some easing of supply chain problems chinese shares got a nearly 1 lift from beijing signaling lower interest rates in 2022 though they are set to end 2021 down 5 5 japanese shares in their last trading day of the year slipped 0 4 for a 4 9 annual gain but short of a three decade top reached in september shares in semiconductor superpower taiwan ended with a 24 annual jump however oil prices have traded mixed only to close lower even amid demand growth concerns and news that china had cut its first batch of 2022 crude oil import quotas by 11 in a sign it would act against small inefficient refineries u s crude recently fell 0 13 to 76 46 per barrel brent which has climbed more than 50 this year landed at 79 30 up 0 09 on the day markets are concerned about persistent inflation and a resulting hawkish turn by the u s federal reserve as investors start to price in a first rate hike as early as march we have these headwinds from the pandemic we had headwinds from energy prices and sky high inflation rates but there is a fair chance that many of these factors if not all of these factors will ease in q1 next year said jussi hiljanen strategist at seb but for a few months to come it will be very volatile and markets will be tested two year u s treasury yields have shot up 55 basis points since september to stand at 0 75 near the highest since march last year however reflecting expectations of a relatively short and shallow rate rise cycle 10 year yields have reacted far less last rising 11 32 in price to yield 1 5065 the dollar ticked up against a basket of rival currencies in holiday thinned trading the greenback which is set for a second month of gains rose 0 159 bouncing off a three week low touched on wednesday when it was hit by the risk appetite revival the euro gained 0 02 to 1 1325 the yen has run into broad year end selling over the past week with the dollar reaching its highest since mid november at 115 2 yen the front end of the u s rates market is pricing more rate hikes back into the curve now so fx may be a battle once again between optimism about the global recovery and expectations about the fed said kit juckes a strategist at societe generale reporting by katanga johnson in washington additional reporting by sujata rao karin strohecker and julien ponthus in london stefano rebaudo in milan and wayne cole in sydney editing by hugh lawson carmel crimmins and dan grebler

kakani told scroll in in delhi the state health minister satyendar jain said 54 of covid 19 samples sequenced in delhi had omicron these included samples taken from international travellers as well as local residents who had no travel history jain said due to the surge in new cases the government had issued instructions to all hospitals to keep stock of medicines ready for the next three months both the cities have seen an explosion in covid 19 cases recently with daily cases growing 20 fold in delhi and 10 fold in mumbai in the past fortnight mumbai on thursday recorded 3 671 cases up from 2 510 on wednesday the daily test positivity rate or the number of positive cases per 100 samples tested has reached 7 9 in mumbai indicating widespread transmission in the community delhi on thursday recorded 1 313 covid cases on thursday up from 923 recorded on wednesday the growth in cases in both cities is faster than seen in previous waves of the pandemic experts say the rest of india is likely to soon follow these trends also read in charts covid 19 cases surge across four metro cities growing faster than previous waves community spread beyond the sequencing done by mumbai s civic body surveillance done by maharashtra s state epidemiology department too has found evidence of omicron s presence in the community thirty eight of 382 samples taken from residents in pune and mumbai between december 21 to 25 were found to have an omicron infection shows data from the indian institute of science education and research which sequenced the samples separately omicron has been detected in roughly 25 of 645 samples of international travellers and their close contacts state health secretary dr pradeep vyas said maharashtra epidemiologist and state surveillance officer dr pradeep awate said it is now established that omicron is present at community level in mumbai and pune further in depth analysis is required to see the spread he said awate pointed out that until a month ago omicron had not been found in any of the samples sequenced in maharashtra from zero its presence has increased to 10 of sequenced cases that shows it is fast growing he said in mumbai as cases surge random coronavirus surveillance has been stepped up at commuter railway stations photo indranil mukherjee afp breakthrough infections mild disease about 50 60 of omicron cases in maharashtra were breakthrough infections which means fully vaccinated people were getting infected with omicron state surveillance officer dr pradeep awate said but these infections are mild to moderate he added of the 141 mumbai residents found to be omicron positive in the random sampling done by the municipal corporation 93 are fully vaccinated and three have taken one dose of the vaccine said dr santosh revankar deputy executive health officer seven patients remain moderately ill and required hospitalisation while the rest are either asymptomatic or have mild symptoms he added in delhi none of the omicron patients have required oxygen support health minister satyendar jain said future trends with omicron present in the community covid 19 cases are expected to continue growing

united states where it is currently causing an exponential rise according to the world health organisation cases of the omicron variant double in 2 3 days the surge in cases in such a short time gives a sense of how quickly the virus is evolving and spreading lahariya said till december 29 961 omicron cases have been confirmed in india with delhi accounting for 263 maharashtra 252 followed by gujarat with 97 cases of the 961 confirmed cases 641 cases continue to remain actively infected lahariya said india must opt for a different strategy to deal with the new variant and refrain from any further lockdowns that could affect economic activities south africa has decided to not test or isolate asymptomatic people even if they have been exposed to infected people india could think of a similar strategy since most cases are asymptomatic and a large population is already exposed to the virus he said this reporting was supported by a grant from the thakur family foundation thakur

the new york city educators rank and file committee calls on our colleagues throughout the city to organize in order to stop the reopening of schools on january 3 and keep students in virtual learning until the virus is under control and schools are safe this must be connected to a broader fight by the working class to shut down nonessential industry with full compensation for affected workers through a tax on wall street s windfall pandemic profits people wait in line to get tested for covid 19 at a mobile testing site in times square on friday dec 17 2021 in new york ap photo yuki iwamura the number of infections from the omicron variant has skyrocketed on december 29 over 67 000 confirmed infections were reported in new york state roughly quadruple the peak in previous surges hundreds of thousands of city residents soon to be millions unless measures are taken soon have been infected with the virus the variant is infecting both vaccinated and unvaccinated people with unknown consequences for years and likely decades to come the scale of infections is already seriously challenging society s ability to function one third of all emergency medical technicians in new york city are sick with covid one subway line has been closed because transit workers are too ill to operate it reports indicate that hundreds of critical infrastructure workers such as those at the energy provider con edison are ill for weeks over the counter tests were unavailable in stores and from the government lines at testing centers according to the latest data from the city have minimum waits of one and a half hours and over 30 testing centers have closed in the week before the winter holiday over 12 schools closed because of covid infections and some classrooms were emptied out by infections in other schools children were crowded into auditoriums because too many educators were sick to teach them child hospitalizations in the city have quadrupled in two weeks educators and students were sent home for winter break with a sense of foreboding of what schools would look like when they return on january 3 but new york city is only in the forefront of mass infection from the omicron variant across the united states the situation in the rest of the country is only a few days behind us all of this was avoidable the experience in countries in the asia pacific especially china show that through the use of long established practices such as quarantining contact tracing and testing the spread of the coronavirus can be stopped even now with concerted action on a world scale this coronavirus pandemic can be brought under control within the space of a few months the uncontrolled spread of omicron has been made possible by the complete rejection of such measures by wall street and its servants in both political parties who have declared in unison that the cure can t be worse than the disease this reached a new stage this week when the federal centers for disease control and prevention cdc reduced the recommended quarantine period from 10 to five days the perverse logic behind the decision openly defended by cdc director rochelle walensky is that relaxing these health guidelines is necessary because an anticipated increase in cases will potentially constrain the labor supply leaving workplaces without enough workers out of quarantine to function this amounts to an open declaration that government policy is to keep people on the job and allow as many people as possible to be infected sacrificing human lives for profit in a recent address biden lied to the public claiming that lockdowns of schools and workplaces are unnecessary because the hospital system is supposedly better off than it was at the start of the pandemic he even rejected quarantining students exposed to covid and encouraged people not to cancel holiday travel plans he offered no meaningful new measures to address the spread of covid and doubled down on his vaccination only covid policy which has already ended in catastrophe in new york democrats have insisted that schools must reopen after the winter break precisely when the omicron surge is expected to peak children will no longer be quarantined after infections if they test negative on a home test at a media event on tuesday december 28 mayor bill de blasio governor kathy hochul and incoming mayor eric adams all promoted the vaccine only program and ruled out the closing of schools or other non essential workplaces during the omicron surge in this they have the support of the unions including the united federation of teachers which has worked hand in glove with the city and state administrations to keep schools open incredibly they have not only not canceled the annual new year s eve celebration in times square but adams himself will be sworn in as mayor at the event meaning his administration will literally begin in a super spreader event in which countless attendees will be infected the overriding priority of the political establishment is the safeguarding of the profit interests and share values of the rich no matter the cost in human lives the consequence of this is that more than 840 000 people in the united states alone have already been needlessly lost if the pandemic is ever to be brought under control the policies taken must be motivated by an entirely different set of social interests therefore the new york city educators rank and files safety committee calls on teachers and workers to take matters into our own hands and fight for a policy which prioritizes human life over profits in carrying out this fight we endorse the principles laid out in the recent open letter by the socialist equality party which include the present policy of herd immunity i e allowing covid 19 to spread throughout the population must be repudiated a new strategy directed toward the elimination and eradication of sars cov 2 must be adopted the policies implemented to stop viral transmission must be determined by the needs of public health the protection of human life and safety must take absolute and unconditional priority over all corporate financial interests the costs of fighting the pandemic including the payment of wages and salaries compensation to small business owners full medical coverage for the ill and payments to bereaved families must be borne by corporations and a 100 percent tax on the windfall pandemic profits obtained by large investors through the run up in the stock market the fight against the pandemic must be conducted on a global scale the pandemic cannot be stopped unless sars cov 2 is eliminated in all countries american workers must demand that vaccines be provided in necessary quantities free of charge to their class brothers and sisters in the less developed countries in the first instance teachers must organize actions to force a halt to the reopening of schools for the spring semester next week or to force them to shut down again as soon as possible all nonessential workplaces throughout the city must also be shut down not to reopen until the buildings are genuinely safe that is once the spread of the virus has been brought under control and a system of mass contact tracing and testing is in place which can quickly suppress all new outbreaks full wages must be guaranteed during the shutdown to be paid for out of the trillions of dollars wasted on wall street speculation during the pandemic the fight for these measures can only be conducted by teachers and workers ourselves not the political establishment not the media and not the pro corporate trade unions to organize this fight rank and file committees must be built at every school consisting of teachers and other school employees and excluding administrators and union officials to fight for a shutdown these committees advised by serious medical scientists must the ones to determine when schools are safe to reopen and oversee the implementation of all safety measures to ensure they are not sabotaged again for the sake of profit interests all educators parents who support this program should immediately join the educators rank and file safety committee

how the us dollar is on the losing end of these shifts and in the year ahead this trend could become a systemic problem true the dollar s value versus gold has been falling for more than a decade now that s a product of ultraloose federal reserve policies flooding the globe with record liquidity now even as the fed moves to tighten the credit spigot a bit other monetary powers are pivoting to gold the reason is growing concerns that the dollar s reserve currency days are over or at best numbered the 30 year bookmark has become a hallmark of 2021 china s economic growth recently dropped to the lowest levels in three decades us inflation and japan s nikkei stock average both surged to the highest levels since the early 1990s but the 30 year metric that might matter most is central banks shifting from dollars to gold according to the world gold council central bank stockpiles of the yellow metal have now increased by more than 4 500 tons over the past decade at the end of september such reserves totaled 36 000 tons a level not seen since 1990 might all hell break loose for the dollar in 2022 most analysts agree the next couple of months could be kind to the dollar the fed s shift toward tighter policy coincides with the people s bank of china pivoting toward monetary loosening investment strategist manpreet gill at standard chartered bank speaks for many when he says we

toward the 30 trillion mark president joe biden s infrastructure and social spending plans come just as us inflation skyrockets that s putting upward pressure on us treasury yields since the 2008 lehman brother crisis global investors have become accustomed to ultralow us yields one could say in fact that markets came to take dollar risks for granted yet us treasury rates tend to be a one way bet until they re suddenly not as concerns about washington s runaway debt collide with surging inflation and a covid 19 explosion sure to slam the economy that moment could be soon two stock froth is getting irrationally exuberant it was exactly 25 years ago this month that then fed chairman alan greenspan used these words to send a shot across the bow of stock bulls the equity bubbles of the mid 1990s were a mere fraction of where asset markets are heading into 2022 for many years james glassman and kevin hassett wore egg on their faces for writing dow 36 000 back in 1999 yet 22 years and one pandemic later that s where the dow jones industrial average is ending the year what these dreamers missed was the need for untold trillions of dollars of cash from the fed european central bank and bank of japan to make it happen far from a milestone the nosebleed heights us equities are at is a warning sign of trouble to come if the delta variant of covid 19 didn t slam the economy omicron is surely about to get the job done even with the us facing stagflation and the specter of fresh lockdowns economist edward yardeni calculates the s p500 is trading 22 above future earnings irrational indeed three the yuan has the momentum since june 2020 the yuan has risen more than 10 versus the dollar it bellied trump s claims that china was artificially depressing exchange rates on his way out the door in late 2020 trump left beijing off the us treasury s currency manipulator list adding vietnam instead yet the move by central banks to pivot away from the dollar comes just as chinese president xi jinping s effort to internationalize the yuan gains traction not everyone agrees with billionaire hedge fund manager ray dalio s belief the yuan will replace the dollar sooner than conventional market wisdom believes but the bridgewater associates founder makes a plausible case that the changing of the guard many pundits hope would never happen may be afoot four the digital future is now as fed chairman jerome powell experiments with tapering and rate hikes pboc governor yi gang s team is about to roll out a digital currency the first by a major monetary authority china s first mover advantage matters when it comes to rewriting the future of money by february when beijing hosts the winter olympics the pboc hopes to have an e yuan ready for circulation the us europe and japan are lagging far behind the more a digital yuan gains global acceptance the more xi s ambitions to increase china s role in global finance and trade comes to fruition and the more washington frankfurt and tokyo will find themselves playing catch up and investors and central banks might increase their yuan holdings five america s bankers call their loans the cornerstone holders of washington s ginormous debt are all in asia especially japan and china asia s top 10 holders are sitting on about 3 5 trillion of us treasury debt just as inflation surges the most in decades fed chairman jerome powell photo wikicommons questions over treasury holdings reserve currency status is indeed an exorbitant privilege as one time french finance minister valery giscard d estaing famously said with it though comes urgent responsibility now that inflation is perking up the fed needs to ensure it s getting ahead of things otherwise washington s asian bankers might dump treasury holdings en masse the fed does have options says columbia university economist willem buiter simply put he says the additional federal fiscal deficits must be monetized buiter notes that in general team powell has done a great job so far expanding its balance sheet by 70 from march 2020 to january 2021 from 4 2 trillion to more than 7 4 trillion the fed though now must prepare to buy up the federal debt issued by the treasury to fund its latest fiscal ambitions buiter says all told though the dollar is heading into a rather precarious year of uncertainty volatility and more than a few

menafn asia times central banks around the globe are ending 2021 with the highest gold holdings in 31 years yet the real story as monetary authorities recalibrate foreign exchange reserve holdings is how the us dollar is on the losing end of these shifts and in the year ahead this trend could become a systemic problem true the dollar s value versus gold has been falling for more than a decade now that s a product of ultraloose federal reserve policies flooding the globe with record liquidity now even as the fed moves to tighten the credit spigot a bit other monetary powers are pivoting to gold the reason is growing concerns that the dollar s reserve currency days are over or at best numbered the 30 year bookmark has become a hallmark of 2021 china s economic growth recently dropped to the lowest levels in three decades us inflation and japan s nikkei stock average both surged to the highest levels since the early 1990s but the 30 year metric that might matter most is central banks shifting from dollars to gold according to the world gold council central bank stockpiles of the yellow metal have now increased by more than 4 500 tons over the past decade at the end of september such reserves totaled 36 000 tons a level not seen since 1990 might all hell break loose for the dollar in 2022 most analysts agree the next couple of months could be kind to the dollar the fed s shift toward tighter policy coincides with the people s bank of china pivoting toward monetary loosening investment strategist manpreet gill at standard chartered bank speaks for many when he says we

as the year closes the covid pandemic is inflicting new levels of entirely preventable misery on the global population while the stock markets continue to soar the pandemic is an indictment of capitalism or in the form of the pandemic capitalism indicts itself the ongoing surge is inevitably bringing about a new wave of closures of theaters museums art fairs and galleries in part simply from a shortage of healthy labor the online observer recently noted with covid 19 once more ripping through the world with unfettered deadly force in a new surge it stands to reason that many arts institutions and fairs are reconsidering whether they should implement new safety measures or even go forward at all hyperallergic reports that artist and curator jenni crain only 30 died december 16 from sudden complications related to covid 19 it is unclear they write how she contracted the virus however crain had recently returned from the blockbuster art basel miami beach international art fair in florida attended by 60 000 people which did not mandate proof of vaccination but allowed those who provided proof of a negative covid 19 test to enter the fair there have been mostly anecdotal reports of a surge in infections during miami art week artsy net remarks cheerfully about the miami beach event many galleries reported gangbuster sales and collectors both of the traditional and new variety clearly came ready to buy death and illness are a small price to pay for gangbuster sales one year ago we wrote nearly 2 million people so far have perished in this painful manner because big business interests and their political agents in government everywhere determined without hesitation that their profits and wealth took priority over human life meanwhile the swine who write for the new york times and the wall street journal cold bloodedly and unashamedly explained to their readers that the cure the systematic eradication of the disease by decisive means which might result in a falling stock market could not be worse than the disease now officially 5 5 million people have died with no end in sight and the arguments have become even more cynical and dishonest by learning to live with the virus the billionaire oligarchs mean they have comfortably adjusted to watching masses of other people die from it the us film industry is recklessly pressing ahead in the face of the disaster with its efforts to lure wary audiences back to movie theaters film advertisements announce only in theaters and various performers who should know better have been trotted out to promote the uniqueness of the theater experience at what cost the success of the latest spider man film is being hailed as a further sign of a box office resurgence in 2021 after the disaster of 2020 which saw a 40 year low in movie ticket sales this is such a good harbinger for the future of the theatrical business coming out of the pandemic john fithian chairman of the national association of theatre owners told variety it s fantastic news for the rest of the year and into 2022 we think this is a turning point for us the hollywood studios have little of interest in store in 2022 if variety s list is anything to go by with a straight face apparently the publication reports on a murderer s row of big screen offerings including black panther wakanda forever thor love and thunder jurassic world dominion avatar 2 and the batman an update of the dark knight saga with robert pattinson donning the cape and cowl it may be lacking in originality but it s the kind of lineup that seems tailor made to pack auditoriums that remains to be seen audiences face the possibility of a two pronged attack from both the empty bombast on the screen and the coronavirus itself the list of actors musicians painters dancers and others who have succumbed to covid 19 or complications from the virus continues to grow among many others that list includes jazz musicians lee konitz wallace roney ellis marsalis

carol sutton dawn wells and linda torres this is just the cost of doing business by november 2021 prior to the most recent covid surge jobs in arts entertainment and recreation according to the us bureau of labor statistics had rebounded to 2 23 million still down 11 percent or more than 200 000 from february 2020 tens of thousands of positions are gone for good with an uncertain future for the sector as a whole also as of november 2021 johns hopkins university reports that the percentage of job losses at nonprofit arts organizations remained more than three times worse than the average of all nonprofits many music venues galleries opera companies orchestras and smaller museums have staggered through thanks to government money but for how long and what will another shutdown forced perhaps by a lack of willing and able workers mean for them americans for the arts points out that during the pandemic 37 percent of artists have been unable to access or afford food at some point and 58 percent have not visited a medical professional due to an inability to pay in stages of grief what the pandemic has done to the arts in harper s june 2021 william deresiewicz who has done valuable research into the economic state of the arts commented that that what has been happening across the arts is not a recession it is not even a depression it is a catastrophe artists have adapted deresiewicz wrote yes the way you adapt to losing a limb deresiewicz has pointed to the devastation of the arts economy rooted in the great besetting sin of contemporary american society extreme and growing inequality in his 2020 book the death of the artist how creators are struggling to survive in the age of billionaires and big tech he painted a shocking picture of the pre pandemic arts and culture world a handful of the facts will suffice here of the two million artists on spotify less than 4 percent account for over 95 percent of streams of the roughly fifty million songs available at last count on the site 20 percent have never been streamed not even once as of 2017 according to the economist alan b krueger the top 0 1 percent of artists were responsible for more than 50 percent of album sales with similar numbers for downloads and streaming in 1982 according to krueger the top 1 percent of artists garnered 26 percent of total concert revenue by 2017 the number was 60 percent at a mega festival of two hundred acts has remarked 80 percent of the money will go to the three or four headliners from 2009 to 2015 according to a survey by the authors guild full time writers saw their writing related income decline by an average of 30 percent from 2001 to 2018 according to the bureau of labor statistics the number of people employed as musicians dropped by 24 percent studies revealed that only 10 percent of the two million arts graduates in the united states make their primary living as artists that 85 percent of artists in new york city have day jobs unrelated to the arts and that the other 15 percent have median incomes of 25 000 like everything else the market for art is a winner takes all in 2018 just twenty individuals accounted for 64 percent of total sales by living artists in the arts tech does not eliminate existing producers creation can t be automated it exploits and immiserates them jonathan taplin estimates that between 2004 and 2015 about 50 billion in annual revenue moved from the creators of content to the owners of monopoly platforms the covid crisis has only sharply exacerbated and deepened this social polarization and economic inequality in the arts world to have a future artists will need to turn to the working class and to conscious opposition to capitalism in any event the pandemic prevented the regular viewing of films

executium on unsplash executium on unsplash for financial advisors family offices and investors alike 2021 will go down in the history books as one of the most significant with respect to cryptocurrency many cryptocurrencies reached all time highs and the first ever bitcoin etf was approved by the sec in the united states at the same time the chinese government banned mining and trading in september moreover a famous meme dogecoin was propped up by tesla s tsla ceo elon musk if that wasn t enough non fungible tokens nft s has been one of the major trends in 2021 however the ratio of retail investors or individuals who have invested in traded or used cryptocurrencies is not high when compared to investments in equities according to pew research center only 16 of americans have invested in traded or used cryptocurrency in terms of stock 56 of americans have owned stock from gallup s research when compared to crypto with stock its ratio is rather low to put things in perspective as of september 30 2021 the total market capitalization of the u s stock market is currently 48 trillion however as of nov 2021 the total cryptocurrency market capitalization broke 3 trillion this data would suggest that there is clear momentum for cryptocurrency to grow in the future when analyzing the pros and cons of investing in cryptocurrency we also explicate the tensions in what we refer to as the good the bad and the ugly moreover we assume that the vast majority of investors will utilize a cex centralized exchange such as coinbase gemini and binance to trade cryptocurrencies total cryptocurrency market cap from coinmarketcap coin market cap total cryptocurrency market cap from coinmarketcap pros cons of investing in crypto cryptocurrencies allow for a number of positive externalities such as offer an opportunity to gain significant return in a short time rapid growth and this is expected to continue in 2022 the amount of initial investment is very flexible for example coinbase allows users to start trading from as little as 2 cexs offer reasonable apy annual percentage yield which is from 0 15 8 meaning credit cards can be used to invest in crypto the metaverse will have positive impacts on the crypto space high volatility the regulatory environment will have a huge impact on the crypto space for example having some technical knowledge to understand the value of projects can help to make more informed decisions about investing into crypto some influencers have a huge impact on the volatility price swings in cryptocurrencies the cryptocurrency market is constantly evolving and changing 24 7 which means some people may need to invest money to utilize technology for trading investors need to get used to new tools platforms that many crypto projects use such as twitter discord and telegram the pros and cons of crypto can be in fact two sides of the same coin meaning investors can earn a significant return in a short time period but this means they can also lose a lot of money in a short amount of time in terms of inflation the reliability of crypto as a hedge against inflation isn t as good as gold since cryptocurrencies are still relatively new as an asset class and thus the jury is still out on this with regards to volatility there are many cryptocurrencies that have over time proven to be relatively stable while the overall global crypto market has declined this means technically investors can build a portfolio that reduces the risk of volatility in terms of the crypto regulatory environment there is the possibility that new regulations from the sec will have an impact on the cryptocurrency market however it is important to note that the regulatory environment from the us as well as other countries like china can have short as well as long term impacts volatility of crypto take for example china which has banned cryptocurrency 20 times however for this first time beijing s 10 regulatory agencies including the people s bank of china pboc jointly announced in september of 2021 to ban all crypto and mining in an effort to root out illegal cryptocurrency activity several exchanges wallets and other cryptocurrency companies have announced that they will stop providing services to users in mainland china and enforced a sweeping block of all chinese ip addresses on their services given the wording of the official document which explicitly singles out overseas exchanges catering to chinese residents the industry appears to have taken an overly cautious approach how much individual citizens will be threatened by the new level of enforcement remains to be seen says luisa kinzius a director at china focused consultancy sinolytics the announcement is also targeting any chinese citizen working for crypto related companies abroad declaring their work as illegal and putting them at risk of being legally investigated often when china makes announcements that it yet again is banning cryptocurrency it has the short term effect of sending the price of bitcoin and ethereum spiraling downwards beijing s utter disdain for cryptocurrency is because it threatens to provide an alternative to the chinese government s top down centralized currency control moreover this is also related to the chinese governments development to rather promote its own digital yuan and central bank digital currency in terms of technical knowledge if investors have knowledge of blockchain that would be great but cexs offer useful information to investors and cryptocurrencies on cexs are examined carefully the most recent popular metaverse will bring positive impacts on the crypto space because nfts will be used as an identification in the metaverse and the metaverse includes economic activity and that will be supported by cryptocurrencies so more people will start using them finally let s consider the worst scenario for investors that use cexs it could be shut down banned by a government but this would be extremely improbable indeed binance has some issues with some countries authorities but it keeps the biggest trading volume also coinbase spent 785k on lobbying in 2021 from opensecrets data therefore the worst case scenario is quite unlikely judging from these factors investing in cryptocurrencies could be a good option for many investors but its critical to do your own due diligence due diligence photo scott graham on unsplash photo by scott graham on unsplash due diligence on crypto projects most cryptocurrencies have a project that solves a specific issue with blockchain technology except meme coins i e dogecoin shibu etc before investing in crypto it is essential to take into consideration the following team composition each crypto project has a core team and understanding the team is crucial but as i mentioned a listed cryptocurrency is examined by a cex carefully so you won t need to spend an exorbitant amount of time on this other important considerations are total funds the company has raised do the investors include any famous celebrity investors in the crypto space who are the key partners in the company and what core competitive value do they bring product this is the same as when you invest in stocks does the company s long term strategy have consistency what kind of issue will the product solve who are the competitors of the product what is the difference between the company and competitors how long has the company developed its product does the company show milestones long term short term does the company conduct smart contract audits does the company have a clear plan for scalability marketing many crypto projects use telegram and discord to communicate with investors developers and use twitter for official announcements so these accounts information is one of criteria to measure the projects expected value is the company telegram group active if the company has does the company twitter account have many followers does the company post information regularly does the company update an official website regularly is the company s discord server active if the company has do any high profile celebrity s support the project conclusion whether you are a financial advisor family office institutional investor or a recent high school graduate there are different objectives as well as risk tolerances for investing in cryptocurrencies which must be understood as with any investment one should clearly ascertain the risk versus reward and the opportunity cost at the present moment when evaluating the pros and cons the risk in more mainstream crypto currencies like bitcoin and ethereum can at times be volatile while at the same time in certain situations provide a level of diversity as well as growth to investors portfolios if you have historically chosen to ignore investing in cryptocurrency because of its high volatility or the complexity of blockchain technology this might be a good time

one year ago we were looking forward to a safer and sounder 2021 the food and drug administration in the us had granted emergency authorisation to the pfizer biontech and moderna vaccines against covid 19 a new presidential administration was poised to take office in the next month armed with a commitment to bring together a nation cleaved by four years of divisive policymaking it was not to be instead of unity and immunity this year has brought us insanity on an unimaginable scale in the categories of public health education policy fiscal policy and investment options we appear to have taken leave of our collective senses certainly there are other years or periods in which stupidity or heedlessness brought civilisation in general close to eradication consider 1914 when most of europe dived hell bent to war for no discernible reason read barbara tuchman s book the guns of august for the full horrific picture the dark ages were a period benighted by scientific ignorance some individual countries and national leaders stand out for tempting fate to their and their citizens misfortune britain in 1938 under neville chamberlain russia s warmongering with japan in 1904 1905 louis napoleon poking a stick into the prussian bear s cage in 1870 1871 saddam hussein invading kuwait in 1990 the perpetrators of some of these errors might assert in their defence that they were brought low by circumstances they didn t know at the time but america in 2021 can t plead that it didn t know didn t know that vaccines representing stupendous scientific achievements were the solution to the covid 19 pandemic didn t know that donald trump wasn t joking when he demanded that government officials overturn a fair presidential election didn t know that bitcoin nfts spacs and meme stocks were destined even designed to take unwary investors to the cleaners of course we knew and know we don t seem to care in reviewing the most intellectually demoralising events of 2021 i ll leave aside a few discrete outbursts of asininity so i won t go into detail about the conservative movement s lionising of kyle rittenhouse the self confessed but acquitted killer of two unarmed men at a protest rally in kenosha wis or the openly antisemitic ravings by former president trump or the ugly dishonest attacks that forced the withdrawal of saule omarova one of the most qualified nominees for a federal banking regulatory job in memory or the shameful behaviour of congressional republicans who cowered in safety during the jan 6 insurrection pleading with trump to help quell the riot only to claim ever since that the violence of the crowd was no big deal or the posting of christmas cards by politicians showing their families hoisting assault weapons as rep thomas massie r ky did just four days after a gunman killed four students at a michigan high school he was followed by rep lauren boebert r colo instead we ll focus on a few of the bigger pictures so as virgil said to dante before guiding him into the inferno let us descend now into the blind world covid 19 the pandemic is surely the focus of the most obtuse and ignorant public reactions and state and local policy responses to any crisis in american history it s as if the grown ups have all been beamed up and we are left in the hands of people like florida gov ron desantis i am paraphrasing a line from the great pandemic movie together in any rational world the refusal or failure by some 50 million adult americans to take a vaccine of known efficacy against a deadly disease would be inexplicable but this is not a rational world and the situation is even worse vaccine refusal is seen in many benighted corners of the united states not merely as the exercise of personal choice for personal reasons but as a means of showing moral superiority over the vaccinated a conservative critic of anti pandemic measures writing from rural southwest michigan for the atlantic bragged absurdly and selfishly i am now closer to most of my fellow americans than the people almost absurdly over represented in media and elite institutions who are still genuinely concerned about this virus the author may think he s remote from virus concerns but that s not the case at a hospital visited by cnn in lansing mich which can t be much more than 100 miles from his location and where the latest covid 19 surge is as bad as health care workers there have seen how did it come to pass that americans who almost uniformly are inoculated against at least a half dozen serious diseases in childhood chose this moment to refuse a spectacularly effective shot against one of the most dangerous diseases to arise in their lifetimes out of pure ignorance its effectiveness is scarcely disputable the commonwealth fund estimates that the vaccine averted about 1 1 million american deaths from covid 19 and more than 10 3 million hospitalisation this year the answer lies in politics trump drew the line first dismissing social distancing steps and refusing to speak up for vaccination he established these steps as partisan choices and his political acolytes followed him over the cliff desantis has been a leader in this descent into the inferno he s chosen to make dr anthony fauci head of the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases and america s most respected authority on the pandemic a target of partisan calumny he s appointed a vaccine doubter as his state s top public health official what is the outcome florida currently ranks eighth worst among states in its covid 19 death rate with more than 62 000 floridians having perished from the virus of the seven states with worse records six are red states like florida corporate america has not showered itself in glory on dec 18 boeing announced that it was dropping its requirement that all us employees be vaccinated its explanation was that a federal judge had blocked the enforcement of a federal executive order that employees of government contractors be vaccinated this is absurd nothing in the ruling required boeing to drop its requirement the company announced its step back just as the omicron variant was about to produce a surge in infections the pusillanimity of american corporations on this subject continues to astound to its credit on dec 17 the biden white house issued an uncompromising warning about the dangers of remaining unvaccinated for the unvaccinated you re looking at a winter of severe illness and death for yourselves your families and the hospitals you may soon overwhelm white house chief of staff ron klain said so our message to every american is clear wear a mask in public indoor settings get vaccinated get your kids vaccinated and get a booster shot when you re eligible inflation and build back better republicans and conservatives have never cottoned to spending on programs that assist the middle and working class president biden s build back better program was destined to get their backs up how could they attack a programme that provides for universal prekindergarten education assistance with child care caps on the price of drugs such as insulin and better access to health care simple raise the old bugaboo of inflation that s been the approach of sen joe manchin iii d w va who recently announced via fox news of course that he couldn t support the plan in any way he s since backed off a bit from his adamantine opposition but the core of his position was concern that the measure would add to inflation as we ve reported that s just wrong not even former treasury secretary lawrence summers who sounded an inflation alarm about the pandemic relief package enacted this year thinks it applies to this measure the provisions of build back better are paid for and represent investments in the economy so they re anything but inflationary indeed wall street views manchin s resistance as an economic negative according to marketwatch goldman sachs cut its growth forecast for the first quarter of next year to 2 from 3 for the second quarter to 3 from 3 5 and for the third quarter to 2 75 from 3 that s not counting the direct impact of build back better on manchin s own state which is among the poorest in the nation and one in which government programs are crucial that s well understood on the ground the united mine workers union publicly urged manchin to reconsider his opposition to a program that would have a meaningful impact on our members their families and their communities much more happened in 2021 that prompts one to hold head in hands to be fair however there were also glimmers of hope biden on dec 21 announced steps to strengthen the country s response to the omicron variant including mobilising troops to help staff overwhelmed hospitals opening thousands of vaccine sites and sending 500 million free testing kits to households the build back better plan is not entirely dead and a revival effort will start in january whether 2022 will be as stupid and insane as 2021 won t be known until we can view it in a rear view mirror 12 months from now we can only hope michael hiltzik is a pulitzer prize winning journalist and author

december brought kansas its first comprehensive look at its housing needs in nearly three decades this report is a bonanza for policy geeks and anyone who cares about housing issues the office of rural prosperity created by gov laura kelly partnered with the kansas housing resources corporation kansas housing finance agency to sponsor the report it provides localized data on housing needs population trends and market dynamics if you want to address housing challenges facing average kansans the data in this report is the start for renters finding quality and affordable housing is hard in many communities that leaves many kansans paying inflated prices for under maintained properties or paying significantly more than mortgages might otherwise cost for buyers a limited supply of affordable modest sized homes is pushing many into renting or buying more expensive homes than they actually want and many buyers can t compete when sellers in some kansas markets expect perks like thousands in cash over asking or waived inspections but in some kansas communities especially shrinking rural communities reality is often different too few buyers and difficulty obtaining funds to bring properties up to buyer expectations from the report two problems define most kansas markets first there is a gap in middle class housing typically more affordable smaller sized and smaller lot homes this is the critical shortage that turns buyers into renters or encourages larger mortgages just to have a house in the kansas city metro it can also be the deciding factor between living in kansas versus missouri second there is a shortage of rental and smaller home stock suitable for our aging population you can sense from local politics that these trends clash with how some communities see themselves in 2021 s local elections in kansas some communities saw real controversy over new rental housing and whether policies should favor larger or smaller single family homes if city halls in kansas make growth decisions based on image over needs and trends they might make easy political decisions that actually make the housing situation in their communities more challenging for the frustrated asking how to improve this situation is natural the answers may not be easy housing is an inherently local issue the easiest solutions may be found in local government growth policies and zoning but participation in local elections in kansas is pretty low how many of us know who serves on our city councils let alone what growth decisions they make that ultimately frustrate us politicians in topeka can still promote solutions it might require innovate policy and local partnerships this is truly an issue where there is no one simple solution and where brainstorming effective policy innovation is needed finding these solutions though requires our political machinery to actually care some in the politics industry care more about talking about housing problems for political point scoring than actually finding hard solutions or they would rather carnival bark about sideshows like critical race theory or outrage of the day headlines than engage you on hard issues you can read the kansas statewide housing needs assessment 2021 at kshousingcorp org kansas doesn t need to wallow helplessly in its housing challenges but we do need citizens and policymakers who know the real problems and seek the hard solutions patrick r miller is an associate professor of political science at the university of kansas

is legally termed a public nuisance but had lethal consequences an opioid use epidemic linked to more than 500 000 deaths in the u s in the past two decades teva pharmaceuticals usa and others misled the american people about the true dangers of opioids james a democrat said in a news release today we took a significant step in righting the wrongs this country has collectively experienced over the last two decades israel based teva which makes medications using the powerful opioid fentanyl said it strongly disagrees with the verdict and plans to appeal the plaintiffs presented no evidence of medically unnecessary prescriptions suspicious or diverted orders no evidence of oversupply by teva and didn t show that teva s marketing caused harm to new yorkers the company said in a statement it is also arguing for a mistrial based on various issues the price of teva s u s listed stock fell after the verdict was announced ending down 6 3 at 7 90 around the country state and local governments native american tribes unions school districts and others have sued the drug industry over the painkillers new york s lawsuit filed in 2019 targeted several opioid producers and distributors companies that buy medications in bulk and sell them to pharmacies the suit accused drug companies of breaching their legal duties to profiteer from the plague they knew would be unleashed the state and counties said that drug manufacturers collaborated to mislead people and downplay the serious risks of opioid addiction and that drug distributors skirted systems meant to limit orders for painkillers teva is known for making generic drugs but the lawsuit focused on actiq and fentora two brand name fentanyl drugs approved for some cancer patients teva repeatedly promoted them more broadly for other types of pain in a deceptive and dangerous marketing strategy the lawsuit said they try to say they re selling legal products the only problem is they re selling them illegally lawyer hunter shkolnik who represented nassau county said at a virtual news conference thursday the jury saw that what they re doing is wrong teva said thursday it continues to focus on increasing access to essential medicines to patients and believes a national settlement of opioid issues is in patients best interest new york said the conduct of the various opioid companies named in the suit cost the state hundreds of millions of dollars in addiction treatment bills and other expenses lawyers for the counties suggested the teva could be held liable for tens of billions of dollars or more in damages the numbers are staggering what it has cost our communities and what it will continue to cost our communities in emergency services for overdose victims drug rehabilitation programs and more suffolk county s lawyer jayne conroy said at the virtual news conference teva was the sole manufacturing defendant left in the suit after others settled most recently allergan finance llc in december the various settlements have netted new york up to 1 5 billion the trial started months ago the jury began deliberating dec 14 taking some days off for christmas elsewhere only a few opioid cases have gone to verdicts to date with no clear consensus on outcomes an oklahoma judge ruled against drugmaker johnson johnson in 2019 but the state s supreme court overturned that decision in november a week earlier a california judge in ruled in favor of drugmakers including teva then late last month a federal jury in cleveland sided with two ohio county governments that had claims against pharmacy chains some observers thought the california and oklahoma rulings doomed the idea of using state public nuisance laws to pursue opioid suits said carl tobias a university of richmond law professor who is following the litigation nationwide but now we re really seeing that that s not true at least in some places tobias said he suggested thursday s ruling could reinvigorate such suits a trial has been completed but a judge has not yet ruled in a west virginia case and a trial is ongoing in washington state thousands of other cases are in the process of heading to trial there have also been settlements some of the biggest industry names such as distributors amerisourcebergen cardinal health and mckesson and drugmakers johnson johnson mallinckrodt pharmaceuticals have reached nationwide settlements with a cumulative value potentially well over 30 billion most of the money is being directed to fight the epidemic but most of those deals have not been finalized and there has been one very big reversal in mid december a federal judge rejected oxycontin maker purdue pharma s sweeping deal to settle thousands of lawsuits over the toll of opioids associated press writer deepti hajela

almaty city 1 006 850 and east kazakhstan region 901 010 kazakhstan offers several vaccines to its citizens russian sputnik v its own qazvac chinese vero cell sinopharm and pfizer biontech vaccine offered to teenagers and women who are pregnant and breastfeeding development of qazvac vaccine another milestone for kazakhstan was the development of its own qazvac vaccine by the kazakh research institute for biosafety problems in the zhambyl region the vaccine was developed between april and may 2020 after researchers took samples from the first covid 19 patients in march 2020 it is an inactivated vaccine with two doses injected 21 days apart the first phase of the clinical trials that began in september 2020 involved 44 volunteers in almaty the second phase started in october 2020 involving 200 volunteers in almaty and the third phase in december 2020 involved 3 000 volunteers in almaty and taraz the condition of the volunteers was satisfactory no severe side effects were reported while blood results showed the presence of antibodies after the first two phases the institute said the vaccine proved complete safety forming a stable immunity against coronavirus infection in april 2021 the qazvac vaccine was presented to journalists and starting from april 26 it was commissioned to use in the country visiting the institute in october president tokayev said the development of the vaccine is a great achievement this is a very necessary production for our country the main work is done next year we will continue production this is a very complex production process it takes three to four years to launch such facility abroad but we were able to get it up and running in nine months said tokayev back then according to nurika asanzhanova head of the laboratory at the institute the qazvac vaccine has several competitive advantages including its storage requirements and effectiveness it is stored in a normal refrigerator and does not require freezing at either minus 20 or minus 70 degrees celsius which are difficult to observe during transportation and storage compared to other technologies our vaccine is made from a whole virus simply put when the virus enters the vaccinated body the antibodies are ready and know who they are dealing with immunological memory is triggered which allows us to fight the disease more effectively said asanzhanova explosion at an ammunition depot in zhambyl region on august 26 a series of powerful blasts at an ammunition depot in baizak district 30 kilometers from the city of taraz zhambyl region shocked the country two years after a similar explosion in the town of arys also in the zhambyl region fourteen people died and over 98 people were injured half of them were employees of the ministry

is this title inspired by one of the protagonists of a breathtaking bollywood film yes it is if you know you know but this this is a story about my irrevocable love for sulaimani chai a silent yet constant companion and selfless advice from strangers who have felt like family in a foreign place side note i don t really wish to refer to the pandemic in this story we have heard enough about it already haven t we so let s hit the rewind button and take a pause it had been ages since i actually witnessed a sun rise on my way to work on a monday morning i noticed the tip of a massive skyscraper splashed with neon orange light having reached a roundabout i noticed that this blinding light on the building was a reflection of the gigantic sun gleaming as though it were clad in millions of marigold flowers since it was a slightly foggy morning the sun rays had a bokeh effect in the sky it was one of those sights that are so surreal that routine life takes a back seat as life gives you a chance to stop stare and stay amazed for a few fleeting moments as the fog cleared the clouds revealed that the skyscraper was none other than the burj khalifa when i set foot in dubai 2 years ago the tallest building in the world became my constant companion anywhere that i would travel in the city this giant structure would peak at me amid the city s skyline after spending a little more than 24 months here i smile each time i spot it as though i were meeting an old friend eventually on days that were tough the burj khalifa became my shrine during work commutes i would glance at it and bow my head gently as i prayed to get through all the rough days it was a perfect definition of finding a friend in a city who would have guessed that this glorious structure brought me to life each day with this i realised that every city has a lifeline whether it s the local trains in mumbai the subway in new york or the cabs in dubai the public transport of any city is like the blood that runs through our veins like the chlorophyll that bedazzles a plant the best part about dubai is that time flies so quickly here this makes the happier times more memorable and the sad times pass by even quicker a cab driver had once mentioned this to me on a rough day that statement flipped my day by a hundred and eighty degrees there are more than 200 nationalities living and working in the uae and i ve had the most moving conversations with cab drivers in dubai be it a short journey or a long one there s so much to learn about where they come from their families cultures and their perspectives on life they add that humane element to our robotic daily routine and for me they re voices from all over the world that guide me every day dubai is the best place to be i ve been here for almost 25 years this is my home another taxi driver added as i asked him about where he hailed from he had been sipping on a cup of tea that looked like black tea this is sulaimani chai it keeps me going he quipped these are the ones who have played the role of a friend in need a brother offering advice or someone who unknowingly imparts words of wisdom that have turned my entire day and my life around speaking of chai in dubai office breaks involved conversations with colleagues over a steaming hot cup of sulaimani chai with lemon and mint now you may think that i am obsessed with the sun but the colour of sulaimani chai with a drop of lemon morphs into a brilliant shade much like the colour of an early morning sky did you know that in arabic the name sulaiman translates to man of peace how apt especially since we as mere mortals are in constant search of this feeling soon this arabic concoction the sight of the world renowned skyscraper and rta cabs became my safe place thousands of us have landed in this gracious city for jobs where we constantly find little ways to turn this new city into our home for me dubai is not just a place it is and will always be my greatest friend

menafn colombo gazette by r r m lilani as the chinese new year approaches in 2022 the chinese government is preparing to confront sri lanka over the dumping of its organic fertilizer shipment and to make amends the first diplomatic visit will be made in 2022 by china s state councilor and foreign minister wang yi a well known figure in sri lanka he is expected to arrive on the island on january 8 with more development projects and freebies to help mend the strained relations between china and sri lanka it has been revealed that he will ensure that sri lanka will always be grateful to them wang has visited sri lanka since the launch of the chinese road and belt initiative in 2013 he first arrived in february 2016 and then again in july of that year again in january 2020 and in june 2021 he paid visits to the island nation china lost its cool when sri lanka s top agriculture scientists rejected china s contaminated organic fertilizer shipment china took the ministry of agriculture to the supreme court to get its massive compensation of usd 8 million while dollar crisis propped up they showed their subtle anger over sri lanka buying india s nano fertilizer having rejecting their fertilizer they decided to claim compensation in order to teach sri lanka a lesson in april 2021 wang hosted the zoom conference which was attended by afghan acting foreign minister mohammed haneef atmar pakistani foreign minister shah mahmood qureshi nepali foreign minister pradeep kumar gyawali then sri lankan foreign minister dinesh gunawardena and bangladesh s foreign minister a k abdul momen and wanted all the six countries to consolidate consensus on cooperation against the covid 19 in south asia the meeting was not attended by india although china is not part of the south asian region it has managed to creep in by way of investing in aimless development projects in sri lanka as well in in pakistan that does not reap revenues as expected wang s visit coincides with an unresolved dispute over chinese fertilizer because of the dispute china eventually banned the state run people s bank rather than remove the contaminated fertilizer the chinese went to the local court and filed a complaint through their local agent the qingdao seawin biotech company refused to accept responsibility and instead blacklisted the people s bank of sri lanka with the help of the chinese embassy and powerful politicians for nearly two months the issue has remained unresolved the chinese have not adjusted to the situation despite the government wanted both parties to reach for an amicable agreement local newspapers quoted that the shipment from china was deemed in illegal importation in the absence of a valuable protection of phytosanitary certifcate ppc from the chinese company this was revealed by a top official of the ministry of agriculture as a result the national plant protection organisation nppo who lacks the legal authority to inspect the fertilizer issued a non compliance notice to its chinese counterpart after sample testing but china is adamant to accept the fault they have been forcing sri lanka to consider the fertilizer or pay compensation so that their international image is not tarnished over a minor fertilizer issue wang stated when he arrived in january 2020 that sri lanka is a strategic partner for china and that china will continue to support sri lanka s interests he also stated that china would always respect sri lanka s sovereignty and that no interference in the country s internal affairs would be tolerated wang stated during his meeting with president gotabaya rajapaksa and his brother prime minister mahinda rajapaksa that china s policy toward sri lanka had always been consistent and that it would continue to be sri lanka s reliable friend all of this however is now a distant memory as sri lanka has gone against the chinese desire to please them despite the fact that it is not widely publicized the current crisis between china and sri lanka is deep but subtle and wang s visit would resolve all outstanding issues nonetheless sri lanka views china as a reliable and long term development partner wang announced a new usd 1 billion concessionary long term loan as well as china s agreement to a phased out debt repayment schedule starting in 2020 china offered a 10 billion yuan 1 5bn usd swap beginning of 2021 these were offers to show that china would stand by sri lanka and not allow outside influences to interfere in its internal matters it means china would protect sri lanka from others who do politics with sri lanka whearas china s interest is only economical aside from the economic interest china has demonstrated beyond a shadow of a doubt that it wants sri lanka to antagonize other countries that are considered china s enemies such as india the united states japan and australia to name a few these countries are keeping a close eye on china s activities in sri lanka and the indo pacific region where the chinese are constructing artificial islands similar to the one they built in sri lanka the port city foreign minister wang was one of many high ranking chinese officials who paid a visit to sri lanka in 2021 wei fenghe chinese defence minister and yang jiechi member of the cpc central committee s political bureau and director of the cpc central committee s office of the foreign affairs commission were also in colombo for bilateral talks between 2020 and 2021 top officials from the united states china and russia visited sri lanka top indian officials also met with the sri lankan government at a high level and signed several development projects and loan facilities for the country a report on the findings recommendations from the meetings of the advisory council was also released by china in his remarks at the meeting of the advisory council of the belt and road forum for intl cooperation 2021 wang spoke highly of the fruitful achievements in belt and road cooperation over the past 8 years in his speech wang took stock of international developments and china s foreign relations during this year including great endeavors made on nine fronts and put forth six priorities of chinese diplomacy in 2022 india sent harsh vardhan shringla the indian foreign secretary and general mm narvane the indian army chief to strengthen india s ties with sri lanka unlike china which is concentrating its efforts on becoming the world s superpower india has been cautiously cooperating with sri lanka not only on bilateral issues but also on a political level to ensure that sri lanka remains a peaceful country in the region india wants sri lanka to be inclusive of all ethnic groups as a result of their shared traditions culture and religions india and sri lanka have a strong political relationship however china asserts that others should not interfere in sri lanka s internal affairs the strong ties sri lanka has with india have either been misunderstood or never understood by china the truth is that china s relationship with sri lanka is not comparable to sri lanka s relationship with india china s only role is to assist sri lanka in its economic development not in its internal affairs or in the fight against india s presence in sri lanka

regardless of what adverts for retail outlets soundtracked by twee piano covers of pop songs tell us various factors mean the reality is often far from the picture perfect ideal we re sold that blend of joy and melancholy means stay another day fairytale of new york and the power of love will endure long after the lyrics to the latest novelty song about sausages have faded from memory five years ago christmas day ended on a sad note with the confirmation of george michael s death i ve got a confession to make as a moody teenager i wasted precious years of my youth convincing myself i disliked george michael s music the 80s smiles and tight shorts era was too cheesy and the 90s weed and facial hair period a bit radio 2 read more festive tv to get through awkward family moments no i was all about real music made by proper bands you know like the libertines these were guys sticking it to the man mainly by singing about people called johnny flophouse or scuzzman jack over out of tune guitars while dressing like topman beefeaters i bought the whole thing hook line and sinker without thankfully ever actually buying the jacket having been born years after the ramones and sex pistols era this was my punk except it wasn t punk not really an infinitely more edgy gesture came a few years earlier courtesy of george michael in 2021 homophobia is still such a significant presence in british society that not a single professional footballer has felt comfortable enough to come out imagine then what the landscape must have been like in 1998 that was the year when he was arrested for engaging in a lewd act with an undercover police officer in a californian public bathroom the british media s reaction veered between cruel jokes and hateful scolding instead of retreating into his shell or in some way submitting to the shame that many believed he should have felt michael s response was defiant and triumphant from lyrics hymning the virtues of outdoor shagging to an in your face video in which he twirled a baton under disco lights in a public bathroom while dressed as an lapd officer everything about his 1998 single outside was a two fingered response to those who ridiculed or condemned him as ben kingsley s character don logan put it in sexy beast it s the sheer f offness of it all over lush buoyant disco michael wholeheartedly embraced his enjoyment of cruising in a song that received frequent uncensored airplay maybe radio commissioners genuinely believed the line i d service the community but i already have you see was about the community service he d recently carried out the song and its accompanying video also served a more serious purpose speaking to attitude magazine in 2004 michael said i know for a fact that when i was 16 or 17 when i started cruising that watching the outside video would have taken some of the weight off my shoulders it told the people who might shame him that their attempts are futile and let those who might have felt ashamed know that they had no reason to be and aside from anything else it remains an absolute banger 23 years on it s one of many in his catalogue including uber hits like wake me up before you go go and underrated gems such as everything she wants impossibly handsome and blessed with a voice like the expensive honey from holland and barrett he could easily have coasted while some stock aitken waterman types churned out three minute hits instead he became one of britain s finest songwriters put the 10 best george michael songs up against those of almost any very important guitar band and he ll come out on top when i was 17 i worked a summer job for a well known scottish home improvements company lying to people over the phone about them winning a fully fitted kitchen when george michael was 17 he wrote the line guilty feet have got no rhythm and one of the most iconic sax solos of all time if you re still not sold on the idea of george michael as a national treasure consider the countless acts of generosity that he performed while actively avoiding public recognition a woman on deal or no deal told us she needed 15k for ivf treatment george michael secretly phoned the next day and gave her the 15k richard osman richardosman december 26 2016 long after becoming one of britain s most high profile musicians he worked in a homeless shelter made huge annual donations to various charities phoned deal or no deal in secret to pay the 15 000 that a contestant said she needed for ivf treatment and after overhearing a woman in a cafe crying about debt wrote a cheque for 25 000 and asked the waitress to hand it over after he d left all life changing contributions and all carried out anonymously he gave a stranger in a cafe 25k as she was crying over debt told the waitress to give her the cheque after he left vectorvictoria v3ct0rv1ct0r december 26 2016 and then there s last christmas landing in that same sweet spot of joy and melancholy as those classics from east 17 the pogues and frankie goes to hollywood it ensures george michael will forever be associated with christmas for happy reasons as well as sad george michael recognised as a genuine national treasure well i guess it would be nice rest in power george

every new fashion trend launching a new collection every time to keep up one of the most recent launches was by pepe jeans which tapped into the increasing trend of travelling or as the md ceo manish kapoor says going out the brand has increasingly been working to ensure that it is on the consumers minds when they choose to travel or go out for any sort of experience kapoor also shared how the industry has seen a massive shift in consumer behaviour where marriage once was an ethnic only occasion but it is now seeing indo western as well as denim with blazers as highly preferred options the consumer is evolving and what they re realising is that for the same pair of apparel there could be multiple uses we as marketers we as brands have also understood that psyche and we have expanded our portfolios he said in a recent interview with exchange4media edited excerpts your most recent spring summer collection 2024 has been stirring great conversations especially with the word wanderlust being a key part of it what birthed this idea i think for this you have to go back to what the campaign is all about we have been noticing this trend among our customers wherein we saw that people today are looking at experiences and when we are talking of experiences effectively it s majorly about travelling it s about going out and when we were thinking about this how do you ensure that you come into the consumers consideration while they re thinking about all these experiences and we have seen it especially during the last twelve odd months apparel or fashion shopping per se has taken a backseat so the idea was to figure out how you get into their mind while they re thinking about all this hence we came up with a tagline which was simple take me somewhere what s further in store for take me somewhere in terms of the media plan we ll be taking the concept beyond the cliche digital media so rather than being just on social or youtube we are getting into newer spaces so if you make a travel booking you will see us on makemytrip if you are going to book let s say a dine out experience on zomato you will see us on zomato so those are some newer avenues that we are exploring since we need to be where our consumer is for us social media is not limited to facebook instagram or youtube all these other apps are also an expression of being social and we want to be present there going further for autumn winter 24 our big focus will be on the women s category and you will see some great marketing action there in terms of celebrity and a lot of other things happening on that side with travel taking up a huge part of consumers lives and terms like discretionary spending becoming more and more common what has the shift in consumer behaviour been like over the years considering you have spent a large part of your career in the fashion apparel industry the premium fashion space is more of a want than a need initially if you looked at branded apparel you would buy it more for the occasion rather than day to day wear and then you would have different brands for different sorts of occasions it has evolved in a way that when you look at marriage as an occasion everything had to be ethnic it was not restricted to just the bride or the groom but everybody around them and then slowly it started changing because marriage is not a single function it s like a three to five day affair there are multiple functions where now you could do indo western at someplace and it came down to a point wherein even denim with a blazer started becoming acceptable the consumer is evolving and realising that for the same pair of apparel there could be multiple uses we as marketers and brands have also understood that psyche and we have expanded our portfolios in terms of how we can offer you wardrobe solutions that are not limited to one single occasion or category the term athleisure has been picking up pace in the fashion industry over the past couple of years what is the consumer demanding athleisure has been a trend which has been there for almost five or seven years it started much before covid gained a lot of traction during covid and now it s moving towards what we call utility very clearly athleisure was a trend now it is becoming a part of the wardrobe for example sports started becoming acceptable as an area wherein people were looking at being fitter and they were embracing sports and that s where sports apparel gained traction but then people were looking at it as i have a sporty lifestyle and then how can i carry it outside of sports so think of it like i want to be sporty but i want to go to a coffee shop we have been doing athleisure for almost five odd years it s a small line and cannot become 50 60 of our business but we do exceedingly well on that particular line we have a line called jim indigo on denim which is primarily knitted denim and a big proportion of our sales today comes from jim indigo 35 36 of our denim sales come from jim indigo overall what demographic of people are your biggest customers if i look at the age group the majority of our sales come from the age segment of 28 to 35 it s close to almost half of our sales another big chunk comes in from the age group of primarily 18 to 27 which has gen z also those are the guys who are shopping more online or interacting with us more digitally when i look at it from a geographic point of view clearly the north contributes to almost 40 42 of our sales this is because the north is the only region which actually gets a pretty decent two and a half three months of winter so the higher proportion is also attributable to our strength in winter wear what share of your ad budget is digital media going to take up going forward this year the reality is that if i were to look at pure spends it s going to become more like 60 digital and 40 traditional but if i look at overall marketing our spending on content will increase multifold so out of a marketing dollar if we were spending something like 4 or 5 on content i think that will increase to 16 18 so it will be an 11 12 jump why the increased inclination to content traditionally a fashion business does a seasonal campaign and that s about it you put all your money onto it and run it probably for 45 60 days for the season you start during the peak shopping time and then end it off after that effectively you are not speaking to the consumer much today the consumer wants to be spoken to effectively every day a lot of it also needs to get personalised so let s say you are a female customer you would always want inputs on what s new in women s wear rather than athleisure or menswear effectively if i am doing 800 options in a season and i need to talk and create content for all the 800 and then i say okay these hundred appeal to a these 150 appeal to b and then i start personalising these options so i think that s the whole realisation wherein this change is happening you also have a presence across retail marketplaces and d2c how is the revenue split between the platforms our revenue split is pretty even 23 24 comes in from retail 25 from e commerce 26 from the large format stores and the balance 23 from regional departmental stores and multi brand stores d2c contributes to around 14 of our e commerce revenue where do you see your d2c business going in the next couple of years for us retail is also d2c since we own that retail i get real time information it is as good as any other d2c media d2c is anything that helps to influence or control the consumer experience that s where our focus is we are at almost 36 d2c at the moment we want the business to be more like 55 d2c in the next three years

this article is more than 2 years old a worker holds a cannabis leaf as she trims cannabis plants that are close to harvest in a grow room at the greenleaf medical cannabis facility in richmond va in june 2021 after a bad year for cannabis stocks viridian capital says 2022 might see more price delines ap photo steve helber associated press after a miserable year for the cannabis sector one wall street firm focused on the industry said investors should prepare for more of the same in 2022 viridian capital advisors a new york financial and strategic advisory firm dedicated to the cannabis market released a report this month outlining its predictions for the u s cannabis market valuations will remain depressed cannabis stocks are cheap on 2021 and 2022 projected results and may get cheaper next year said viridian valuations for u s cannabis companies have compressed so much that companies are trading at an average enterprise value to sales multiple of 2 3 for 2022 and an enterprise value ev to ebitda earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization multiple of 8 0 this is a significant drop compared to the forward looking multiples a year ago of 4 1x and 16 4x respectively said viridian it blamed the price compression on a lack of institutional investment viridian said until this is resolved there will be few catalysts for broad based upside before there will be any significant institutional investment federal legislation must pass giving the cannabis industry access to the u s banking system not only will banks provide capital from institutional investors but will also accommodate trading and custody for assets viridian said it doesn t expect to see such federal legislation until late 2022 possibly after the midterm elections viridian expects valuations to remain compressed for at least the first three quarters of 2022 possible reasons for this compression include concerns over slowing growth because of delays setting up of new recreational cannabis markets in new jersey and new york and the pricing pressure in still developing markets such as arizona illinois massachusetts and michigan we expect execution on expansion initiatives will be a key factor driving returns in the near term as some companies struggle with integrating acquired assets and construction projects in some cases due to challenges beyond their control viridian said in the report the firm said investors should focus on two areas to find outperforming stocks undervalued operators able to gain share by executing on growth initiatives and likely m a targets that can provide a short term pop on takeout the stocks viridian expects to outperform based on execution of growth initiatives include ayr wellness ayrwf goodness growth holdings gdnsf harborside hborf marimed mrmd jushi jushf and tilt holdings tlltf all these stocks trade on the over the counter market which can be illiquid and very risky the firm believes the following companies could be acquisition candidates in the near term while also having attractive growth opportunities in their own right 4front ventures ffntf cansortium cntmf goodness growth harborside lowell farms lowlf and planet 13 holdings plnhf these also trade over the counter viridian said the cheap valuations become even more compelling when considering a longer term outlook and the upside potential as we look to the future years and what the space could be valued at when institutional investors are eventually able to invest without issue and as operators see the fruits of their on going expansion efforts longer term upside potential for investors viridian s conservative forecast for 2023 and 2024 assumes revenues will grow 25 both years with flat margins the firm estimates u s cannabis stocks will trade at ev ebitda multiples of 5 7x for 2023 and 4 6x for 2024 these multiples represent valuations commensurate with more mature industries without high growth opportunities or legislative catalysts ahead said viridian as for the conservative projection of 25 sales growth the current consensus estimates for 2022 revenues project year over year growth of 58 meanwhile 2023 and 2024 should see higher growth given looming launches of recreational cannabis the firm said given the projections of meaningful upside investors should be buying today even in the face of near term pressure in order to capitalize on the reasonable two year potential return there are not many other sectors where investors can justify a two year upside doubling in public companies as we can with cannabis here are viridian s other predictions for 2022 1 the largest multi state operators msos will lose share to smaller operators 2 industry consolidation will accelerate 3 significant legislative progress at the state level including recreational use in populous states will not matter for stock returns 4 declining flower pricing will continue to be a problem however this pressure presents opportunities for brands and service providers 5 software plays continue to garner mainstream institutional investment institutional interest represents a harbinger of what will come for plant touching operators post banking legislation 6 debt will becomes cheaper for even smaller operators capital access will fuel growth and mergers and acquisitions m a 7 international opportunities will

menafn asia times central banks around the globe are ending 2021 with the highest gold holdings in 31 years yet the real story as monetary authorities recalibrate foreign exchange reserve holdings is how the us dollar is on the losing end of these shifts and in the year ahead this trend could become a systemic problem true the dollar s value versus gold has been falling for more than a decade now that s a product of ultraloose federal reserve policies flooding the globe with record liquidity now even as the fed moves to tighten the credit spigot a bit other monetary powers are pivoting to gold the reason is growing concerns that the dollar s reserve currency days are over or at best numbered the 30 year bookmark has become a hallmark of 2021 china s economic growth recently dropped to the lowest levels in three decades us inflation and japan s nikkei stock average both surged to the highest levels since the early 1990s but the 30 year metric that might matter most is central banks shifting from dollars to gold according to the world gold council central bank stockpiles of the yellow metal have now increased by more than 4 500 tons over the past decade at the end of september such reserves totaled 36 000 tons a level not seen since 1990 might all hell break loose for the dollar in 2022 most analysts agree the next couple of months could be kind to the dollar the fed s shift toward tighter policy coincides with the people s bank of china pivoting toward monetary loosening investment strategist manpreet gill at standard chartered bank speaks for many when he says we think the dollar has room for strength at the start of the year but there are at least five headwinds facing the dollar in 2022 and five reasons to worry economist stephen roach s belief that the dollar s crash is only just beginning are looking less hyperbolic by the day as roach former chairman of morgan stanley asia asks why in the world would you own dollar debt stephen roach the former chairman of morgan stanley asia photo wikicommons five reasons to worry let s count the ways one fiscal excess runs amok donald trump s 2017 2021 presidency accelerated the surge in us debt journey toward the 30 trillion mark president joe biden s infrastructure and social spending plans come just as us inflation skyrockets that s putting upward pressure on us treasury yields since the 2008 lehman brother crisis global investors have become accustomed to ultralow us yields one could say in fact that markets came to take dollar risks for granted yet us treasury rates tend to be a one way bet until they re suddenly not as concerns about washington s runaway debt collide with surging inflation and a covid 19 explosion sure to slam the economy that moment could be soon two stock froth is getting irrationally exuberant it was exactly 25 years ago this month that then fed chairman alan greenspan used these words to send a shot across the bow of stock bulls the equity bubbles of the mid 1990s were a mere fraction of where asset markets are heading into 2022 for many years james glassman and kevin hassett wore egg on their faces for writing dow 36 000 back in 1999 yet 22 years and one pandemic later that s where the dow jones industrial average is ending the year what these dreamers missed was the need for untold trillions of dollars of cash from the fed european central bank and bank of japan to make it happen far from a milestone the nosebleed heights us equities are at is a warning sign of trouble to come if the delta variant of covid 19 didn t slam the economy omicron is surely about to get the job done even with the us facing stagflation and the specter of fresh lockdowns economist edward yardeni calculates the s p500 is trading 22 above future earnings irrational indeed three the yuan has the momentum since june 2020 the yuan has risen more than 10 versus the dollar it bellied trump s claims that china was artificially depressing exchange rates on his way out the door in late 2020 trump left beijing off the us treasury s currency manipulator list adding vietnam instead yet the move by central banks to pivot away from the dollar comes just as chinese president xi jinping s effort to internationalize the yuan gains traction not everyone agrees with billionaire hedge fund manager ray dalio s belief the yuan will replace the dollar sooner than conventional market wisdom believes but the bridgewater associates founder makes a plausible case that the changing of the guard many pundits hope would never happen may be afoot four the digital future is now as fed chairman jerome powell experiments with tapering and rate hikes pboc governor yi gang s team is about to roll out a digital currency the first by a major monetary authority china s first mover advantage matters when it comes to rewriting the future of money by february when beijing hosts the winter olympics the pboc hopes to have an e yuan ready for circulation the us europe and japan are lagging far behind the more a digital yuan gains global acceptance the more xi s ambitions to increase china s role in global finance and trade comes to fruition and the more washington frankfurt and tokyo will find themselves playing catch up and investors and central banks might increase their yuan holdings five america s bankers call their loans the cornerstone holders of washington s ginormous debt are all in asia especially japan and china asia s top 10 holders are sitting on about 3 5 trillion of us treasury debt just as inflation surges the most in decades fed chairman jerome powell photo wikicommons questions over treasury holdings reserve currency status is indeed an exorbitant privilege as one time french finance minister valery giscard d estaing famously said with it though comes urgent responsibility now that inflation is perking up the fed needs to ensure it s getting ahead of things otherwise washington s asian bankers might dump treasury holdings en masse the fed does have options says columbia university economist willem buiter simply put he says the additional federal fiscal deficits must be monetized buiter notes that in general team powell has done a great job so far expanding its balance sheet by 70 from march 2020 to january 2021 from 4 2 trillion to more than 7 4 trillion the fed though now must prepare to buy up the federal debt issued by the treasury to fund its latest fiscal ambitions buiter says all told though the dollar is heading into a rather precarious year of uncertainty volatility and more than a few moments of existential dread

anyone who watches closely the ongoing feud between chevy camaro dodge s challenger and blue oval s mustang knows very well that currently it s a two way race so fans of the gm representative might jump at the chance of redemption currently chevrolet s camaro is entrenched in a world of sorrow at least from the sales point of view because when the aftermarket realm gets involved it can easily best any stock gt500 or demon redeye out there with a little help from thorough modifications so it s no wonder that even older generation camaros are easily suspected of being formidable opponents even for a heavily modified nitrous fed whipple supercharged dodge challenger srt demon if one follows closely the drag racing exploits of this flagship muscle car series it s possible to have seen before herman young and his custom soul snatcher he operates in the 1 8 mile category most of the time from his hometown dragstrip xtreme raceway park in ferris texas there he is allegedly not afraid to run against anyone no matter how tough the opponent might seem at first sight so when the crimson fourth generation camaro lined up he knew the owner was fast and even felt like this race might be a toss up between us his fans also know that he s never a man to back down from a race so he simply decided to give out the best performance possible from the cool bespoke dodge demon after a short presentation from the 1 12 mark the regular burnout showcase and a nitrous spray or two it was time to duke it out like there was no tomorrow at least for young and his soul snatcher challenger which even started spitting flames down the runway during the race which kicks off at the 3 40 mark just to make sure everyone saw it gave everything but it was all to no avail unbeknownst to young the crimson camaro gave us the most anticlimax conclusion possible as it never left the start line well that was unexpected
as fertilizer costs continue to rise farmers are working hard to plan and budget for the 2022 growing season fertilizer is a necessity for farmers allowing them to achieve the high yields needed to meet demand and keep their operations afloat according to the american farm bureau federation fertilizer costs have risen as much as 300 in some areas adding significant pressure to farmers pocketbooks it s just so outrageously high it s pretty unreal said richard kitchen a southampton county farmer and member of virginia farm bureau federation s cotton advisory committee kitchen grows cotton peanuts corn soybeans and wheat at plank road farms in courtland he said while he isn t using much fertilizer during the winter he ll have to be strategic in the spring it ll be a lot of sharpening the pencil and deciding what is going to be the best crop mix for the 2022 growing season kitchen said maybe that means not growing as many acres of crops that require a lot of fertilizer afbf explained that increased global demand energy costs increased prices of raw nutrients like nitrogen phosphorus and potassium supply chain disruptions and trade duties are all contributing to sky high prices kitchen added that many farmers had stellar growing seasons with larger yields in 2021 combined with higher commodity prices farmers were in a good position to make extra income money that could be saved or reinvested back into the farm unfortunately a lot of those profits are going to be diminished because you re already going to be spending this money just to buy fertilizer so we re able to farm next year he lamented so where normally we d be excited it s knocking us back a notch in westmoreland county sparky crossman said high fertilizer prices are just another thing for farmers to contend with alongside unpredictable weather pests and other factors that come into play when growing crops when commodity prices go up fertilizer seed and everything tend to follow he explained it goes up quickly and stays there for a while and it s a long time coming back until commodity prices start dropping again crossman owns laurel springs grain corporation in mount holly where he grows corn and grain on about 500 acres he noted that corn requires the most nitrogen and according to afbf nitrogen costs have risen over 159 compared to september 2020 he said farmers will have to tighten their belts crossman added that he may reduce the amount of fertilizer he uses in 2022 it probably wouldn t hurt me for a year or so but if prices stay up there a long time it would really hurt everyone i don t like it but what can we do
advocates in the battle against food insecurity are urging lawmakers to find room in the upcoming utah state budget to increase aid to food banks and other nutrition programs when the utah legislature s 2022 session opens state agencies and social service groups are hoping to make an ad hoc task force formed during the pandemic permanent and that its recommendations will result in new policies in the battle against poverty and hunger alex cragun food security advocate for the group utahns against hunger said the committee brings like minded entities together to fight food insecurity it is a working group of people that lead out on various federal nutrition programs like snap wic and others where they come together and talk about how they can better work together to address issues cragun explained cragun noted sen luz escamilla d salt lake city is planning a bill to turn the informal task force on food security into a permanent entity he said the coalition aims to find another 1 3 million for food banks and to bolster state and federal nutrition programs cragun pointed out gov spenser cox has left the door open in his budget proposal to find additional funds to make infrastructure improvements to dozens of utah food banks as well as help to feed more families while the legislature is still looking at an income tax cut which utahns against hunger opposes the governor s budget provides certain alternative paths to better utilizing some of that funding rather than simply cutting it cragun emphasized cragun added the governor s budget also calls on lawmakers to either mitigate or eliminate the state s food tax which depending on local options added between 2 and 5 to utahns grocery bills he thinks those resources should be aimed at families who fall outside the current benefit programs investment in working utahns and those that needed help and especially those that haven t benefited from federal programs cragun outlined i would mention members

significantly unlike other states missouri has chosen not to retain certain pandemic benefits such as flexible summer meal distribution methods it meant that we could serve more meals in a drive through fashion now it has returned to kids being required to eat the meals on site so that obviously makes it trickier to get the food to as many kids as we could she explained data from missouri kids count show last year 33 of children in st louis lived in poverty and 26 experienced food insecurity meaning their families had no access to sufficient or quality food fundoukos said getting enough healthy food can also be challenging because of such factors as food deserts in rural areas lack of transportation and others that prevent families from reaching available resources she said it s important to understand that parts of the state may not have a local grocer but perhaps just a convenience store with limited perishable items such as fresh produce kids may be getting something to put in their stomachs to sort of stave off the extreme hunger but they re not getting the nutritious food they need to grow and thrive or to even be able to focus in school or sit still and pay
