our earnings release filed with the securities and exchange commission for more information concerning non gaap financial measures and a reconciliation to the most comparable gaap financial measures please now turn out to slide 5 the drybulk market for the midsize segment continued to strengthen in the second quarter on the back of robust demand across the commodity spectrum and especially for grain and infrastructure related cargoes we carry such as cement manganese ore and steel the baltic supramax index rose by almost 60 during the quarter the levels not seen in more than a decade eagle generated a net tce for the second quarter of 21 580 the highest level in 11 years given the rapidly rising market environment we ve been experiencing there s an inherent lag effect between our tce performance and the bsi as we have existing commitments on the books and the majority of our fleet is employed on voyage is lasting up to about 60 days the bsi is currently at its highest level of the year at around 33 000 given our relatively short duration exposure and our active management approach to trading our ships we continue to be successful capturing the majority of the move up on a real time basis as of today we fixed around 75 of our available days for the third quarter at a net tce of 28 300 per day while we generally prefer to utilize ffas as a means to hedge forward exposure due to the increased optionality and provides us with we ve elected to lock in some revenue in the form of time charters on a selective basis as an example earlier this week we fixed one of our 58 000 deadweight supramax vessels for minimum 11 months to 13 months iterative 27 250 per day commencing in october given the deferred delivery this charter will stand at least until september of 2022 please turn to slide 6 in terms of operating performance we achieved our best ever quarterly results producing 62 7 million in ebitda for the three months ending june 30 this represents an increase of 100 compared to the prior quarter and as you can see from the chart it s the fourth sequential quarter of significant ebitda growth given the fixed cost nature of our business essentially all of the incremental net revenue flows to the bottom line we realized an adjusted net income of 40 3 million for the second quarter up fourfold as compared to q1 please turn to slide 7 asset prices have also continued to increase in recent months with values for 10 year old supramaxes is up around 24 on the quarter and approximately 75 year to date this represents the second highest percent six month increase over the last 20 years the first one being in early 2004 at the beginning of the 2000s dry bulk super cycle it s also noteworthy that the increase in values is occurring against a record pace of transactions year to date over 200 mid sized dry bulk vessels have been bought and sold implying an annual run rate of almost 400 ships notwithstanding the dramatic increase in asset prices over the past eight months the chart on this slide would indicate there still remains significant potential upside spot rates are at an 11 year high but asset prices remain well discounted to their levels in 2010 when charter rates were similar to today s levels assuming a return to 2010 type levels we could see upside in second hand values of a further 30 which would of course translate to increase now for the company please turn to slide 8 on the acquisition front as reported separately we purchased two 2015 build scrubber fitted ultramaxes in the early part of the second quarter for total consideration of 44 million to help fund these acquisitions we issued equity under our atm program raising about 27 million at a weighted average of 47 97 per share we currently intend to fund the remaining balance with cash on hand in total we purchased nine ships since november by our estimates the first seven acquisitions are up in value by about 60 while the value on the ships we purchase just 10 weeks ago are up by about 16 together this represents a total increase in value of over 60 million to date we ve taken delivery of six of the acquired vessels with the remaining three expected to deliver between late august and mid september separately and as part of our ongoing fleet renewal we executed an agreement to sell the turn a 2003 build supramax just ahead of our statutory dry dock and ballast water installation due date pro forma for pending smp deliveries our fleet now totals 53 ships averaging 8 8 years of age with 89 being fitted with scrubbers with that i d like to turn the call over to frank who will review our financial performance frank de costanzo chief financial officer thank you gary please turn to slide 10 for a summary of our second quarter financial results the significant improvement in the charter rate environment drove our top line in q2 with revenue net of both voyage and charter hire expenses totaling 99 2 million an increase of 61 from the prior quarter net income came in at 9 2 million for the second quarter earnings per share or eps for the second quarter was 0 76 on a basic basis and 0 74 on a diluted basis beginning this quarter we have added additional non gaap measures adjusted net income and adjusted eps which exclude non cash unrealized gains and losses on derivative instruments as we have discussed we charter in third party ships as part of our active management strategy furthermore we utilize forward freight agreements or ffas to selectively hedge our exposure to the market for both owned and chartered in tonnage although ffa is our great tool to synthetically lock in cash flows they do not qualify for hedge accounting as such all unrealized mark to market gains or losses on hedges for future periods impact current quarter results on a non cash basis however the associated revenues for the ships are only recognized in future periods thereby causing a timing mismatch between revenue recognition in gains losses on hedging instruments we believe that the additional non gaap measures adjusted net income and adjusted eps which exclude the unrealized non cash derivative gains and losses will better reflect our operating performance and improve the compatibility of the periods presented in the financial statements adjusted net income excluding non cash unrealized gains and losses on derivative of 31 million came in at 40 3 million for the second quarter adjusted basic eps came in at 3 31 for the second quarter beginning this quarter in retroactively adjusted for prior periods adjusted ebitda also excludes non cash unrealized gains and losses on derivative instruments as with the above we believe the change better reflects the operational cash flows generated within the respective reporting period adjusted ebitda doubled in q2 coming in at 62 7 million let s now turn to slide 11 for an overview of our balance sheet and liquidity total cash was at 83 8 million at the end of q2 representing an increase of 3 million as compared to the end of the first quarter and a decrease of 5 million from year end the change in cash versus prior quarter in year end was driven by cash generated from our strong operating results equity proceeds of 27 4 million from our atm program offset by vessel acquisitions and debt service i will cover the movements in greater detail on the cash walk slide total liquidity improved by 20 1 million from the prior quarter to 139 8 million total liquidity comprised of total cash of 83 8 million and 56 million of undrawn revolving credit facility please note that subsequent to the quarter end we have repaid the remaining 25 million outstanding on the ultraco revolver bringing our undrawn revolver availability to 81 million as previously reported we have funded the acquisition of one vessel with restricted cash in addition we have secured new debt facilities totaling 51 5 million for six of our newly acquired vessels as of the date of this earnings call we have taken delivery of five of these vessels and have drawn a total of 35 million we have chosen to not complete the third drawdown on our holdco rcf given our strong cash flows from operations total gross debt excluding debt issuance costs at the end of q2 was 500 7 million a decrease of 7 1 million from the prior quarter the decrease is due to the 30 million we repaid on the ultraco debt facility revolver principal repayments of 8 1 million on the ultraco debt facility and 4 million on the norwegian bond debt offset by the 24 million we drew from the holdco rcf and 11 million we drew from the ultraco debt facility third incremental borrowing please now turn to slide 12 for an overview of our cash flow from operations for the second quarter net cash provided by operating activities was 15 3 million in q2 the chart highlights the timing driven variability that working capital introduces to cash flow operations as depicted by the differences between the dark blue bars which are the reported cash from ops numbers and the light blue bars which strip out changes in operating assets and liabilities primarily working capital although as the chart demonstrates the volatility caused by working capital largely even though over time the differences between the two bars this quarter can be explained by the timing of accounts receivables collections as we received 7 5 million in early july please have turns to slide 13 for our q2 2021 tax walk let s focus on the top chart which covers the cash movements between q1 and q2 the revenue and operating expenditure bars are a simple look at the operations moving to the right the 20 million bar representing the cash used in the quarter on margin and collateral on our derivative instruments the 32 million bar for vessel s p represents the acquisition of three vessels for 27 2 million plus deposits paid of 4 4 million for two vessels to be acquired in the third quarter of 2021 the chart at the bottom covers cash movements year to date let s now review slide 14 for our cash breakeven per ship per day cash breakeven per ship per day came into 11 220 for the second quarter vessel expenses or opex came in at 5 020 per ship per day in q2 excluding one time non recurring expenses related to vessel acquisitions in sales opex was negatively impacted by cost associated with the acquisition of three vessels during the quarter in addition we continue to face higher operating expenses related to the covid 19 pandemic across a number of areas including higher lodging and transportation costs related to crew changes and costs related to stores and spares drydocking came in at 357 per ship per day in q2 791 lower than prior quarter as we had fewer vessels drydocking then in q1 it is worth noting that there are significant challenges regarding covid protocols and quarantine requirements for ships going into facilities for drydocking and installation of valves water systems in the like we do not see this abating at the moment and is likely to increase all higher times for these events cash g a came in at 1 624 per ship per day in q2 flat as compared to q1 it is worth noting that our g a per ship calculation is based on our own vessels whereas we operate a larger fleet including our chartered in tonnage if we were to include the chartered in days in our calculation g a per ship per day would decrease by about 161 to 1 463 cash interest expense came in at 1 540 per share per day in q2 which was marginally lower quarter over quarter driven by an increase in ownership days cash debt principal payments came in at 2 679 per ship per day in q2 819 higher than prior quarter the increase is attributable to amortization repayments on our norwegian bond debt which are paid semiannually in q2 and q4 this concludes my comments i will now turn the call back to gary gary vogel chief executive officer thank you frank please turn to slide 16 in q2 we saw rain strengthened in both the atlantic and pacific basins with the magnitude of the move up being much greater in the pacific atlantic market average 22 600 for the quarter up 11 over the prior period while the pacific was up 74 averaging 26 100 as we ve discussed previously pacific outperformance occurs from time to time but generally happens in weaker markets apart from the elevated trade flows we saw within the basin one of the primary reasons why the pacific market outperformed was due to a significant increase in the backhaul trades including cargoes that typically move in containers we estimate up to 10 of all cargo moving on both carriers from the far east to places like west coast south america europe and the us was container cargo spilling into the conventional bulker market as a result of much higher container rates these cargoes include smaller semi finished steel parcels fertilizer in bags bag cement dry chemicals in bags and lumber given the ongoing strength in the container market which is due in part to supply chain inefficiencies we expect this dynamic to continue at least through the balance of the year as we look ahead into q3 both basins have traded higher and the atlantic is outperforming once again driven by a pickup in grain exports from east coast south america as well as a strong mediterranean market in fact the med has now emerged as a primary source of exports on a number of minor bulks such as slag cement gypsum salt and steel products year to date the bsi has averaged 22 600 with the forward curve currently averaging around 31 000 for the balance of the year if the forward curve plays out 2021 would be the best year for the bsi since 2008 please turn to slide 17 fuel prices have continued to increase on the back of increased demand for oil products across the spectrum vlsfo is now trading around 535 per tonne up approximately 65 as compared to 12 months ago as we ve talked about previously 89 of our fleet is fitted with scrubbers and those vessels are able to utilize lower priced hsfo as such the spread between hsfo and vlsfo is an important value driver for eagle as underlying crude and fuel prices have increased so has the spread which currently sits at around 115 per time at this level we generate around 1 400 per day and incremental value across our fleet equating to about 27 million per annum looking ahead we expect fuel prices and spreads to continue to trend higher which should be beneficial for our business please turn to slide 18 net supply growth increased slightly in q2 a total of 118 drive of new building vessels were delivered during the period down about 5 quarter on quarter and 28 year over year partially offsetting this a total of 11 vessels were scrapped during the same period the scrapping figure was down significantly as compared to the prior quarter which is not surprising given the strength in the underlying market in terms of forward supply growth the overall drybulk order book stands at a historic low of just 5 7 for 2021 drybulk net fleet growth is expected to come in at 3 3 this assumes scrapping are roughly 7 6 million deadweight tonnes down from previous guidance and about half of last year s amount again primarily as a result of the stronger rate environment a total of 55 drybulk ships were ordered during q2 down roughly 15 as compared to the previous period although we expect some new ordering given the strength and the underlying spot and period markets we still do not believe it will be material for a number of reasons firstly new building prices are up significantly you now need to pay around 28 million dollars for a chinese ultramax was about 25 higher as compared to just a couple years ago in addition new building slots are scarce with yards busy with orders in the container segments as well as with other vessel types as such a ship order today will likely only be delivered in late 2023 or even 2024 and finally there s significant uncertainty around future regulations regarding emissions and decarbonization together we believe all of these factors will keep ordering fairly limited please turn to slide 19 global growth expectations for 2021 remain at 6 unchanged since our last earnings call for 2022 the imf is estimating global gdp growth of 4 9 which requests a 50 basis point improvement over their previous projection please turn to slide 20 drybulk demand growth has been revised upward since our last earnings call with 2021 growth now estimated at 4 2 up 40 basis points this has been driven primarily by an increase in forecasted trade for grains fertilizer and steel notwithstanding continued uncertainty around covid 19 we remain optimistic about the prospects for continued global growth which is being supported by massive amounts of stimulus this positive demand picture combined with record low order book we discussed earlier supports our constructive view or market developments looking ahead with that i d like now to turn the call over to the operator and answer any questions you may have operator questions answers operator with prepared remarks completed we will now open the line for questions our first question comes from the line of randy giveans with jefferies randy giveans jefferies analyst howdy gentlemen how s it going gary vogel chief executive officer good morning frank de costanzo chief financial officer hey randy randy giveans jefferies analyst good morning hey clearly congrats on a good quarter i ll probably say that again next quarter as well but speaking of next quarter you stated that 75 of 3q 2021 is booked at 28 300 a day i guess if rates stay at these levels or at least above 28 300 any reasons your actual rates would come in below that for example balancing or repositioning or counting variances there and then second part of that question you mentioned one chartered out supermax for about a year at 27 500 i think you said a day quite the rate is that the only tc you currently have and any appetite for additional gary vogel chief executive officer so a fair amount to unpack there and appreciate the words on the quarter so first of all if we talk about q3 and the 28 300 we have cargo on the books as an operator and various things but directionally if the market is stronger you would expect our tce decline compared to when we re booking it previously and of course we re booking in advance being 75 covered in the quarter whereas we re only in early august here so but directionally you re correct but you can t just apply the current rate given that we do have business on the books in addition that we have to cover as we go forward and that s part of the lag that i spoke about but there s nothing like unexpected i guess you could say our county wise our tce calculation is straightforward and i guess you re alluding to the derivatives and that s a separate thing here in terms of the actual tce the only the part of derivatives that go into tce calculation is actual realized ffa and bunker hedges and i think it s important i ll take the opportunity to say that 100 all of our derivatives are hedges there s no speculating that we don t do any speculating at all so anytime there s a cost on a derivative it s matched up notwithstanding basis risks it s matched up to a physical asset on the other side randy giveans jefferies analyst got it ok and then on the time charter outs gary vogel chief executive officer yeah so we do have other charters out we don t disclose all of them and but it s the longest one that we have i ll say that but we do from time to time we look at things from a value standpoint and it s interesting at the moment there s a big dislocation between the ffa curve for next year which for the year stands in the low 18 000s and the rate i mentioned and it s also worth noting that the ship we charted out is a chinese supermax scrubber fitted but still a chinese supermax compared to the index so it s a big dislocation and the ffa curve right now is trading at that discount so we work for maximum value so all things being equal we would prefer to use the ffa market to lock in those cash flows for next year and typically do but when the value is not there we re willing to pivot we have different levers we can pull and so we see that although we re losing that ship in quotes for the period that it s charted out the premium value of it relative to the ffa curve at the moment for a number of reasons is compelling and that s one of the reasons we re doing that randy giveans jefferies analyst got it ok and then i guess next question and last question for the balance sheet right you re in great shape here your net debt is continuing to fall your fleet has grown to pro forma around 54 ships after delivery here with that kind of what do you do now with the free cash is it share repurchases now that your shares are well below nav or maybe a dividend policy that you would start after the 3q earnings what do you do going forward gary vogel chief executive officer yeah i mean first of all i appreciate the question and i m not surprised to have a question on dividends not surprised it s first out of the box so to speak but given the strong environment that we re in and i ll say it this way returning capital to shareholders has been a clear goal of mine of the company since we restructure the balance sheet in early 2016 when i joined the company having said this i ve also said a number of times that i think it s really important that when we do something like a dividend policy we have clear visibility and i think we are in a situation now where there s clear visibility but it needs to be both meaningful and sustainable so as you know as we talked about right we ve just acquired nine ships we still have three we re taking delivery of and we re doing these with limited debt so over the last few months and we ll continue to do so we re taking them i mean these supermax as an example the one supermax still to be delivered we acquired for nine plus million we re putting five million of debt on it and that ship now is worth 17 plus so very limited debt so we re delivering in fact some of the alters we re taking delivery of we re not putting any financing on so we re we ve been focused through these deliveries of strengthening the balance sheet and delivering having said that once we finalize these deliveries i think we re given what i think is clear visibility and strong cash flows i think we ll be in a position to substantively address capital allocation whether that share buyback or dividend so i ll end it with kind of watch this space but i think it s an appropriate question and an important topic going forward randy giveans jefferies analyst ok we will be watching keep up the great work thank you gary vogel chief executive officer thank you randy operator our next question comes from omar nokta from clarksons securities omar nokta clarksons securities analyst thank you hi gary frank good morning gary vogel chief executive officer good morning omar omar nokta clarksons securities analyst hi i just wanted maybe to just a follow up and sorry to press a little bit on randy s question but i guess as we do think about it obviously you guys have built eagle up into a much stronger company sort of a very healthy place at this point and you mentioned the nine vessel acquisitions taking them in you ve got the three more waiting to get those in house and then addressing potential return of capital whether it s dividends or share buybacks i guess what is i guess should we should i take from that that maybe once you take these next three ships that you re done buying vessels and that the next thing is going to be returning capital or is it more of ok we re going to take these three ships and then we re going to figure out what to do going forward either buy more vessels or pay out dividends gary vogel chief executive officer yes i mean that s fair i would say it this way i think we re very comfortable with the nine ships that we ve acquired i would never want to say that we re done but we don t feel that we need to continue to acquire vessels at this point there s been a significant appreciation in value and i think there s more potentially to go but it s not a it s not really a focus of ours right now to add to that number given the significant appreciation so like i said i don t want to exclude that if there s an opportunity then that we wouldn t of course pursue that but we feel quite comfortable with the pro forma 53 ships including the one that we sold the older ship and need to deliver so yes i ll leave it at that but yeah i ll stop there omar nokta clarksons securities analyst yes no that s clear i appreciate that gary and then just wanted to just follow up i noticed that one of the supermax is you agreed to buy back in february i think the initial delivery window was until may but that looks that slipped into the third quarter here and any read through into that any concern or risk that that deal doesn t go through i know you ve guys got at a very good price relative to where things are today gary vogel chief executive officer yes and quite observing and in fact the ship got delayed because of operational delays at the load port and but we actually are being compensated for that late delivery and we expect the delivery to take place within the next few weeks within august so the answer is you know it s definitely late but as i said we re being compensated for that under the agreement omar nokta clarksons securities analyst got it ok thanks gary that s clear gary vogel chief executive officer thank you operator our next question comes from greg lewis with btig greg lewis btig analyst hey thank you good morning everyone gary vogel chief executive officer good morning greg lewis btig analyst good morning not going to dwell on capital allocation but thanks for that i guess gary i have a question and it kind of you know it kind of piggybacks on omar s comments about the vessel being delayed and piggybacks on some of frank s comments about vessels been stuck in drydocking and i guess what i m wondering is is there any sense to figure out whether it s covid related or supply with just you know all the supplies ceramic is there any way to kind of back into a rough number of how much of the fleet is being artificially underutilized because of all these ongoing global issues and if you guys spend any time thinking about that just whether it s in drydocks or port being stuck at ports or any kind of thoughts around that gary vogel chief executive officer yes it s a good question an important point i mean we don t have an aggregate number but we re definitely seeing considerable delays in china around constantly changing quarantine protocols from port to port and so that s having an impact and a positive impact in terms of fleet utilization of course it s a negative on when it affects your ships specifically and the ship is delayed and not earning revenue especially in a 30 000 plus a day market but overall there s definitely delays there and then you overlay that with the fact that a significant portion of the fleet still needs to install ballast water treatment systems over the next year and a half i think is also bodes well or negatively for the fact that you re going to have more ships backing up because that s a statutory requirement without really any flexibility so and same with drydocks right there can be for extenuating circumstance a an expansion but it s not it can t just keep happening so i think we re going to continue to see that until some of these protocols are lifted and at the moment we just don t see that there s also delays for bulk carriers of the panama canal and particularly the neo panama canal which is which is also having an impact but i don t have a an aggregate number for you but i think they are impactful definitely greg lewis btig analyst ok great and then just looking kind of at the ffa curve and any progress into the back half of the year i mean it looks like it s in contango and then i guess really tails off as you guys think about your ffa you are trading ffa portfolio like how long is there do you guys have a limit and how far out you re thinking about going in that with that how you manage that portfolio i guess i m wondering like i looked at 2022 and i see some healthy rates out on the curve is that something we think about taking advantage of or this is more we kind of operate more on the shorter end of the curve gary vogel chief executive officer yes i mean we use the faa strictly as i said strictly as a hedge so if we charter in a ship for a year let s say a good example would be one year with an optional year we can sell a derivative at the same level effectively locking in a breakeven for the first year we ve created what we call asymmetric optionality by having a free option right we still trade the ship for the year and we can hopefully add incremental value around it but we re not exposed to the market so typically our ffas go out about a year when we do a ship a one year charter or one option one we could do longer if there s a longer charter but it s pretty backward data down as i said 18 000 we don t think that s fair value at the moment given where physicals are so you couldn t charter in a ship today for a year and selling ffa because you d be on the wrong side of 4 000 or 5 000 given where we charter out that supermax so at the moment that that play doesn t work but at times it does so typically i d say a year we re not limited to a year but again that markets pretty backward dated and so for that reason it s just not that attractive right now so that hopefully that gives you an answer but it s strictly on a hedging basis so there s got to be a reason on a physical asset why we want to enter into that ffa greg lewis btig analyst ok great and then just your comment maybe now s not the best time to be acquiring vessels i mean at this point it seems like pretty much all of your your older vessels are trying to add a fleet i mean i guess is there ll be opportunities on the as we look at on the older edge of your fleet to maybe continue to trim some of those vessels and take advantage of the higher asset fleet market or at this point you do really like the mix gary vogel chief executive officer no we ve i believe we ve stated clearly there s two ships that we have that are 17 years old and then beyond those frank de costanzo chief financial officer beyond those gary vogel chief executive officer no i feel no beyond those few ships our next oldest ships 12 5 years old and we re very comfortable with that so i don t see us monetizing those assets because of age now if we get to a point in this cycle where we feel asset values and i by the way although we re not out there and with a need i think to continue to grow this fleet i believe it s we believe there s significant upside to asset values because of the strength in the market and also where we are relative to historic so that we talked about so i m still a believer in asset value appreciation here but we ve got 53 ships already but the answer is at some point in the cycle would we be willing to sell a number of ships and get smaller if we felt it was the right thing from a capital standpoint and monetizing some of the value of course as values are driven by future cash flow the answer is yes but not at this point in the cycle we re quite constructive greg lewis btig analyst ok perfect super helpful thank you everybody gary vogel chief executive officer all right thank you operator our next question comes from j mintzmyer with value investor s edge j mintzmyer hi good morning gary thanks for taking the questions gary vogel chief executive officer good morning j j mintzmyer yes i think we covered the base a little bit earlier on the line but i noticed you mentioned that 2430 days as 16 000 a day you ve mentioned second half 2021 through 2022 do you have any sort of a breakdown of where those are going to layer in is a lot of that front loaded or is it pretty even gary vogel chief executive officer yeah fair question we re actually going to provide that in the q so when it gets filed you ll see a breakdown of by quarter and into next year so you ll have full clarity on that j mintzmyer ok outstanding and it ll be helpful and related to that you have a collateral post on your balance sheet is that just a accounting measure or is that actually required collateral due to let s say counterparties gary vogel chief executive officer yeah no that s real collateral it s held that the banks in which we use to utilize ffa everything s cleared so it s actual real real cash j mintzmyer ok thanks gary and then final question you have these convertibles now that are clearly in the money but there s it seems like there s really no way to force those conversions is there anything you can do with those because i mean otherwise you just sit out there right you re paying 5 interest on them and they really kind of pull down your reported earnings so anything you can do to incentivize that conversion or get those out of the way or you just stuck with them for three more years gary vogel chief executive officer well i mean potentially we can buy them in the open market but as you said there s no ability to force a conversion but the calculation is as you they re in the money so i think it s the general view is that they ll be converted at some point and the coupon on it is 5 25 but yes they re sorry five to 5 sorry anything else frank you want to add to that frank de costanzo chief financial officer no no no you ve covered it well gary gary vogel chief executive officer thank you j mintzmyer all right thanks gary and then just one thing on dividends real fast because i think i m the last person thinking forward on that obviously you got to wait make sure things are sustainable but would that be maybe like a fixed sort of policy or do you think it would be more so variable based on cash flows and earnings ant sort of thoughts on how dividend would look theoretically gary vogel chief executive officer yeah i mean ultimately the board will make a decision as to what it what it looks like if we implemented dividend policy but what i ve said from my view is it needs to be sustainable so if there s going to be a fixed portion to it it needs to be relatively low given the volatile long term cyclical volatile nature notwithstanding the strength in the market and our view on the forward market i do believe this is what is still a cyclical business and so i think variability is an important part whether it s part at all i think that that s really important because it needs to be sustainable and i ve said before i feel strongly that it s like we get a lot of questions why we don t have a dividend but it s better to not have one than to have one and then have to have to cut it or stop it completely so that s really the i think the main driver is whatever we do we want it to be sustainable j mintzmyer certainly makes sense thanks gary thank you gary vogel chief executive officer all right thank you operator our next question comes from poe fratt with noble capital markets poe fratt noble capital markets analyst great thanks thanks for covering ffas i had a question about the timing too but frank and gary when you look at the triggers or potential catalysts for the second half of the year one thing that you have is the norwegian bonds that are still high cost and i m sorry if you address those earlier i wasn t on in the full presentation but can you talk about refinancing those bonds frank de costanzo chief financial officer sure poe it s frank here i ll take that one yes we re going to refinance them within this year 2021 the markets that we have available to us continue to improve the bank market the bond market so our options are wide opening and getting better so we will take that out and likely whatever replaces it will be very attractive poe fratt noble capital markets analyst great and then gary you talked about second hand values moving up not as attractive from an acquisition standpoint when do newbuilds potentially get attractive for you frank de costanzo chief financial officer well i think the answer is i don t think they do and so i ve been kind of on my soapbox saying we re not going to be ordering ships since i joined eagle and the main driver of that was we have the world had enough tribal ships and clearly that was shown with the challenging market that we worked through for the first five years i was here having changed my view that we don t we don t need more ships so first of all for a couple of reasons ships you order today won t come at least till the end of 2023 or 2024 so i think we have a nice window here before that happens but ordering a ship today that ship will only be 10 years or 11 years old in 2035 the uncertainty around future fuel regulations and carbon tax and decarbonization is extraordinary i think the risks that tell risk on an asset which historically is a 25 year to 26 year lifespan given that on zero emission ships coming i just i don t see eagle participating in new builds really i can t see a scenario where that would make sense for us we feel really good about we ve required 29 ships and except for the three supramax s all ultramax s between zero years and five years old so we think that s really a sweet spot for having ships that the ships were acquiring say a 2015 build ship right is going to be 20 years old and 2035 a much better risk profile given the changes that are of course coming so i just don t see a scenario where eagle will be ordering ships and although as this market strengthens there s continue there will be pressure and there will be some ordering the people ordering those ships are going to need to wait now two to three years to get those ships so you need to be pretty confident in his market sustaining not just for the next year and half two years but beyond and into that delivery window so we feel we feel pretty good for those reasons that supply is going to stay relatively muted but of course there will be some ordering that i m sure poe fratt noble capital markets analyst just maybe cement but would you think how would you would you consider buying ultra out of the order book the same as ordering a new one or would you consider that as just essentially taking something out of the orderbook and it doesn t actually incrementally add to what the visible suppliers out there to cement frank de costanzo chief financial officer no it s an interesting question we did take delivery of one resale but that was actually a contract that was defaulted on back in 2016 at the bottom of the market and the ship was completed i think that s a little different than buying a resale of a keel that was laid let say six months ago and it s coming in a couple years i don t see us buying i think the sweet spot for us is still if we were to acquire ships is still that that three to five year old ultramaxes for the reasons i mentioned so i ll never say never because there we don t know what the environment and landscape might look like but i just i just don t really see that being a high probability for eagle bulk poe fratt noble capital markets analyst great thanks gary gary vogel chief executive officer thank you operator our next question comes from liam burke with b riley liam burke b riley securities analyst thank you good morning gary good morning frank gary vogel chief executive officer good morning liam frank de costanzo chief financial officer good morning liam liam burke b riley securities analyst gary your fleet is pretty versatile you can handle both major and minor bulks as you look in through the end of the year and into 2022 is there any particular area that makes you feel a lot better about how the demand side of the equation is going to be gary vogel chief executive officer yeah i mean what makes me feel good about the demand side is how broad it comes across the commodities i mean sometimes you ll see a disparity between major bolts and minor bolts right but if we look at this year they re both 4 3 4 1 and if we look across there s a lot of cargo a lot of commodities that are growing in the 3 to 5 range so the fact that we re seeing it across the board is is i think really positive as opposed to being driven by let s say grain movement because of drought somewhere or rains and things like that so that s that s i think what s really compelling this time on the demand and of course it s being supported by stimulus and a lot of that stimulus we re seeing infrastructure spend and infrastructure spend takes a long time it doesn t just happen in three or six months so cargos that were moving like cement cement clinker

decade motley fool stock advisor has tripled the market they just revealed what they believe are the ten best stocks for investors to buy right now and enerplus resources fund wasn t one of them that s right they think these 10 stocks are even better buys see the 10 stocks stock advisor returns as of june 7 2021 with that i will turn it over to ian ian dundas president and chief executive officer thank you drew good morning all our second quarter results reflect the increased scale of our business following our acquisitions along with strong operational momentum we achieved record quarterly production of over 115 000 boe per day in the second quarter 26 higher than the prior quarter we expect another meaningful sequential increase to production in the third quarter which will be the first quarter that fully reflects our two bakken acquisitions which closed in the first and second quarters of the year the second quarter was our most active period of the year in terms of drilling and completions activity and the execution of our capital plan remains on track we move the midpoint of our annual production guidance higher by 500 boe per day following strong execution and outperformance year to date and we continue to operate within our capital spending guidance of 360 million to 400 million our free cash flow profile is continuing to move higher driven by the improved commodity prices since the start of the year our increased production outlook and our disciplined capital allocation we now expect to generate over 450 million in free cash flow in 2021 based on forward stripped commodity prices for the remainder of this year we will continue to prioritize directing the majority of this free cash flow for debt reduction we have highlighted a 400 million debt reduction target which aligns with our net debt to funds flow ratio target of one time or less in a 50 wti oil price environment at current commodity prices we anticipate achieving this target by mid next year with the step change in our cash flow generation driven by our significantly higher production base and the line of sight to hitting our long term debt target we elected to increase the dividend for the second time this year consistent with our approach of sustainable dividend increases our board also approved a renewal of our normal course issuer bid under our framework we expect to allocate approximately 90 of our free cash flow after dividends to debt reduction while we progress our deleveraging plan with the remaining 10 we will continue to evaluate incremental shareholder returns including through the further potential dividend increases and share repurchases looking ahead as we achieve our long term debt target we expect to be in a position to meaningfully increase our allocation of free cash flow to shareholder returns i will leave it there and turn the call over to wade for his comments wade hutchings senior vice president and chief operating officer thanks ian and good morning everyone our operational performance this year continues to be solid we completed and brought 23 wells on production in the bakken in the second quarter and our completions efficiency is averaging approximately 13 stages per day up from nine and a half last year our drilling performance has also been strong we set a company record in the second quarter drilling a two mile lateral section in 48 hours on the back of this performance we updated our 2021 well cost estimates in the bakken to a 5 7 million compared to our previous estimate of 6 1 million this represents a significant reduction in our cost structure over the last couple of years we are down 10 compared to last year and 25 compared to 2019 as ian noted we achieved record quarterly production in the second quarter which was driven by higher volumes in the bakken following the closing of our acquisitions and our active completions program total williston basin production was over 72 000 boe per day in the quarter 53 higher than first quarter production in the second quarter we completed our first pad of wells that were acquired in connection with the bruin acquisition this was an eight well pad in fort berthold adjacent to our legacy acreage the wells are tracking expectations with peak 30 day rates of approximately 1 900 boe per day on average per well based on the six of the eight wells that have had more than 30 days online we anticipate the third quarter to be another record production quarter for enerplus we expect to see strong bakken production growth following another quarter of active completion operations and the full production impact of the assets we acquired from hess which closed in mid q2 i ll now pass the call to jodi jodi labrie senior vice president and chief financial officer thanks wade our second quarter adjusted funds flow was 184 million with capital spending of 130 million and resulting in free cash flow of 54 million our realized bakken oil price differential averaged 2 76 per barrel below wti in the second quarter refining demand was strong and there continues to be significant available pipeline capacity in the basin supporting pricing effective august 1 we have increased our committed capacity to deliver crude oil from north dakota to u s gulf coast by the dakota access pipeline as part of its broader system expansion the pipeline s capacity was recently expanded from 570 000 barrels per day to 750 000 barrels per day based on comments from the pipeline operator enerplus now has approximately 10 000 barrels per day of firm transportation on dapl based on our year to date realizations in the bakken and improved outlook for differentials given dapl s expansion we ve narrowed our annual differential guidance to 2 35 per barrel below wti from 3 25 per barrel previously turning to the marcellus our realized marcellus natural gas price differential was 0 89 per mcf below nymex in the quarter significantly weaker than the prior quarter due to a combination of normal seasonality we see in the u s northeast markets and unplanned regional pipeline maintenance as a result we have widened our annual marcellus natural gas price differential guidance to 0 65 per mcf below nymex from 0 55 per mcf previously we expect differentials to remain relatively weak in the third quarter and then strengthen through the fourth quarter as regional demand increases heading into winter we recorded a current tax expense of 4 2 million in the second quarter primarily consisting of u s federal tax as a result of higher income expected in the u s in 2021 for the full year we expect income tax expense of between 5 million and 7 million turning to our free cash flow outlook we expect free cash flow generation to materially increase in the second half of the year on a full year basis we estimate that we will generate over 450 million based on current commodity prices with 117 million in free cash flow generated during the first half of 2021 that points to over 330 million in the second half of the year priority no 1 for this free cash flow is the balance sheet as we work toward reducing our current net debt at june 30 by 400 million although we are prioritizing debt reduction we remain in a strong financial position today and this gives us the flexibility to enhance our return of capital to shareholders in the near term we announced a 15 dividend increase today and we also announced that we would allocate 10 of our free cash flow after dividends to incremental shareholder return opportunities while we are progressing on our deleveraging plan this could come in the form of additional dividend increases and or share repurchases and as ian mentioned our board has approved the renewal of our normal course issuer bid for up to 10 of our outstanding shares finally as an update to the five year plan that we introduced in april we have updated 2021 to reflect the year to date commodity prices and forward strip for the balance of this year the remaining years 2022 to 2025 continue to be based on a flat 50 to 55 wti oil price with this update our cumulative free cash flow estimate over the five year period increased to 1 50 billion to 2 billion i will leave it there and we ll turn the call over to the operator and open it up for your questions questions answers operator thank you your first question comes from greg pardy from rbc capital markets greg please go ahead greg pardy rbc capital markets yeah thanks good morning maybe just the first question might be for wade and from everything you re saying in terms of the reduction in d c cost it really sounds like it s just increased efficiency like less time but i m wondering if you ve made any changes to either the well construction or how you re completing these wells just curious there wade hutchings senior vice president and chief operating officer sure happy to address that the wells that we drilled and completed in the first and second quarters of this year really follow the design that we ve had for the last several years so there s no material change there when we look at the rate of change from last year that kind of dropped from 6 3 to where we re projecting this year to be at 5 7 we re seeing about half of that on the drilling side and half on the completion side most of that is from just improved efficiencies on multiple stages multiple aspects of drilling and completions i would note that there is an important part of that on the drilling side that s come from essentially a new contract with the existing super spec rig that we ve been using for the last several years and so we re benefiting from kind of the change in the market rates for that as of earlier in this year relative to several years ago when we signed that up so we are certainly pleased we ve actually saw improvements in our completion efficiency and drilling efficiency at a faster pace than we were even anticipating greg pardy rbc capital markets ok terrific wade thanks for that and then maybe just shifting to the cash taxes i m wondering if there s a rule of thumb we can use maybe this is more about 2022 jodi but i m wondering is there like a percent of pre tax we should think about in terms of cash tax next year jodi labrie senior vice president and chief financial officer yeah i think maybe if you just want to rule of thumb you could think of call it 1 of net operating income in the u s that would be in the ballpark greg pardy rbc capital markets ok great and last question for me is kind of ian i mean strategically other things being equal would you prefer to consolidate further in the bakken or is the company maybe approaching a size where you re thinking more about basin diversity and i m thinking oil and liquids basin diversity more so than the marcellus ian dundas president and chief executive officer morning greg while with your setup of everything being equal more bakken clearly fits the bill we ve got an established footprint we see value and scale we think the setup in the bakken is really pretty encouraging costs are under control differentials are tightening and so that would clearly be the focus areas today greg pardy rbc capital markets ok terrific thanks very much ian dundas president and chief executive officer thanks greg operator your next question comes from patrick o rourke from atb capital patrick please go ahead patrick o rourke atb capital markets hey good morning i m just wondering now that you ve had your hands on the steering wheel for call it a quarter here with the new asset wondering if you can give us your view on kind of where the bakken base decline is sitting obviously it seems like you have some comfort with it in order to increase the lower end of the production guide for the year and then wondering how with where the well costs are now appears that you re offsetting any sort of inflationary pressures with efficiencies as you mentioned with the last question here where you would see the maintenance capital level at a corporate level right now ian dundas president and chief executive officer yeah morning patrick so to decline it s consistent with what we had forecast corporately low 30s i guess that was part and parcel of bringing it bottom in the guidance there s a lot of things that move there though obviously relative to the timing of on streams and then their downtime and everything else that hits you maintenance capital we don t have a firm number out there but we pointed to i think 500 million next year sets up 3 to 5 growth sort of start back off that growth and around 400 million i think it s a good round number to think about and just maybe just a sort of comment our ability to offset inflationary costs i think we re actually doing a very good job on it there is a bit of pressure in the market and you re hearing this other producers talk about it as well steel and like and so if you really got under the hood and you look really closely at year to date well performance we would be a bit ahead of that number that we re putting out there so we have built in we ve anticipated some modestly higher costs over the course of the year and then that gets you to that 5 7 and the big picture here is we continue to do a really good job growing great efficiencies and we are sort of eating into and in fact year to date more than leading into any inflationary pressures we re seeing patrick o rourke atb capital markets ok great and then ian you re always very thoughtful on your approach to the commodities so i would like to hear your view on this you re using a bandwidth of 50 to 55 right now for your kind of five year plan and just wondering what you would have to see in the market out there to shift that to something a little bit higher and incorporate that in your business planning and the way you re allocating capital ian dundas president and chief executive officer yeah i don t get cold thoughtful very often so it s a good way to start the day i think there s a few things here in absolutely inherent in all of this is thinking our way through sustainability and thinking about volatility so we re just not that smart and there are a lot of things that are up there that can move those prices around a little bit so we re using what we think are mid cycle prices to guide our business and as we think about higher price environments we will take advantage of some of that through hedging strategies and the like so what would if we had a strong strong view of a higher market would that influence activity behaviors i don t know that it would honestly some of the things we do we only have a very strong view on the market and if the board market is not there to be able to mitigate some of that that would meet any activities we have as you think about things like as we realize look right now we are realizing higher prices meaningfully higher prices than that but our forecast is not money in the bank and so we are very cognizant of actual results versus forecast so i don t think there s anything sort of fundamentally out there that we would do dramatically different and in fact if in the strong rise like you can easily create a stronger price forecast than 50 to 55 i think it s very plausible i think it s actually potentially likely with that probably comes higher inflationary assumptions that we re baking in now so we ll be balanced on this and we think that our goal is to be able to make money in all cycles and that means conservative balance sheet management focusing on returns using risk management tools to take price risk out of the equation as we are spending dollars and so that s what sort of guided us for years and is going to continue to guide us in the future but i think the oil set up feels pretty good right now and if you told me we were averaging about 55 i wouldn t bet against that over the next couple of years guess we ll see patrick o rourke atb capital markets ok thank you thanks again ian dundas president and chief executive officer thanks patrick operator your next question comes from cody kwong from stifel cody please go ahead cody kwong stifel financial corp analyst hi guys thanks for taking my call i ve got a question for probably for ian when you guys were talking about your free cash flow priority being 90 debt 10 return of capital until you get to your debt threshold that you want how does that change once you meet that target and if you can maybe expand upon that whether it s through just kind of in theory or if you had some actual numbers that you had in your mind ian dundas president and chief executive officer yeah cody thanks for the question i think we ll stay away from numbers here the concepts that we ve laid out 90 to debt once we re through that level which could be within a year possibly the signal that we ve sent is we see higher returns to shareholders we haven t put a pin in what exactly that looks like in part because if you want to look at the environment you re in at the moment and how competing priorities exist but we do think we ve got a really attractive plan that grows the company and puts us in a great position to delever and to continue to provide capital to shareholders the tools that we ve highlighted things that we think are important a growing rock solid sustainable base dividend we think is something that will be really attractive to shareholders which means it needs to sustain price volatility as well so we re on the path to continuing to move that forward we also think share buyback plays a role and we think it particularly plays a role when you look at the valuations of our company we see significant intrinsic value that we plan on unlocking in share buyback and plays a nice role in that it also helps support the sustainability of the base dividend and keep your capital structure strong so i guess those are the principles that are guiding us there s others out there who have a variable dividends and specials and those things and yes we ll remain attuned to the market and those sorts of things but right now i think sustainable growing base dividend i think share buybacks particularly when we see the valuation that we re seeing right now and then i think once we ve hit our debt targets more coming for shareholders and then we ll work to provide more visibility as we get closer to that as to what more looks like cody kwong stifel financial corp analyst thank you very much operator ok there are no further questions at this time i ll turn it back to ian for closing remarks ian dundas president and chief executive officer well thank you everybody appreciate you dialing in today enjoy the last little bit of summer for those canadians who are watching the gold medal soccer match sweden i won t say anything about it enjoy the rest of your day thank you very much operator duration 23 minutes call participants drew mair

turn the call over to jerry to say a few words on his announcement before getting into the 2021 second quarter financial results jerry barbato chief financial officer thanks kurt and good morning everyone it has been a privilege to work with the cronos team and i m proud of all we have accomplished over the last several years i know that under bob s leadership and with support of the outstanding teams across the organization the company is well positioned to lead the global cannabis industry and capture the significant opportunities ahead i will now move to a discussion of our 2021 second quarter financial results the company reported consolidated net revenue in the second quarter of 2021 of 15 6 million a 58 increase in the prior year period revenue growth year over year was primarily driven by the continued growth in the adult use canadian cannabis market and increased sales in the israeli medical market consolidated gross loss for the second quarter of 2021 was 15 8 million a 12 9 million increase in losses from the second quarter of 2020 the increase in losses versus prior year was primarily driven by an increase in inventory write downs in the rest of world segment which totaled 12 million in the second quarter of 2021 versus 3 1 million in the second quarter of 2020 the impact of strategic price reductions on various adult use cannabis products in canada taken in the second half of 2020 as well as start up costs associated with new product development in the rest of world segment adjusted ebitda loss for the second quarter of 2021 was 49 8 million representing a 22 8 million increase in losses from the second quarter of 2020 the increase in losses year over year was primarily driven by an increase in gross loss as previously explained an increase in sales and marketing spend due to brand development in the u s segment and an increase in r d driven by spending on product development and developing cannabinoid it in the rest of world segment turning to our reporting segments in the rest of world segment we reported net revenue in the second quarter of 2021 of 13 4 million a 74 increase from the prior year period revenue growth year over year was primarily driven by the continued growth in the adult use cannabis flower market in canada and sales in the israeli medical cannabis market gross loss for the rest of world segment for the second quarter of 2021 was 16 4 million a 12 9 million increase in losses from the second quarter of 2020 the increase in losses versus prior year was primarily driven by an increase in inventory write downs the impact of strategic price reductions on various adult use cannabis products in canada taken in the second half of 2020 as well as start up costs associated with new product development adjusted ebitda loss in the rest of world segment for the second quarter of 2021 was 32 6 million representing a 14 million increase in losses from the second quarter of 2020 the increase in losses was primarily driven by an increase in gross loss and an increase in r d costs turning to the u s segment we reported net revenue in the second quarter of 2 2 million and gross profit of 0 6 million both of which were roughly flat to the prior year period adjusted ebitda loss in the u s segment for the second quarter of 2021 was 10 7 million representing a 5 9 million increase in losses from the second quarter of 2020 the increase in losses was primarily driven by an increase in sales and marketing costs related to brand development overall cronos group reported an increase in net income versus the prior year period primarily due to the change in fair value of the financial derivative liabilities associated with altria s investment which is described in more detail in the 10 q in the second quarter of 2021 the company recorded a noncash gain of 115 2 million related to the change in fair value of these financial derivative liabilities cronos continues to expect there may be significant reported earnings volatility primarily driven by the fair value quarterly adjustments related to the movement of cronos group s stock price turning to the balance sheet the company ended the quarter with approximately 1 1 billion in cash and short term investments which is down roughly 142 million from the first quarter of 2021 as a reminder as kurt discussed during his prepared remarks we deployed approximately 110 million to acquire an option for a 10 5 stake in pharmacann during the second quarter of 2021 which drove a significant portion of the sequential decrease in cash and cash equivalents capital expenditures for the quarter were 2 1 million with the spending focused across our global strategic priorities we remain committed to deploying capital in a disciplined manner and only in ways that align with our strategic priorities i continue to be encouraged by the work our teams are doing globally with that i ll turn it over to kurt for closing remarks before q a kurt schmidt president and chief executive officer thank you jerry despite the ongoing challenges posed by the pandemic our industry continues to show resilience against this backdrop we continue to bring high quality and novel products to market under our brands in the u s canada israel and germany with our balance sheet existing cbd infrastructure our strategic investor along with our success and insights ready to releverage from all other markets we are confident we are well positioned to be a best in class cannabis company in any market we compete with that let s open the line for questions questions answers operator your first question comes from the line of andrew carter with stifel andrew carter stifel financial corp analyst hey thank you good morning i guess i wanted to ask and maybe i m beating a dead horse asking about the gross margin here it continues to be underwhelming so i just wanted to ask what kind of signs we should see to start to see a stronger performance in this line is the innovation going to be margin accretive are you in a position on your kind of third party cost to where that can be profitable or do you have the right price points anything you can help us on this gross margin line thanks jerry barbato chief financial officer thanks andrew the way that we think about it we definitely had inventory write downs this quarter of 12 million and we continue to evaluate the competitive landscape in concert with consumer preferences to drive product innovation and i think that s what really hampered our margins in the quarter as kurt talked about in prepared remarks we re definitely seeing green shoots in terms of our revenue and innovations with gmo cookies in the flower category and our sourz in the edibles and obviously the ginkgo cannabis products that we re going to be launching later in the year andrew carter stifel financial corp analyst ok second question switching gears a little bit i mean the headset data we ve seen has validated a very strong performance by spinach in ontario and alberta in particular so i guess one question i have we know it s a volatile supply chain in canada are the reorder with the strength are the reorders keeping up with your expectations are the retailers able to reorder and get it from the provinces and the provinces coming to you could you kind of help us out with that kurt schmidt president and chief executive officer yes you re right sourz is doing really well we have two skus in the top five and three in the top 10 the early success has been very good and we feel confident we can handle the demand again we weren t first in market with the gummies we spent some time trying to get this thing right but the early results speak for itself as far as bringing this high quality product and that confidence has led us that we believe our first rare cannabinoid launch of with cbg will be under the sourz brand under the edibles brand andrew carter stifel financial corp analyst yes but my real question is i get the strength my real question is is the supply chain are you really seeing the commensurate reorders or is it just kind of more of the same volatility like we kind of see from the supply chain kurt schmidt president and chief executive officer yes well it s early days but clearly the feedback from the trade is excellent so that s a sure indication that the reorder should be strong as we bring these consumers into the category and more of them experience and with the marketing programs that we re doing there to educate on the product so we feel pretty bullish because the product is delivering i mean we get very good feedback that the product is delivering and that s a really good sign for repeat andrew carter stifel financial corp analyst thanks i ll pass it on mike gorenstein executive chairman it s mike just to add to that i think things have certainly improved in canada as the covid restrictions have been lifted so a lot of the supply chain challenges that you ve heard about with provinces were related to the more intense lockdowns in canada versus the u s operator our next question comes from the line of rahul sarugaser with raymond james rahul sarugaser raymond james analyst good morning kurt jerry mike thanks so much for taking our questions and also a big welcome to bob so this is terrific news that cronos fermentations called through cbg will be included in the spinach gummies before the end of this year particularly given that ginkgo itself has been highlighting his partnership to cronos in its own upcoming public listing so my first question is how is the ginkgo cronos partnership evolving toward the development of additional culture cannabinoid and when do you expect this broadened portfolio to fungible molecules to be included in cronos products in canadian or potentially even u s shelves kurt schmidt president and chief executive officer yes again we shifted our strategy we talked about in the last call the focus on the rare cannabinoids and you re seeing we re progressing our first one cbg with that launch coming upcoming so we feel very good that we re on track to deliver for these products as we go over time so again you ve seen us saying in the way of us meeting the kind of milestone time lines we had for a launch plan we reordered to focus on the rarest first versus the common cbd and thc and we are really bullish you re going to see this coming over the next 18 to 24 months you re going to see these products coming online and so again it s the strength of this joint venture and the partnership and the innovation we re spinning off we re really really confident mike i don t know if you want to add anything on that since you ve been instrumental in the ginkgo agreement and process mike gorenstein executive chairman sure yes thanks and i think that s right you ll see us continue to include cultured cannabinoids specifically the rare ones cbg we re starting off with sourz but you ll see that also spread to other formats and we re making great progress with ginkgo and it ll be similar to how we re launching cbg when you start seeing some of the other rare cannabinoids added to the specific formats and then depending on the consumer insights spread into other formats as well so that will just be sequenced over the next couple of months and quarters rahul sarugaser raymond james analyst great we ll certainly look forward to that so now moving to the u s it s great to hear that the peace talks have been relaunched would you be able to share any more color on how the partnership with altria may enable penetration particularly in the c store channel across the u s and how we should be looking at that adoption ramp kurt schmidt president and chief executive officer right so yes we believe the addition of peace is a sign it s a really nice component to a pure pricing strategy and again we ve got four tincture skus that we re launching we re starting on our b2c website that will expand we are working with c stores and convenience stores and we hope to announce something in the not too distant future on that one as far as altria that is certainly value added that we could have now that would require some things we ve talked about before as far as getting the fda to on the edible side on the regulatory side but as you know as soon as there s clarity there that leverage point of altria we can take advantage of immediately rahul sarugaser raymond james analyst great thanks again i ll pass it on operator your next question comes from the line of john zamparo with cibc john zamparo cibc capital markets analyst thanks good morning i wanted to start with the spinach brand as well it does seem like it s capturing more market share and price is certainly a part of the picture there but has there been any other strategic shift that you can share that s helped cause that whether it s promotions or marketing or interaction with retailers or something on the cultivation side i just like to get a sense of what s causing that brand to move so meaningfully when most of the other large brands are fairly stagnant and then related to that do you think you found the right level of pricing on expenditure or are there more investments to be made kurt schmidt president and chief executive officer yes i think it s a combination of things innovation is certainly a clear driver of that we talked about that in our new flower launch which is doing exceptionally well and that is science behind the genetics of that plant sourz which is just a combination of fantastic some proprietary parts of that product but really treating it like confectionery like mondelez which we launching a product it s a fantastic product and carrier so innovation is going to play a big part of this extending the brand in certain areas will play a part of it we talked about the nuggetz in the 28 gram and dabz coming in there so as we round out a portfolio the second part is focus we re really focused on the spinach brand i d rather have one power brand than 28 brands that are all kind of doing something we believe the spinach brand resonates with consumers it s got a great brand positioning we worked very hard on that i think it s a lot of the blocking and tackling execution is probably the third point of that which includes some of that marketing and those three elements i think are really really our strength going on in the future and will continue to be the innovation carrier for us and that pipeline is being worked on and it s we re staging that as we go along mike already alluded to the culture of cannabinoids where that could possibly go so we feel this is our power brand and i d rather have one coca cola than 55 different bottle water brands right so we re going to really focus on that brand and i think we re seeing that pay off that strategy pay off john zamparo cibc capital markets analyst ok that s great i appreciate the color and then my second question is on the pharmacann investment are you exploring other incremental investments of that nature how would you characterize the attractiveness of the m a landscape in the u s at the moment and how do you think about targeting brands versus operators in cultivation or retail kurt schmidt president and chief executive officer yes i ll kick off and then i ll let mike jump in because he s really been leading us in this venture first of all we think pharmacann is a great one we have a set of criteria we look at what we would want to be part of and pharmacann i mean really checked all the boxes for us so it s a fantastic strategy they re a best in class operator we ve talked about before this i 80 strategy they have and limited license states from illinois to massachusetts we think they have capacity to grow organically and through m a so it really kind of checked all those boxes but we ve been pretty consistent saying we re not finished we look at our criteria is breadth geographic beachhead items but brands is also very important so it s not out of the realms of possibility that we may focus on something else that brings a different set to the party but i will tell you we look at it it has to be complementary to the overall strategy mike you should probably weigh in on this a little bit mike gorenstein executive chairman sure and thanks john i think the m a landscape certainly is attractive one of the things that s i think being focused on by a lot of potential targets is and really was amplified by the language in the schumer bill around interstate commerce is what benefits there could be from a potential partnership and how things may change once things are federally legal and that really aligns with the way that we re looking at them so brands are certainly going to be important we think ultimately that s where the value shifts long term we understand there s a balance between where value shifts long term within brands and sort of over the medium term how you build those brands and get them out so i would say that there could be similar structures we have other structures that we ve looked at but we re still very very excited and we think there s a lot of attractive opportunities that will fit very well for us in the u s john zamparo cibc capital markets analyst ok that s helpful thank you very much operator our next question comes from the line of vivien azer with cowen vivien azer cowen and company analyst hi good morning on the u s i was hoping we could dive in a little bit on cbd i was hoping to get your most current assessment of the market from a sizing perspective and then specifically on happy dance if you could comment on any intra quarter trends and whether you re seeing at all a recovery or an uplift as consumers get back and they can even go back into stores thanks kurt schmidt president and chief executive officer yes i ll kick it off and then let jerry or mike comment we re starting to see we had a lot of hopes of covid recovery but as you know lately we seem to be going back into this covid delta thing so we don t know how that one is going to swing out we were hopeful because you do see bricks and mortars coming back but we need to see that infinite i have to say overall we re not happy with the results in the u s cbd market we don t break down our performance by brand but we are taking a strategic review of the brands we ve got some good things but certainly i m not happy i d like to see faster growth and so we re kind of reviewing everything on this one that includes the portfolio price gap price management what we re doing there product offerings and we re looking at the marketing mix we don t have the full results yet we re getting we re trying to complete that but we have a couple we have two markets that we ve been testing advertising in a more aggressive marketing mix on the product now that looks encouraging but we have to see how that ends up but we need to review everything and make sure that we can get the pace because generally speaking we were not happy with the results this quarter but again some of that is related to the covid some of it s related to some changes in some of the dc capability especially with apple s new security has been has certainly had an impact but again we believe we get the elements right and we get the investment right the brand resonates very well with consumers that we ll get it back to the trajectory we want vivien azer cowen and company analyst ok perfect just sticking with the u s my follow up question please on pharmacann can you comment at all around any opportunities around ip or trademark exchanges or sharing kurt schmidt president and chief executive officer yes i ll let mike weigh in on this because it s good to have him he s also the lawyer in the room with me yes we re looking at those types of things but all those have to be managed under the guys of a path of investment and the lack of federal legalization but certainly if you look at the announcement we made there s tremendous opportunity once federal legalization comes but that doesn t mean we re thinking about what happens if prior to federal legalization a bunch of things happen i just can t commit to anything because we have that restriction of ensuring that we can do this and do this in a way that is sensible for us and the guys of the regulatory environment mike i don t know if you want to add anything to that mike gorenstein executive chairman yes sure vivien we certainly see this as something that s very strategic for us as far as pushing brands out i think the way that we really focused on getting that advantage was in setting up distribution agreements that we can sort of trigger at our own option so we re going to continue monitoring and making sure that whatever it is that we do to get our brands out is done in a way that wouldn t in our view affect anything with the csa but we feel that there s a strong partnership that we can use to leverage brands too early to speak about any imminent trademark swaps though vivien azer cowen and company analyst understood thank you operator your next question comes from the line of tamy chen with bmo capital markets tamy chen bmo capital markets analyst thanks good morning everyone first question is on the vape category i recall processes maybe about two years ago you talked about your initial launch of vape products in the canadian market would be sort of first gen but that you d be working on next gen proprietary products in this category so i just wanted to see if i get an update on how that s going with respect to the innovation work for the vape category in particular kurt schmidt president and chief executive officer yes this is kirk thanks for that question yes we are working on it and you re going to see something in the not too distant future but i don t want to talk about the actual dates or anything on innovation but we are working in that on the vape segment right now tamy chen bmo capital markets analyst ok got it and then my follow up is going back to the first culture cbg product under the flowers format in canada later this year i was wondering if you could talk a bit on how you re going to position the product i presume like from a marketing perspective and making sure that staff in stores are educated on that on the differentiation that they can communicate it to consumers because with respect to product launches in general in canada and i recognize this is a unique product but it is a very crowded market there s a lot of different products and brands on shelves to what degree of confidence do you have that there s going to be strong uptake for a cbg product in particular and what sort of work you re doing to ensure getting the shelf space it s going to get the bartender attention and positioning kurt schmidt president and chief executive officer yes good question well we have a full team from developers innovation to the research we ve done to the product developers to the marketing teams we don t view this as a product we view this as a concept a business concept and we think we have something really interesting a sub brand under the spinach line and we believe that s the way to do it that s my background blue buffalo built a 1 billion business on a single brand called blue buffalo but we had life protection we had wilderness we had freedom sub brand on blue buffalo and we had basics there and we believe this concept and we spent a lot of working on how to communicate with consumers so obviously we re rolling out we have to get to each one of these rare cannabinoids so it takes time you can t make all 6 at once but we are not thinking about this as a product this is not a product this is a brand concept lifestyle positioned against consumers resonating with consumers and that s the way we look at this thing and we re confident we re on the road to creating that and we think that s really what this whole thing is about mike gorenstein executive chairman and tamy just to add i think if you think about edibles as a crowded space even without rare cannabinoids which is where we ve seen a lot of excitement from retailers and from the provincial boards we launched spinach sourz and immediately had great success and we saw that as a pre seeded launch of the rare cannabinoid edible so we ve had great success without them and we expect that s only going to be stronger once we have the key differentiator added to those kurt schmidt president and chief executive officer and again as mike said we re going to grow the business edible is a great start for us but other 2 0 products are great vehicles for this and so we ve got innovation along the concept we ve got innovation along where we can move the brand to the products too so it s an exciting i think like i said there s been a hell of a lot of work done by the teams and i think we ve got it and i m looking forward to you ll start to see a little bit of that when we launch the first one here in september tamy chen bmo capital markets analyst great thank you operator our next question comes from the line of heather balsky with bank of america heather balsky bank of america merrill lynch analyst hi thanks for taking my question i m just curious just going back to one of the questions at the beginning of the q a around gross margins what do you think needs to happen what sort of scale what other i guess mix shift maybe that you need to get back to positive gross margin jerry barbato chief financial officer yes thanks for that question heather i think in the u s segment it s really about driving that revenue growth our revenue was down a little bit this quarter and i think with increased revenue that will improve the margin in that segment on the canada side we are seeing some positive momentum on the spinach brand and like i said earlier our margins were negatively impacted this quarter mainly due to the continued development of innovative products so we have some heightened start up costs within our manufacturing facility in addition we re lapping the price reductions that we took in the canadian market in the second half of 2020 which is causing a portion of the impact on a year over year basis heather balsky bank of america merrill lynch analyst thanks for the color operator your next question comes from the line of bill kirk with mkm bill kirk mkm partners analyst hey good morning everybody i want to go back to innovation but tackle it a bit more philosophically it seems the pace has accelerated rather dramatically so what philosophically for you has led to the strategic shift to focus what seems like more urgently on recreational use innovation kurt schmidt president and chief executive officer well thanks for the question i don t think it s really been a shift i mean we work on innovation and we come from a very disciplined ensuring we have a distinct point of difference and sometimes that takes longer i think edible is a classic example we could have thrown anything out the door but we looked at from the consumer side from kind of the product build side of what kind of what we re trying to do and some of that takes longer in the case that we ve cultured cannabinoids that s a pretty hefty project that s like new science when i sit in the ginkgo meetings and i am a undergrad in chemistry sometimes i need the head of innovation to give me kind of a tutoring afterwards on some of the stuff so we re doing some basic technologies we want bigger ideas they tend to take longer on the other hand once you get the system in place you could start to move faster once you get the fundamental building blocks in place between marketing the product development teams and the research side you start to go and a lot of that was built so i think we re at the point now where we ve got the right machinery and people to get this done but we believe again we believe the key for us is to become a branded player and a branded player who s bringing great products that delights the consumers and platforms that are new and unique and so that s what we re about and we will not lose that focus on innovation and i think that s really critical to us as a company mike gorenstein executive chairman yes bill i think you re seeing us quite a bit of work that it s not us with the urgency on product development we just now have quite a bit of products we ve developed and being very mindful about how we launch them but having a supply chain in place and now with retail opening back up in canada we think it s a good time bill kirk mkm partners analyst thank you mike thank you kurt operator our next question comes from the line of howard penney with hedgeye howard penney hedgeye risk management analyst hi thank you so much for the question i was wondering if you could expand on the pharmacann investment in particular the commercialization and distribution agreement that you signed and why that s important as you look to enter the u s thanks kurt schmidt president and chief executive officer yes i ll kick it off and then mike can jump in yes we re in it for the long haul we re not this is not an investment for us we re trying to build a partnership and a partnership so that concludes a bunch of things and access for our brands and distribution and access for eventually for our technologies we have a great and i ll tell you personally i love the guys there we ve got a great relationship with pharmacann we really see eye to eye on it and we re really trying to build for the long term for what can we build a leading cannabis company in the u s so all those things we want to mutually share what we do really well what they have so that we really get we really try to drive this thing and so that s why the some of these commercial terms and distribution terms are so important for us again we d love to move faster but obviously because of the regulatory environment we have to move at a different pace on some things but we want a commitment because we see this even though we only have 10 we didn t get into this as an investment we got into it as a long term partnership that s going to help drive both our businesses mike i don t know if you want to add anything to that mike gorenstein executive chairman thanks yes i think that s right we see two drivers of value here one is we think they have a great core business and so we like the investment just purely on an investment basis but the other is it s really important depending on how the regulatory environment shapes up and how things progress that we do in these key restrictive markets as far as retail like new york for example there s currently 10 licenses just knowing that we have a trusted partner with a close relationship to be able to launch our disruptive products through it s something that really excites us now to just to keep investing behind innovation knowing that we ll be able to reach consumers right when we need to howard penney hedgeye risk

portfolio net margin for the quarter was 55 basis points higher than the previous quarter benefiting from improvements in asset yields and decreased average funding costs from our liabilities the company took advantage of the lower interest rate environment accessing the market with two capital markets transactions 10 stocks we like better than new york mortgage trust when our award winning analyst team has a stock tip it can pay to listen after all the newsletter they have run for over a decade motley fool stock advisor has tripled the market they just revealed what they believe are the ten best stocks for investors to buy right now and new york mortgage trust wasn t one of them that s right they think these 10 stocks are even better buys see the 10 stocks stock advisor returns as of june 7 2021 in april the company completed a private placement of 100 million of rated senior unsecured notes with a five year term at an interest rate of 5 75 in july the company completed offering of its series f preferred stock for net proceeds of approximately 139 million with a coupon of 6 875 the company used approximately 105 million of these proceeds to redeem our 7 875 series c preferred stock thereby lowering our cost of capital by 100 basis points while the company indeed benefited from the lower interest rate environment we also believe our execution of these two transactions and improved pricing levels validates the strength of our current balance sheet now going to page 6 in the supplemental you ll see our investment portfolio totaled 3 2 billion at the end of the quarter and our market capitalization was also was 2 2 billion both unchanged from the previous quarter our capital is currently allocated at 77 to single family and 21 to multifamily our portfolio growth continues to focus on credit investments as we believe we can generate better risk adjusted returns with more stable funding on slide 7 we highlight some of our key developments during the quarter where we declared a 0 10 common stock dividend and generated a total rate of return on our common stock of 2 2 for the period and we currently have a year to date total rate of return of 26 6 we purchased approximately 258 million in residential loans and closed on our second multifamily joint venture investment for 12 million on our financing efforts we completed our first bpl revolving securitization for a total amount of 167 million jason will speak to this in more detail later in the presentation we completed a private placement of rated unsecured notes with a five year term at an interest rate of 5 75 our lowest cost of term financing in company history in july we issued our first rated preferred stock offering raised approximately 135 million with an initial rate of 6 875 we continue to focus on long term financing options to fund our growing business to help us navigate the ever and changing financial landscape on slide 9 we ll go over portfolio metrics on a quarter over quarter comparison as i said before our net margin for the second quarter was 2 97 an increase of 55 basis points from the previous quarter our portfolio weighted average yield was 6 31 an improvement of 28 basis points the increase was largely attributable to the continued rotation out of lower yielding cusip securities to higher yielding residential loans including business purpose loans our funding costs improved by 27 basis points during the quarter as the impact of calling one of our securitizations late in the first quarter was fully reflected in the second in july we called 2020 sp1 residential securitization in anticipation of issuing a new securitization in the third quarter the sp1 securitization had approximate cost of 4 which we believe we can replace with costs in the low 2 range this quarter our leverage remains low at 0 3 times and our liquidity remains strong as we head into the third quarter at this time i d like kristine nario our cfo will now go over the financial results in more detail kristine kristine nario chief financial officer thank you steve good morning everyone and thank you again for being on the call in discussing the financial results for the quarter i will be using some of the information from the quarterly comparative financial information section included in slides 23 to 30 of the supplemental presentation slide 10 summarizes our activity in the second quarter we acquired residential loans for 258 million closed on a multifamily joint venture investment for 12 million and purchased 19 million of investment securities we sold residential loans and cmbs for proceeds totaling 15 million we also had total repayments of approximately 309 million primarily from our residential loans most of these residential loans were purchased at a discount and the early payoff of the loans resulted in additional income of approximately 5 million which is included in realized gain we also had four multifamily loans at redeem which generated 1 5 million of redemption premium income which is included in other income we had net income of 43 million and comprehensive income of 47 million attributable to our common stockholders our book value ended at 4 74 up from 4 71 the previous quarter slide 11 details our financial results we had net interest income of 31 5 million an increase of 1 1 million from the previous quarter total net interest income increased from the previous quarter primarily due to our continued investment in higher yielding business purpose loans which contributed to the 2 1 million increase in total interest income this was partially offset by an increase in total interest expense of 1 million primarily attributed to the interest expense recognized on the senior unsecured notes issued in april we had noninterest income of 43 3 million mostly from net unrealized gains of 23 9 million due to continued improvement in pricing on our assets particularly our non agency rmbs and cmbs securities residential loans and our investment in consolidated slst in addition lower interest rates drove modest price appreciation on our agency rmbs securities we also generated 5 million of net realized gains primarily from residential loan prepayment activity in addition our multifamily preferred equity investments accounted for as equity contributed 6 4 million of income which includes 5 5 million of preferred return income and 0 8 million of unrealized gains our other equity investments contributed 4 3 million of income primarily from income recognized on redemption of an equity investment that invested in residential loans we had total g a expenses of 12 5 million an increase of approximately 1 1 million from the previous quarter the increase can be attributed to annual awards and equity compensation to nonemployee directors during the quarter we had operating expenses of 10 6 million during the quarter which included 6 7 million related to our portfolio investments this increase primarily due to the growth of the business purpose loan portfolio and 3 9 million of operating expenses related to multifamily apartment properties that we consolidate in accordance with gaap as i mentioned earlier included in our results for the quarter is the net income activity related to multifamily apartment properties that we consolidate in our financial statements in accordance with gaap these properties generated operating income of 2 1 million and incurred interest expense and operating expenses of 0 4 million and 3 9 million respectively after reflecting the share in the losses to the noncontrolling interest of 1 6 million in total these multifamily apartment properties incurred a net loss of 0 6 million for the quarter it should be noted that the net loss in these properties include depreciation and amortization related to real estate the graph on slide 11 illustrates the change in our book value from june 30 our book value increased to 4 74 during the quarter and increased 9 from the end of june 2020 our stock price assets also recovered significantly increasing our price to book ratio to 0 94 from 0 60 at the end of june 2020 we continue to focus on growing and strengthening our balance sheet by investing in our core strategies of single family and multifamily investments and prudent liability management by placing greater emphasis on procuring longer term and a more committed financing arrangement jason will now go over the market and strategy update jason jason serrano president thanks kristine as it relates to our strategy we continue to favor bpl scratch dent multifamily lending and jvs we see strong signals that provide a favorable investment landscape in these areas on page 14 starting with bpls the overall economic backdrop is very supportive of the u s residential housing in both single family and multifamily with estimated 5 5 million new housing units required to meet demand after 1 3 million of expected new builds the market will continue to be extremely tight in the near term with a significant housing deficit we continue to support single family bridge lending focused on modest home renovation under a one year loan our borrower alignment is strengthened with the 74 pre model and 64 post model ltv we have faced increased market competition of late with new market participants willing to compete on one price meaning more rates and or structure meaning higher ltvs we remain consistent with our pricing in the short duration bpl sector we instead focus on competing with our process where we can take advantage of our experienced team and proven technology to reduce the operational burden of bpl originators before and after loans are purchased in the performing loan space we continue to find value in the scratch dent sector with the collapsed primary secondary mortgage rate and new curbs on early funding from the cash window for agency channels we purchase loans close loans that were found to have technical issues with the original origination guidelines our purchase even at a deep discount helps the originator s liquidity we have been able to buy loans from over 200 originators in the past few years with a purchase discount of seven points on average we do not compete on price but like bpls we buy loans in an expedited manner meeting the needs of our selling partners with a consistent diligence and closing process this helps us be a preferred counterparty in the space lastly with a housing deficit multifamily valuations have also improved with increased rents in this case we target selective submarkets facing more acute housing shortages found in the south southeast united states average multifamily rental rates are up 7 year over year led by double digit gains in markets like atlanta tampa and raleigh and our direct lending and jv business we focus on low to mid rise properties in secondary markets we have done so without incurring a loss in any position in the eight years plus investing in this space consistent with the commentary and other strategies we are focused on hitting all funding time lines for our acquisitions under a consistent due diligence approach with our sponsors again we compete by providing a trusted process here holding the line on pricing across these strategies in the face of higher competition allowed us to increase our average yield on assets turning to page 14 in the month our pace of acquisition slowed to 290 million from 364 million last quarter while we do see elevated levels of competition our a larger contributor to the client investment activity was related to a focus of opportunities which can take longer to close particularly in the multifamily space thus we see we expect to see a meaningful increase to our allocations in the third quarter with our core strategies turning to page 15 as was stated on previous calls we expect our portfolio leverage defined as recourse financing to remain low first we run an unleveraged strategy within multifamily loan and jv investments as return on assets is expected to meet to meet yield targets in the low to upper teens second residential markets securitization debt or term nonrecourse financing is a primary focus point our opportunity is to continue allocating new purchases alongside of 700 million of unencumbered loans we have on balance to this form of financing we are currently working on a number of transactions with bankers in unrated space and with rating agencies in the rated residential debt offerings as discussed on our last call we expect the securitization market to even to be even more accommodating to issuers as the level of demand including replacement band with higher market pay down rates continues to outstrip new supply as a result we witnessed financing costs decline about 28 basis points to a 2 level in the unrated npl space rpl space and in the rated space triple a financing levels improved approximately 15 basis points in the quarter to a 1 area of cost of debt we are excited about this proposition to generate equity returns within our portfolio with reduced leverage risk versus traditional bank offerings repo offerings on page 16 as discussed the current environment is favorable for our strategies while we are not currently active in the reperforming loan auctions our 895 million portfolio today with a 4 84 coupon and at 72 ltv would be extremely difficult to replicate in today s market with year over year housing prices printing at 16 growth rate the highest level recorded on the case shiller index our equity position with borrowers continues to improve which brings a higher degree of alignment and downside protection with our loss mitigation approach at 97 our loan valuation is accreting to par alongside of the market improvement as such we recently noticed investors to call one of our unrated deals with 300 million powered loans in today s market and as steve mentioned earlier we see up to 200 basis points interest cost savings with the resecuritization of these loans with our business purpose loans which at the end of the second quarter equaled 622 million of asset value here they are mainly bridge and rehab loans we have funded these loans without any loss to date we believe and apparently many others in today s market find a strategy to fit well within the macros in the housing market our recent new issue revolving securitization in this space paves the way for high teens low 20s returns on these assets after launching the deal with 160 million of loans in the second quarter we continue to utilize the cash built within the structures with 75 million of new loans added to the securitization in july within the performing loan strategy which is mostly scratch dent loans we have seen an elevated amount of activity in the quarter which should bring higher investment pipelines in q3 like the agency market we have witnessed an increase to the portfolio s prepayment activity however unlike the agency market we benefit from this activity because of a deep discount acquisition cost turning to page 17 in this quarter we highlighted this trend here where we show the purchase price against the exact loans that are prepaid in a particular month at average acquisition prices between 93 and 95 we captured the discount with loan prepayments mostly above 30 cpr while pay down activity reduces the portfolio size the payoffs are accretive to our earnings as we capture the 5 discount turning to page 18 finally in the residential markets we provide an update for our bpl portfolio here we continue to focus on markets with low housing supply borrowers with proven experience low ltv and importantly low rehab requirements to provide for a quick project turnaround we believe these characteristics hit a sweet spot in the market with our high level of originator trade support we believe we can maintain a high level of activity benefiting our pipeline s increasingly competitive market environment now turning to page 19 switching over to multifamily overview we have seen a recent decline in senior financing costs within the agency sector by approximately 30 basis points which sparked an increase in our pipeline with the sponsors who are seeking cash flowing multifamily property acquisitions cash flowing so sponsors can immediately take advantage of the sub 3 senior financing cost we support these acquisitions within layer to the sponsor s acquisition on average of an 80 up the 80 ltv with a contractual coupon of 11 6 and additional early prepayment benefits the risk adjusted return here is very attractive as i stated earlier we keep market share in a space with a proven process against tight closing time lines such as in the case of the 1031 exchange we started to refocus on jvs this year with a more favorable macro environment in the south southeast united states and have looked at multiple recapitalization opportunities alongside the sponsors the team is very focused in the part of the market by utilizing our large network developed over 10 years of source portfolio opportunities quickly on the multifamily securities side we discussed in the previous quarter we believe the market is fully priced here with yields in the 2 area as such we recently liquidated nearly all our positions last month in the sector to move toward a full exit of the sector given the tight market environment turning to page 20 lastly with respect to multifamily performance not surprisingly underlying property occupancy rates continue to improve with demand in the local markets given the sector strength we continue to receive prepayment notices from borrowers in our portfolio as an additional four loans prepaid in the quarter providing a 14 7 investment irr at a 1 4 times multiple after all applicable minimum return multiples we have very few assets in special service we continue to work toward a par payoff of the two of the 40 assets in this part of the portfolio now turning to page 21 we thank you for your time to hear an update of our business the investment team is focused on unlocking new opportunities across the resi loan sectors and multifamily cap structures our goal is to deliver high returns with low volatility we re excited about our new investment prospects and financing arrangements to continue with this success at this time i ll pass it back to steve steve mumma chairman and chief executive officer thanks jason and operator you can open it up for questions questions answers operator your first question comes from the line of doug harter with credit suisse doug harter credit suisse analyst thanks steve hoping you could talk about the decision to kind of raise the unsecured debt and increase the amount of preferred in the context of kind of the low overall balance sheet leverage and kind of how you weighed those different forms of capital steve mumma chairman and chief executive officer sure so from the i ll do the preferred first i mean really we raised 137 million we paid we deemed 105 so we re net up a flight we still have another preferred equity piece that s out there that can be redeemed that s higher cost at 7 75 we ve raised the five year money it was the first time we did a rated deal we wanted to test the market and see where we could get we have seen some of our competitors getting very good execution and we have a convertible deal that s maturing in early january so keeping all that into perspective we were testing the market on the rated world as a way to replace that convertible deal that s going to be maturing in january and i think as we look at when we think about the preferred given the size of our balance sheet it s really trying to continue to lower the overall cost of capital and really not net increasing substantially that preferred channel so i think over time you ll see the preferred sort of get rebalanced back to where it s been we were up like 35 million relative to what we were after the net pay off but we still have that 7 75 out there that we re looking at what s the best way to manage that money going into this cycle and given the outbreak of the delta variant we want to make sure we understand the impacts of potential liquidity as we go into the remainder of the year and so we want to be more conservative as it relates to financing opportunities doug harter credit suisse analyst great and then just to make sure i understand the revolving securitization how long is that revolving period and how what size could that could get to jason serrano president yes so the revolving is really replacing the fast paydowns we have in the portfolio so the short duration of the loans given the win your maturity and with some extension anywhere from 12 to 18 months kind of the pay downs expected we want to make sure we were able to relever those deals into a two year revolving structure which is what that securitization provides so with that we can keep the leverage outstanding and efficiently finance our pipelines steve mumma chairman and chief executive officer it s a two year period that we can continue to reinvest doug harter credit suisse analyst so a two year period and then it would likely have some steve mumma chairman and chief executive officer and then it basically it goes two years then it s three yes that s right this is a step up three years later doug harter credit suisse analyst got it ok that s helpful thank you steve mumma chairman and chief executive officer thanks doug operator your next question comes bose george with kbw unknown speaker this is actually mike smith on for bose so just on the bpls you mentioned some of the competition in the space can you just talk a little bit about your broader sourcing strategy and kind of have you seen any decline in expected returns given the increased competition in the market jason serrano president yes the market we ve definitely seen an increase in competition really over the last few months now there has been a the story is very popular it s a very strong macro tailwind that supports the assets so it s not surprising that other market participants are looking to enter into the space or increasing their funding availability as it relates to our pipelines we re buying loans from the same originators that we ve been working with over the past few years we they mentioned earlier we haven t reduced our yield requirements in the space despite the fact that the market overall has is trading at a tighter level we do so because we believe that our operational capability and a lot of the hand holding going back and forth with the originators on the closing process as well as afterwards a lot of the originators are also the servicer of the loans post origination date so there s a lot of servicing needs and a lot of help we can provide with as it relates to updating the portfolio so in all those cases we find ourselves in a position where we re able to continue buying loans at the previously at yields that have been consistent for us for the last six months and we believe we re able to do that because we re able to move quickly with these originators and provide a level of service as a buyer that we think is differentiated so i hope that answers your question unknown speaker yes that s helpful and then a lot of peers have taken equity stakes in originators or acquired originators to kind of secure sourcing and improve the economics here is this something you could look to do or on the other side of that do you know if any of your origination partners have had any changes to their ownership structure jason serrano president yes we ve talked to just about all the market participants in the space on the origination side we ve evaluated a number of those opportunities that end up being a capital market transaction or acquisition or entering into a gp of a structure of one of the originators in the market so we ve kind of seen it all we ve evaluated alongside with other market participants we ve decided not to pursue a capital markets activity through a purchase simply because we believe we can maintain the levels that we re purchasing this is again a market that is pretty finicky it s shut down in march 2020 valuations on the loan originators are pretty volatile given the short time lines of the loans themselves and how fast the market can basically just stop the investment activity so we didn t feel it s prudent to spend that type capital for the pipelines that are available and also we view this market as a trade and the trade continues to be a strength and a strategy given the macro environment but this is a bit of a new market yes hard money lending has been around for as long as the mortgage industry has been around but this type of financing and with the efficiency of the securitization market is providing for a kind of new stage investment opportunity and that could easily change quickly i think we would prefer to look at more long dated strategies in the bpl market as i mentioned earlier our focus has been on the short duration part of the market with the fix and flip type of loans there are opportunities in the investor loan or debt service coverage ratio space that we re evaluating but at this point we re comfortable where we stand with respect to our pipelines and the fix and flip strategy unknown speaker great that s helpful and then just one more for me can you provide an update on how book values trended since quarter end steve mumma chairman and chief executive officer yes look i mean we don t typically we don t give specific forward looking statements as it relates to dividends and or book value but we given where the market is and certainly there was a little bit of a backup and race this morning with the issue of the employment numbers but given the strength of the credit markets we would say that our book value is probably up slightly unknown speaker great thanks for taking the questions steve mumma chairman and chief executive officer sure thanks operator your next question comes from the line of stephen laws with raymond james stephen laws raymond james analyst hi good morning steve jason kristine maybe a bigger picture question reading some articles just about the different agency multifamily guidelines maybe those caps are going up maybe loosening standards and some shifts there how does that create an opportunity for you maybe on kick outs or ebos or other how does that potentially what s going on in d c change either positively or negatively your pipeline of potential investment opportunities steve mumma chairman and chief executive officer yes i mean certainly we look at those things as it relates not so much directly to us because we re a co investor in these properties providing mezzanine capital but certainly to the extent that they reduce programs where you get supplemental financing on the existing property that s beneficial to us as they increase their limits and it s really not the limits of lending that hurts us if they increase the amount of money that they ll lend against the property at the agency level that certainly squeezes into where we play however there s so many opportunities right now providing additional capital and what we started to do jv investing again quite frankly because we think there s just better opportunities in some cases on certain properties to participate at the jv level certainly with properties that are we would consider a like properties b plus to a those are probably jv equity investment opportunities versus where we look at the b to b plus properties where they re going to be lifted from a b to b plus or a is a better mezzanine opportunity and so that s why we continue to increase our touch space into the multifamily area but yes we are keenly aware of what s going on in the agency space and watching what washington is doing is probably going to be a drive to affordable housing too that those are areas we ll look at also going forward stephen laws raymond james analyst great thanks for the comments on that steve jason and kristine kind of for both of you but i guess you called the deal in q3 jason how much more opportunity as we think about those calls next year is there some percentage maybe or some amount you think continue to be called and then kristine from a 3q standpoint how should we think about the gains that will hit in 3q from that call and additionally any gains on i thought it was 90 million of cmbs sales but i think jason said maybe all of the 147 so any gains in q3 or losses on those sales jason serrano president yes i ll start with the call so we recently issued a notice to our to the investors that are in one of our securitizations that was done a year ago so the non call period is coming up and that s why we re looking to call again we think we can save about 200 basis points up to 200 basis points of interest cost and also relever the transaction which is helpful we do have other deals outstanding and those deals would also be we ll also be looking to make calls in this market given at this point on the unrated space the financing that is available is probably the best is the best that we ve ever seen in the npl space or the unrated space npl rpl unrated space in rpl rated space part of what we re going to do is transition the loans that have been paying for quite some time and transition those into a rated deal which i mentioned earlier we re be looking to issue one of those deals in the near term and we see senior financing costs at the 1 financing level so clearly all these securitization strategies beat the financing terms that financing costs you see it in the repo space which is another reason to do the securitizations but it s very attractive against a legacy portfolio of assets we own that have obviously coupons and ltvs that we very hard to replicate in today s market with the purchase prices that are available as it relates to the sales of our of the cmbs sold most of the assets we still have a few remaining that we re looking at this quarter as well but we were able to sell those consistent with our valuation on those bonds given the monthly market process there kristine nario chief financial officer right so we sold just to be a little bit more specific we sold cmbs for 90 million that s a majority of them but and the marks or the price that we ve exited is close to what we marked at quarter end and as to answer your question as it relates to any gains or losses on the securitization that we re going to call it s not really a concept for that there s not going to be any gain or loss recognized for that jason serrano president right and just to be clear this situation we re looking to flip the loans back into the market which then you would recognize again our goal here is to resecuritize the assets under a more efficient financing steve mumma chairman and chief executive officer yes stephen since those weren t remix and since those were our loans to begin with we didn t recognize a gain putting them into the securitization so it was just a financing transaction and that s why it doesn t generate any extra p l that you see other guys calling deals those are deals that they bought in the marketplace and so those weren t their loans initially so that s where they have the ability to bring those loans back and generate a gain stephen laws raymond james analyst perfect yes i appreciate all of your comments on that topic thank you very much steve mumma chairman and chief executive officer sure operator your next question comes from the line of eric hagen with btig eric hagen btig analyst hey thanks good morning one more follow up on the 2020 s p one that you re calling i guess the specific question is what kind of advance rates do you expect to get like in the end how much capital are you expected to free up from the opportunity and then the second question is what s your lifetime expected loss rate at this point for the slst deal that you own like when you guys book a yield that shows up in earnings what kind of default and severity rates are embedded in that yield and is there any upside from loans paying down even faster jason serrano president i ll start with the securitization we had a deal outstanding a year we re taking about 310 million of loans back into the market through a resecuritization the amount of capital that we ll be freeing up in that deal is not material from our total capital the reason to do the deal is to gain access to better financing levels and we use the npl market financing market as basically a gestation period for our rpl rated strategy so that would be done in another one year deal so it s really a cost of capital consideration there not as a means to kind of unlock fresh capital for new investment purchases steve mumma chairman and chief executive officer and the slst eric we don t really we don t disclose specifics on defaults and other parameters around the slst deal but certainly prepayment speeds increases helped that deal right to the extent that you re taking back loans that sit in the pool of your projecting losses it s helpful to the bond but just given the overall healthiness of the housing market and increased valuations that certainly supports a lot of the loans in those deals eric hagen btig analyst and then one on operating expenses forgive me if you said this but the operating expenses i assume included deal expenses during the quarter and so if you strip those out what s the kind of steve mumma chairman and chief executive officer no the deal expenses get capitalized to the cost of a debt kristine nario chief financial officer right that s right eric any securitization debt issuance cost is included in the cost of the debt eric hagen btig analyst ok so the 10 6 million in operating expenses for the quarter maybe i missed it in your opening remarks but what was what s driving that kristine nario chief financial officer the 10 6 million there s an increase because of an increase in our portfolio of business purpose loans so that increases that but we also have a portion of that related to our multifamily properties that we consolidate in accordance with gaap this is a vie consolidation which increased that operating expense number this quarter eric hagen btig analyst i m really just kind of looking for a run rate operating expense steve mumma chairman and chief executive officer yes so that run rate operating is a little difficult because i mean you really should look at it we have a it s two different lines right we have 6 7 million in expenses related to the portfolio the 3 9 is really going to jump around based on if we end up consolidating a multifamily property all of a sudden you can have a jump that s really not really a jump in direct expenses to us but it s just because we have to consolidate their activity up but the operating expense line certainly is related to our portfolio and the growth of that operating expense in the portfolio is 100 related to our bpl portfolio growth so the way those loans are booked they are just a higher expense ratio to service those loans so that drives that number up as we grow that portfolio eric hagen btig analyst got it ok thanks for the color steve mumma chairman and chief executive officer yes sure thanks for the questions eric operator your next question comes from the line of christopher nolan with ladenburg thalmann chris nolan ladenburg thalmann analyst hey guys on your multifamily equity investments are those into common equity or preferred equity kristine nario chief financial officer the multifamily investments we have preferred equity but we also have jv equity which would be on the common steve mumma chairman and chief executive officer the preferred equity investments that show up as equity chris it s really from an accounting standpoint they have the similar characteristics of what we would classify the other stuff as preferred loans but because of certain legal requirements within the documentation they end up being accounted for it as equity but we re earning an interest rate on them the jv is absolutely true equity in the sense that we are participating in it at the equity level but the preferred all our preferred investments have a coupon associated with them chris nolan ladenburg thalmann analyst so the preferred is really secured to some degree by the underlying steve mumma chairman and chief executive officer that s it is secured 100 it s there s equity below it that s subordinating it and it s and the preferred is secured to the property chris nolan ladenburg thalmann analyst what sort of cap rates are does the your jv partner or you go into these multifamily properties with steve mumma chairman and chief executive officer i mean i think the markets that we participate in in the south and southeast obviously the cap rates have been compressed but what s really we re really looking when we get into these transactions not so much the entry cap rate it s the exit cap rate and so we re looking those cap rates seem to have some ability to compress for us to hit our exit multiple targets so we don t really have a specific cap rate minimum or maximum it really depends on the property specific and where it is located in the opportunity to change that cap rate so we don t really have a specific cap rate in mind jason serrano president and remember the opportunities that we re focused on are transitional plays for the most part so what we re really focused on is what the new management teams transition business plan is for the property there s two forms it s either management improvement or there s some deferred maintenance that needs to be addressed with respect to the property that could help with the rent rate increases so we look for those plays where that could happen also it shortens the duration of the proffer offering as well simply because typically a sponsor would come in and look to basically take our loan out once the management plan has been executed and then opt to take a 10 year senior loan out from freddie mac or fannie mae for that matter but also in and we do focus on ground up construction as well outside of just the transitional story within multifamily and there we re looking at very similar very similar markets with opportunities where there s just a deficit of housing demand especially with the migration trends in the united states from northeast down to southeast so we re seeing opportunities where very high rent rate increases very low very high occupancy rates and therefore analysis of these markets we find it very favorable to add new product into some of these secondary and tertiary markets where we re aligning ourselves with the sponsor chris nolan ladenburg thalmann analyst and i guess sort of given that collapse of that building in florida and given you re investing in properties which i understand low to medium rise but do you expect construction renovation or maintenance cost to increase substantially on these properties jason serrano president relative to what we saw in miami no we don t lend or have exposure in that market to those type of properties again we re mostly in the secondary tertiary markets to mostly garden style apartments and there it s the types of maintenance or deferred maintenance that we see when we re looking to get into these deal for the transitional play is more aesthetic improvements to the property that are dated kitchens bathrooms and communal areas steve mumma chairman and chief executive officer yes chris we have a very healthy program and we have a large asset management team for those very reasons to go out and review properties to make sure we understand what are the physical needs to maintain that property but jason is 100 accurate in saying that the majority of the stuff is really to update and bring forward units to market standard chris nolan ladenburg thalmann analyst ok thank you operator your next question comes from the line of matthew howlett with b riley matthew howlett b riley financial analyst hey guys good morning thanks for taking my question when i model the portfolio margin out i mean it went up sequentially i hear you with you ve got to keep on calling these securitizations and issuing new ones that probably is the lowest securitization rates we ve ever seen how does that margin can you sustain that sort of 3 on a gaap basis or is it going to move around to the mix shift or could you just give us a little bit on how to model that steve mumma chairman and chief executive officer yes i mean two things you got to keep in mind when you look at our margin one we have very low leverage right so that margin is being calculated by an asset yield of 6 31 and then the cost of debt but that debt is a smaller portion relative to our assets so that being that s one comment the second comment is as we get out of the cusip securities and we focus more on bpl loans and multifamily investing those are certainly higher coupon assets than scratch dent and some of our old rpl loan portfolios so i think that s where you ll see some movement around and as it relates to the cost of debt i mean certainly as we go through and reprice our warehouse lines that come due in the fourth quarter we ll look to be tightening that up but you are correct in saying that the securitization market has never been tighter as it relates to rates and then jason maybe you want to add something to that jason serrano president yes i mean just the sale of our securities book which we sold most of our multifamily securities last quarter will improve our total interest earning assets yield so it s more of a rotation given the increase in values we ve seen in that space we saw basically we believe it s about a 2 total yield kind of yield to that securities portfolio when we sold those bonds and that s replacing into a mostly bpl and multifamily type of space so rotation on top of utilization of our cash and lower financing costs with respect to securitization should continue to improve our net interest margin matthew howlett b riley financial analyst did you say high teens on that bpl securitization that you saw on the retained security you said did i hear you speak to that jason serrano president yes that s right i mean the highlight is simply you re looking at high single digit type of coupon with our financing costs dropped i believe about 58 basis points on that deal so when you look at and model through the securitization leverage that s there with respect to the financing costs you easily can get to a 20 level on those types of on those assets steve mumma chairman and chief executive officer on the equity at jason serrano president yes return of the equity of the securization yes that s right matthew howlett b riley financial analyst and would you go ahead jason serrano president yes yes that s right i mean the there s not many markets where you could achieve that type of return it s really related to the fact that it s a short duration loan where it s similar to our multifamily business this is a bridge play into an improvement story so they re willing the contractors are willing to take a higher cost of debt to turn that into a flip or we re seeing more cases now turning into a rental property that with taking back the property as an interest as an investment property itself so that s why that cost of debt is there there s lots of management requirements on managing the draws making sure that improvements are going accordingly so those other reasons typically why you have a higher cost of capital for that type of debt which we benefit from matthew howlett b riley financial analyst and you lock in the financing via the trust and it s a revolving trust like a credit card deal does it work like a credit card deal where you pay it down and you keep on putting a new receivable into it jason serrano president yes for two years we can recycle the pay downs that we received in that securitization our fixed cost of capital there so in credit card deals the recycling happens much more frequently in these types of deals it s maybe one or two times a month where you look at the paydowns and you recycle with new portfolio opportunities so the like a clo as an example you re able to enter add new assets to that portfolio over the course of two years which is what you d like to see on a 1 5 one year duration type of asset when you re doing a securitization which is why we opted for that structure matthew howlett b riley financial analyst great got it ok and then i guess on the unencumbered 700 million i mean unencumbered i mean can how much of that is are you going to finance i mean can you just sort of give us the cadence on how what you re going to do with that over the next sort of 12 months jason serrano president yes i mean we re looking at as you mentioned earlier the we re kind of seeing historically low securitization costs across different industries right so we re looking at the assets we have in that book and pairing with our pipeline assets and looking to optimize our securitizations within both in the on rated and the rpo space so we are evaluating that piece of on a residential loan book to add we think is prudent leverage to that portfolio matthew howlett b riley financial analyst and the last question with the pricing on the series f the other deals they re not i mean over the next couple of years you re going to become callable the other preferred right i mean presumably you are looking at that steve mumma chairman and chief executive officer fairly callable the series c 7 75 is currently callable the other two have a couple of years matthew howlett b riley financial analyst do you i know that s the series c is trading up series f is trading up i mean do you think you could potentially test the 6 right i mean over time you see the preferred steve mumma chairman and chief executive officer i mean we are consistently current we re constantly constantly is the word i m looking for monitoring those markets to try to optimize our capital cost structure no question matthew howlett b riley financial analyst but that s going to have a significant impact if you can do it great ok that s it for me thank you so much steve thanks jason steve mumma chairman and chief executive officer thanks matt have a great day operator at this time there are no further questions i would like to turn the call back over to mr steve mumma steve mumma chairman and chief executive officer thank you operator and thank you everyone for being on the call today enjoy the rest of your summer and be safe and be

miami business wire starwood real estate income trust inc starwood an affiliate of starwood capital group a leading global private investment firm focused on real estate and energy investments today commented on a report issued by institutional shareholder services inc iss a leading independent proxy advisory firm in its report iss recommends monmouth real estate investment corp nyse mnr monmouth or mnr shareholders vote against monmouth s proposed transaction with equity commonwealth eqc which is scheduled to be voted on at a special meeting of monmouth shareholders on august 24 2021 we are pleased iss recognizes that the value and uncertain upside of monmouth s proposed transaction with eqc renders it inferior to the starwood offer this recommendation is an important step toward ensuring that monmouth shareholders can receive maximum certain value from our superior offer starwood s offer remains superior in both value and certainty to any bid that has been made during or after the strategic review process in a letter to monmouth s board today starwood reaffirmed its 18 88 per share net all cash offer and encouraged the board to immediately declare its offer a superior proposal under the eqc merger agreement allowing the current transaction to proceed to a vote given the recommendation from iss and the two thirds requirement for approval would unnecessarily delay shareholders from receiving the superior value from the starwood transaction and expose monmouth to greater expense reimbursements to eqc for a transaction we believe is unlikely to gain shareholder approval we stand ready to sign the already negotiated merger agreement we provided to monmouth that offers shareholders significantly greater value and certainty than eqc s proposal and we are resubmitting our all cash proposal to the monmouth board today to leave absolutely no doubt that they are free to engage with us under the existing agreement with eqc we encourage the monmouth board to act in the best interest of shareholders by immediately declaring the starwood offer superior and moving quickly to close our proposed transaction iss notes in its report that1 support is not warranted for the proposed transaction particularly in light of the greater value and certainty of the starwood proposal in consideration of s limited presence in industrial real estate and the noticeable gap between eqc s recent industrial acquisition history and the billions of dollars of acquisitions that are planned for the combined company there remains substantial uncertainty that the combined company will be able to execute on the post transaction opportunities touted by mnr s board in light of the decline in the value of the consideration and potential execution risk that could limit shareholders future returns particularly relative to the value and certainty of the higher competing cash proposal support for the transaction is not warranted particularly relative to the value and certainty of the higher competing cash proposal absent the starwood proposal there would also be downside risk of rejection because of the possibility that mnr shares would return to a value in line with their historical relationship to peers there would also be downside risk of rejection because of the possibility that lingering concern in the minds of shareholders about the possibility that a preference for a tax deferred structure over certainty of value led to a sub ideal outcome the full text of starwood s letter to the monmouth board is incorporated below august 6 2021 monmouth real estate investment corporation 101 crawfords corner road suite 1405 holmdel nj 07733 attention eugene w landy chairman of the board dear eugene today institutional shareholder services iss recommended that shareholders of monmouth real estate investment corporation monmouth vote against the proposed merger with equity commonwealth eqc at the special meeting of monmouth shareholders scheduled for august 24 2021 the special meeting the iss recommendation is consistent with our view that the all cash starwood proposal provides greater value and certainty for monmouth shareholders than a transaction predicated upon speculative upside from merging two entities without obvious synergies or competitive advantages in the industrial sector given the two thirds support required from monmouth shareholders and the against recommendation from iss continuing with any vote on the eqc transaction will subject shareholders to further delays in realizing value and unnecessarily obligate monmouth to 10 million in additional expense reimbursements for an inferior transaction with a low probability of being approved in view of recent events starwood real estate income trust inc starwood or we is hereby reaffirming and hereby submits a proposal to acquire all of the outstanding common shares of monmouth for a price of 19 51 per share reduced by the termination fee owed to eqc of 0 63 per share for a net consideration of 18 88 per share to monmouth shareholders in light of the iss recommendation and the views of several large shareholders who have publicly and privately expressed opposition to the eqc transaction we believe recent events have added even more uncertainty to the already low prospects of consummating the eqc transaction we therefore urge the monmouth board of directors to immediately declare our proposal a superior proposal under the existing merger agreement with eqc and move down a path that will deliver certain maximum value for your shareholders and bring an efficient conclusion to this lengthy process without adding additional undue costs we stand ready to sign the merger agreement previously submitted to you and consummate a transaction on terms that stand out above any presented during your comprehensive strategic review process thank you for your continued consideration we look forward to working with you to achieve the optimal outcome for your shareholders regards starwood real estate income trust inc christopher graham chief investment officer ethan b bing managing director starwood strongly urges shareholders follow iss independent recommendation to vote against the eqc merger proposal to protect their interests a vote against the eqc merger proposal on the blue proxy card will send a clear message to monmouth s board that shareholders prefer the higher value and greater certainty starwood is offering and that shareholders expect the monmouth board to act in their best interests if the eqc merger proposal is not approved monmouth will have the right to terminate the eqc merger agreement starwood also recommends monmouth shareholders vote against proposal 2 compensation proposal and proposal 3 adjournment

hotels resorts inc wasn t one of them that s right they think these 10 stocks are even better buys see the 10 stocks stock advisor returns as of june 7 2021 with that i would like to turn the call over to tom tom baltimore chairman and chief executive officer thank you ian and welcome everyone i am pleased to report that widespread leisure demand accelerated during the second quarter leading to stronger than expected operating performance which ultimately drove breakeven results at the corporate level during the month of june well ahead of expectations we continue to make progress on strengthening our balance sheet raising an additional 750 million of attractively priced senior secured notes and announcing nearly 480 million of asset sales with net proceeds being used to repay debt given the meaningful improvements to both operations and the balance sheet we are in a great position to once again prioritize growth opportunities including roi projects and selective acquisitions on the macro front the combination of strong economic growth and stimulus high personal savings widespread availability of vaccines and the corresponding easing of covid related restrictions has fueled a resurgence in leisure travel the pace of economic growth has accelerated meaningfully since our last call gdp reached an all time high during the second quarter and is now forecast to increase 6 6 for 2021 nonresidential fixed investment which is highly correlated with lodging demand is estimated to grow by 8 4 this year 60 basis points higher than our last call and by an additional 6 in 2022 u s savings set at 1 7 trillion as of june and with roughly two thirds of the u s population over 12 years old now vaccinated all signs still point to a return to in person schooling and work for many people post labor day assuming for now that the delta variant does not alter this progression the ongoing return of normalcy is an important catalyst for our industry s recovery while we have all benefited from strong leisure demand in recent months this next step should allow for the resumption of business travel corporate group and convention business none of us can be certain of the shape or the pace of the recovery but i strongly believe that the fundamental desire to be with people face to face will again prevail we continue to work closely with our brand partners to ensure we are offering our customers what they need enhanced safety and cleanliness more automated and digital amenities and flexible workspaces to blend between business and leisure i am thrilled with hilton s recent announcement for opt in housekeeping at the majority of its hotels we believe that measures like these will push the industry in the right direction not only from a profitability standpoint but also from an environmental standpoint for park we have five key priorities that i would like to highlight first we are focused on reopening our three remaining suspended properties located in the new york and san francisco metro areas second we are seeking to maximize revpar by pushing average rates in the strong leisure demand markets while positioning ourselves for select business and smaller smerf and corporate group opportunities to build occupancies in urban suburban and airport locations third we remain laser focused on implementing operational efficiencies to increase profitability and realize the 85 million in cost savings or nearly 300 basis points of margin improvement we ve mentioned on previous calls fourth we continue to make progress on deleveraging our balance sheet through asset sales and finally pivoting now to offense to drive earnings growth through accretive investments including value enhancing roi projects like our bonnet creek signia conversion and meeting space expansion while eyeing several other potential brand conversions and repositionings within the portfolio with respect to future acquisitions we anticipate being very active as we head into 2022 with a continued focus on upper upscale and luxury hotels in top 25 markets and premium resort destinations turning to our second quarter results consolidated revpar came in 25 higher than expected driven by incremental growth in both occupancy and adr in select markets performance at our hotels in leisure oriented markets helped us generate 33 million of adjusted ebitda or more than 60 million ahead of the forecast we set at the beginning of the quarter results at our leisure focused properties continue to surprise to the upside with five of our hotels meeting or surpassing 2019 occupancy levels while 10 of our hotels surpassed 2019 adrs by an average of 25 during the quarter the phenomenon of revenge spending is very real and has led to price insensitivity fueled by higher than average savings and cabin fever our royal palm hotel in miami for example grew adr by 47 or 25 over the second quarter of 2019 while our two resorts in key west which have continued to see incredible demand recorded quarterly occupancy of over 92 and an adr of nearly 500 leading to nearly 50 revpar growth over the second quarter of 2019 in total our open hotels saw ancillary out of room spend increase 65 to 26 on a per occupied room basis during the second quarter compared to the same time in 2019 highlighting the pent up demand for perceived extras such as golf or spa treatments as well as the appeal of drive to destinations which provided incremental parking revenue note that this figure excludes food and beverage as many of our outlets were closed during the quarter as our food and beverage outlets reopen we expect to see incremental growth in our total revpar stats as restrictions eased during the quarter we reopened the w city center in chicago in mid may followed by the hilton san francisco union square just before memorial day and the hilton chicago in mid june we were able to move up the full reopening of all five towers in hilton hawaiian village due to the robust demand we ve been seeing in hawaii we now have 90 of our total portfolio rooms opened and hope to reopen our remaining three hotels over the coming months as we evaluate the near term business demand trends in these markets from a segmentation perspective leisure demand doubled from the first quarter and accounted for roughly 70 of total demand benefiting from strong performance in hawaii in particular while we are still seeing very modest numbers overall both business transient and group revenues also doubled from the first quarter and support the trend we are seeing of increased mobility over one third of our total group business for q2 was picked up in the quarter for the quarter as people gained confidence and restrictions eased we are seeing group pace picking up beginning in the fourth quarter with confirmed bookings pacing at roughly 50 of 2019 revenues looking ahead to 2022 we are trending at 72 of pace for 2019 at the same time in 2018 our top group markets for 2022 include hawaii new orleans key west and orlando as we mentioned on our last call we have been working tirelessly to reimagine the operating model to find incremental permanent savings across our portfolio adopting the adage of never waste a crisis we ve identified 85 million of savings which translates into nearly 300 basis points of margin improvement on an annualized basis all across our portfolio our asset managers have challenged our operating partners to think creatively cross utilize staff and reexamine contracts and procedures in hawaii for example we combined management of our two resorts under one executive leader and implemented several new operational synergies which resulted in roughly 1 5 million in savings in the second quarter we have modified operating hours or changed food and beverage outlet concepts to mitigate losses stemming from low occupancies and we have reimagined how these outlets can operate more profitably moving forward we remain confident that with the support of our brand partners we can translate these modifications into permanent practice going forward as another example of proactively sourcing operating efficiencies across our portfolio we are very pleased to have transitioned our four self managed select service hotels to third party management arrangements in july combined with our exit on these three laundry facilities last year we no longer directly manage any properties which is a significant savings to our operating model going forward diving into our markets as we have forecasted on our last call hawaii has seen a huge acceleration in demand many travelers are opting to take advantage of the ability to work from anywhere before a return to work and school after the summer and this is especially true for hawaii increased domestic airlift to the state particularly from southwest is providing u s air travelers with ready access to a tropical destination when many international destinations remain restricted for our two resorts revpar exceeded the first quarter by 104 or nearly 210 at hilton hawaiian village occupancy at our nearly 3 000 room resort jumped from 44 in april to 84 in june all from domestic leisures trip we have reopened all five towers and most of our food and beverage outlets have reopened some with operational modifications to increase profitability operating margins at the property exceeded 34 for the second quarter or just 570 basis points shy of the level achieved during the same period in 2019 at waikoloa occupancy increased from 70 in april to nearly 90 in june even more impressive we have been able to maximize rate over 2019 with june s adr of close to 300 coming in 81 higher than june 2019 in fact waikoloa generated more ebitda this past june with half the number of rooms available than it did in june 2019 clear proof that we made the right decision to transfer 600 rooms to hgv and rightsize the hotel to maximize operating efficiencies yield higher rates and drive better margins furthermore many guests are taking full advantage of all our resorts have to offer ancillary spending such as luaus parking spa and resort rentals increased 33 over the second quarter of 2019 to 116 on a per occupied room basis for our two hawaii properties during the quarter while we expect these leisure driven trends to moderate some after labor day we remain very bullish on hawaii going forward we expect strong demand over the winter holidays where we are already seeing rates in excess of 1 000 per night with that momentum expected to continue well into 2022 and beyond as we anticipate the resumption of asian travel to hawaii later next year in terms of group demand some headwinds persist from restrictions against gatherings that remain in place statewide however group pace for our hawaii hotels is currently up over 20 for 2022 and at this time we have every expectation that these groups will be able to meet albeit with potential attrition from international attendees in the early part of the year moving to florida our resorts across the state continue to have strong performance fueled by leisure strength as well as small groups in key west revpar at our two resorts was up nearly 50 from 2019 levels as we continue to reap the benefits from our renovated assets and complementary branding strategy we are seeing incredibly strong out of room spend in key west with total revpar for our two assets reaching 663 for q2 which is 37 ahead of 2019 on the group side our hotels hosted 5 200 group room nights during the quarter and local catering was up 26 from 2019 driven by weddings the resorts have more weddings on the books than they have had in any prior year with 136 weddings on the books in 2021 versus 122 in 2018 in miami our teams have employed aggressive rate strategies to drive adr 23 higher than the second quarter of 2019 our rates this summer have been more in line with peak season rather than the typical post spring break discounting we see although we do expect this to moderate post labor day and then reaccelerate as we move into the peak winter holiday season in orlando we are starting to see the return of traditional group demand our newly rebranded hotel signia by hilton bonnet creek has over 50 000 group room nights on the books for the back half of the year which is down just 5 to 2019 levels in addition the orange county convention center lifted all capacity restrictions in june and the convention calendar for the balance of the year sits at roughly 75 of 2019 levels in terms of room nights based on past trends we expect orlando and florida to continue to remain accommodating of both transient and group visitors which should continue to translate into increased bookings going forward moving to our capital allocation successes we made significant progress at reshaping our balance sheet and reducing leverage during the quarter issuing attractively priced corporate debt and also executing strategic asset sales i m especially proud of the team s efforts on the capital recycling front given the strong appetite for institutional quality assets in major markets by private equity we took advantage of market conditions and are on track to exceed our stated goal of 300 million to 400 million worth of asset sales this year with our recently completed and pending transactions we remain disciplined throughout the pandemic as the bid ask spread narrowed significantly following the widespread distribution of the vaccine further supported by our most recent completed and pending san francisco hotel sales which went under contract at less than a 2 to 3 discount to pre covid levels despite increased price transparency in the private markets the valuation gap between public and private pricing remains at among the widest gaps in recent memory similar to previous cycles however we expect the valuation gap to narrow as the lodging recovery continues to take shape and the pace of private market transactions accelerate over the coming months with respect to additional asset sales over the balance of the year while we do not have anything to report at this time we are always seeking to maximize shareholder value and we ll entertain attractive offers as they arise as we look ahead we are encouraged by the healthy lead volumes we ve seen since the start of the second quarter which have held steady at roughly 80 of 2019 levels we are seeing larger corporate and citywide meetings planned for 2022 and beyond in our major group markets while on average our more near term groups scheduled for the next couple of quarters are seeing smaller projected group sizes compared to historical levels which is not surprising given the current uncertainty surrounding the delta variant however we expect this trend to normalize over the next few months as we get past these next few weeks and as vaccination rates continue to increase as we think about transient demand for the balance of the year we expect domestic leisure to continue to lead the way combined with an uptick in business transient post labor day before i hand the call over to sean i want to emphasize the important milestones we have reached with regards to achieving breakeven at the corporate level coupled with our initiatives to sell assets and improve the overall quality of our balance sheet all well ahead of expectations this along with our operational improvements and expectation for continued improvements in overall travel demand positions park for ongoing success for the coming quarters we believe our diversified portfolio will allow us to benefit from all demand segments group business transient and leisure throughout all phases of the lodging recovery with over 1 8 billion in current liquidity we are also poised to move to offense by unlocking embedded value through targeted roi initiatives as well as strategic acquisitions that fit our strategic profile we look forward to updating you on future calls and with that i would like to turn the call over to sean who will provide you with some more color on our results and an update on our balance sheet and liquidity sean dell orto chief financial officer thanks tom overall we were very pleased with our second quarter performance with pro forma revpar sequentially increasing 92 over q1 driven by a 1 600 basis point improvement in occupancy while average daily rate exceeded 185 accounting for a 19 pro forma increase from the previous quarter driven in large part by the strong leisure demand we generated positive adjusted ebitda of 33 million for the second quarter well ahead of expectations representing the first time since the first quarter of 2020 that we generated positive adjusted ebitda we are very encouraged by the pace of improvement throughout the summer as performance accelerated in june the number of breakeven consolidated hotels increasing to 34 hotels up from just 12 during the first quarter allowing us to achieve breakeven at the corporate level during the month as well a meaningful improvement from the 23 million burn rate achieved in april in light of this past quarter s strong results and the momentum we anticipate throughout the summer we expect to exceed breakeven levels for the third quarter as well in addition to strong top line results performance throughout the second quarter was further enhanced by ongoing operating efficiencies especially within our resort properties with hotel adjusted ebitda margins exceeding 35 or 30 basis points higher than 2019 looking ahead to the third quarter july gave us a very strong start with occupancy for all open hotels improving sequentially by over 800 basis points to approximately 64 while adr is expected to reach approximately 220 for sequential improvement of over 10 from june overall we expect to finish the third quarter with an average occupancy in the mid 50 range for our consolidated portfolio while revpar is projected to exceed 100 overall an expected sequential increase in excess of 30 over q2 turning to the balance sheet as tom noted our liquidity currently stands at over 1 8 billion including nearly 1 1 billion available on our revolver and 800 million of cash on hand taking into account the sale of the two san francisco hotels this quarter our net debt which was 4 4 billion at the end of q2 is expected to decrease by nearly 300 million with 100 of the net sales proceeds used to partially repay our sole remaining bank term loan leaving just an estimated 80 million balance versus a 670 million outstanding at the start of this year over the past two years we have made incredible progress in improving the overall quality of our balance sheet raising 2 1 billion of public corporate debt while paying down over 2 3 billion of bank debt and extending our weighted average maturity profile by almost a year the public debt markets remain open while other debt markets are becoming more constructive as the lodging recovery gains more traction over the coming months and into 2022 we will continue to evaluate options to refinance our 725 million cmbs loan coming due in late 2023 and anticipate refinancing the 650 million of senior secured notes that we issued in may of last year this concludes our prepared remarks we will now open the line for q a operator may we have the first question please questions answers operator thank you ladies and gentlemen at this time we will be conducting a question and answer session our first question comes from the line of david katz with jefferies please proceed with your question david katz jefferies llc analyst hi good morning everyone thanks for taking my question i appreciate it tom it sounded in some of your opening commentary that we heard some appetite on both the buy side and the sell side any chance you can elaborate and maybe set some boundaries or give us just a little bit more color on what park would find compelling in either direction tom baltimore chairman and chief executive officer david it s a great question i would remind listeners if you think back to the journey over the last sort of five years we have worked really hard to reshape the park portfolio so we have sold now 30 assets for about 1 7 billion obviously we bought 18 assets obviously as part of the chesapeake deal for 2 5 billion so we have been very active in toggling between obviously both the sale and repositioning as well as on the buy side i think the message that i d really like to leave with you and with listeners today is we are laser focused on reopening hotels as we talked about we ve got the three remaining and again we ll wait for the right conditions to open those we have worked tirelessly on reimagining the operating model and are confident that we ve been able to pull out 85 million in cost savings and i think hilton s announcement about opt in on housekeeping is a great example but as we mentioned on the last call we ve taken out about 1 200 ftes that s resulting in about 8 of the workforce plus or minus at the property level and we ve also again really been thinking out of the box and what we shared in our prepared remarks about hawaii is a great example taking a great leader in debi bishop and having her over both properties and again taking another 1 5 million in admin out of those two great assets as an example so you ll see you ll continue to see those types of initiatives those will certainly continue to grow cash flow and then there are many options available within our portfolio for embedded roi opportunities obviously the bonnet creek that we ve talked about that has been reactivated we re really excited about that one the name change and two the repositioning of that world class resort the doubletree san jose is another great conversion opportunity for us taking that up brand like we did with the doubletree in santa barbara where we ve got incredible results and then of course the casa marina in key west is another that you ll see us reposition as well even though it s having phenomenal results in this time we had great success converting the reach to a curio and we re evaluating our options for the casa as well regarding kind of the next growth lever single asset acquisitions i mean we will like many of our peers focus on top 25 markets and upper upscale and luxury assets in top 25 markets and premium resort destinations we too will we certainly like to take a more active role as we look at opportunities both in the southwest and in the southeast that s going to be incredibly competitive for everyone but we will continue to look at that we ll be cautious we re not ruling out some of the other markets that some people are redlining we certainly believe that deals happen opportunistically and that these markets will come back albeit perhaps a little slower there s no doubt that some of the great urban markets are certainly going to recover and then of course we re going to be very interested as we look at creative ways given the huge discount between the public and private markets right now we are not going to be issuing equity it s been crystal clear through this cycle through the difficult period and i think we ve demonstrated last year even when our burn rate was at 85 million and given the challenges we made all the right moves we ve gotten back to breakeven and we didn t have any kind of dilutive equity raise we re not going to do anything like that as we move forward and clearly when we re trading at such a significant discount to nav and certainly the replacement cost but there are lots of things that we can do within this portfolio we can sell other assets and recycle that capital we could joint venture assets we ve got an iconic portfolio our top 28 assets the core account for 90 value and give us incredible optionality so we ll be very thoughtful but we want to make sure that as we raise capital that it s done at prices that reflect nav and are accretive we re clearly not going to be doing anything that s dilutive i ve been a passionate proponent i ve said that repeatedly to investors and we stand by that and you ll see that behavior as we move forward david katz jefferies llc analyst perfect and as my follow up i just wanted to ask about the chesapeake portfolio if we can go back in time a part of the thesis was the opportunity to grow margins with less of less through the ota channel i realize it may be a little bit of an unfair comparison but can you just talk about progress to that end if it s available at this stage tom baltimore chairman and chief executive officer yeah there s no doubt that it still remains available david look we stand by the chesapeake acquisition we believe then as we do now that it really improves the overall portfolio quality we have brand and operator diversification it gave us geographic diversification it improved our growth profile and again embedded value both from roi opportunities margin and grouping up so sean and the asset management team continue to work on those initiatives we have sold some of the assets in the chesapeake portfolio but candidly those were assets in almost every situation but one where really those were not really compliant with our intermediate or long term asset goals so we are we ve got 11 remaining out of the 18 and are confident that all of those provide the kind of opportunities that we underwrote initially and you may recall that right before getting hit by the asteroid we had 21 of the 24 million in synergies really already identified and accounted for so still very very bullish on the chesapeake acquisition as we look forward david katz jefferies llc analyst appreciate it thank you so much tom baltimore chairman and chief executive officer thank you operator our next question comes from the line of floris van dijkum with compass point please proceed with your question floris van dijkum compass point research trading analyst thanks thanks for taking my question tom i love hearing your view on not issuing equity below nav maybe if you could give us some of your thoughts on nav and obviously it s an evolving target but presumably with some of the transactions that have occurred and some of the increased activity that we re seeing in the market right now what do you think i mean how should we think about your nav right now going forward and also how is that how much has that increased since the dark days in january february tom baltimore chairman and chief executive officer floris it s a great question you can imagine we feel a lot better today than certainly 16 months ago and i m sure our peers feel the same way as we were in the dark days obviously of the pandemic i think our consensus nav is somewhere in the 27 a share the reality is pre pandemic we were probably closer to 30 if not above that there s been about 3 of scarring from the pandemic in terms of the amount of cash that we had to really expand in terms of the carry during that period of time we ve recovered significantly as you look at our balance sheet and the moves that we ve made a lot of credit to sean our finance team and just how proactive this is a very seasoned and experienced team we knew what to do we went into action we never panicked we didn t panic then we re certainly not going to panic now and i think it ties into your comment about dilutive equity moves we avoid it we were crystal clear and firm in our position that we wouldn t do a dilutive equity trade and that still applies today so we trade at probably one of the widest discounts at nav today and so we clearly are not going to be looking to do any kind of equity offer any kind of atm program it doesn t in our view for park it doesn t make sense at all to be selling equity at such a huge discount again this portfolio provides such great optionality and i alluded to it in the question that david asked is look we can recycle assets out of certain other markets we could joint venture assets the market and we ve demonstrated and we ve shown there s so much liquidity on the private side we can get nav or above nav so it makes no sense to be selling equity in our view and you ll see us continue to be creative and thoughtful but rest assured we will create value either the public markets will recognize our value or the private markets but we will create value for shareholders floris van dijkum compass point research trading analyst if i can follow up on that vein in terms of obviously you ve got a couple of irreplaceable assets multibillion dollar assets particularly in hawaii that was i believe institutionally owned in the past would you consider selling a stake in hawaii village to a large institutional investor or one of your other trophy assets tom baltimore chairman and chief executive officer yeah i think we would clearly explore with a trophy asset obviously the last on that list as you can imagine would be hilton hawaiian village we get calls all the time i would respectfully submit that i can t imagine that there is a reit asset across any sector as valuable as hilton hawaiian village 22 acres five towers we re working on the sixth tower and getting the optionality of adding another tower there world renowned but we will do what s in shareholders best interest and we will create value for shareholders floris van dijkum compass point research trading analyst thanks tom appreciate it tom baltimore chairman and chief executive officer yeah thank you operator our next question comes from the line of rich hightower with evercore isi please proceed with your question rich hightower evercore isi analyst hey good morning guys tom baltimore chairman and chief executive officer good morning rich rich hightower evercore isi analyst tom i want to follow up on the investment question and you sold two san francisco assets for reasons i think all on this call we understand but i m curious for your longer term expectations for that market knowing that it s always going to be a relatively low supply market and demand is going to grow eventually once we get out of covid here maybe back to prior peak levels whenever that happens so how do you sort of pair the income and the value foregone from selling those assets versus maybe what you re looking at currently in terms of future acquisitions as we think about a use of proceeds there tom baltimore chairman and chief executive officer yeah it s a great question rich and the reality is we love the san francisco market long term when you think to the point that you made you ve got one huge barriers to entry and real supply constraints there you ve got multiple sources of demand corporate convention and clearly on the leisure front and we do believe that san francisco will come back i would not bet against them great cities of the world i clearly would put san francisco in that bucket for us it became really two issues it was both a concentration issue san francisco is about 17 we d really like to be sort of inside of 15 and candidly the need to delever we thought it was really important to have the optionality on the balance sheet and so we looked at the six holdings the six assets that we owned in the cbd and concluded obviously adagio was better hands in private equity given the adjacent parcel and the optionality there and sort of a small box and le meridien in a perfect world in normalized conditions probably one that we would have liked to keep but when you compare that against the other assets we really thought that one it had a lot of optionality we could achieve a really respectable pricing comparable to 2019 you do recall a year ago rich everybody said there was going to be all this distress and assets were going to be trading at 30 40 discounts i think you will recall and listeners will recall i was crystal clear in saying that park would not participate and we wouldn t sell assets at that kind of pricing we waited prudently and appropriately and obviously realized in both assets attractive pricing so proud of the team proud of the discipline we certainly made the right move regarding other markets everybody is chasing the southeast now we ve been to this movie before remember 10 years ago when everybody wanted lifestyle hotels in new york and everybody ran to buy lifestyle and i d respectfully submit that didn t work out so well i think here in the what s happening in the southwest and what s happening in the southeast we certainly agree it s business friendly we ve seen the change in population growth and demand growth those markets are going to be attractive it s going to be competitive we are well positioned in florida right now but we too will be looking opportunistically and we ll have to evaluate the pricing and the situation and where it makes sense i think investors need to understand that we have great optionality in our portfolio just not sure we re getting the credit that people understand that there s lots we can do with this portfolio to continue to create tremendous value for shareholders rich hightower evercore isi analyst thank you tom that s all i got tom baltimore chairman and chief executive officer thank you operator our next question comes from the line of smedes rose with citi please proceed with your question smedes rose citi analyst hi thanks i just i wanted to ask you a little bit more about the 85 million of cost savings with the recent investments at hilton made around housekeeping is that factored into those cost savings or do you think there could be upside to that or does it just give you more kind of certainty around meeting that number sean dell orto chief financial officer yeah smedes this is sean the recent hilton policy change there or locking in opt in housekeeping is not included in the 85 the 85 million is an exercise of us looking at department head roles manager roles within whether they call it front desk or ultimately f b outlets and whatnot so it was kind of going kind of position by position within each property and kind of thinking through the org chart and not so much about brand initiatives so certainly some upside potential there with hilton s opt in change going forward smedes rose citi analyst yeah no it seems like there would be i mean do you have any sense any way to kind of quantify it a little bit or is it too early sean dell orto chief financial officer i think it s too early to tell certainly we got to get into you got to kind of get the business traveler back here to kind of get a sense we certainly have looked and seen how the cleanstay program has worked over the last couple of quarters it s not exact science it s not perfect but we certainly think that we ve seen gains in and above the upfront expense of having to clean the room with additional protocols and whatnot each time there s a checkout which clearly that s coming off and the opt in kind of strategy remaining so i think certainly we ll see some benefits going forward from it but still a little bit early to kind of quantify at this point smedes rose citi analyst ok and then i also just wanted to ask you you mentioned you ll be cash flow positive in the third quarter but fourth quarter is left out and is that do you think you ll be cash flow negative in the fourth quarter or is it again too early to tell and maybe if you can talk a little bit about how the transition i guess from leisure season into a more business travel group centered season how that s scaling or kind of what you see in the near term sean dell orto chief financial officer sure i think certainly we look it s more kind of near term focus for us just to kind of look at the cash positions for q3 we certainly had a very strong july and we ll see as we transition with from august which obviously will be a little bit could be a little bit lighter as people think about going back to school and getting prepared to go back to the office we ll certainly see that leisure could ultimately be slowing down a little bit traditionally it does and we re certainly seeing august kind of holding its own but for the most part july was certainly a very strong month for us so we feel good about the quarter overall going to q4 we certainly think there s a leisure component that really comes back around the holidays and so the question really remains around the business transient which we ve certainly seen great business transient we think progress over the last several months we ve kind of looked at midweek occupancies across non resort oriented hotels in our portfolio a couple of dozen or so we ve seen it go from about 35 to 65 from april through mid july so we certainly feel that there is some data that kind of goes along with some of the anecdotes we ve seen and experienced ourselves with people coming to visit us and having meetings externally so i think there s people out there traveling ahead of their offices reopening we certainly expect that to continue and pick up as we get into the september and post labor day months i should say but ultimately we ve got to certainly be respectful of the fact that the delta variant could ultimately have some impact as well so certainly still a lot of visibility for us to kind of get better visibility on as we get into q4 so not so much to say that we don t think q4 is that way just kind of more keeping it near term focused smedes rose citi analyst great thank you operator our next question comes from the line of aryeh klein with bmo capital markets please proceed with your question aryeh klein bmo capital markets analyst thank you maybe on the optionality in the portfolio you noted some opportunities but how are you thinking about timing there especially for some of the bigger ones when could we expect to see more progress on those tom baltimore chairman and chief executive officer we continue to evaluate opportunities you ll hear more probably as we get to third fourth quarter and beyond these things tend to be opportunistic and candidly that will depend on how the overall demand patterns unfold i think it will depend on discussions that we have we get lots of inbound calls all the time about different ways to work together there s no shortage of private capital and there s no shortage of obviously private capital is prepared to pay nav or above and the public markets are dragging we ve been to this movie before as we get more visibility we think the public markets will catch up we re certainly not going to wait we re going to continue to execute the initiatives that we talked about both on continuing to rightsize the operating model looking at embedded roi and then other ways that we can unlock so it could be that we sell some additional assets and recycle capital it could be that we look to partner and unlike unlock capital that way some of the tax implications of the spin go away here at the end of the year so that makes it a lot gives us even more optionality as we get into 2022 the other thing to keep in mind and again i don t think the market always appreciates is just the complexity of the spin we sold 30 assets 14 of those international we inherited the laundry business we ve gotten rid of that we had four assets that we had to self operate as part against some of the requirements of the spin we ve now solved that problem and we ve got third party operators so the park team has been incredibly busy proud of our work obviously none of us expected to get hit by the asteroid the pandemic we quickly retooled we ve managed it our balance sheet is in outstanding shape and we have a lot of optionality and we can toggle between defense and offense but you can certainly begin to see us positioning to offense we ve got scale and we will be a player so make no mistake about that aryeh klein bmo capital markets analyst and then on the group side as businesses book events are there any new trends or differences that you re seeing relative to how groups look previously and then are they asking for different things and are you seeing like for like events book with for fewer people especially as you look out to 2022 tom baltimore chairman and chief executive officer yeah i d say a couple of things i think we all can expect that your i was out at alis obviously you had the mask mandate out in l a but i think what we re going to continue to see is you re going to see more of a return to normal like we saw on the leisure front it accelerated lots of pent up demand i think you re going to see the same thing on both the business and on the group side for even those companies that have people working remotely what i hear from ceos and other business leaders men and women that they re going to look to get their people together more frequently so you may see people getting together in smaller groups or larger groups for training for innovation for team building that need to be together isn t going to go away you have to believe that advances in technology and hybrid meetings that there ll be applications i don t know that anybody has perfected it yet i m on zoom calls and combination zoom meetings and they work fine and they worked fine during the pandemic because we had no other alternative now people want to be together they see the benefit of it and i think things will accelerate closer back to where we were than i think people realize i want to be on the road i ve been on the road i m getting more inbounds of people that want to come in once we get a return to office once we get schools reopened once we get past this delta wave and the more people we can get vaccinated the sooner the better it s going to be for all of us but there s no there s been no real change and you can expect some hybrid stuff on the margin but we re all not going to be doing hybrid meetings i just don t i don t see that as a new standard as we move forward aryeh klein bmo capital markets analyst thanks for the color tom baltimore chairman and chief executive officer yeah thank you operator our next question comes from the line of anthony powell with barclays please proceed with your question anthony powell barclays investment bank analyst hi good morning just a question on tom baltimore chairman and chief executive officer good morning anthony powell barclays investment bank analyst good morning good morning a question on hilton both going to opt in housekeeping and also changing some of the breakfast benefits for elite members you have a lot of full service hiltons and i m guessing some of the customers may be used to daily housekeeping and a generous breakfast how has that been received by customers and do you worry about any kind of long term impact to customer satisfaction from these changes tom baltimore chairman and chief executive officer no i ll jump in here anthony then sean can jump in first of all as i said in my prepared remarks i really applaud hilton we have got to use the crisis as an opportunity to reimagine the operating model i think the opt in was the right move i think the changing the credit for elite members was also i think more efficient and i think we re going to continue to see changes in food and beverage and whether that s room service or whether that s grab and go or eliminating threeal restaurants that are unprofitable we have to think about the business differently this crisis was painful for all of us particularly owners but also for the brands as well if they don t have a healthy owner community they re not going to continue getting that distribution as they d like to see and need to see so i think the moves were the right moves as we move forward clearly the luxury product and luxury customer i think we ll be less likely to make those changes but we continue to evaluate it and i think on the margin there have been modest or small complaints but the reality is i think people are accepting of where we are right now sean dell orto chief financial officer yeah and i would just quickly add that in the end as i mentioned before i mean we still need to kind of see a good return of that business customer too to kind of test this opt in we certainly early on have not seen many complaints and certainly not have heard from our friends at hilton around that certainly they re very focused on making sure they maintain their market share and market premiums so we re certainly in conversations around any of the brand standards as we thought about it being brought back with that in mind but also within obviously the bottom line in mind as well we re certainly having great conversations as we kind of layer things back in or think about it so i think we re encouraged about how that these things work going forward but we have to kind of see and test it out over the next several months anthony powell barclays investment bank analyst got it and one more on capex you guys have been pretty consistent in your capex as a percent of revenue i guess up to the pandemic i know you have you re working on signia in orlando maybe an update on the new orleans i guess convention center expansion there other projects and just general capex levels over the next few years do you think you need to up capex going forward or is that 7 still kind of where you want to be tom baltimore chairman and chief executive officer yeah anthony we ve been kind of in that 6 5 to 7 i know sean and the team are looking at possibly increasing that slightly we ve got the three roi projects that i mentioned those are probably about 200 million in capital and we think the returns are probably 14 to 15 and you re probably looking at ebitda somewhere in the 30 million range that does not include new orleans new orleans is certainly more complex but keep in mind we ve got the whale lot that we often referred to we ve got eight acres plus or minus and we ve got 5 million square feet of additional far adjacent to the convention center that s clearly a longer term project and one that we would look for a development partner and others as we proceed but we see huge huge upside i mean that could be another sort of l a live type execution there in new orleans we want to find the right timing for it but we see huge upside again none of that is factored into nav or future growth but it s land that was in land bank 25 plus years ago and obviously we appreciate having that benefit for future shareholders of park anthony powell barclays investment bank analyst got it thank you tom baltimore chairman and chief executive officer thank you operator our next question comes from the line of chris woronka with deutsche bank please proceed with your question chris woronka deutsche bank analyst hey good morning guys tom baltimore chairman and chief executive officer good morning chris chris woronka deutsche bank analyst good morning tom i was hoping we could circle back to the acquisition topic for just a minute and obviously you guys took on the chesapeake portfolio you ve sold a bunch of mostly single assets including some of the chesapeake hotels and you mentioned that you could potentially jv some of your assets and free up a fair amount of capital so should we triangulate that to mean you might have a preference for chunkier deals or portfolios going forward as opposed to a lot of your peers focusing on a one off acquisition strategy tom baltimore chairman and chief executive officer yeah it s a great question chris i would say it s really to be opportunistic we want to be nimble enough and we are nimble enough whether it s a single asset that s chunky i mean we clearly want upper upscale or luxury assets top 25 markets by definition we think those will probably be acquisitions that are certainly north of 100 million or more so they by definition will be chunky but we re also not opposed to portfolio or larger deals and we re also not opposed to m a we don t think m a is the timing is right today for all the obvious reasons but we still believe that having 15 16 lodging reits at some point we hope that investors and we hope that analysts will start to encourage we re the most fragmented segment in all of lodging so at some point that discussion will make sense again not something that we are looking at today and not something we re spending time on we think it s more important to execute the initiatives and priorities that i already outlined but we certainly believe long term that you will see the sector consolidated at some point chris woronka deutsche bank analyst ok very good appreciate that thanks tom tom baltimore chairman and chief executive officer thanks operator our next question comes from the line of bill crow with raymond james please proceed with your question bill crow raymond james analyst hey thanks good morning hey tom we ve heard some indications on the airline front that they re seeing a greater than seasonal decline in forward ticket sales and i assume that would be related mostly to the latest delta outbreak but anything you re seeing from a cancellation front or reservations over the next call it 30 days that we might be entering a little bit of an air pocket sean dell orto chief financial officer yeah bill this is sean we have seen in select spots some cancellations it s kind of concentrated in as you would expect markets like orlando florida and new orleans i would say that it s also kind of really concentrated in kind of this month and kind of up to mid september in terms of some cancellation activity it s a few and certainly notably too it s been a majority of what we ve seen which has not been a lot is kind of actually the medical groups so but in the end it s interesting because a lot of stuff we saw in orlando is medical groups but we haven t seen much impact in our bonnet creek complex we ve seen it in some other assets we have in orlando so a little bit of activity there and certainly we re seeing a little bit of kind of pause wait and see and some prospecting for groups that might be looking to kind of hold off and make a decision in a few weeks to see how things play out so potential slight air pocket bill but i would say that i think people most people generally think this kind of peaks pretty quickly and i think we just will probably get back to regular activity probably as we get to the end of the month here and early september tom baltimore chairman and chief executive officer bill it s tom the other thing i would say as sean said look it s probably small air pockets we re not overly concerned and i think we all believe we re going to get to the other side we need to see vaccinations accelerate we need people to get their shots and we need candidly as i said in my speech out at alis we need leaders to lead and we need companies and governments to mandate i think that s the only way we re going to get to the other side and we re beginning to see people do that now which is encouraging but i would also say if you look at our non resort markets and if you look at say through mid april to sort of mid july we saw an uptick in occupancy going from say 35 up to probably 65 so we re seeing business transient and again these are the non resorts this is not hawaii or florida or new orleans and the other markets where we re getting just that prolific growth we were seeing that sort of midweek tuesday wednesday occupancy grow so that s an encouraging sign and i think the other side of it is look we re we all need to live with the facts and circumstances get vaccinated and put your mask on and get moving and i think people are moving forward you re not going to see massive lockdowns you re not going to see we believe the panic and hysteria we got to get moving and i think you re going to continue to see that bill crow raymond james analyst yeah i appreciate that tom you led me right into my follow up question on mandates today united airlines announced they were going to mandate vaccinations for their employees so i m wondering how much pressure you re able to put on hilton to enforce a mandate to introduce and enforce a mandate tom baltimore chairman and chief executive officer well i certainly am not going to try to speak for my good friend chris he s more than capable to speak and to set that tone and he s a dynamic leader and i would expect that he will arrive at the right conclusion i was crystal clear in my remarks out at alis and i ll say it again we re not going to get to the other side until we have leaders leading and mandating and we re doing it at park and i m doing it and saying it on this call and any forum i get and look there are going to be exceptions whether it s for medical or religious but the reality is we ve got to get shots in arms to move forward so i ve said my piece bill crow raymond james analyst appreciate it thanks guys operator our next question comes from the line of neil malkin with capital one securities please proceed with your question neil malkin capital one securities analyst hey neil operator neil your line is live neil malkin capital one securities analyst oh sorry i was on mute that never happens i apologize just thinking about the delta variant and things that are potentially being implemented or things that are being canceled one of the things about delta is that its clinical breakthrough rate is pretty significant in terms of people who get it have already been vaccinated with the original vaccine so given those things and you re starting to see companies delay back to work and i m just wondering i guess what do you expect or what s your view on if like the un assembly or fashion week broadway stuff is held up as an example and what s your kind of view on if vaccine passports are mandated in some of your bigger markets like call it new york and california how do you think that winds up playing out in terms of both business and leisure demand near term tom baltimore chairman and chief executive officer yeah a couple of things and neil i m not a medical professional but from what i read obviously the suite of vaccines that we have available are holding up really well the problems are largely i mean 99 are with people that are unvaccinated so i think it s important to sort of level set and i think the more pressure encouragement that we get from both the federal government and local governments business leaders those men and women and those companies sort of mandating vaccines the faster we re going to get to the other side i don t think you re going to see widespread lockdowns we ve been there done that i just don t think the nation is ready prepared or willing to do that in my view and we re watching demand patterns carefully part of the reason why new york is certainly remains closed is we want to make sure that we open at the right time given the size and complexity of that asset among the other large assets that we have in san francisco so we ll continue to study it i suspect if anything you might see a few companies delay but i think the vast majority of people assuming schools are reopening some of the child care issues are addressed that people want to get back to being with their colleagues and continuing to interact in person so maybe it gets pushed back a few weeks maybe it gets pushed back a month but i do think that becomes the exception rather than the rule neil malkin capital one securities analyst ok great and then just kind of looking at i understand booking windows are short but in terms of business transient and group let s call it post labor day or into the fourth quarter what do you expect demand to be or what s a reasonable level of demand for the business transient and group segments relative to 19 levels in sort of later in this year is 50 a good bogey or if you could just talk about that maybe sean that would be helpful in kind of gauging how things are going to progress in modeling sean dell orto chief financial officer yeah i think that s a fair bogey when you think about kind of our mix we should kind of as we kind of look out i think we certainly see try getting the mix back to kind of if we think about group and business trends kind of to where half of what it was back in 19 so i think it s a fair thing to say about 50 of normal neil malkin capital one securities analyst ok thank you operator our next question comes from the line of brandt montour with j p morgan please proceed with your question brandt montour j p morgan analyst hello everyone good afternoon thanks for squeezing me in here i just have one question on the dividend as we think about how you guys are going to deleverage naturally in 22 and 23 and the free cash flow associated with the business what how is the board thinking about reimplementing the dividend under from the context of what do you think you might need to pay over those two years versus what you might want to pay from a reit perspective versus just a corporate finance perspective tom baltimore chairman and chief executive officer we re certainly going to meet whatever the reit obligations are obviously coming through this window gives us again a lot of optionality given some of the nols that we have and allow us to redirect capital to some of the roi projects and other initiatives that we ve talked about so we do appreciate having that flexibility that we candidly did not have at the start of the spin just given the relatively low tax basis for part of the original portfolio so we clearly want to reinstate the dividend probably more at a very modest level and then have it we ll top it off at the end of the year but you would expect that our dividend would certainly be lower than what we ve had historically brandt montour j p morgan analyst ok thanks for that guys operator our next question comes from the line of gregory miller with truist please proceed with your question gregory miller truist securities analyst thanks and good afternoon tom baltimore chairman and chief executive officer hey greg gregory miller truist securities analyst hey how are you doing tom tom baltimore chairman and chief executive officer good gregory miller truist securities analyst great great i m hoping to follow up on the topic from your prepared remarks i appreciate visibility may be limited but what are your current expectations of the timing and trajectory of the recovery of the japanese consumer to oahu and hawaiian village perhaps how you see 22 playing out at this point tom baltimore chairman and chief executive officer well greg it s a great question if you think historically visitation in hawaii has been 8 5 million 9 million about 62 of that coming from the u s 17 of that coming from japanese travelers this will be probably the second year that they have been down those trends coming out of japan have been pretty consistent over the last 30 years so it s about 30 of visitation in hilton hawaiian village international about 60 of that coming from japanese travelers so about 223 000 room nights so we would fully expect as you see vaccinations ramp up and international begin to that to start to see a ramp up i would say the second half of 22 and then see that just explode into 23 and part of that is again you will have had two seasons where that very loyal traveler who visits japan visits hawaii often and again given that 30 year history we would expect just a really strong resumption sort of that revenge spending that reclaim recapture what they ve lost and effectively would have been away for almost two years from hawaii and we re not getting any of that today as you know but because you re not seeing the international travel we re getting all the domestic travel so we see that as just another leg in continued growth for hawaii we think hawaii will continue to outperform and that s 25 30 of our revenue gregory miller truist securities analyst makes a lot of sense i d like to follow up on also on the international front this is more of a higher level question but since you mentioned leaders leading i think you re well suited to address this question i would be interested to hear your thoughts on the travel infrastructure today to induce international demand to your gateway markets as corridors start to reopen and i think in particular about how local cities are communicating to international travelers given varying policies in cities and states on items such as indoor mask requirements or perhaps presenting vaccination cards at restaurants i m not sure if the confusion may impact near term interest to visit the u s or if this is just a non issue how concerned are you that travelers may be confused and what do you think can be done to improve these potential communication issues should the efforts be at the local cbd level from hotels and the airlines perhaps more a national basis maybe i m overstepping the issue here but i d be curious to hear your thoughts about it tom baltimore chairman and chief executive officer yeah it s a great question i don t know that we ve got enough time because we could spend 30 40 minutes on it and i go back to my earlier comment i think the first is we ve got to get people vaccinated both domestically and i think abroad and the sooner we get that that s going to provide people with the confidence and protection and then we ve got to reopen borders and i think part of it is you ve got to have it consistent i know we ve dealt in markets like chicago where you had the governor had one point of view and the mayor had another and until they were aligned we really couldn t reopen there and i think the same thing applies to many of the other cities and i also think if you had the travel industry and you re seeing it now you re seeing united i suspect the other companies or airlines are going to follow suit i mean leaders should lead and we ve got to have a consistent message have the mandate have a strict policy of masks until we can get to the herd immunity and get to the point and then have some sort of vaccination card i think many years ago many of us had it as we were i m older than probably a lot of people on the call but we had a record of the vaccinations and we need it to go to school i just think we re going to have to figure out a way and a process and we re going to have to live with the delta variant or others until it s eradicated and we can accelerate that and the risk by getting people vaccinated so i ll stop there just in the interest of time but welcome the opportunity to have a sidebar with you at your convenience gregory miller truist securities analyst thanks i appreciate the insights operator our next question comes from the line of lukas hartwich with green street please proceed with your question lukas hartwich green street advisors analyst thanks good morning tom baltimore chairman and chief executive officer hey lukas lukas hartwich green street advisors analyst hey how are you tom baltimore chairman and chief executive officer good i hope you re well lukas hartwich green street advisors analyst great thanks so for the unconsolidated portfolio are there any opportunities to reduce or increase stakes there tom baltimore chairman and chief executive officer yeah in terms of buying and taking an increased interest in them lukas you broke up a little bit i want to make sure i understand the question lukas hartwich green street advisors analyst yeah sorry yeah the unconsolidated portfolio there s some assets in there some held by owners that arguably have higher levels of leverage may need access to capital so i m just curious if there s any opportunity to increase stakes in some of those or maybe even sell stakes potentially tom baltimore chairman and chief executive officer yeah all the above and we continue to engage in discussions keep in mind our top core portfolio accounts for 90 of the value all of those remaining 10 joint ventures have different legal and tax complexities some of that will be easier for us to address here once we get out of the remaining the fifth year sort of threshold on the spin so that will give us increased optionality next year to continue to accelerate some of them have short term ground leases that have to either be extended or modified as well so everyone has a unique story but rest assured that the men and women at park are working hard on that like you ve seen us clean up in terms of the 30 assets that we ve sold and including the international getting rid of the laundry business getting out of the management business we ve got work streams underway on many of those assets lukas hartwich green street advisors analyst excellent thank you tom baltimore chairman and chief executive officer thank you operator there are no further questions in the queue i d like to hand the call back to management for closing remarks tom baltimore chairman and chief executive officer thank you we really appreciate everybody taking time today hope you enjoy the remaining part of your summer and we look forward to seeing many of you in person in september october and look forward to our next call in early november stay

you think you know someone and then they die before their time and suddenly you know them no longer a good friend of mine died last month aged just 53 i say he was a good friend but i had never known his surname he had been known by one and all across this fair city as ben i called him white ben for reasons that will become apparent on his untimely and unexpected death i thought that at least i would learn his surname if only to be able to share it with you as i relate how much this man meant to me and many others the only snag was that ben wasn t actually his name in other words i didn t actually know either the christian name or surname of the man for whom i write this obituary rest assured ben would have found this hilarious in death as he did constantly in life he s laughing and smiling as he makes the rest of us do the same this begs the question who was ben his name was stephen wright he was born in baillieston in 1967 he attended bannerman high school apparently ben came from the fact that he and his three brothers used to play bonanza after the popular american tv western someone had to play to play the widowed father of the family stephen was chosen and thus became ben his daughter jacqueline jaq tells me that the nurses during his last few days would address him as stephen the name on his records she had to ask them to call him ben because he wouldn t know they were speaking to him for the better part of the last 25 years ben worked in various cash and carries across glasgow starting at u save in queenslie before taking on a supervisor s role at sher brothers in tradeston almost ten years ago to the week he became the manager of a shop that means a very great deal to me krk on woodlands road was for many immigrant families the first and only place to stock up on their subcontinental necessities it even has a dedicated halal butchery section my parents have been taking me to krk since i was a wean so curious though it may sound to many i have a deep emotional connection to it to this very day i leave krk with a new magical ingredient whenever an out of town visitor pitches up in glasgow krk forms a stop on my own personal tour of the city just after the university just before kelvingrove park i believe any visitor ought to experience the aladdin s cave of bounteous riches contained crammed within the modestly sized shop and ben knew where everything was and how to get you anything krk was what brought ben and me together for the last seven or so years since my return home i have been frequenting krk on a regular basis sometimes as often as five times a week occasionally more than once a day i did all my shopping there commercial and personal ben would always give me a discount when i was cooking for a charitable project or for the homeless that is very much the muslim way and it also happened to be very much in ben s wheelhouse he spoke more than a few phrases of urdu and punjabi it always tickled me that ben a white guy managed this quintessentially pakistani punjabi business so i lovingly called him white ben this made davie one of the other employees and a staunch rangers fan laugh again ben would until last season mercilessly rib davie about his team to the extent that i assumed ben was of the green persuasion football wise but guess what ben was a gers fan i know you may be forgiven for wondering why the manager of a pakistani grocery shop should be included in this section normally reserved for the good and the great i have no doubt that all these august citizens featured in this page contributed a great to modern life as we know it in glasgow and scotland but for me and so many others ben epitomised my modern nation our contemporary country ben was my glasgow i grew up near the streets of woodlands back in the seventies racist name calling was a daily occurrence to and from and during primary school if i had known back then that i would see an urdu punjabi speaking white dude managing a pakistani shop i would have scarcely believed it our country is far from perfect but the fact that we can create people like ben people who straddle the modern multiculturalism of the new millennium says a very great deal about who we are as a a people and who we can be i ve been unable to return to krk since ben s passing i can t bear the thought of him not being there not taking the mick my mum hasn t been back yet either he never failed to ask after both my parents when i was in ben is survived by tracy his wife of 36 years by jaq and her siblings stephen and danielle and by grandchildren emma aiden and ava i ll miss ben my friend shopping for lentils and garam masala will never be the same the city has lost a most beloved son but as i have pondered how and what to write as i have considered a suitable elegy for ben i have laughed and smiled and shed a tear but there is one thing that i know for certain this modest man from a modest background showed us all that in our own unique way we can all be the great change we wish to see whatever your name is

the results on our website before turning the call over i want to remind everyone that due to the fccs anti collusion rules related to auction 110 we will not be responding to any questions related to spectrum auctions and now ill turn the call over to pete sereda pete peter l sereda executive vice president chief financial officer thanks jane and good morning everyone before speaking about the balance sheet and our funding strategies i wanted to recognize all the actions that both of our business units are taking to lead to higher returns and stronger businesses over the next several years turning to the income statement i want to call your attention to a couple of unusual items first our effective tax rate was a negative 48 9 during the quarter due primarily to the reduction of certain tax accruals and as part of redeeming some of our higher cost debt we recorded an additional 36 million in noncash interest expense 20 million of which was at u s cellular and this was to write off unamortized debt issuance costs from prior bond transactions as weve discussed on past calls maintaining financial flexibility is one of the pillars of our corporate strategy over the years weve worked to retain relatively low leverage levels long dated maturities sufficient undrawn revolving credit facilities and significant cash balances while at the same time making sure we have the financial resources we need to fund our businesses as you can see on slide four at the end of the second quarter tds continues to maintain a solid financial position including ample available funding sources consisting of cash and cash equivalents and available credit facilities which is especially important since u s cellular and tds telecom are both currently in investment cycles with u s cellular investing in network monetization 5g and spectrum and tds telecom aggressively investing in fiber expansion we will continue to look for innovative ways to finance these investments while preserving our credit rating turning to slide five i also wanted to call your attention to all the work that has been done to lower the average cost of our financings as you can see through june 30 weve redeemed over 1 billion in debt with a weighted average cost of 7 1 and replaced it with debt with an average cost of 4 8 this results in a run rate of 25 million in annual coupon savings on the redeemed debt and then earlier this week both tds and u s cellular announced additional redemptions of high cost senior notes and this will raise the amount redeemed by over 450 million to a total of almost 1 6 billion also earlier this week and shortly after we announced that we were calling the u s cellular notes and planning to fund the transaction by drawing down on our eip securitization moodys affirmed tds corporate family rating but downgraded the remaining u s cellular senior notes the reason for this downgrade reflects the fact that the new eip debt that will be taken on to fund the redemption comes ahead of the remaining notes in right of payment the downgrade is specific just to those notes not to the company in general moodys views the recent refinancing steps to lower the cost of the balance sheet as credit positive in sum we believe both business units have a lot of growth opportunities and we are ensuring that we have the financial resources to fund them while at the same time we are continuing to lower the average cost to finance them i will now turn the call over to lt lt laurent c therivel president chief executive officer director thanks pete and good morning everybody its been about a year since i joined the company and i continue to be just blown away with the team and the culture at u s cellular i want to thank all of our stakeholders and that includes everybody on this call for the support and the input over the past year if we turn to page seven our strategic priorities remain simple and theyre designed to drive growth and improve return on capital over time were about halfway through the year and were making really good progress toward these priorities im going to let doug cover the operational and the financial highlights of the second quarter while id like to provide a couple of thoughts on these strategic priorities and top of mind for me right now is the competitive environment weve seen some really aggressive promotions out there for both new and existing customers and as doug will touch on it had an impact on our postpaid subscriber results for the quarter we are maintaining our focus on profitable growth and were leveraging our regionally focused strategy to test different offers to help us hone in on the right balance between subscriber growth and profitability ive talked about this in prior calls but i believe one of the benefits of having noncontiguous regions is the ability to test different approaches to see what resonates with our customers and you see this and how were approaching the marketplace right now weve got some very aggressive offers to drive switching in certain markets with more upgrade focused offers than others were going to continue to work these trials so that we have the right approach when we get to the main selling season later this year i spoke to you last quarter about some of our new initiatives to drive growth in our business and government and prepaid segments we made some changes to our prepaid offerings which led to really strong prepaid results this quarter the business and government segments are a longer term effort but im beginning to see some encouraging signs i feel confident in our ability to drive growth there particularly in the iot and the private networking space so a few words on our network vision network performance is the hallmark of our value proposition were continuing our network modernization program and our multiyear 5g deployment the majority of our traffic is now carried by sites that have 5g deployed and this helps maintain our network leadership and it also brings down our costs we continue to be optimistic on the use of millimeter wave spectrum for fixed wireless access were continuing two tracks of work one on technology and one on market demand the technology testing frankly is exceeding our expectations weve been working with our partners on extending millimeter wave distances and most recently we achieved another world record using our 5g millimeter wave spectrum achieving near gigabit speeds over a distance of 10 kilometers this milestone can potentially bring extended range 5g service with massive capacity and low latency to even more of our footprint that includes more rural areas on the market demand side were continuing our 5g millimeter wave high speed internet trials and weve seen some early encouraging results its very clear that customers in our areas are looking for alternatives to the current providers in the marketplace turning briefly to washington im encouraged by the recent progress made on bipartisan infrastructure legislation and i join other companies in the business roundtable in encouraging passage of the proposal im encouraged that the proposed legislation sets aside funds for both infrastructure and affordability both of those are going to be critical in bridging the digital divide to be just a bit more specific im particularly encouraged that the requirements for infrastructure funding dont require symmetric speeds that would have been disaster for efficient funding of rural broadband asymmetric requirements allow any network technology to compete for funding that includes wireless and funding those wireless build outs helps both fixed and mobile use cases and hopefully and i am hopeful that this infrastructure legislation could be an example of avoiding partisan politics and putting america and americans first finally with the rollout of the vaccine i recently had more opportunities to get out in the field visit stores talk to customers and talk to associates in person hopefully well continue to see progress on the vaccine so we can maintain the positive momentum over the past few months o ur field teams in the stores and the network have been doing just a tremendous job keeping our customers connected in some really challenging circumstances and for the portion of our workforce that has been working remotely we just announced our return to office approach well be focusing on purposeful interactions instead of acquiring a certain number of days in the office we hope this will strike the right balance between in person time for culture reinforcement while also acknowledging the productivity and coordination lessons learned from the pandemic personally im just looking forward to meeting more members of my team for the very first time in person and with that doug im going to turn it over to you to cover the details of the quarter douglas w chambers executive vice president chief financial officer treasurer thanks lt good morning lets start with a review of customer results on slide eight postpaid handset gross additions increased by 16 000 year over year due to higher switching activity which was depressed last year as a result of the unfolding pandemic our ability to attract switchers remained flat year over year due to aggressive industrywide promotional activity on handsets we saw connected device gross additions decline by 4 000 year over year this was driven by lower gross additions of internet products such as hotspots and tablets compared to the prior year when we experienced an increase in demand due to covid 19 the declines in hotspot and tablet sales were partially offset by an increase in connected watch gross additions total smartphone connections increased by 15 000 during the quarter and by 60 000 over the course of the past 12 months that helps to drive more service revenue given that smartphone arpu is about 20 higher than feature phone arpu additionally i want to call out our strong prepaid results which were driven by changes to our prepaid offerings our prepaid base increased 11 000 due to an increase in gross additions combined with a decrease in defections next i want to comment on the postpaid churn rate shown on slide nine postpaid handset churn depicted by the blue bars was 0 88 up from 0 71 a year ago this was driven by voluntary churn which continues to run at higher year over year as a result of increased switching activity and aggressive industrywide competition total postpaid churn combining handsets and connected devices was 1 11 for the second quarter of 2021 higher than a year ago as we have also seen churn increase on connected devices due to certain business and government customers disconnecting devices that were activated during the peak periods of the pandemic in 2020 now lets turn to the financial results on slide 10 total operating revenues for the second quarter were 1 014 billion an increase of 41 million or 4 year over year retail service revenues increased by 28 million to 686 million the increase was primarily due to a higher average revenue per user which i will discuss in a moment as well as an increase in average postpaid subscribers inbound roaming revenue was 28 million that was a decrease of 13 million year over year driven by a decrease in data volume and rates one of the factors contributing to this data volume decrease is the merger of sprint and t mobile and the migration of sprint roaming traffic to t mobiles network other service revenues were 60 million an increase of 6 million year over year including a 6 increase in tower rental revenues finally equipment sales revenues increased by 20 million year over year due to an increase in units sold and an increase in accessories sales as a result of higher volume partially offset by a decrease in the average revenue per unit in large part as a result of an increase in promotional activity we engaged in aggressive promotional activity during the second quarter of 2021 to remain competitive with the industry particularly for switchers a portion of the resulting promotional costs reduced equipment sales revenues and increased loss on equipment which represents equipment sales revenues less cost of equipment sold in addition loss on equipment in the second quarter of 2020 was mitigated by the impacts of the pandemic specifically lower gross adds and less aggressive promotional activity as a result of the combined impact of these factors loss on equipment increased 20 million year over year from a positive margin of 2 million in 2020 to a loss on equipment of 18 million in 2021 this change in loss on equipment was the primary driver of our decline in profitability year over year we expect the aggressive promotional environment to persist for the remainder of 2021 and our full year guidance reflects the corresponding financial impact now a few more comments about postpaid revenue shown on slide 11 average revenue per user or connection was 47 74 for the second quarter up 1 50 or approximately 3 year over year on a per account basis average revenue grew by 4 55 or 4 year over year the increases were driven primarily by favorable plan and product offering mix an increase in regulatory recovery revenues an increase in device protection revenues and an increase in overage and which were waived in the prior year to assist customers during the covid 19 pandemic turning to slide 12 as we continue our multiyear network modernization and 5g rollout control of our towers remains critical by owning our towers we ensure we maintain the operational flexibility to add new equipment and make other changes to our cell sites without incurring additional costs which is very important particularly given our current technology evolution as you can see on this slide with the assistance of our third party marketing agreement we have seen steady growth in tower rental revenues as i mentioned second quarter tower rental revenues increased by 6 year over year we will continue to focus on growing revenues from these strategic assets moving to slide 13 i want to comment on adjusted operating income before depreciation amortization and accretion and gains and losses to keep things simple ill refer to this measure as adjusted operating income as shown at the bottom of the slide adjusted operating income was 218 million a decrease of 7 year over year as i commented earlier total operating revenues were 1 014 billion a 4 increase year over year total cash expenses were 796 million increasing 58 million or 8 year over year total system operations expense increased 4 year over year excluding roaming expense system operations expense increased by 7 due to higher circuit costs and sell side rent and maintenance expense roaming expense decreased 3 million or 7 year over year resulting from lower voice roaming while higher day usage was largely offset by lower rates cost of equipment sold increased 40 million or 19 year over year due to an increase in units sold and an increase in accessory sales as a result of higher volume selling general and administrative expenses increased 11 million or 3 year over year driven primarily by costs associated with supporting enterprise projects billing system upgrades and federal universal service fund expense which is fully offset in service revenues turning to slide 14 ill touch on adjusted ebitda which starts with adjusted operating income and incorporates the earnings from our equity method investments along with interest and dividend income adjusted ebitda for the quarter was 267 million a decrease of 13 million or 5 year over year equity and earnings of unconsolidated entities increased by 3 million or 7 next i want to cover our guidance for the full year 2021 for comparison were showing our 2020 actual results for total service revenues our guidance range of 3 05 billion to 3 15 billion remains unchanged for adjusted operating income and adjusted ebitda we are maintaining our guidance ranges of 850 million to 950 million and 1 025 billion to 1 125 billion respectively as mentioned earlier this reflects our expectation of a continued highly competitive environment for the remainder of the year for capital expenditures we are also maintaining our guidance range of 775 million to 875 million and we have provided a breakdown by major category i will now turn the call over to vicki villacrez vicki vicki l villacrez chief financial officer senior vice president of finance okay thank you doug and good morning everyone i am pleased with our financial results for the second quarter and through the first half of the year and we are tracking to our guidance expectations we continue to see strong broadband growth that has accelerated since the start of the pandemic we grew residential broadband revenues 16 in total in the quarter driving total residential revenue growth of 10 overall we grew our top line 5 while planned investment spending on new market launches caused our adjusted ebitda to be lower than prior year also notable during the quarter was strong average residential revenue per connection growth of 7 on price increases and product mix as customers take higher speeds we continue to experience strong tailwinds which are driving increased broadband adoption for example work at home environment continue bipartisan support for broadband is driving more federal and state opportunities and population migration in our most attractive markets is driving strong household growth during the quarter we grew our total footprint 6 which increased strong organic household growth across our market turning to the slide 17 we remain committed to the strategic priorities we have been focused on for several years as previously discussed our primary objective is to generate growth by investing in our high speed broadband services we have a multifaceted approach in this growth that includes leveraging existing networks and constructing greenfield fiber in targeted locations we are very pleased that where weve invested in fiber in our incumbent market we have achieved superior market share and in our expansion markets we are seeing strong customer preregistration in addition we continue to drive faster speeds in our more rural incumbent markets by building to meet our a cam obligations and utilizing state broadband grants on slide 18 total residential connections increased 2 due to residential broadband growth in new and existing markets partially offset by a decrease in voice and video connections total telecom broadband residential connections grew 7 in the quarter as we continue to fortify our networks with fiber and expand into new markets we are on track in our network construction under the a cam program also helping to drive growth in our incumbent markets overall higher value product mix and price increases drove a 7 increase in average residential revenue per connection on slide 19 you can see the broadband connection growth across all markets our focus on broadband connection growth and fast reliable service has generated a 16 increase in total residential broadband revenue we are offering up to one gig broadband speeds to 56 of our total footprint including both our fiber and docsis 3 1 market the one gig product is an important tool that allows us to defend markets and to win customers in new markets in areas where we offer one gig service we are now seeing 21 of our new customers taking this superior product turning to slide 20 we have augmented our success growing broadband with our tds tv offering our next generation video platform enhances the customer viewing experience and ends up bundle the products help us to increase our broadband market share and reduce churn video residential video connections were nearly flat wireline growth of 6 driven by our expansion markets nearly offset losses in the cable market video continues to remain important to our customers for example we are experiencing a 40 video attachment rate to every broadband connection in our wireline markets where we offer iptv services and thats across half our wireline footprint nearly half our wireline footprint our strategy is to increase video connections through the offering of our cloud based tds tv product the rollout of this product currently covers 60 of our total operations including our cable markets moving to slide 21 we continue to be very bullish on our fiber strategy and how it will transform tds telecom in a very meaningful way over the next several years given the attractiveness of this opportunity and the heightened level of participation by other overbuilders our sense of urgency has increased we therefore are upsizing the number of expansion markets we expect to build over the next several years as well as increasing our fiber builds within our existing footprint for competitive reasons we are not specifically naming the markets or the number of service addresses yet and any additional spending this year is well within our guidance we plan to announce these additional markets after we sign construction agreements and launch our premarketing and sales efforts publicly fiber is the most economical long term solution to deliver the best broadband experience we continue to refine our market selection criteria and are highly confident in this process now lets turn to slide 22 which shows the progress we are making this year on our multiyear fiber footprint expansion which includes fiber into incumbent markets and also expansion into new markets as a result of this strategy 39 of our wireline service addresses are now served by fiber this is up from 33 a year ago this is driving revenue growth while also expanding the total wireline footprint 8 to 873 000 service addresses moving to slide 23 we have highlighted the total service addresses for the clusters that are in construction and we are actively marketing we recently announced our expansion of fiber into spokane valley washington adding 33 000 service addresses to our plans in the spokane cluster in total we completed 338 000 fiber service addresses through the second quarter and are working to build out the footprint in these announced markets to 657 000 service addresses by 2024 performance of our launched fiber markets continues to meet or exceed our business cases year to date we completed construction of 31 000 fiber addresses adding 18 000 service addresses in the quarter this progress is slower than planned and is putting pressure on service address delivery on the back half of the year the delays we are seeing in construction could impact our ability to deliver our goal of 150 000 service addresses by the end of the year but we are confident that well still complete a substantial portion of our plan we also continue to proactively manage construction and customer equipment inventory demands where we are seeing lengthening lead times with our suppliers we will continue to update you on our progress throughout the year on slide 24 total revenues increased 5 year over year to 252 million largely driven by the strong growth in residential revenue which increased 10 in total the chart includes residential revenue mix which highlights the increasing contribution of our expansion markets incumbent wireline markets also showed impressive residential growth of 7 due to increases in broadband connections as well as increases from within the broadband product mix partially offset by a 4 decrease in residential voice connections cable residential revenues grew 10 also due to increases in broadband connections as well as product mix commercial revenues which continue to be impacted by clec declines decreased 4 to 46 million in the quarter and wholesale revenues decreased 3 to 45 million due primarily to reductions in special access in the incumbent wireline market so let me sum up the combined financial results for the quarter as shown on slide 25 total revenues increased 5 from the prior year as growth from our fiber expansion and increases in broadband subscribers exceeded the declines we experienced in our legacy business cash expenses increased 10 due to both supporting our current growth as well as spending related to future expansion into new markets which is not yet reflected in our revenue future market costs include direct costs such as sales marketing real estate and technicians in addition to shared service costs necessary to support new market growth as a result adjusted ebitda decreased 7 to 78 million as expected capital expenditures increased 33 from last year to 99 million as planned we continue to increase our investment in fiber deployments and success based spending for new customer installs on slide 26 weve provided our 2021 guidance which is unchanged from the guidance we shared at the beginning of the year we expect expenses and capital expenditures to ramp up in the second half of the year as we continue to execute on our fiber expansion strategy and we expect to end the year within the guidance range i want to express my gratitude to all associates for their dedication to the success of tds telecom our positive quarterly results are a product of your hard work thank you and with that id like to forward i look forward to updating you in the third quarter and now ill turn the call back over to jane jane w mccahon senior vice president of corporate relations corporate secretary thanks vicki operator were ready for questions at this point questions and answers operator your first question comes from the line of ric prentiss from raymond james your line is now open ric prentiss raymond james analyst thanks good morning everyone vicki l villacrez chief financial officer senior vice president of finance morning rick ric prentiss raymond james analyst i want to start on the wireless side lt its been a year as you point out since youve been there one of the things you mentioned early on was your thought that partnerships could help u s cellulars kind of service revenue growth and return on capital objectives update us a little bit on what kind of partnerships youre seeing out there that might make sense and if you could maybe also opine on what are the pros and cons as you look at the at t and dish deal that was announced recently laurent c therivel president chief executive officer director thanks ric let me start with partnerships i think of partnership in two ways partnerships to grow revenue and partnerships to manage costs and manage capital more efficiently on the revenue side we moved forward with a number of partnerships the way to think about these just its kind of across the business is a lot of these are small so just as an example right weve substantively moved our path forward on new stores over to our local dealers our retail organization has signed on a number of new dealer partners and were co investing with them so we can grow our footprint share the cost share the benefit on the business side we signed a number of partnerships to bring new solutions to bear i guess one example we announced just yesterday around geotab geotab is a fleet management service i believe its one of the best fleet solutions in the business were excited to partner with them gives us another product to sell to our business customers and obviously growth and revenue growth and margin on the infrastructure side on the cost side those partnerships take time we are in a variety of different discussions ill just point briefly at the dish mla that we signed which i think is a pretty good example of a partnership right we have we took our weve taken our tower business i talked about this in previous calls and so i wont get in too much detail unless theres interest but weve really pivoted our tower business to serve potential colocation customers one of those is dish we signed an mla with them i cant get into the details on that but were bullish about how that is going to help us both drive revenue but more importantly drive better utilization of our assets so i feel good about the path that weve been on with those partnerships i think theres more to come we continue to look for good ways to share investment share revenue growth share margin expansion i think we have a lot of opportunity to do so let me pivot to the at t dish deal you asked about that theres been a lot written about that deal i think my take on it is twofold the first dish has announced theyre going to build a national network theyve got relatively aggressive build out targets that they have to hit and so its pretty logical for them to try to find a partner in order to supplement that build out and to provide them coverage for their subs and so from a dish perspective its entirely logical to do it from an at t perspective obviously i dont know the details of the deal but if im in at ts shoes i would say okay if its not me its going to be someone else so it makes sense for at t to do it i think both sides create opportunity for us right we have coverage where at t does not that provides us an opportunity to work with dish and on the flip side if dish builds out their network i think theyre going to have capacity that we can take advantage of to bring our cost to bring our capital build out down and so i think its a logical deal and i think it creates opportunities on both sides for u s cellular ric prentiss raymond james analyst makes sense also you touched on a couple of times fixed wireless access it seems like youre trialing it now when do you move and you talked about the technical side and the market demand side when do you think you could move from trialing to actually launching and what sort of addressable market is there out there and why would somebody choose u s cellular laurent c therivel president chief executive officer director so we havent announced a launch date from a broader productization perspective but certainly if the trials go as were seeing them go so far i expect this to be a product that we have in the market certainly by next year generating some meaningful opportunity for us your question of where is the market opportunity is exactly the thing that were trialing because theres a bull case and a bear case to this the bear case is substantive fiber expansion so moving from what is currently at best fiber inside of municipalities and that starts to move out coupled with satellite moves from being a truly ultra rural solution and a promise which is what it is now to a meaningful product that delivers meaningful speeds and meaningful capacities to consumers right in that world the opportunity for fixed wireless is i still think its meaningful but its not as large theres an alternate path forward which is fiber does not expand broadly from municipalities satellite remains what it is today ultra rural and a promise of future speeds and future capacities and that creates a lot of opportunity for us and what ill tell you is that the initial market trials are indicating that i cant get into details but the take rates that weve had just on our pilot programs are higher than i expected what that tells me is that customers are eager for an alternative to cable and are eager for an alternative to the other solutions that are out there from a rural perspective and so i think that wireless broadly can provide a really compelling alternative for home connectivity in not just rural areas but call it suburban areas and then why should they pick u s cellular as an alternative for that well id argue that our technical trials and where were setting world records in terms of the speed that we have i dont think theres anyone better than we are in terms of providing connectivity to rural america and so i think well be in the drivers seat when it comes to offering that solution to our customers once were finished with the technical trials which have more to do with productization by the way so for example how to think about taking an external antenna on a home getting the signal inside the home getting it propagated and so on then does the technology work the technology works the trials have proven that out so im optimistic about it timing tbd but current course and speed i certainly think it will be in the market in a compelling way at least starting next year ric prentiss raymond james analyst thanks guys very well operator your next question comes from the line of simon flannery from morgan stanley your line is now open simon flannery morgan stanley analyst great thank you very much lt you were talking about the roaming and the impact of the sprint merger i think that moved 80 of the traffic onto the t mobile network is it fair to think that were kind of troughing here and that you can grow that business as we go forward and perhaps the opportunity with dish as well any color on where roaming goes from here would be great and then on the l a partnerships or any other wireless investments any color on the outlook for distributions over the next couple of years does have you got better communications on what to expect given the c band auctions and the spending there laurent c therivel president chief executive officer director yes thanks simon good morning so on the roaming with the sprint merger yes youve seen our inbound roaming revenues decline large part of that is that reason with t mobile migrating legacy sprint traffic over to their network know that sprint represents right now about 15 of our roaming and non roaming revenue so theres not a lot more of that to lose with them that will be going away over time and we do project declining roaming revenue for the remainder of 2021 and going forward that said there are opportunities out there and you mentioned one thats front and center in dish and thats something that well be exploring for sure but thats the trajectory of roaming revenues moving on to the l a partnership and distributions our distribution in the first half of the u s was about 70 of what it was last year and that was primarily due to operational reasons within the partnership and our expectation for future distributions in the second half we expect the distribution that is close to what we received in 2020 and going forward we have no visibility beyond that i think we expect the current trend to continue we have no knowledge of any unique arrangements with respect to spectrum or other assets that could change that that said were a 5 5 partner in that partnership and we dont control that distribution so if verizon decides to changed the path of that distribution then well have to live with that but right now no significant changes that we are aware of simon flannery morgan stanley analyst okay thank you and on the roaming what are we seeing on the volume side just with covid reopening and so forth there are is that sort of back to normal levels or is there still some benefit as people business travel returns or whatever laurent c therivel president chief executive officer director well with yes theres two sides to that inbound roaming our volumes are going down and thats associated with what i just talked about and some other carriers reducing their volumes such as 3g traffic and other traffic on the outbound side its a totally different story our usage on the outbound side increased 100 q2 over q2 year over year and by the way while that occurred our expense went down 7 because weve negotiated very favorable rates on those outbound roaming agreements so were managing that aspect of it quite well and yes theyre going in different directions simon flannery morgan stanley analyst all right thank you operator your next question comes from the line of phil cusick from jpmorgan your line is now open amir razban jpmorgan analyst hi this is amir razban for phil cusick thank you for your time just one for me is usm registered for any upcoming auction laurent c therivel president chief executive officer director so we filed an application for the upcoming dod auction thats the answer amir razban jpmorgan analyst thank you operator your next question comes from the line of sergey dluzhevskiy from gamco investors your line is now open sergey dluzhevskiy gamco investors analyst good morning guys vicki l villacrez chief financial officer senior vice president of finance good morning sergey sergey dluzhevskiy gamco investors analyst thanks for taking the questions its so my first question is for lt so lt you mentioned in your prepared remarks business and government segment a little bit but could you kind of expand on the opportunities that you see in that market obviously increasing penetration there is one of your priorities what is the size of the business and government market in your service territories what is your share now and where would you like to be in a few years i guess what would you consider a success kind of on a three year horizon laurent c therivel president chief executive officer director sure sergey so from a business and government perspective right we dont disclose the segment independently but get back of the envelope you can think of our share as being approximately half of our postpaid consumer share and so theres a lot of opportunity the were getting a bit more granular on where that opportunity lies i would point at a few places the first is just simple blocking and tackling on the small business customers that walk into our stores were making growing small business a priority for our stores and were starting to see some benefits there were also seeing that in terms of adding products to the mix for our stores so for example the geotab partnership that provides fleet management services fleet management is the bread and butter of small business sales from going through retail because you have folks that want lawn services you have folks that have seven trucks eight trucks and thats difficult to cover with a large enterprise sales force it is perfect for our stores and we started to put some of those measures in place more broadly however were putting a concerted effort behind building distribution in the business and government space and so i mentioned kim kerr joined our team last year shes been expanding her channels expanding her distribution and were starting to see some benefits there and so were starting to see some larger iot deals were seeing some larger private networking deals so this is a situation where i think we have a fantastic asset which is an industry leading network in the markets in which we operate and we havent put strong business distribution behind that in the past and we expect to now and so it didnt require like development of a lot of brand new capabilities we dont have to spend a ton of capital in order to support this channel this is about building distribution and getting share similar at the very least to where our postpaid consumer share is and that creates meaningful growth so hopefully that addresses what youre looking sergey dluzhevskiy gamco investors analyst yes great thank you maybe one question on the competitive front so t mobile obviously has been highlighting suburban and rural markets as a growth opportunity for them theyre trying to double their market share over the next four to five years what have you guys seen from t mobile when you compare it to front in the second quarter in your markets and how do you plan to mitigate some of the impact that you may see from or maybe already are seeing from their network builds distribution expansion and in general the marketing question laurent c therivel president chief executive officer director sergey so ill address your t mo question i think theres two fundamental things that are happening on the competitive front right the first is weve seen much more aggressive upgrade offers across the industry at t started this up about by now almost 12 months ago and verizon has been on and off in matching them i think question one is how do we think about those upgrade offers and is that a logical thing for the industry to be doing and what the way im thinking about this right now is that in the near term so for a short period of time its actually relatively logical for the industry to be as aggressive as weve been if you think about customers that are out of contracts right those are up about 15 since for the industry since covid same thing with average holding period of devices up 15 and so youve got a lot of people that are out of contract theyve had their devices for much longer if i couple that with the fact that 5g availability the currency of choice right now for people making switching decisions pretty logical for carriers to be working hard to get 5g devices in the hands of consumers given the better network experience bring churn down and so im not surprised that were seeing more aggressive offers and youre seeing them from us too right we have taken this regional approach but in certain regions some of the most aggressive offers in the marketplace the benefit that were seeing there is arpu and arpu expansion and i think thats been underestimated in the way that people are thinking about the financial impact for the industry so just to put a little bit of numbers behind it we have and for our higher rate price plans we generally have been about in the mid 20 percentile of the customers that select those higher rate price plans thats up to the mid 40s and so theres arpu expansion and that arpu expansion is the gift that keeps on giving and that creates attractive long term economics once we get through what i believe is relatively near term promotional aggressiveness and then we talked about this in our guidance we have weve maintained the guidance even though theres been a really aggressive promotional environment now the second thing as you mentioned is t mo right and so t mo has made a lot of noise about their expansion into rural areas so we have not seen it we track market share market shares remain generally constant for t mobile we track the components of market share win share and loss share i havent seen those move either sergey the way i think about this is what we do is hard putting in networks monetizing networks its difficult different people have said oh we can do that too i think of google fi as a good example and its much harder than people think and its even harder in rural america than it is in urban and im not taking t mobile lightly theyre a well run company theyre a formidable competitor but so far what were seeing is more marketing than it actually is network deployment and customer action sergey dluzhevskiy gamco investors analyst got it great maybe couple of questions for vicki so on the fiber build front i guess looking at your most mature markets as well as some of the new builds that youre doing in idaho and washington what are some of the lessons learned what are some of the learnings that might be impacting how you guys are approaching future builds and how youre tweaking some of your plans i guess what worked for you guys so far and what didnt work and you adjusted vicki l villacrez chief financial officer senior vice president of finance thank you sergey and good morning thank you for the questions the success that we are seeing in our new fiber markets really continues to meet or exceed our expectations these are the ones where we have the construction completed and we are watching our results and this is whats really increasing our sense of urgency to accelerate our programs right now let me just share with you some of the successes were seeing with our new out of territory markets for example nearly half of our broadband connection growth in the quarter was due to our out of territory market reporting twice the number of connections as compared to last year and our broadband penetration rates although vary across our markets due to the different timing in the market launching theyre averaging about 32 as of the end of the second quarter and this is still early for many of our completed markets i also wanted to note that voice and video connections are also growing across our expansion markets with video attachment rate at 41 and contribution margins as im watching the financials on these markets although early are north of 50 in the market that has completed construction more than 12 months ago so thats some of the successes were having in terms of the construction period we are having some delays and there are some lessons learned there the pace of construction and the challenges we encounter are very different across each of our markets sometimes its permitting challenges sometimes were hitting rocks as were doing largely varied builds but were getting smarter and so are the cities that want this these are huge significant projects that is really about the future economic prosperity of these communities so city leaders that are keeping the end game in focus are working with us more and more to ensure success during the construction period i think thats a real key learning for both us our contractors and our city leaders as we continue to work forward sergey dluzhevskiy gamco investors analyst great and my last question is about video so you mentioned that 41 attachment rate i guess its obviously an important element of your strategy but some of your peers deemphasized tv offerings and basically direct consumers to streaming and virtual mvpd options like youtube tv so what are the reasons why your video strategy makes sense for you in your markets what is different in your markets that maybe some of your peers are not seeing vicki l villacrez chief financial officer senior vice president of finance yes well the video attachment rate of 40 on average across our wireline market is our customers telling us how important video is to the overall service offering for 40 video attachment to every single broadband connection thats a really strong rate and our video product is profitable and its a state of the art platform that bundled with broadband really offers a superior experience for our customers and as you know in our markets we have markets that really have a high percentage of single family homes and single family homes buy these entertainment packages and they buy up the stack higher speeds and higher video programming and whats really important from an economic perspective is that as you look as you know bundling is an important part of our strategy and so as i look at the economics the customer lifetime value of a customer who take not only data but also take video with data so they have a bundled product the value increases significantly as we watch as we see lower churn on these products so very important to our overall strategy sergey dluzhevskiy gamco investors analyst great makes sense thank you operator speakers im seeing no further questions in the

washington d c as raw material shortages continued despite signs of some easing in supply chain constraints u s manufacturing activity grew at a slower pace in july for the second straight month a survey from the institute for supply management ism on monday showed a measure of prices paid by manufacturers fell by the most in 16 months while the supplier deliveries index retreated further from a 47 year high in may timothy fiore chair of ism s manufacturing business survey committee noted that supply and demand dynamics appear to be moving closer to equilibrium for the first time in many months as quoted by reuters part of that could be because spending is rotating back to services from goods the ism s index of national factory activity fell to 59 5 last month the lowest reading since january from 60 6 in june a reading above 50 indicates expansion in manufacturing which accounts for 11 9 percent of the u s economy demand shifted to goods from services during the covid 19 pandemic as millions of americans were forced to stay indoors straining the supply chain now with roughly half of the population being fully vaccinated against the coronavirus allowing people to travel frequent restaurants and more government data last week reported that spending on services accelerated sharply in the second quarter helping to lift the level of gross domestic product above its peak in the fourth quarter of 2019 still the ism survey points out that the supply chain was still a long way from normalizing in the computer and electronics industry manufacturers reported that purchases continue to have long lead times due to shortages of raw materials while the scarcity of inputs in the automobile industry is well known additionally the ism survey s forward looking new orders sub index fell for a second straight month businesses depleted inventories rapidly in the second quarter stocks at retailers are well below normal levels economists at goldman sachs expect retail and auto inventories will return to normal levels in mid 2022 a measure of factory employment rebounded in july after contracting modestly in june for the first time since november though manufacturers continued to complain about the scarcity of workers the labor shortage is expected to ease in the fall when schools reopen for in person learning but a resurgence in new covid 19 cases driven by the delta variant of the coronavirus could make some people reluctant to return to the labor force
hancock county mt vernon schools officials tabled a proposed update to its health and safety protocols and will contemplate other parts of the existing plan after receiving feedback from parents and a physician the debate comes as the school district records three covid 19 cases and 72 close contacts exposed to those individuals since the start of the school year just over a week ago first adopted in may and modified in july mt vernon s system already relies on the absentee rate due to combined illness of students and staff in an individual building to trigger certain requirements those include additional sanitizing procedures masking and in the event of widespread absences consulting with the hancock county health department about possibly closing a school mt vernon s school board held a special meeting friday afternoon and evening to consider adding numbers of covid positive individuals per building as triggers for those requirements as well the plan also already addresses procedures for reporting covid 19 cases investigation and contact tracing as well as isolation for those who test positive for covid 19 and quarantining of close contacts all of which stem from indiana department of health measures referred to in a state executive order those measures include avoiding quarantines for close contacts who are fully vaccinated and shorter quarantines for close contacts who test negative if they mask and socially distance for the remainder of what would have been a full quarantine indiana s back to school guidance also recently added that while fully vaccinated close contacts don t necessarily have to quarantine they should wear a mask until a negative test result is received of mt vernon s 72 close contacts 15 do not have to quarantine at home due to being fully vaccinated a close contact is defined as anyone within 6 feet of someone infected with covid 19 for a total of at least 15 minutes within a 24 hour period a federal mandate requires masks on school buses mt vernon encourages wearing masks in buildings and requires them in buildings in the orange and red tiers the most severe of the district s color system orange represents an absentee rate of 16 due to combined illness of students and staff in an individual building while red represents 20 nine people spoke critically of the district s health and safety protocols at the meeting most of whom are mt vernon parents their concerns included a lack of educational opportunities for quarantined students frustration toward the ever changing recommendations from the centers for disease control and prevention impacts to students mental and emotional health and effects on personal freedoms they expressed discouragement over how political covid 19 measures have become pointed to low mortality and few instances of severe illness among children from the novel coronavirus and questioned how mt vernon would enforce the measures one parent recounted receiving a call from her child who was quarantined in school for nearly two hours earlier this week and how she didn t hear from the school until after she had already picked up the child jack parker mt vernon superintendent restated an apology he gave the parent after the incident i was very unhappy that your child had to wait and i fully believe that was a big mistake that we won t make again and i m sorry about that parker said that was certainly very disappointing another parent traci dayhoff of mccordsville said the school system needs a virtual learning plan for students at home in quarantine as a parent if i choose not to send my kids to school for 10 days you can turn me into for neglect she told the school board but we re allowing our school system to neglect our children s education for god knows how many days and call it excused in the name of covid to me there s no excuse for that there needs to be some sort of better plan haile loring a mt vernon parent from fortville shared a similar concern this is a publicly funded school she said we pay for academics school officials agree and hope to have a plan for students unable to participate in in person learning by aug 20 we have some things to do better specifically regarding and supporting students who are not able to come to school in person parker said and we ve already started doing some significant conversations with our building administrators teachers association and that takes just a few more days but we certainly know that we need to do a better job in supporting students who are not able to be in person learning dr dan stock a mccordsville resident and family medicine physician said the measures mt vernon has implemented and is considering adding are not useful he added indiana department of health and cdc recommendations are contrary to the rules of science coronavirus and other respiratory virus particles are small enough to go through masks stock continued adding vaccines will not be effective against covid 19 he noted the virus is on the rise in the middle of summer a time when respiratory viral syndromes are typically at their lowest stock also pointed to the covid 19 outbreak last month in provincetown massachusetts the majority of which included vaccinated individuals vaccines don t prevent infection just symptoms stock said so you cannot stop spread you cannot make these numbers that you ve planned on get better by doing any of the things that you re doing he said because that is the nature of viral respiratory pathogens and you can t prevent it with a vaccine because they don t do the very thing you re wanting them to do and you will be chasing this through the remainder of your life until you recognize the centers for disease control and the indiana state board of health are giving you very bad scientific guidance meeting attendees also questioned whether the school corporation is legally required to have close contacts quarantine at home parker said the corporation s legal counsel advised that reporting positive cases conducting contact tracing investigations and requiring un vaccinated close contacts to quarantine is legally required and that it s a class b misdemeanor for each day of noncompliance parker also noted the school corporation has received 20 emails on the health and safety plan seven of which ask for more restrictive protocols mt vernon recorded just over 300 covid 19 cases among students and staff throughout the 2020 2021 school year with 1 775 close contacts the district s highest monthly totals per school ranged from five cases to 29 under the proposed additions to the health and safety plan nine students staff members not sharing a household who are covid positive in an elementary school and 15 in a secondary school would put the building in the orange tier requiring masks to be worn inside parker said based on last year s data such a situation wouldn t be likely unless under extreme circumstances to trigger mask wearing in the orange tier we believe that unless our numbers of covid positive cases increase considerably from last year or they are all concentrated in a few short weeks we re not likely to get to the orange tier due to that reason he said in light of the comments and literature stock provided board members expressed a desire to hold off on considering adding covid positive totals as triggers to the tiered color system and explore whether quarantining could be mitigated or avoided board member shannon walls moved to table the matter for further discussion at the school board s next meeting which is scheduled for 7 p m monday aug 16 in the school corporation s administration building located at 1806 w state road 234 fortville i believe we have an obligation to one find the facts that were shared today walls said we have not had a chance to review that information ourselves as a board i think we have an obligation to our students to know what our academic plan is moving forward the board approved the motion 4 0 with walls chad gray kellie freeman and tony may voting in favor phil edwards was not present the decision only tabled the proposed addition of covid positive totals per school building to the health and safety plan the rest of the plan remains in place including quarantining measures

editor s note a version of this story appeared in cnn s meanwhile in china newsletter a three times a week update exploring what you need to know about the country s rise and how it impacts the world sign up here hong kong cnn among the recriminations and accusations there was one point of consensus when american and chinese diplomats met in the coastal city of tianjin earlier this week no one wants to see the world s most important relationship deteriorate into armed conflict but there was little consensus on a concrete way to avoid that catastrophe and that has experts worried washington and beijing have been trapped in a spiral of anger and suspicion for several years but the situation has deteriorated rapidly since the beginning of the covid 19 pandemic amid finger pointing over the origins of the virus meetings between the two sides are few and far between and when they occur such as in alaska in march they are bitter and confrontational the us is without an ambassador in beijing there have been no moves to reopen the recently shuttered united states consulate in chengdu or the chinese consulate in houston and the appointment of a new chinese ambassador to washington while a positive step is unlikely to deescalate tensions in the short term there s certainly no small amount of antagonism between the two sides at present experts point to rising brinksmanship over taiwan and the expanding standoff in the south china sea as possible military flashpoints with unpredictable consequences for both sides speaking in tianjin both sides said despite the current state of relations they wanted to avoid direct confrontation us deputy secretary of state wendy sherman underscored that while washington welcomed stiff competition it did not seek conflict with beijing meanwhile china s foreign minister xie feng told sherman the chinese people cherish peace yet willy lam an adjunct professor at the chinese university of hong kong said neither side had actually put anything in place to stop conflict from happening no further talks are planned publicly and expectations of a possible meeting between us president joe biden and chinese leader xi jinping at the g20 in october weren t raised so there is room for further deterioration but there are no signs of possible improvement even in areas where they have common interests said lam at a speech in singapore on tuesday night us secretary of defense lloyd austin said while the us didn t want conflict with china beijing was showing an unwillingness to resolve disputes peacefully and respect the rule of law in the south china sea the taiwan strait and in the western region of xinjiang at the same time the united kingdom a close us ally has sent a carrier group to the south china sea including the queen elizabeth aircraft carrier and announced it would permanently deploy two warships to asian waters experts said the growing militarization of both the south china sea and air and sea around taiwan puts the us and china as well as their allied nations at risk of an accidental collision in a contested area or exchange of gunfire that spirals out of control both sides have been able to cool tensions in the past such as in 2001 when a us navy surveillance plane collided with a chinese fighter jet leading to a tense 11 day standoff over the surviving american pilot eventually he was released and tensions cooled but orville schell director of the asia society s center on us china relations said both sides might not be as keen to negotiate this time they re headed towards a train wreck here he said in particular schell described the taiwan strait as the chernobyl of international relations with the repeated military drills and flyovers by chinese aircraft a disaster waiting to happen this is where the globe is most stressed china and the us and taiwan are right there at the epicenter he said both the us and china have offered potential ways forward to avoid any further deterioration before sherman went to tianjin us officials said they wanted to emphasize the need for guard rails in the us china relationship washington has mooted the idea of creating an emergency hotline between washington and beijing similar to the red phone between the us and the soviet union during the cold war intended to allow for direct communication as a way to avoid major conflicts including nuclear war but there isn t any public indication at this stage whether beijing would sign up for such a plan instead the chinese government presented a list of demands to the us side during the meetings with sherman which included lifting sanctions on chinese entities stopping restrictions on student visas and withdrawing its extradition request for huawei executive meng wanzhou schell said any talks between the two sides were better than none and this one could be the beginnings of a guard rail but he said the current and former us military officials he spoke to were extremely worried about the risk of conflict if better communication wasn t established there s no mechanism to deal with these there s no red phone there s no leading groups there s no protocol there s nothing he said japanese

gold in the men s all around gymnastics final edging out china s xiao ruoteng by 0 4 points at just 19 years old hashimoto is the world s youngest gymnast to ever claim that medal as japan celebrated his victory some in china questioned the fairness of the result and accused the judges of favoritism toward host japan by inflating hashimoto s score on the vault the anger first set off on chinese

account inundating his feed with angry comments and tagging him in insulting posts many called him japan s national humiliation others accused him of stealing china s gold medal some even tagged him in photos of the atomic bombings of hiroshima and nagasaki hashimoto later changed his privacy settings on instagram banning himself from being tagged but angry comments have kept pouring under his posts following the controversy the international gymnastics federation fig issued a statement thursday explaining hashimoto s vault score including a detailed list of the imperfections the fig can assess that the 14 7 score obtained by hashimoto on this apparatus is correct in regards to the code of points and so is the final ranking the statement concluded the nationalist rage against hashimoto followed attacks on mima ito and jun mizutani the japanese table tennis duo who narrowly defeated the chinese team to win the first ever gold medal in mixed doubles monday the attacks are an extreme expression of the rising tide of ultra nationalism sweeping through chinese social media in recent years which has silenced many liberal and moderate voices some chinese netizens have tried to

ceo and chief financial officer doug douglas devine chief financial officer thanks leigh good afternoon and thank you all for joining us during our prepared remarks today i ll start with a quick review of second quarter highlights and then update you on progress we are making on our key operating priorities dan wilson evp of strategy and corporate development will cover reimbursement and then i would like to welcome mark day our evp of r d to the call to share some of our current zio platform advancements and initiatives after that i ll close with a more detailed review of q2 results and our outlook for the remainder of the year we ll then open up the call for your questions starting with q2 highlights our results reflect a continued demand for our zio platform as well as solid execution on our operating goals by the entire irhythm team who are working tirelessly to meet the needs of our physicians and patients during the second quarter revenue was 81 3 million representing a year on year increase in revenue of 59 8 and sequential growth of 9 4 over the first quarter zio at had a record quarter reaching approximately 10 of overall company revenue for the first time registrations for our zio service has exceeded our capacity particularly during the march april and may timeframe which resulted in processing times extending by approximately a week this led to a higher than usual number of units awaiting clinical processing at quarter end which limited reported revenue growth in q2 21 and increased some of our costs we expect to be back to normal turnaround time by the end of the third quarter we also made continued progress in identifying and planning for cost efficiencies that will be implemented in the medium term these were outlined in our last call and i ll cover them more a little later we ended the second quarter with 255 7 million in cash and short term investments which highlights the financial strength of the company investing for long term growth remains top of mind and importantly we have the financial resources to do so lastly we had two new 510k clearances during the quarter for our next generation hardware platform and our fourth generation deep learned ai algorithm one for a new and improved design of our zio monitor and the second for updating artificial intelligence capabilities both are key building blocks for our scalability and operational efficiencies the new zio monitor is designed to significantly improve patient s comfort while the advancements to our ai capabilities are expected to further improve rhythm and diagnostic accuracy notably our new ai algorithm release is already delivering benefits including contributing to improvements in our unit processing times and our ability to return to more normalized report turnaround times by the end of q3 we are pleased with these highlights and also encouraged by the progress we re making on focus areas we discussed last quarter as a reminder these include driving continued demand for our zio service leveraging our platform to expand both our market share and our addressable market making adjustments to our business model that we believe will provide operating efficiencies that will deliver sustainable profitability and growth and pursuing multiple paths toward reimbursement that are more in line with the benefits and underlying value of our technology during the second quarter we continue to see opportunity in the united kingdom which again outpaced overall company growth as you may recall last september irhythm was the recipient of nhs funding as the winner of its artificial intelligence in health and care award that award was recently disclosed to be gbp4 8 million or approximately 6 8 million and has enabled us to commence trials of our zio service in selected sites across the uk combined with the nice recommendation last december we have seen very strong revenue growth in the first half of this year as we brought new grant sites online as we move into the execution phase and bring fewer new sites online we expect revenue growth in the uk to be more measured for the remainder of 2021 further we are in the process of building out our operational infrastructure within the uk that can support this future growth and take our learnings and successes from the uk to serve as a playbook to other countries in the future we are also making progress on our new manufacturing facility which will house all of our production capability starting in 2022 and enable increased scalability and enhanced operating efficiencies in the medium term and on product development and innovation as we ve highlighted in the past irhythm has long established its ongoing commitment to improving the patient and provider experience demonstrated by our significant investments in next generation capabilities across our diagnostic platform the two new 510k clearances we announced during the quarter are great examples of this work overall we re very pleased with the financial and operating results in the second quarter and remain focused on continuing to make progress on our priorities over the remainder of 2021 including with regard to our priorities on reimbursement which dan will discuss dan daniel wilson executive vice president strategy corporate development investor relations thank you doug as part of the reimbursement discussion i ll cover where we were at with our efforts to establish national pricing with cms discuss our continued engagement with the mac to establish more appropriate medicare pricing provide an update on commercial pricing and then close with a summary of how we are collectively approaching reimbursement starting with cms national pricing as we shared in the press release last month cms published the calendar year 2022 medicare physician fee schedule proposed rule in mid july in the proposed rule cms did not propose national rates for long term ecg monitoring cpt codes instead cms proposed to continue with contractor pricing for calendar year 2022 the proposed rule is followed by an open comment period before cms issues the final rule in the november december timeframe in the proposed rule cms noted that they continue to seek public comment and information to support future rulemaking to establish a uniform national payment for these codes by further understanding the practice expenses incurred in providing these services during the open comment period irhythm intends to provide comments and we ll continue to work with cms in support of its efforts to establish national pricing that fairly represents the costs incurred to provide these services the unique benefits they provide and in consideration of continued access to these services for medicare beneficiaries on a related note cms commented separately in the proposed rule that more and more services under the medicare physician fee schedule include innovative technologies such as software algorithms and artificial intelligence and recognition that the current pricing methodology employed by cms does not account for these technologies we are encouraged that cms is recognizing the difficulty in pricing vertically integrated ai based business models like our own within existing pricing methodologies we will use the open comment period and other channels to provide our perspectives and suggested paths forward irhythm has also joined other industry stakeholders and societies representing ai solutions that aim to support healthcare delivery by providing input on possible solutions in summary we will be using the open comment period between now and mid september to provide comments to cms proposed rule and or joining other industry stakeholders to continue support of potential national pricing for calendar year 2022 however we believe the more likely outcome is that we will remain with carrier pricing in 2022 while continuing to pursue national pricing in the following year cycle for calendar year 2023 now turning to our ongoing discussions with novitas and the other regional macs since our last earnings call in may we met with several other macs to garner their support for evaluating an alternative pricing model we understand that the macs are communicating and will likely work together to evaluate the pricing of the long term ecg codes we remain encouraged by the willingness of novitas and the other macs to explore this alternative pricing model which we believe is a better representation of the true cost of delivering the service we along with other industry participants will be submitting cost data under this alternative pricing model to an independent third party who will validate the data and submit to the macs we currently anticipate the alternative model information will be submitted to the macs in the september or october timeframe we cannot provide any assurances that novitas or other macs will update pricing based on this information nor of the timing of any potential actions as an update on our commercial payer discussions nearly all of our commercial payers have recontracted our zio xt service since the establishment of the category 1 codes on january 1 2021 with most cross walking to pre existing rates overall commercial pricing in the second quarter of 2021 was consistent with commercial pricing in the first quarter of 2021 and was down low single digits on a percentage basis when compared to 2020 pricing we currently do not expect commercial pricing to change materially in the second half of 2021 as we look to 2022 we believe that our commercial payers have more flexibility in pricing of services and will consider the overall clinical and economic value of zio xt thus we are focused on providing the evidence that demonstrates zio xt s high diagnostic yield the efficiencies the service brings to their patient populations and the improved clinical and economic outcomes we have a strong health economics and outcomes resource team that is focused on producing these data and our recent partnership with the national association of managed care physicians will add to the robust data that we continually share with commercial payers as mentioned previously however we do believe that if we are unsuccessful in improving medicare rates before calendar year 2022 it is prudent to expect that some of our commercial rates may begin to be negatively impacted next year to close on reimbursement we have multiple avenues available to potentially achieve higher medicare reimbursement and we are actively pursuing all of them we believe we have the right strategies in place to achieve this but recognize that it may take some time we are confident in the value of our technology platform and the clinical and economic benefits that it delivers to patients physicians and to the healthcare system and we are hopeful that the value of the zio xt platform will ultimately be recognized under the existing medicare reimbursement system regardless we will continue to pursue other opportunities to monetize the value of our platform through new indications such as silent af new products such as zio at and the technology we are developing apparently geographic expansion as well as other alternative revenue models they will all incrementally reduce our exposure to medicare fee for service over time we look forward to sharing more details on each of these efforts as we make progress i ll now turn the call over to mark who will discuss those recent fda clearances how they further bolster our competitive positioning and why we are even more excited about the future of our zio service mark mark day executive vice president of r d thanks dan as doug noted in the second quarter we received fda clearance for two new technology platforms that represent irhythm s future the first clearance was for the zio monitor our third generation biosensor the second was for our next generation of deep learned algorithms together these clearances demonstrate our commitment to leading the category we first created over a decade ago and i d like to share more details about each i ll start by describing the zio monitor the first product clearance of this new hardware platform the zio monitor is a smaller thinner and lighter version of the current zio xt biosensor a device that more than 3 million patients have relied on to record a comprehensive view of their heart s electrical activity over two weeks while the zio xt device still provides industry leading performance the new zio monitor meaningfully improves on it in many important ways this new form factors nearly 60 later 25 smaller and 30 thinner and also includes a new breathable and waterproof outer layer all of which allows our customer adhesive to confidently and comfortably secure to all patients these refinements were designed with our patients in mind and with the understanding that more comfortable wear improves compliance which in turn leads to even more complete and accurate diagnostic data again this is a biosensor platform that will become the cornerstone of our service and we intend to pursue additional product clearances on this platform in future next i d like to describe the clearance we received for our second generation of deep learned ecg detection algorithms our fourth generation algorithm overall since 2018 irhythm has been a leader in using fda cleared deep learned algorithms for classifying and characterizing diverse heart rhythms with this latest clearance we re now using ai to detect beeps beep types and heart rates we ve also further enhanced the deep learned rhythm detection capability we previously introduced this new clearance amounts to a significant improvement in our ai based detection capabilities enabled by the greater than 750 million hours of curated heart beat data in our database likely the world s largest repository labeled ecg recordings our new deep learned algorithm was recently deployed and we re already seeing positive impact about diagnostic accuracy and scalability of our service we see this latest clearances further differentiating us in the market and a key step in developing new products and services fundamentally enabled by our ai expertise we look forward to sharing more about this in the future finally i ll quickly touch on the meaningful progress we ve been making in our partnership with verily as a reminder the context for this partnership is the understanding that silent atrial fibrillation is a key public health challenge particularly in the united states and that detecting this type of asymptomatic atrial fibrillation likely benefits from a long monitoring duration with that perspective we re working to build the first offering of a medical grade long term continuous and non invasive solution to detect and characterize atrial fibrillation the solution we re developing utilizes fairly steady launch platform in combination with our algorithm analytics clinical back end and workflow tools we re on track to submit to the fda clearance by the end of this year when we receive clearance we ll enter a market evaluation phase to establish the efficacy of the solution through clinical evidence and to explore the optimal business model associated with this potential paradigm shift in monitoring in many ways we expect this process to be similar to when we first brought the zio service to market a decade ago that is a thoughtful investment into clinical evidence that lays the foundation to change clinical practice we look forward to sharing updates as we progress along this journey in sum we still need clearances and our ongoing product development efforts represent our commitment to driving innovation to extend our leadership position in the ambulatory monitoring industry from our start we have been an innovation focused company and we continue to see many opportunities to improve and expand our technology platform while delivering important and valuable benefits to patients providers and the healthcare system now i ll turn it back to doug to cover our second quarter results in the second half outlook doug douglas devine chief financial officer thanks mark as i noted earlier total revenue in the second quarter was 81 3 million reflecting year over year growth of 59 8 and a sequential increase of 9 4 over the first quarter gross margins were 68 down 1 6 year on year and 0 4 quarter on quarter adjusted ebitda defined as ebitda less stock based compensation expense was negative 4 6 million an increase of 4 1 million year on year and 0 6 million quarter on quarter cash and short term investments were 255 7 million at quarter end down 6 6 million from q1 21 taking a more detailed look at the second quarter financial results revenue grew sequentially with quarter on quarter growth of 9 4 q2 21 revenue growth was a mix of volume growth improvements in collections performance for some contracted and non contracted payers and some favorable pricing adjustments for zio at approximately 4 5 million of q2 21 revenue was due to improved collections from prior period revenue and higher adjudicated reimbursement from certain payers and is not expected to reoccur in future periods zio xt in the us drove the majority of our volume growth in the second quarter while zio at in the us and zio xt in the u k outpaced overall company growth on a percentage basis zio at volumes grew significantly quarter over quarter crossing 10 of revenue for the first time we saw strong zio at performance continued into july and anticipate it will be a growth driver for the remainder of the year new account on board decreased slightly compared to the first quarter of 2021 with june on boarding down as we delayed account launches to focus on reducing our clinical backlog looking at new store same store mix new store accounted for 25 of year over year growth down from 28 in the first quarter of 2021 primarily due to strong rebound in existing account volumes from the covid impacted q2 2020 home enrollment was approximately 20 in the second quarter of 2021 down slightly from the first quarter of 2021 turning our attention to the rest of the p l gross margin for the second quarter was 68 a 0 4 decrease compared to a gross margin of 68 4 in q1 of 2021 the decrease was primarily due to higher overtime costs related to previously discussed capacity shortfalls offset by volume benefits q2 21 gross margin benefited from a price approximately 4 5 million of revenue not related to q2 21 volumes discussed above and would have been approximately 2 points lower on a pro forma basis operating expenses for the second quarter of 2021 were 72 3 million down 7 7 from q1 of 2021 and up 30 1 year over year the sequential decrease in operating expenses included a 2 5 million decrease in bad debt due to improved collections a 10 3 million decrease in stock based compensation offset by an increase hiring and investments both bad debt and stock compensation included one time adjustments and as such should not be considered representative of cost structure moving forward comparing year on year opex q2 21 opex was up 30 1 due primarily to hiring and legal spending offset by a decrease in verily milestone expenses quarterly adjusted ebitda of negative 4 6 million in q2 2021 was approximately flat to q1 2021 adjusted ebitda of negative 5 2 million cash and short term investments decreased 6 6 million dollars from the first quarter of 2021 to 255 7 million purchases of property and equipment of 5 9 million repayment of long term debt of 2 9 million an ebitda loss of negative 4 6 million consumed cash offset by working capital improvements and proceeds from employee stock purchases cash stabilized thus claims submissions began to normalize accounts receivable increased by 3 4 million from 60 million in q1 2021 to 63 4 million in q2 2021 still significantly elevated above the q4 2020 balance of 29 9 million accounts receivable is expected to decline in second half 2021 as backlog claims processing becomes fully caught up finally the net loss for the second quarter of 2021 was negative 17 4 million or a loss of 0 59 per share compared with a net loss of 20 4 million or 0 75 per share for the same period of the prior year we are currently holding approximately 10 of 2021 year to date zio xt claims down from approximately 70 as of q1 2021 quarter end we have submitted all novitas claims remaining health plans or for a limited number of commercial payers as we discussed last quarter we have initiated a process of evaluating our operating profile to identify opportunities to scale more efficiently increasing our revenue conversion for unit and reducing our cost to serve key strategies include reducing device manufacturing costs through design and automation reducing clinical scan times through increased ai and workflow improvement improving revenue cycle management to reduce contractual allowances cost of claims and bad debt and finally examining various go to market options that would reduce sales and marketing cost per unit collectively we identified opportunities where we believe we can drive double digit percentage reductions to our cost to serve with reductions fully implemented in the 2023 24 timeframe and as a result build a strong sustainable operating foundation that can profitably support a range of reimbursement levels in second half 2021 higher costs associated with capacity limitations will exceed the impact of cost structure reductions we look forward to sharing more details on our cost improvement initiatives as well as our market expansion opportunities later this year turning to guidance for the full year 2021 we expect revenue to range from 320 million to 325 million representing year over year growth of 21 to 23 revenue guidance for the year does not assume any changes to medicare reimbursement and as previously mentioned discussions with novitas and the other macs remain ongoing we expect revenue in the third quarter 2021 to grow sequentially over the second quarter by approximately 3 registration volumes in the quarter are expected to be approximately sequentially flat with revenue volume growth coming from reducing the clinical backlog of zio reports offset by non volume related revenue drivers in q2 2021 not reoccurring in q3 2021 for the fourth quarter of 2021 we expect revenue to be approximately flat as compared to q3 2021 with growth in registration volumes offset by clinical backlog reductions in q3 not reoccurring in q4 gross margin in the third quarter of 2021 is expected to decline approximately 3 compared to q2 2021 due to the non volume related revenue drivers in q2 not recurring in q3 and higher costs associated capacity limitations opex is expected to increase by approximately 13 million in q3 2021 as compared to q2 2021 due to bad debt and stock compensation not benefiting from the factors that impacted q2 2021 growth in hiring and investment growth in stock compensation due to hiring and retention and increases in legal spending additionally the next verily milestone is forecasted to be achieved in the second half of 2021 if the milestone is reached in q3 21 this will add 3 million in q3 2021 opex additionally we will continue to pay down debt for our amortization schedule and we ll continue to build out our new manufacturing facility in the second half of 2021 as you heard work is underway and we believe this quarter s results demonstrate the progress we are making i would also note that the ceo search is actively underway with healthy interest we look forward to providing additional updates as appropriate the irhythm team remains focused on and excited about the opportunities we have and i have the greatest confidence in our future and with that we would like to open up the call for questions operator questions and answers operator thank you please standby while we compile the q a roster your first question comes from robbie marcus from jp morgan your line is open unidentified participant hey thanks for taking the question you ve got saran on for robbie here just i have a question on the reimbursement you mentioned in the unfortunate scenario where medicare rates don t move this year what can you quantify or kind of size the impact that we would see on commercial rates heading into next year douglas devine chief financial officer yeah we would this is doug we would be speculating as we have said before if we don t have any further any favorable movement between the macs and medicare as we head into the negotiations for 2022 contracts that certainly puts risk into there and at the same time we are in frequent communication with the commercial payers we have a good story on the clinical benefits and the economic benefits that our product provides and so we are working to minimize any impacts there but at the same time it would be too much speculation to put a range on what type of impact we could potentially see unidentified participant got it thank you and on the guidance that you gave was helpful you gave some of the commentary there in terms of what the mix is looking like from new center versus existing versus growth you gave some commentary on quarter any commentary you have for and what the outlook looks like for the back half of this year douglas devine chief financial officer well i think what you re seeing we saw the lowest number coming from new store this quarter but i attribute that to being that the existing stores we re all very depressed in q2 2020 that being the deepest quarter of impact in covid and you re still seeing some very real covid impacts in q3 of 2020 and so just the fact that those existing stores are rebounding significantly is going to make the component of growth is coming from new store lower but we ve been very happy overall with our new store account openings and so we re very confident and we continue to make the progress we want to make in new store account openings new store openings unidentified participant thank you operator your next question comes from margaret kaczor from william blair your line is open unidentified participant hi everyone this is brandon on for margaret thanks for taking the question we re still going to punch in the numbers here obviously in our model but it feels like in the beginning of this year or at least year to date so far that the ecg market and patch based ecg specifically is accelerating especially given the guidance that you gave so just curious what if you guys could talk about what you re seeing in the field it s still seems like the adoption of patch based ecg this is moving along nicely perhaps even faster than in the past is that a fair characterization and if so what kind of drivers are making that happen out in the field douglas devine chief financial officer well i think i think the biggest thing that i would say is that our new account openings and the interest in new accounts and in signing onto our product remains very high remains high by historical levels and we continue to work through that and then we would we would say this is the clinical efficacy of our product and the economic the economic benefits that our product provides so i think it s just a continuation of the trends we ve been seeing as we mentioned in the call we did see in march april and may in particular we saw very significant strength in the existing accounts increase in volumes and we do interpret that to be that is as covid continues to impact people s behaviors that was a low point in case loads and there was some acceleration of patients coming back to see the doctors in that time period unidentified participant okay that s helpful and it s maybe looking at a longer term and maybe toward the tam expansion i think it s been something like ten months now since we saw the presentation of mstops which was all around pretty overwhelmingly positive data i can appreciate that maybe we ll wait to get more definitive updates on tam expansion but any updates that you could provide in terms of what s been going on behind the scenes engaging with payers i think that was the one specifically that mstops was run with anything that they saw intriguing there that may be leaves you any more or less encouraged for that tam expansion opportunity unidentified participant let dan take that question daniel wilson executive vice president strategy corporate development investor relations yeah thanks brandon for the question i would say in the early days of our market development and selling targeted detection programs we believe the value proposition is resonating with payers and integrated payer providers so we re very excited about the progress we ve made in the last six months or maybe the ten months since mstops in our early go to market strategy we have a great team behind this effort and are pushing it forward we re certainly looking to build this out even more fully and there is aspects of the service or capabilities that we re adding here to still leveraging our core zio xt platform that building around that and we look forward to sharing more details as we make progress there unidentified participant got it great thanks daniel wilson executive vice president strategy corporate development investor relations thanks brandon operator your next question comes from cecilia e furlong from morgan stanley your line is open unidentified participant hey good afternoon and thanks for taking my question this is calvin on for cecilia so just one on reimbursement and one on data the first one is just understanding you believe next july when comes out that would be the more major catalyst versus this november december my understanding though it was the lack of update in july it didn t necessarily preclude a development in the final rule so i m just curious have you seen to date any public comments of significance either from societies like acchr or other participants i think last year during the commentary we saw comments from our competitors as well so just curious anything to date where we re calling out or expect to see perhaps that could make a real impact into the final rule daniel wilson executive vice president strategy corporate development investor relations yeah calvin it s dan i can address that so i would say as it relates to the proposed rule we were encouraged and due to the proposed rule this year it is positive progress cms continues to seek information and is looking for ways to appropriately price the service it is clear there are challenges and how best to price vertically integrated ai based business models like our own but cms is actively seeking ways to solve for this both specifically with our own code as well as seeking comments from stakeholders around ai based services so we intend to use the open comment period between now and mid september to provide our perspectives and also work with other industry stakeholders to provide comments that we hope are helpful with cms so we will continue to seek national pricing for calendar year 2022 and that remains a possibility which is encouraging but we do believe the more likely outcome as we said in our prepared remarks that we will remain contractor pricing for 2022 and reenter the cycle next year unidentified participant understood and just one quick one and mstops i think we were expecting to see some cost effectiveness data either at mid year this year or in the back half just wanted to check in on that are you still expecting to see that in the near term and can you maybe just comment on the confidence and how good the data set is going to be thanks daniel wilson executive vice president strategy corporate development investor relations yeah sure this is dan i ll take that one again so for on mstops the data that was released today last year we believe the publication around the clinical outcomes data is coming shortly don t have any specific timing or details to point you to but do believe that s in the near term for the economic data piece that remains in the works but delayed a bit from our original thinking that it would be mid this year i don t have updated timing to give you today but other than to say that remains in the works but i would also say that we do believe that having this data and economic data in particular peer reviewed and published will be a big boost to our efforts but we also have our own economic models and can work with payers and integrated payer providers to review their data their specific data and have a discussion around the economic benefits of a targeted detection program and that is an element of our go to market strategy today within silent af unidentified participant got it thanks so much operator your next question comes from bill plovanic from canaccord your line is open bill plovanic canaccord analyst thanks good evening so just i m going to focus on the model i mean you guys are really having success in driving revenue and i m kind of curious if you broke that up you ve seen this big increase in the zio at business which i believe has a pretty significant price premium so what is the underlying unit growth look like just in patients year over year i don t know if you share that i apologize if you did douglas devine chief financial officer yeah we haven t shared that specific number we ve given you the impact on how to adjust for the quarter of our volume that is medicare pricing so i ll let you do them after 25 medicare pricing price went from 311 gross to 115 gross i mean that will get you in the ballpark of how to translate this the magnitude of the revenue growth into closer to a volume growth and i mean obviously zio at has grown significantly and you are correct that zio at particularly with the decline in zio xt pricing is it s more than 2x the zio xt price at this point bill plovanic canaccord analyst okay and then forgive me if you answered this question but the uptake in the at i mean are you seeing some of the physicians transfer over to that product just because of the pricing on the xt douglas devine chief financial officer no i wouldn t say we have any indication that i think the physicians doesn t directly impact on what the medicare reimbursement level is when i look at at i d point to a couple of factors in first we re extremely happy with the level of volume growth and the increased adoption that we re seeing on zio at and we definitely highlight that compared to we re still well below 10 penetrated in the mct market this is compared to where we are at a higher penetration rate with zio xt so there is quite a bit of room for zio at to continue to grow at a good clip but i would say our sales force is getting steadily longer we ve the product in field our sales force is getting better and more efficient at selling the product we ve had a very good clip of setting up of selling and setting up new accounts i mean primarily accounts that currently do zio xt but there is a significantly greater amount of that at growth is coming from the new store volumes as opposed to on the xt side bill plovanic canaccord analyst great thanks for taking my questions operator your next question comes from david rescott from truist your line is open unidentified participant hi guys sam on for david thanks for taking our questions just the first one going to reimbursement again with mac pricing in 2022 how do we think about the potential change we can see there is it possible that the macs could increase payment at a significant rate or are we more likely to see more of a smaller sequential step up daniel wilson executive vice president strategy corporate development investor relations yeah hey sam it s dan i can take that one and doug can anything he sees fit so i would make a couple comments obviously we re going to stop short of providing guidance on what a potential outcomes is but we ll reiterate a couple of points one we remain very encouraged by the willingness of novitas and the other macs to explore an alternative pricing model which again we believe is better representation of the true cost of delivering the service and as mentioned previously the reason it s a better representation of the true cost of delivering the services it includes historical r d costs as an example and remember that the challenge we are facing is that we are a vertically integrated service provider and there are no commercial invoices that cms can point to and say that this is a commercially validated price the supplier or equipment that is used in the service such as our wearable biosensor in software tools if there were one could argue that the historical cost to develop the hardware and software and the cost to produce the cost to sell and market the product as well as the overhead would all be captured in that commercial price of the hardware or software so we believe this alternative model sells for a lot of those challenges and novitas and the other macs while not providing any commitments are willing to review the data so we re optimistic that this is a viable strategy to more appropriate pricing obviously with caveat we cannot provide any assurances that novitas or the other macs will ultimately update pricing based on this information nor the timing but our focus is on presenting them this information and continuing the discussions with them and again we remain encouraged that they remain at the table with us to discuss unidentified participant okay that s helpful and just i ll just ask one more on reimbursement and yeah provide whatever that you can but if we think about is there may be a level on mac reimbursement say maybe like 200 or 250 reimbursement for macs where you see commercial payers may be less likely to shift their rates significantly going forward and just any color you can provide about that differential would be really helpful thank you douglas devine chief financial officer yeah so this is doug i mean obviously the higher the level of mac pricing is the less impact we would expect there to be on the less risk we would expect there to be to commercial payers but i think we need to be careful to spec not to speculate here and then i mean the other thing i would say is that while we are still in carrier pricing i mean the commercial players are very aware that this is this is a process that s still underway on the medicare side so i do think that national when we achieve national pricing that is likely to be more impactful and more taken into stronger account by the commercial payers than a mac price which is going to be seen as an intermediate step in a longer process and that is very much what we have been seeing with this year s mac pricing development so i would give you the guidance that mac pricing changes to mac pricing is going to be less influential to the commercial payers than the cms national pricing will be operator your next question comes from suraj kalia from oppenheimer company your line is open suraj kalia oppenheimer company analyst good afternoon everyone can you hear me all right douglas devine chief financial officer i can hear you suraj suraj kalia oppenheimer company analyst perfect just forgive me if you mentioned this already just jumping in between close what s the contractual allowance in the quarter and i ll just throw my other question also and don t you mentioned about gross margin seen catch the reason for that and if you could also just expand on your comment about revenue cycle management improvement how would that just kind of put some additional color on that to help us understand how opex to be reduced margins could be improved and any color would be great thank you for taking my questions douglas devine chief financial officer okay no problem so first contractual allowances is how we account for the difference between the contractual price that we signed with the commercial payers and the amount that the commercial payer actually pays us and so during the quarter we actually have very good performance of improving the collections on that on past contractual allowances with a number of both with a number of commercial payers which resulted in us taking some one time favorable adjustments to revenue but anyway that is what the contractual allowances is and it s really the difference between when we close each quarter we have an expected level of what those contractual allowances i e what the contractual what the level of holdbacks that the commercial payers are going to pay us and then there is always a true up that if we ve collected more or potentially less but in this case it was significantly more on than was expected over those historical periods than the results in a favorable adjustment so when you look at revenue cycle there are three components to revenue cycle one component is exactly what we were saying most contractual allowances and when we improve contractual allowances that s going to result in top line growth and then the other two components of revenue cycle our bad debt which in this case is non payment by the patients and in the commercial market we treat bad debt on the patient side as an opex charge and sg a charge and then the other component is the actual cost of processing the claim that we have some third party assistance and then we have an internal team that is processing the claims and so the opportunity here is to reduce that claims reduce those costs with the largest impact of that being and we don t disclose the specific numbers but when we file initial claims x percentage of those claims will be denied and then we have a claims team that will go in and work those denials and x percentage will be reduced to y percentage and so you can see that if we can reduce that initial denial rate by pick your number 25 40 then that s going to result in first better claim better collections performance but second most of my cost and the revenue cycle are based on working those denied claims and so if i have 25 or 40 less denials upfront then that s going to cost me significantly less on a per claim basis toward the denials suraj kalia oppenheimer company analyst doug forgive me if the contractual allowance was 10 before this quarter did it go up or remain the same douglas devine chief financial officer we haven t disclosed the exact percentage or contractual allowances in the commercial market it has historically been in the low teens suraj kalia oppenheimer company analyst thank you operator there is no further question at this time you may continue douglas devine chief financial officer okay i would like to thank everyone for joining we re very happy with the quarter we ve had and look forward to sharing more information as we go forward thank you operator duration 53 minutes call participants leigh salvo head of investor

washington d c as raw material shortages continued despite signs of some easing in supply chain constraints u s manufacturing activity grew at a slower pace in july for the second straight month a survey from the institute for supply management ism on monday showed a measure of prices paid by manufacturers fell by the most in 16 months while the supplier deliveries index retreated further from a 47 year high in may timothy fiore chair of ism s manufacturing business survey committee noted that supply and demand dynamics appear to be moving closer to equilibrium for the first time in many months as quoted by reuters part of that could be because spending is rotating back to services from goods the ism s index of national factory activity fell to 59 5 last month the lowest reading since january from 60 6 in june a reading above 50 indicates expansion in manufacturing which accounts for 11 9 percent of the u s economy demand shifted to goods from services during the covid 19 pandemic as millions of americans were forced to stay indoors straining the supply chain now with roughly half of the population being fully vaccinated against the coronavirus allowing people to travel frequent restaurants and more government data last week reported that spending on services accelerated sharply in the second quarter helping to lift the level of gross domestic product above its peak in the fourth quarter of 2019 still the ism survey points out that the supply chain was still a long way from normalizing in the computer and electronics industry manufacturers reported that purchases continue to have long lead times due to shortages of raw materials while the scarcity of inputs in the automobile industry is well known additionally the ism survey s forward looking new orders sub index fell for a second straight month businesses depleted inventories rapidly in the second quarter stocks at retailers are well below normal levels economists at goldman sachs expect retail and auto inventories will return to normal levels in mid 2022 a measure of factory employment rebounded in july after contracting modestly in june for the first time since november though manufacturers continued to complain about the scarcity of workers the labor shortage is expected to ease in the fall when schools reopen for in person learning but a resurgence in new covid 19 cases driven by the delta variant of the coronavirus could make some people reluctant to return to the labor force
from oregon in the united states to antalya and bodrum in turkey to some of the coldest areas of siberia in the last month wildfires have been devastating thousands of acres amidst temperatures above 40 c the flip side of this has been simultaneously catastrophic floods in germany and china as this article was being prepared wildfires threatened to ignited huge coal stocks at the milas power station in turkey at the end of january this year mainstream pro capitalist politicians probably felt a sigh of relief donald trump had been evicted from the white house and a vaccine to combat the corona virus had been discovered indeed three of them together normal service for world capitalism could be resumed alas it was not to be despite high levels of vaccination in a few rich countries vaccine nationalism and the fast spreading delta variant have combined to ensure a rapid increase in the levels of infection at the same time extreme weather events have sounded an ominous warning note scientists are warming that super high temperatures and disastrous weather events are going to be the new normal why let s start with the high pressure heat dome that has caused disaster for farming and rural communities in oregon and as far north as vancouver in canada the immediate cause of this is high sea temperatures causing storms off japan in the north pacific these have combined to create a rossby wave of high temperatures stretching hundreds of miles into the atmosphere and dragged eastwards by the jet stream ending up as the heat dome over the north west us coast and part of canada but the root cause is high sea temperatures the us canada heat dome is worsened by ground level factors namely long term drought conditions and tinder dry woodland and grassland the us west is facing a systemic water crisis as the giant aquifer under the rockies dries out and lake mead created in boulder canyon by the hoover dam sinks to record lows if this decline continues water supplies to arizona and nevada are under immediate threat in the longer term california also faces a water crisis massively high temperatures are hitting the eastern mediterranean and causing catastrophic fires in turkey s star tourist resorts like bodrum and antalya right wing turkish president recep tayyip erdoğan was quick to blame the kurdish rebels of the pkk kurdish workers party for starting the fires an absurdity given the geographical scope of the inferno the turkish fires are part of the east mediterranean high temperature process affecting greece and italy as well as turkey and extending northwards into lebanon syria iran and iraq wildfires have threatened the outskirts of catania second city of sicily and the northern suburbs of athens and stretched into bosnia and croatia obviously the tourist industry in many of these countries already battered by the pandemic is now facing major losses the southern coastal resorts of turkey centre of a hugely profitable industry have always been known for high temperatures the message has been only to go on holiday there if you can cope with regular temperatures of 35 but now it s more like 40 impossible temperatures for many tourists the same is true for many parts of the mediterranean as far west as portugal this time round sardinia far to the west has also been badly affected by wildfires but inland in many countries of the med and the middle east and especially in lebanon iraq syria and southern iran the heat and water crisis are causing massive hardship for ordinary people little covered in the mainstream media there has been a revolt among the ethnically arab people in khuzestan the southern iranian region bordering iraq they accuse the iranian government of corruption and incompetence in water management the government has responded to protests with its usual brutality on a much larger scale the cities of iraq especially in the south are suffering drastic heat levels and water shortages while the country has seen its water supply reduced because of turkey and syria taking more water from the tigris and euphrates rivers that supply iraq government corruption and infrastructure collapse mean that ordinary people are struggling to get water needed for washing and cooking climate change also plays a big role as one chatham house commentator puts it historically iraq lay claim to one of the most abundant water supplies in the middle east but the flow of the tigris and euphrates rivers has reduced by up to 40 since the 1970s due in part to the actions of neighbouring countries in particular turkey upstream rising temperatures and reduced rainfall due to climate change are also negatively impacting iraq s water reserves while the water crisis and firestorms developed globally in july in china massive floods inundated zhengzhou the major city of henan province killing dozens on the swamped metro system however it is not simply a matter of wildfires in oregon and the mediterranean while there are floods in china the zhengzhou floods were immediately preceded by days of temperatures in the high 30s that created the atmospheric conditions for a huge downpour and flooding the china meteorological administration blamed the storm on strong and sustained subtropical high pressure systems that along with typhoon in fa approaching south china pushed water vapour from the sea to henan global heating causing rising sea temperatures once again played a deadly role business websites unsurprisingly raised the alarm that zhengzhou is a major centre for the manufacture of iphones as well as being a centre of general manufacturing and food production as in china western commentators are beginning to wonder if china s flood and emergency rescue systems are up to the job the emphasis is on managing the disasters caused by climate change not on taking decisive action to reduce its impact and extent learn to live with it is becoming the right wing mantra for climate change and covid 19 if all this were not enough huge wildfires in the yakutsk region of siberia have created the worst pollution crisis ever in a major city with chemicals like ozone benzene and hydrogen cyanide being released the exact source of this poisonous mixture is not known what is clear is that this area has the reputation of being one of the coldest in the world and is now involved in its own heating crisis making the area doubly unliveable and finally there is the flooding in india from an exceptionally intense monsoon season and the sudden dramatic storms in germany that have washed away small towns and killed more than 150 people what does all this mean for the world s climate this is summed up by veteran environmental campaigner fred pearce some of the most alarming science surrounding climate change is the discovery that it may not happen incrementally as a steadily rising line on a graph but in a series of lurches as various tipping points are passed and now comes a new concern these tipping points can form a cascade with each one triggering others creating an irreversible shift to a hotter world a new study suggests that changes to ocean circulation could be the driver of such a cascade the potential tipping points come in three forms runaway loss of ice sheets that accelerate sea level rise forests and other natural carbon stores such as permafrost releasing those stores into the atmosphere as carbon dioxide co2 accelerating warming and the disabling of the ocean circulation system briefly summed up potential tipping points that were once considered independent of one another are now seen as part of a world system global heating melting ice sheets and glaciers and rising temperatures on land and sea could be pushing a catastrophic rise in sea levels and an average temperature rise of 3 way in excess of the paris target of 1 5 leading to a global catastrophe certainly large parts of the world are set for routine summer temperatures of 40 including britain a study in published in the royal meteorological society s international journal of climatology found that britain s climate is becoming hotter and wetter and that summer temperatures are likely to reach 40 by 2040 if present trends continue that of course is the key question what will be done to combat global heating and its disastrous effects when the flooding disaster struck germany and belgium in july german chancellor angela merkel due to leave office within weeks emotionally stated her grief and said that germany would have to do more these mealy mouthed words are the typical response of mainstream capitalist politicians who have failed to meet even the inadequate targets set by the paris climate agreement in 2015 the guardian s acute analyst aditya chakrobortty predicts a change of tack among right wing politicians climate change denial is out and the new line will be that climate change is inevitable and we will just have to live with it just like we are being told we will just have to live with the covid 19 pandemic we is in this context a slippery term in the near and medium future those sections of the world s populations who have abundant water supplies secure food working electricity and air conditioning and the resources to move where they live will live with climate change much more easily than the poor the poor in the global south and the poor also in the advanced countries much more likely to be the victims of fire and flood in his excellent new book fight the fire jonathan neale outlined a plan to cut co2 emissions by 90 and other harmful emissions by 50 75 through a conversion of heating and other domestic energy transport and industry to sustainable electricity sources especially through wind and solar power this involves substantial changes to the energy grid says neale what stands in the way of this plan the answer is basically fossil fuel capitalism whose companies make up a significant percentage of international stock markets this of course involves both oil and coal and the countries that have vast reserves of these resources like australia china india and saudi arabia but it s more than that it s also the structure of production that is skewed towards wasteful unnecessary and especially luxury goods the transformation away from fossil fuel capitalism means a major social and political transformation the big issues of climate change will be debated at the november cop environment conference in glasgow but whatever is agreed there humanity for the moment can only be in the process of mitigating climate change not stopping it climate change is already underway the fact that the uk is predicted to have average summer temperatures of 40 by 2040 does not mean we will have mild temperatures until then on the contrary the recent report by the independent climate change committee warns of rising temperatures and more storms and floods in the short and medium term the results of this report are summed up on the uk greenpeace site the disastrous fires in the mediterranean siberia and north america this year are not something just affecting other people britain and northern europe are integrated into world weather systems and will suffer the results of global heating too without major political change on the climate the future is grim 6 august 2021 source anti capitalist resistance

an unknown illness affecting songbirds in multiple states still hasn t been identified but it doesn t seem to have reached southwest virginia and cases are dropping in the areas where it has been detected the southwest virginia wildlife center of roanoke svwc said in light of that news the group said this week that it s fine for bird feeders and baths to come back out in southwest virginia and northeast tennessee but it encouraged people to feed birds using native plants rather than feeders and stressed that anyone using bird feeders should thoroughly clean them at least once a week it never quite got here we don t think chester leonard svwc s assistant director said friday and if it did there were only a handful of cases that s great news of course any time that we aren t losing wildlife that s a great thing you never know it could resurge that s always possible he added but it seems to be going away the mystery disease began showing up in northern virginia and multiple other states in late may according to the virginia department of wildlife resources dwr common symptoms have included tremors difficulty balancing tilted heads and swollen oozing or encrusted eyes the hardest hit species seem to be common grackles blue jays american robins and european starlings on june 29 after finding two dead birds with signs of the illness svwc issued an urgent advisory for residents in the region to take down bird feeders and baths the idea was to be proactive not reactive the group said since the disease seemed to be spreading and experts weren t sure what it was or how it was transmitted dwr also urged people to take down and clean their feeders in the northern virginia regions where the illness had already shown up but in a july 28 update dwr said that reports of birds showing the eye and neurological symptoms associated with the disease had dropped by 50 the agency still recommended that people stop using bird feeders in the affected regions in northern virginia virginians beyond those regions should take down bird feeders if they find multiple dead birds on their property over a short period of time it said on wednesday svwc shared its own recommendation that feeders and baths could come back out in the region it seems the disease is concentrated to our north and the number of cases seems to be declining the svwc statement said that being said the best way to care for and feed our local birds is to plant native perennials the statement said native plants provide more habitat and nutrition for birds especially babies are not as likely to transfer disease from bird to bird and better support bird populations long term the group recommended searching audubon s native plants database www audubon org native plants which is searchable by zip code and asking local nurseries if they have any of the results in stock the group also reiterated that birds are not reliant on feeders at this point in the year so keeping them down won t leave them hungry if you do decide to feed birds again we strongly recommend everyone clean their feeders at least once a week with a 1 10 bleach to water solution the statement said we still don t know what the cause of the disease is and for that reason we ask everyone to do their best about cleaning their feeders without conclusive results it is difficult to make the right call which is why you may have heard various conflicting over the past few months from various sources svwc said in the statement there is pressure to have a definitive answer we humans like easy answers but the biological world is complicated and messy what about those two dead birds that svwc sent to labs for testing i m not sure of their status if they ve already been like broken down with their blood samples leonard said they probably can t tell us that yes that is in fact the disease because they re still trying to figure out what the disease is dwr hasn t even picked up some additional birds that residents have since submitted to the wildlife center he said leonard added that his team was grateful to everyone who responded to svwc s proactive recommendations we ve had a lot of positive feedback of course some people have pushed back oh you re crazy he said but a lot of folks really care about the wildlife took their feeders down and we re grateful for that it s nice to know that in the future when you put something out there to try to save wildlife people will respond and try to help us and the wildlife as well

katie brockman the motley fool meme stocks have been one of the greatest phenomenons of the investing world this year investments like gamestop nyse gme amc entertainment holdings nyse amc and dogecoin crypto doge saw their prices explode overnight and some investors have made a lot of money from these stocks however meme stocks are more dangerous than they might seem on the surface though their meteoric gains make them tempting there are a few things all investors can learn from them explainer what is a meme stock and is it right for your market portfolio 1 timing the market can be incredibly difficult the difference between meme stocks and growth stocks is that meme stocks growth is sudden and unfounded gamestop for instance had been on the verge of bankruptcy for years and it announced it was closing more than 1 000 stores shortly before its price skyrocketed because the stock price doesn t match the underlying fundamentals with these businesses these gains likely won t last long meme stocks grow quickly because retail investors buy the stock in droves which pumps up its price once those investors sell their shares and move on to a different stock the price will fall it s not impossible to make money with meme stocks but you ll need to be extremely skilled at timing the market selling at the exact right moment before the price crashes is incredibly difficult however because these stocks and the market as a whole are unpredictable if you wait just a day or two longer to sell the price may have already crashed and you could lose money for that reason you re better off buying solid stocks and holding them for the long term healthy companies are likely to see their stock price grow over time so you won t need to worry about selling at the last second before the price drops 2 if it seems like it s too good to be true it probably is one of the biggest appeals of meme stocks is their enormous price gains for example dogecoin which is technically a cryptocurrency but also falls under the meme stock umbrella saw its price surge by nearly 12 000 in a matter of months it s hard to ignore those returns and it can be tempting to buy into these types of investments to avoid missing out on the chance to make a lot of money however one of the golden rules of investing is that if it seems like it s too good to be true it probably is meme stocks may see incredible returns but if their business fundamentals don t align with those gains that growth likely won t be sustainable although it s considerably less exciting investing in stocks with steady and consistent returns is a much safer bet than buying stocks that explode over a matter of days you won t become rich overnight but you are more likely to earn positive returns over the long run 3 putting all your eggs in one basket is risky when you look at meme stocks record breaking returns it s easy to think about how much money you would have made if you d invested every dollar you have but putting all your money behind a single investment even a relatively safe investment is risky because if that stock flops you have a lot to lose no matter where you choose to invest it s wise to make sure you have a diversified portfolio that includes a wide variety of stocks from different industries there s always a chance that one or two stocks won t perform well but your money is much more protected when it s spread across many different investments meme stocks may be risky investments but there s a lot to learn from them too if your goal is to earn as much as possible in the stock market you may be better off buying stocks that see consistent growth and then holding them for the long term you won t become an overnight millionaire but your money will stay safer and you may see significant earnings over time offer from the motley fool 10 stocks we like better than dogecoin when our award winning analyst team has a stock tip it can pay to listen after all the newsletter they have run for over a decade motley fool stock advisor has tripled the market they just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy right now and dogecoin wasn t one of them that s right they think these 10 stocks are even better buys see the 10 stocks katie brockman has no position in any of the stocks mentioned the motley fool has no position in any of the stocks mentioned the motley fool has a disclosure policy the motley fool is a usa today content partner offering financial news analysis and commentary designed to help people take control of their financial lives its content is produced independently of usa today
the 60 40 investing rule is dead experts say it s time to be more creative for a long time investors have trusted their financial futures to a piece of conventional wisdom known as the 60 40 rule the idea is that you put 60 of your investing dollars into stocks so you ll have enough growth potential to meet your goals the other 40 goes into bonds to provide a stable source of income to fall back on in case your stocks don t perform it s supposed to work well the problem is that the investing landscape today looks completely different from what it was 70 or even 20 years ago what the professionals are saying now jordvdz twenty20 while it s not a universal opinion analysts from major firms including bank of america morgan stanley and j p morgan have all proclaimed the death of the 60 40 rule in recent years david kelly chief global strategist for j p morgan asset management says a plain vanilla portfolio of 60 global equities and 40 u s bonds is likely to net an annual return of just 4 2 over the next 10 to 15 years why the simple explanation is that bond yields interest rates today are minuscule compared to the yields of yesteryear for example the return on a 10 year treasury note reached a high of 15 8 back in 1981 by the end of the decade it had fallen to 9 5 it s currently hovering around 1 3 not that much better than some savings accounts or certificates of deposit as a result many investors are looking past bonds for other low risk assets that still provide reasonable returns and some are going beyond stocks in search of higher growth potential that can pick up more of the slack alternative investments to consider thanks in part to advancements in technology the average investor has access to far more options today it s even possible to invest with only your spare change here are five ways to inject more diversity into your portfolio beyond simple stocks and bonds farmland rodrigodaibert twenty20 if it s good enough for one of the richest men on the planet surely it s good enough for you story continues farmland can act as a shield against volatility even when the economy goes through a recession people still need to eat and yet there s evidence to show you can expect better returns from farmland than bonds gold and often the stock market using a new investment platform you can join with other investors to buy stakes in individual farms without having to run one yourself you can get a cut from both the leasing fees and crop sales providing you with a cash income while the value of the asset increases exchange traded funds exchange traded funds or etfs combine the convenience of stocks with the diversification and reduced volatility of mutual funds instead of buying into a single company you get a share of a number of different assets such as stocks commodities and bonds the typical etf is based on a financial market index like the s p 500 and contains all of the individual stocks or other investments that make up the index etfs can be bought and sold just like stocks and tend to have lower fees than mutual funds real estate barefoot_traveller twenty20 want to get a cut of the hot housing market right now but can t afford to buy a property or two a real estate investment trust or reit will allow you to get your foot in the front door without having to fork over your life savings or commit to becoming a landlord with as little as 500 you can help fund the purchase of commercial real estate developments and then reap the profits that might even put you on the path to buying your own home hedge funds for the daring and wealthier investor hedge funds can offer both diversification and greater returns these funds are known for using unconventional and risky investing strategies that don t align closely with the stock market they often invest in other alternative assets such as private companies distressed debt currencies and commodities while hedge funds are typically only open to accredited investors some investing apps are trying to make hedge funds more accessible to all cryptocurrency rltheis twenty20 investing in crypto is easier than you might think you can buy bitcoin and other digital currencies through popular investing apps but it s not for everyone yes some people have made a fortune off the incredible volatility as one bitcoin is now worth more than 42 000 meanwhile legendary value investor warren buffett calls the stuff rat poison squared pointing out its limited use as a form of currency the potential is there but don t invest more money than you can afford to lose in the next big swing this article provides information only and should not be construed as advice it is provided without warranty of any kind
three top stocks that are timely buys right now the energy sector has delivered incredible returns for investors so far this year the energy select spdr etf xle 0 26 is up 32 in total returns almost double the 18 for the s p 500 index over the same period as rising demand for oil and gas push energy prices and oil stock profits steadily higher yet at the same time the future of energy is still heavily pointed toward renewables and investors who consider both the near term and long term implications can find a handful of top energy stocks you can buy to benefit from today s surging demand for all things energy while still being positioned for profits in the low carbon future three top energy stocks that look very compelling today include wind turbine blade supplier tpi composites tpic 0 58 integrated energy giant phillips 66 psx 0 03 and infrastructure operator brookfield infrastructure bip 0 11 bipc 0 51 chances are there s something compelling that makes at least one a good fit for investors of all kinds if you re looking to add a top energy stock to your portfolio this month keep reading to learn which of these three might be the perfect timely energy stock buy for you messed up expectations creating a great buying opportunity over the past few years tpi composites has spent a lot of money building out capacity the company which primarily manufactures wind turbine blades for leading wind energy companies was predicting that this new capacity would start paying off this year however that s not looking likely to be the case after management trimmed its full year guidance in late july as a result tpi shares are down more than 50 from the high reached in january and management is now cautioning that sales could be flat through 2022 as well but i think the market s reaction might be short sighted at least for investors willing to think bigger picture and looking to take advantage of this sell off eventually demand for its new capacity should pay off in the interim the company generates solid operating cash flow so it should have little trouble continuing to fund its business during the current soft period in the cycle whether management continues tapping the debt markets to fund capital expansion remains to be seen let s be clear this isn t a value play shares are still more expensive than almost any time in the company s history prior to late 2020 it s a turnaround play with plenty of growth prospects on the other side if management can stay focused on a healthy balance sheet and getting to the next growth phase in the wind cycle investors who buy today should be very happy they did returning to profits today building a sustainable business for tomorrow the past year has been pretty brutal for phillips 66 the company makes most of its money refining and selling refined products like gasoline and diesel and last year s collapse cost it 4 billion in losses yet when it reported second quarter results on august 3 the strength of its business really showed up on the bottom line with 296 million in net income after losing 141 million last year cash flow is starting to surge too operating cash flow was 2 billion in the first half of 2021 1 7 billion of that in the second quarter alone more than double last year s first half result one thing that really stood out is that those profits came even with the refining segment still losing money refining operations reported a pre tax loss of 729 million but a big surge in profits from marketing and specialties fuel and refined products sales along with record profits from petrochemical manufacturing helped offset the continued losses in refining looking ahead it s likely the losses in refining are mostly over demand for fuel is surging and phillips 66 s cash cow is likely to start producing once again what about the low carbon future phillips 66 is making serious inroads there too having already converted one refinery to produce renewable diesel and now doing the same with its rodeo refinery in northern california moreover the company s significant natural gas pipeline and storage facility along with its huge petrochemical manufacturing operations are already set up to handle renewable natural gas as more supply of this product which is captured from human and agricultural waste becomes available phillips 66 s existing infrastructure will play an important role in the transition away from fossil fuels investors who buy now can capture a heady 4 7 dividend yield that s likely to move higher in the earnings release ceo greg garland said we anticipate return to dividend growth as cash flow recovers that high yield will make it a lot easier to hold the stock while the company transitions away from oil and to more and more renewables over time brookfield keeps buying pipelines and its cash flows keep going higher while this isn t a pure play on energy brookfield infrastructure makes the cut as a top stock with growing energy exposure that investors should buy now that s because over the past few years management has made a clear decision that some of the best capital allocation opportunities out there are in the energy logistics space specifically oil and gas pipelines storage terminals and processing facilities have been on the shopping list its latest deal to acquire inter pipeline ipl is the most recent and is expected to add almost 400 million in annualized adjusted ebitda to brookfield infrastructure s bottom line here s just how much management s focus on this segment has paid off in the first quarter brookfield infrastructure s midstream segment reported an 89 increase in funds from operations by far the highest growth of any part of its business lastly brookfield infrastructure is a diversified business giving investors exposure to telecommunications transportation and utilities infrastructure assets on multiple continents the nature of its business also results in steady cash flows making its 3 plus dividend yield very secure if you re looking for some exposure to energy but prefer a diversified business with lots of ways management can invest capital to grow the brookfield infrastructure might be the right stock to buy now
washington d c a 1 trillion infrastructure bill under debate by the u s senate includes a provision mandating the installation in autos of a technology for preventing intoxicated drivers from starting their vehicles in a bid to prevent more than 10 000 deaths per year for over 15 years automakers and government agencies have researched technologies for preventing the roughly one third of annual national traffic deaths involving impaired drivers this legislative effort has gained support from advocacy group mothers against drunk driving the auto insurance industry and some alcohol trade associations in its study the insurance institute for highway safety iihs said alcohol detection systems that prevent impaired driving could save over 9 000 lives annually noting that u s police departments arrest some 1 million people per year for driving drunk related deaths cost the country some 44 billion in economic harm and 210 billion in social costs according to a 2010 study in 2019 lawmakers told reuters that auto manufacturers could install touch devices on steering wheels and engine start buttons that can measure drivers blood alcohol levels or install sensors that can passively monitor drivers breath or eye movements the bill would require the u s transportation department to establish a technology safety standard within three years the bill does not specify the technology to be adopted but stressed it must passively monitor drivers performances and accurately identify whether they are impaired the national highway traffic safety administration and automakers have researched one system that samples a driver s breathing while another technology measures blood alcohol level by shining an infrared light through the driver s fingertip however questions remain about the accuracy of these technologies and their suitability for widespread adoption

todd brady president and chief executive officer thank you joshua and good morning we began this morning with the exciting news relating to our retinal disease program over the past few weeks the fda has granted orphan drug designation to adx 2191 the lead product candidate in our retinal disease pipeline for the treatment of two additional rare disorders primary vitreoretinal lymphoma and retinitis pigmentosa primary vitreoretinal lymphoma is a rare aggressive high grade cancer that affects approximately 2 800 people in the united states with approximately 600 new cases diagnosed annually retinitis pigmentosa is a clinical group of rare genetic eye diseases that affects an estimated 82 000 to 110 000 individuals in the united states and approximately one in 4 000 people worldwide as noted in this morning s news release we plan to initiate a phase 2 clinical trial of adx 2191 in patients with retinitis pigmentosa this year adx 2191 has now received orphan drug designation for three distinct clinical indications that affected retina primary vitreoretinal lymphoma retinitis pigmentosa and proliferative vitreoretinopathy a sight threatening condition and the leading cause of failure of retinal detachment surgery and for which we have received fast track designation from the fda the prevention of proliferative vitreoretinopathy as many of you know is the focus of our ongoing phase 3 guard trial part 1 of which is scheduled to conclude enrollment at the end of this year to get there these designations highlight the broad platform potential of adx 2191 to treat a spectrum of rare yet serious retinal disorders none of which have approved therapies particularly as a result of the recent orphan designations in primary vitreoretinal lymphoma and retinitis pigmentosa we will be updating you on future calls as to regulatory timelines and the development process for adx 2191 across the retinal disease platform turning to our anterior segment ophthalmology pipeline we remain on track to discuss results of our phase 3 invigorate trial and our regulatory strategy for reproxalap in ocular allergy with the fda this year the discussion follows the successful completion of invigorate in april where reproxalap demonstrated highly statistically significant improvement over vehicle for the primary endpoint of ocular itching and the key secondary endpoint of ocular redness as well as secondary endpoints patient enrollment continues in our phase 3 tranquility trial of reproxalap for dry eye disease with enrollment in the identical tranquility 2 trial on track to begin this quarter ocular redness is the primary endpoint of these two day trials with rasp levels schirmer s test and dry eye symptoms as secondary endpoints we expect to enroll approximately 150 patients per arm in each trial and top line results are planned for the fourth quarter of this year in parallel with tranquility we ve initiated a multicenter double masked randomized vehicle controlled parallel group phase 2 clinical trial in dry eye disease the purpose of this trial is to optimize the tear collection process to measure rasp similar to tranquility the primary endpoint of the trial is ocular redness in addition to our ocular programs we remain excited about the extension of the therapeutic potential of rasp inhibition to systemic inflammatory disease initial results from phase 2 trials in asthma psoriasis and covid 19 of adx 629 our first in class orally available and irreversible covalent inhibitor of pro inflammatory rasp are anticipated in the fourth quarter of 2021 or the first quarter of 2022 in addition to the disease areas currently under study we re evaluating the possibility of expanding clinical testing of adx 629 and other systemic indications where rasp may mediate pathology and where current therapy is either inadequately effective or toxic we look forward to updating you on our progress along these lines later this year with that i ll turn the call back over to joshua to review our second quarter financial results joshua reed chief financial officer thank you todd cash and cash equivalents as of june 30 2021 were 249 7 million based on our current operating plan we believe that existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to fund currently projected operating expenses through the end of 2023 including potential nda submissions for reproxalap initial commercialization of reproxalap once approved and continued development of our product candidates in ocular and systemic immune mediated diseases turning now to our second quarter 2021 results research and development expenses were 11 5 million for the quarter ended june 30 2021 compared with 4 9 million for the same period in 2020 the increase of 6 6 million is primarily related to the increase in clinical research and development expenditures general and administrative expenses were 3 1 million for the quarter ended june 30 2021 compared with 2 2 million for the quarter ended june 30 2020 the increase of 900 000 is primarily due to an increase in personnel related costs and other miscellaneous administrative expenses the net loss for the second quarter of 2021 was 14 9 million or 0 28 per share compared with a net loss of 7 5 million or 0 25 per share for the quarter ended june 30 2020 looking at our investor calendar todd and i will be participating in a number of investor conferences in the coming months including events hosted by jefferies citi btig h c wainwright and berenberg please check the events and presentations section of our website for details now i ll hand the call back over to todd for closing comments todd brady president and chief executive officer thank you joshua aldeyra continues to make significant progress toward our goal of developing effective and highly differentiated new therapies to treat immune mediated diseases with significant unmet medical need we are excited about the first line potential for reproxalap as a treatment for anterior surface inflammatory diseases that for a significant percentage of patients are not being adequately controlled by standard of care approaches beyond the anterior segment we are developing innovative medicines for retinal inflammatory diseases that we believe will create near term high value commercial opportunities for our pipeline finally we re committed to expanding our therapeutic applications to systemic inflammatory diseases representing a myriad of conditions that are today not sufficiently treated with that josh and i will be happy to take your questions operator questions answers operator thank you your first question comes from the line of marc goodman with svb leerink marc goodman svb leerink analyst yes good morning can you talk about this new indication for the erp so i guess first of all your other ideas there came from the docs at mass eye and ear and you bought the technology out did this one come from them too or i m just kind of curious where the idea came from why starting the study now has the methotrexate off label being used for this indication before maybe you could just give us a little history of that and then is there a screening that takes place because this is a genetic disease just curious about that and then also on the phase 2 to optimize the rasp level study that you re talking about there is that an fda requirement is this going to be one of those supplements after you file just curious who s calling that thank you todd brady president and chief executive officer marc good morning and thanks as always for the excellent question and so on retinitis pigmentosa a program about which we re very excited i think as you can tell from our prepared comments this morning the genesis of retinitis pigmentosa as it relates to methotrexate is a paper that was published out of case western and the university of pittsburgh that s highlighted in our corporate deck that was updated and posted this morning you can see the data in the deck which suggest that methotrexate is particularly important in redoxin misfolding redoxin is a protein that s critical in the light sensation cascade in the retina and methotrexate seems to be able to prevent the redoxin that s holding and certain genotypes of retinitis pigmentosa so the answer to the second part of your question is that patients in the upcoming clinical trial will be screened genetically not only to identify retinitis pigmentosa but this particular subtype is genetic subtype of retinitis pigmentosa that seems to respond well to methotrexate regarding your question about the phase 2 trial in dry disease that we mentioned this morning in the prepared comments this is not an fda requirement but as you know we re particularly interested in assessing rasp levels in tears rasp is the target of our drug if we can successfully demonstrate changes in rasp following drug administration then i believe we will be the first company ever to demonstrate that a topical drug can affect the target of that drug in the tears of patients we re also interested potentially in highlighting the changes in rasp in the pharmacology section of our potential drug label if commercialized so we re taking the assessment of rasp very seriously hence this phase 2 trial which as we mentioned is designed to optimize tear collection obviously a pivotal process in the assessment of rasp thanks marc operator and your next question comes from the line of yigal nochomovitz with citigroup yigal nochomovitz citi analyst great todd and josh thank you very much for taking the question i just wanted to follow up on the phase 2 trial that you re running the new one that you ve just announced you re saying the purpose is to optimize the tear collection process to measure rasp could you just help us understand a little bit better why this wasn t possible within the context of the two tranquility phase 3s todd brady president and chief executive officer of course good morning yigal and thanks for the question i m happy to clarify the phase 2 rasp trial the tranquility trials are identical and based on the highly successful run in cohort from january then as part of tranquility we ve identified ocular redness as the primary endpoint ocular redness has numerous advantages not to mention the fact that we ve consistently demonstrated activity in ocular redness with reproxalap not only in dry eye disease but also ocular allergy but also because ocular redness is probably the sign the exclusive dry disease sign that matters to patients patients do not care about schirmer s test patients do not care about ocular staining or any other so called signs of the dry disease hence our selection of ocular redness nonetheless as i mentioned in response to marc s a good question prior we re still very interested in assessing rasp and presenting rasp data to the street and potentially including rasp beta in our product label this is why that we ve initiated this study tear collection is tricky as you know in dry eye patients tears are at a premium there just aren t very many tears in many subjects the result of that is difficult to measure rasp we require about three microliters of tears to generate a rasp signal from a single subject and believe it or not about 25 of the subjects in the running cohort for tranquility were not able to produce three microliters or more tears this is why we are altering optimizing the tear collection process and that ultimately is what this trial is about as i mentioned though yigal ocular redness remains the primary endpoint here in this phase 2 trial yigal nochomovitz citi analyst got it thank you and i just had a few housekeeping questions on your plan to process for disclosing tranquility firstly will both trials be reported at the same time second will you be conducting any type of a pooled analysis of these two trials and then finally what should we expect with respect to the top line release beyond ocular redness are we also going to see the tear rasp level data of the schirmer s test data and the dry eye symptoms in the top line release thank you todd brady president and chief executive officer yes i do think that we will disclose the tranquility trial serially they are run in a staggered fashion i do not expect that we will announce the results of both trials together just given timing issues we re big fans of pooling as you know and pooling is part of the nda submission process i do expect you ll see a pooled data at some point though it may not be at the data releases for obvious reasons ocular redness is the primary endpoint we are also interested in a schirmer test and tear rasp levels as we ve discussed schirmer test and tear rasp levels will be secondary endpoints and represent two other fda designated as signs of dry disease we re also assessing dry disease symptoms so in terms of secondary endpoints you ll see a couple of different signs as well as a dry disease symptoms within the chamber yigal nochomovitz citi analyst thank you very much todd brady president and chief executive officer thanks yigal operator and your next question comes from the line of edwin zhang with h c wainwright edwin zhang h c wainwright co analyst hey thanks for taking my question for retinitis pigmentosa have you done any in house work before you decide to go after this genetic disease do you need to do any preclinical or clinical test before you start the phase 2 trial my second question is a quick one for allergic conjunctivitis have you learned any feedback from the fda what s the regulatory pathway possibly going forward in ac thank you todd brady president and chief executive officer thanks edwin for the questions the retinitis pigmentosa paper that cited in our corporate deck is a remarkable scientific work the investigator screened tens of thousands of compounds against certain genetic subtypes of retinitis pigmentosa and methotrexate surface to the top of those in terms of preventing adopt in misfolding the investigators have presented a variety of preclinical data including animal injections single injections multiple injections and i think as a body of work the paper and the results are remarkably compelling which is why we ve and why we intend to initiate a clinical trial in retinitis pigmentosa nonetheless to your question we have now confirmed the activity of methotrexate in vitro in human cell lines that have been genetically modified in two different laboratories so yes we have confirmed the work we typically will attempt to replicate the scientific literature before we initiate a clinical trial i can tell you that the investigators for the upcoming trials are ecstatic about the potential of a new therapy in retinitis pigmentosa as i mentioned there is no approved therapy the disease is difficult to treat and in many cases leads to blindness so i think from the patient perspective the investigator perspective and certainly from our perspective we re all very excited about getting this trial going and translating this exciting preclinical work into a clinical trial in terms of allergic conjunctivitis we are still in dialogue with the fda as we mentioned we expect those discussions to occur this year and of course we ll be updating the street accordingly once we have that clarity on that series of discussions i think we re ready for the next operator and your next question comes from the line of tom shrader with btig tom shrader btig analyst good morning thanks for taking the questions a couple of questions on 629 as we get close to data for the psoriasis readout do you expect there s enough data there to make a reasonable comparison with psoriasis standard of care and for atopic asthma who are the patients here are these patients well controlled on current medications or a quite impaired patients just a sense of how noisy that data set is going to be thank you todd brady president and chief executive officer great questions tom thank you the intent of the three phase 2 trials that we re running for 629 adx 629 is to clarify how the drug is working particularly in terms of cytokine and rasp profile which cytokines are elevated which cytokines are depressed which rasps are controlled how quickly do those biomarker signals that change there probably will be some clinical data of relevance that can be derived from these studies but obviously they re not powered to detect statistical changes in clinical endpoints and really the clinical changes aren t the point of the trial i think with adx 629 we ve taken a very deliberate systematic approach to identifying the kinds of diseases that might respond to the drug which is why we chose psoriasis and asthma which sit at two different ends of the inflammatory cascade psoriasis sort of a th1 autoimmune disease atopic asthma obviously an allergic th2 hypersensitivity disease and we re all very eager to see how the drug behaves particularly from a biomarker standpoint in these two different flavors of inflammation covid is a mix of all of the above as you know some of these patients have cytokine response syndrome or cytokine storm and there we re interested in seeing how the drug works broadly i ll note that in our corporate deck we have cytokine data from reproxalap some time ago i believe we presented those data at quad high some years ago and what you can see is the activity of reproxalap which is closely related to adx 629 structurally is remarkable all the inflammatory cytokines th1 th2 that we tested seems to be reduced following therapy whereas il 10 which is the key anti inflammatory cytokine that was upregulated and that s why we say that rasp are pre cytokine systems based mediators of inflammation and if you can inhibit rasp with reproxalap or 629 or other molecules in our platform the idea is to flip a switch from pro inflammatory to an anti inflammatory state and again this is why we ve selected the spectrum of diseases many people don t know this but one reason we tested reproxalap in dry eye disease and allergic conjunctivitis is that those two diseases also fit that sort of opposite ends of the inflammatory cascade a th1 type disease an autoimmune type disease in dry eye and a th2 or hypersensitivity type disease and allergic conjunctivitis well lo and behold we have activity in both of those conditions so i think it s possible that with regard to adx 629 we ll see activity across the board at least in terms of a biomarker standpoint to the question about clinical readouts of course will attempt to measure pasi scores and pulmonary function tests and normal things that any sponsor would attempt to assess in these indications but i don t expect to have a large data set along those lines at least clinically in terms of the patient population in asthma atopic asthma is interesting these are patients that are triggered by allergen hence the hypersensitivity th2 nature of the patient population and in that way we require patients to have an allergic response in terms of pulmonary function testing and so forth to certain allergens and we will challenge those patients this is a crossover trial so each patient will be exposed to drug and placebo at different times and the response to that challenge will be key in terms of our biomarker and clinical assessments tom shrader btig analyst thank you that was perfect operator your next question comes from the line of prakhar agrawal with jonestrading prakhar agrawal jonestrading analyst hi good morning and thanks for taking my questions for adx 2191 in the retinitis pigmentosa what endpoints could you study in phase 2 and any clarity on what a regulatory pathway could look like and secondly any clarity on the planned nda submission for allergic conjunctivitis updates from the timelines there that would be super helpful thank you todd brady president and chief executive officer for sure prakhar and thanks for the question it is early to comment on the regulatory pathway for retinitis pigmentosa i can tell you that other sponsors have explored clinical challenges as primary endpoints for later stage trials such as walking through a maze and the dark and there are a variety of creative clinical outcomes that can be tested in later stage trials the point of the current trial that we disclosed this morning is not that the point is to assess the activity of adx 2191 in terms of biomarker assessments and oct other types of radiographic and morphological assessments that are typically used to gauge the activity of a drug and retinitis pigmentosa one positive aspect about testing rare retinal disease is that the retina can be observed directly in fact it s the only aspect of the central nervous system that can be observed directly with fundoscopic exams that will be the focus of the upcoming phase 2 trial and we will disclose more about that trial subsequently in terms of design and endpoints and so forth as i mentioned we re very excited about testing the compound because retinitis pigmentosa remains a clinical challenge with no approved therapy and thus derives a great deal of optimism and excitement from patients and physicians in terms of allergic conjunctivitis as i mentioned in my prepared comments we remain in discussions with the fda and i would expect it will have clarity on the regulatory path at some time this year and obviously we ll keep the street updated on next steps operator and your next question comes from the line of justin kim with oppenheimer unknown speaker hi this is isabelle on for justin thanks for taking my question just as you think about a potential filing timeline do you anticipate the safety experience of tranquility 1 and 2 to be sufficient based on current enrollment progress todd brady president and chief executive officer hi good morning isabelle thanks for the question the gating factor for the nda filing for reproxalap as i have mentioned on prior calls is not tranquility it is the safety trial as you point out the fda for most nda submissions requires a detailed and dedicated safety trial usually longer than the typical efficacy trial in our case our chronic efficacy trials were 12 weeks long for symptom assessment in the case of the safety study that trial is 12 months long and so the idea is to estimate nda filing based on the last patient last visit in that safety trial we do believe that we ll be able to file or submit the nda based on six months of patient safety data we continue to reiterate prior guidance that the nda for reproxalap will go in late this year or early next year but the exact timing as i mentioned depends on the nature of enrollment and the timing of enrollment in the safety trial regarding your point about the safety database which is different from the safety trial we think we re well within the normal safety database bounds for numbers of patients just based on the number of phase 2 and phase 3 trials that we have performed in dry disease so we don t anticipate any issues in terms of the size of the patient safety database unknown speaker thanks for that operator and your next question comes from the line of kelly shi with jefferies unknown speaker this is hao calling in for kelly shi so my question is about the phase 2 retro trial in dry eye disease so about the trial design is it going to be the same as to tranquility trials with a focus on optimizing the tear rasp collection and then my second question is about the commercialization of retro in and ac like what s your thoughts right now potential maybe launch yourself or collaborations todd brady president and chief executive officer excellent question about the phase 2 rasp trial in dry eye i really did not highlight the trial design in my prepared comments the answer to your question is yes the trial design is substantially similar to tranquility 1 and tranquility 2 in that the phase 2 is a two day trial day 1 is four doses of drug day 2 is a dose of drug prior to a 90 minute dry eye disease chamber and in the middle of that chamber at approximately one minute 45 there s a second dose of drug what has changed in terms of the protocol for the phase 2 rasp trial is that we re collecting tears particularly on day 1 with a different schedule of that there s lots of ways to collect tears the two most common ways are the use of a capillary which is a small glass tube that s inserted into the eye just above the lower lid and over a period of five to 10 minutes tears by capillary action are sequestered in the tube the other way is to use the schirmer test strip as you know schirmer tests are small strips of paper that are placed in the cul de sac in the tear lake and tears are absorbed into that strip the strip can then be frozen and subsequently spun down and analyzed that way the timing of capillary extraction versus the timing of schirmer strip extraction the order of those procedures is what s being optimized in the phase 2 trial particularly for the assessment of rasp i don t expect that those protocol changes will have any effect on the chamber data on day 2 particularly in terms of the symptom assessment the chamber and the redness assessment of the chamber but really the phase 2 is focused on day 1 and the tear collection there to optimize the rasp signal more so than we might see in the tranquility trial and actually earlier question about what will we see in terms of secondary endpoints in the run in trial we did announce the schirmer test we announced the symptoms we announced ocular redness all relatively quickly after the completion of the trial rasp assessment takes a longer period of time and in the running trial we announced the rasp data after the top line data from the other endpoints was released the reason for that is that the tears need to be shipped to a third party laboratory where a qualified and validated process is used to analyze the rasp levels in tears all that takes more time and is more complicated than standard dry eye disease sign assessments in this case we re not yet clear as to when the rasp data will be released relative to the other data from these phase 2 and phase 3 trials we ll be updating investors as we get closer to those data readouts maybe for the commercialization approaches for reproxalap i ll turn that answer over to joshua who can comment further joshua reed chief financial officer sure thanks for the question from a commercialization standpoint we are committed to following the path that is in the best long term interest of aldeyra and our shareholders on the business development front our discussions are robust the early onset of activity and broad symptom improvement profile of reproxalap continue to generate significant interest from potential strategic partners so that addresses sort of the bd side of the equation with respect to going it alone we have approximately 250 million in cash which is sufficient to begin initial commercialization efforts for reproxalap so we have a number of different options that we re exploring here and we believe that we re well positioned to capitalize on the opportunity unknown speaker thank you and congrats on getting the additional orphan designation for two on that one joshua reed chief financial officer yes thanks we re thrilled operator and your next question comes from the line of esther hong with berenberg esther hong berenberg capital markets analyst hi good morning thanks for taking my questions so on adx 2191 can you give us an update on the ongoing phase 3 study in pvr and then also with multiple ongoing programs which could possibly advance the quickest and then i just got a quick follow up thanks todd brady president and chief executive officer thanks esther and good to hear your voice i m glad you asked about adx 2191 this is a program that i think has been largely ignored by investors yet as i said in my prepared comments 2191 a near term high value commercial opportunity and not only in one clinical indication but in three clinical indications the pbr program is going well we have as of this morning reiterated our guidance that will complete enrollment in the guard phase 3 program this year i ll point out that one thing we ve observed with the guard trial is that many retinal surgeons are already treating pvr with methotrexate off label if you will that is it seems like the de facto standard of care treatment of pvr is already methotrexate and we re really thrilled to be able to present to the retinal community control data along these lines eagerly anticipating the results of the guard trial because i do think that the results have the potential to validate what is sort of done in a standard of care basis today in terms of treatment of the disease and we look forward to announcing those results sometime next year there are multiple programs as you point out with 2191 i really do believe that 2191 represents a platform approach as you know methotrexate has been used in many many different indications it is a known and potent anti inflammatory and antifibrotic drug with hundreds of thousands of patients worth of clinical experience well as you know it turns out that methotrexate is injected into the eye from my prior comments regarding proliferative vitreoretinopathy and now ocular lymphoma in terms of which indication who ll make it to the market first we don t yet know we re optimistic about all of them i would say that retinitis pigmentosa is the newest of the indications that we re testing i would probably place that in terms of timing behind pvr and ocular lymphoma but we re excited to update the street on timelines and regulatory process and so forth if not later this year earlier next year and as i mentioned in the beginning of my response to your question we re just so thrilled about 2191 and the potential for our company and for patients and physicians all of these indications that we re pursuing have no approved therapies esther hong berenberg capital markets analyst thanks super helpful and then just safety data to date on 2191 thanks todd brady president and chief executive officer one advantage of 2191 is that we do have lots of patient exposure the data with ocular injection some of that data is in our corporate deck with regards to the study on pvr in the scientific literature the safety of intraocular injection of methotrexate is well described and well known which represents a real advantage to this compound relative to newer compounds i don t expect that with regard to any of the indications that we described that safety will be an issue simply because the doses that we re using the injection schedule that we re using all have been well described and are in common use in practice for the treatment of these rare diseases esther hong berenberg capital markets analyst thanks todd todd brady president and chief executive officer thanks we re ready for the next operator your next question comes from the line of matt cross with alliance global matt cross alliance global partners analyst hey guys good morning thanks for squeezing me in here just had two quick ones one on the phase 2 tear collection trial that we re asking quite a bit about i guess i might have missed this earlier in the call apologies a busy morning but i was curious if when the study completes how that may impact i know there s some kind of discussion of how this may impact the labeling but are there any takeaways that you might evaluate from this phase 2 that could impact anything you re doing in tranquility is this just going to be for post marketing studies or could there be some modification another as you mentioned tranquility 1 and 2 will complete serially with a little gap in between so i wasn t sure if this could probably not given timing but impact things you may do in tranquility 2 and then the second question i had was just around enrollment for both the tranquility studies given that tranquility 2 that will be starting up shortly but i was wondering given that you re still committing to having both of those data sets in q4 whether you ve been pre identifying patients for tranquility 2 as you were enrolling patients in tranquility 1 even if that hasn t that second trial hasn t officially opened up yet thanks todd brady president and chief executive officer thanks matt for the question i know you re busy there are lots of earnings this time of year and we appreciate taking the time to join our call excellent questions regarding the phase 2 and the implications of the phase 2 to not only tranquility but to our regulatory package the intent of the phase 2 rasp trial in dry disease really is to augment the pharmacology section of the label i would not classify in any way the phase 2 as mission critical for the nda submission or the nda approval process but as i mentioned in my prior answers the idea of getting rasp data in the pharmacology of the section pharmacology section of the product label is commercially differentiating there is no other topical eyedrop that we re aware of that has been able to improve target engagement and the fact that we know how we prove that mechanism of action and the tears of trial patients i think is quite remarkable and should distinguish reproxalap mechanistically from the other approaches out there in the dry eye disease market the primary endpoint of the phase 2 nonetheless is ocular redness we ve been consistent in our ability to demonstrate improvement in redness and allergy and dry eye disease as i ve mentioned previously we remain optimistic about the commercial implications of ocular redness that patients generally care about how they look they are less interested in their stating scores or their schirmer test and so forth so we re really thrilled to have demonstrated the ocular redness activity that we ve shown so far and other trials and that made perfect sense to include ocular redness as the primary endpoint in the phase 2 to the point of your question obviously it is a good sign if ocular redness is improvement in ocular redness is demonstrated in the phase 2 i ll point out though that the size of the phase 2 is approximately half the size of the tranquility trial in phase 2 we re expecting about 75 patients per arm or 150 patients total which is half that of the tranquility trial and thus the powering is not as robust in the phase 2 as it would be in the phase 3 but then again we re not really running the phase 2 for redness we re running it for rasp in terms of tranquility 1 and 2 the trials as i mentioned are being performed serially the same patient population is being enrolled in both trials the enrollment criteria are identical and what we ve decided is to focus on enrollment of tranquility 1 once tranquility 1 completes full then switch to tranquility 2 the beauty of the tranquility trials is that there are two day trials which is awfully convenient for subjects in theory a subject could screen on one weekend qualify and then the next weekend finish the trial the day 1 and day 2 can be performed rapidly i think that s an attractive advantage that relative to longer trials particularly for subjects i would say that enrollment so far in tranquility 1 and the phase 2 trial has been robust i don t expect at this point any issues with tranquility 2 we have seen to date little impact of covid on our enrollment in the tranquility trial and as i mentioned the two day nature of these trials may have something to do with that in terms of being attractive to subjects matt cross alliance global partners analyst perfect that s super helpful extra detail todd i appreciate it and yes hope and see that rasp data in the label and kind of prove out which you re already showing i think between the correlation between rasp and redness so much appreciate it operator and at this time there are no further audio questions we ll now turn the conference back to dr brady for

on june 13 a 26 year old arizona woman woke up to find her 2017 chevrolet bolt electric vehicle charger s adaptor smoking and melted in her home garage she was alarmed she said she had not received any notice from her dealer or general motors of a recall on her car gm had first issued a recall on 68 000 of the 2017 through 2019 model year cars last november you could definitely smell the burning and the wall i plug it into had burn marks up it and all the metal around the adaptor had melted the woman said we didn t know if the fire was out or if it was still burning i googled it and that s when i saw all the articles about the bolt fires from that day forward she said she and her mother have called gm customer care the ev hotline her chevrolet dealer and the chevrolet concierge nearly daily but they are left frustrated because there has been no resolution it s the scariness and the fear of will i be able to charge my car will i make it work she said noting she has a 50 mile roundtrip commute every day is unknown now before i could charge my car at home and have it be fully charged so it s been stressful i charge my car at the public library in case the car sets on fire again the woman who bought the car new in november 2017 asked to not be named to protect her privacy and personal safety but she s a young professional and her family has traditionally bought chevy vehicles she wanted the bolt and still wants an ev because she loved the car and she cares about the environment the second global recall was two weeks ago after two more bolts caught fire recently after that recall the woman said she received four notices from her dealer a class action lawsuit filed earlier this year in the u s district court for the eastern district of michigan alleges that chevrolet bolt owners are not receiving the range they paid for because gm recommends owners not fully charge the batteries the lawsuit alleges that gm may have concealed widespread defects in the batteries suspected of causing the bolts to catch fire on friday a gm spokesman said we are not going to comment on ongoing litigation according to the national highway traffic safety administration records posted online for the 2017 bolts there have been two recalls and 153 related complaints in 2018 there were three recalls and 25 associated complaints and for the 2019 model year there have been four recalls and 78 complaints gm engineers are scrambling to find a fix that will keep the cars from catching on fire and gm says it is doing everything it can to appease bolt customers gm and lg engineers are working around the clock on a fix gm spokesman dan flores told the free press on monday we understand this second recall is a huge inconvenience for our customers all i can do is apologize we are working around the clock we want to get it done and get the procedure to dealers as soon as we can he could not speak to the arizona woman s case because he was not familiar with it but he said until there is a fix customers should follow gm s safety procedures including not parking the car in their home garage and keeping it at only a 90 state of charge gm said those measures should reduce any risks and the vehicle should be safe to drive if someone is not satisfied with that or wants a buyback or trade in to a different vehicle we are looking at that on a case by case basis flores said lemon laws the arizona woman wants gm to find her a different car or put in a new battery that assures her the car won t go up in flames to me a resolution would be just to be able to work with gm the woman said neither me or my mom have had luck with finding anyone who s helpful short of a fix she would like gm to make a reasonable offer for her car that she paid close to 40 000 for an offer that would include the 687 she paid for the charger and now charred adaptor as far as getting a refund for the car every state s lemon laws are different said erik gordon business and law professor at university of michigan in michigan he said the law offer two ways to get a refund on a car purchase if the problem persists after a reasonable number of attempts to repair it a person is entitled to a refund it s presumed that four attempts to repair the same problem within two years crosses the reasonable line if the vehicle is out of service for 30 or more days during the term of its warranty or during the first year after its delivery whichever comes first most lemon laws follow state guidelines gordon said because the federal lemon law guidelines are too vague according to the federal law gordon said if you ve been given a full warranty they re supposed to honor the warranty and repair the vehicle within a reasonable amount of time but it doesn t define a reasonable amount of time or a reasonable amount of times to repair it gordon said so if you go through the federal law or federal courts you just don t know if you ll win or lose losing ground in the ev race but the legal issue is not what s at stake for gm gordon said it s their reputation with customers and risk in the stock market if it doesn t get a handle on the problems with the bolts gm is in the court of public opinion where their product looks to people to be so unsafe that you better leave it outside or else it ll burn your house down gordon said it s not a courtroom where they have to provide evidence it s the court of customer opinion then there s wall street if equity analysts and investors look at this as a signal that for all of the announcements gm has made they can t produce a reliable ev and they can t figure out how to fix it that is not good for your stock price gordon said it s not good for gm s bottom line either the bolt recall has already cost gm 800 million the automaker said wednesday in its second quarter earnings report that cost made up the bulk of gm s 1 3 billion in warranty expenses in the quarter gm still had a good quarter despite a global shortage of semiconductor chips reporting net income of 2 8 billion compared with a net loss of 738 million in the year ago period but gm does not want to lose current or future ev customers over these recalls flores said the company spokesman noted that the 2020 and 2021 bolts use different batteries than those affected by the recall and there have been no problems with the 2020 21 model year cars likewise the 30 new evs gm promises to launch by 2025 will operate on gm s new ultium battery platform the gmc hummer ev pickup that will be launched later this year has battery technology that s two generations beyond the batteries being recalled flores said but i am not downplaying it if they bought these vehicles brand new they expect to not have a problem with the batteries and we re working as fast as we can to fix it seven bolts burn in november gm issued the first recall on all the 68 000 2017 19 model year bolts because the vehicles potentially posed a fire risk gm said at the time the batteries in five vehicles caught fire and injured two people with smoke inhalation according to gm s initial investigation the five bolts all had the high voltage batteries made by lg chem s ochang south korea facility another commonality among the five vehicles was they were at full charge or right below that when they caught fire gm warned owners of those vehicles that until dealers can make a software fix the owners should reset their batteries to a maximum of 90 charge to lessen the risk of the car catching fire if they cannot do that gm advised owners to keep their parked cars away from their garage or carport by april gm engineers said they d figured out how to fix the battery problem they developed diagnostic software to look for anomalies in the batteries if problems are found the company will replace faulty parts of the battery the software was available to the bolt owners by the end of may but since that first recall there have been two more bolt fires earlier this month gm again warned owners of the same bolt evs not to park the vehicles in the garage one of the fires we can confirm was a battery fire flores said it was in vermont and we confirmed that the fire was battery related and that customer did have the recall software performed and did everything he was supposed to do the 2019 bolt that caught fire belonged to vermont state rep tim briglin the associated press reported he drove it to work and back home on june 30 depleting the battery to around 10 of its range he plugged it into a 240 volt outdoor charger that evening and left the bolt in his driveway around 6 30 a m the next day briglin saw smoke coming from the rear of the car and called the fire department only some nearby plants were damaged the other ev that caught fire was in new jersey gm could not confirm the cause of that fire because the bolt was on a flatbed truck which was later stolen that bolt has not been found gm safety recommendations the existing software fix gm performed on the bolts during the first recall has been largely successful flores said but not fully effective to eliminate fire risk since there was at least one more fire related to the battery we don t want any more fires we don t want customers to have to deal with this flores said we don t have the specific fix determined yet but if you do a b and c we believe you re effectively reducing the risk of a fire by a b and c he means return the vehicle to the 90 state of charge limitation using hilltop reserve mode for 2017 18 model years or target charge level mode for 2019 model year charge the vehicle after each use and avoid depleting the battery below 70 miles of remaining range park the vehicle outside immediately after charging and do not leave the vehicle charging overnight customers who have not received the advanced diagnostics software should visit their dealer to get the update after obtaining the software limit the state of charge to 90 and follow the advice above the arizona woman said she is following all the recommendations but the charging restrictions add to her stress you can only charge it up to 90 and not go below 70 miles which limits my mileage she said if i go to work and then want to visit family afterward i burn through that charge in a day and gm s argument that the recalls won t damage its future ev customer base because of new and different battery technology falls flat with gordon that s like boeing saying don t worry about our 737 crashing because our dreamliner will be different gordon said the perception is bad and you ve got to turn that around you don t do that by saying our new ones are a different technology you always thought every technology would work the arizona woman said she and her mother have worked full on since june 13 to get a call back from gm finally on july 28 her mother called gm customer care who then patched her to the third party claims processor and to speak to a claims agent the women sent in all the required paperwork the agent requested that day but she still has not received a resolution the arizona woman said i always want to be electric i know chevy is coming out with more electric cars but it s tough going back to them after dealing with all of this gm s flores said if a customer has an issue they should call the chevrolet ev concierge 833 evchevy which is available 8 a m 12 a

the start to 2021 was phenomenal for this pot stock the future looks even brighter u s cannabis stocks had an outstanding 2020 thanks to the marijuana boom amid the pandemic the ramp up of state legalization is aiding sales this year as well against this backdrop massachusetts based curaleaf holdings curlf 0 96 has been my top cannabis pick it has performed consistently well in its last few quarters achieving triple digit revenue growth and positive earnings before interest tax depreciation and amortization ebitda that many of its canadian counterparts are struggling to achieve it is set to report its results from the second quarter ended june 30 on aug 9 investors expect to see another good quarter from this company curaleaf s smart and timely acquisitions have led to its quality performance let s take a look at what the company has been up to since its last earnings report and what lies ahead curaleaf had an exceptional start to 2021 i won t be surprised if curaleaf turns in another great quarter it completed many acquisitions in 2020 that included cannabis manufacturers and dispensaries across the nation such as curaleaf nj arrow meot remedy blue kudu and alternative therapies group few of them contributed to its first quarter performance its revenue grew 170 year over year to 260 million its retail revenue grew 231 to 188 million driven by organic growth in its existing stores and contributions from six new stores across florida maine and pennsylvania the company also credited arizona for a spurt of revenue in the quarter the state legalized recreational cannabis in january curaleaf s select brand a cannabis oil brand that it acquired from cura partners in february for 948 8 million led to a 254 jump in wholesale revenue to 72 million from the year ago period the other acquisitions have yet to show their full potential this drastic revenue jump led to another quarter of positive ebitda of 63 million a 213 year over year increase consistent positive ebitda is also a sign that the company is handling its operating expenses well which is evident from its dip in selling general and administrative expenses minus non recurring items which fell to 29 of total revenue from 36 in the year ago period what has curaleaf been up to since its last earnings release after starting 2021 with a bang the company has been keeping busy expanding to hot and upcoming cannabis markets on june 24 the company opened its second store in new jersey it holds a total of three licenses in the state and expects to open a third store by late summer new jersey legalized recreational cannabis in february but retail sales there won t begin until 2022 according to the company its second cultivation facility in the state is now fully operational and is prepared for both the current medical cannabis and the upcoming recreational markets curaleaf also has a robust market in arizona with eight dispensaries and nine licenses in march new york legalized recreational marijuana but retail sales won t begin for a year or two curaleaf already has a footing in the new york medical cannabis market with four operating dispensaries new york new jersey and arizona could be three strong markets that could do wonders for the company s financials in 2022 and beyond curaleaf stated in its q1 earnings call that it expects to earn about 2 1 billion and 5 billion in sales respectively from new jersey and new york each year curaleaf is also expanding internationally it is targeting the german medical cannabis market which is europe s largest medical cannabis market and could be worth 2 1 billion by 2025 according to the company in may curaleaf launched its medical cannabis products including a high thc oil product in germany there is more upside to this pot stock acquisitions have been a driving factor for curaleaf s revenue and ebitda growth in may it acquired colorado based los sueños farms and its related entities allowing it access to the largest outdoor cannabis cultivation facilities in the country this facility will give curaleaf 66 acres of cultivation capacity with smart acquisitions and expansion plans curaleaf is more than prepared to become one of the top contenders in the u s cannabis space it is also on track to achieve its full year revenue target of 1 2 billion to 1 3 billion the company s target of achieving positive net income and positive operating cash flows in the back half of 2021 also seems possible to me wall street analysts recommend this stock as a buy and i strongly agree curaleaf has a strong market presence with a total of 108 dispensaries 22 cultivation sites and 30 processing sites in 23 u s states it holds 32 additional licenses to expand and strengthen its roots nationally even with a limited legal market in the u s curaleaf s stock has soared 103 over the last three years compared to the s p 500 s gain of about 64 federal marijuana legalization would just be the icing on the cake for this pot stock analysts expect an 87 upside for its share price over the next 12 months which i think is entirely possible with outstanding revenue numbers positive ebitda and rapid expansion curaleaf is closer to profitability than ever that s why this is a cannabis stock to buy and hold for the long term
i wrote this spicy little number after 23 years i m committed to being single a few days ago in the wake of a week of being treated not ideally lest we revisit the past i ll sum it up for you for something i wrote when i was angry i didn t think it was my worst piece though the subtitle was a tad dramatic i wouldn t submit it to a literary magazine but i used my writing to serve a purpose as i wrote i could imagine the icky feelings oozing out through my fingers writing is cathartic for me and as much as i love my dedicated readers and i do try my best to produce writing you can stomach i write first and foremost for myself i ve since been informed i came across as angrily single which i thought was an informative perception a reader also said i cam across as someone that considered herself above average and knowledgeable that s not the worst criticism i ve ever received and i would say that s just how i write it s my tone of voice my groove my writing style i didn t and don t claim to be knowledgeable about much but what i studied in school so physiology and cell biology etc who needs it but i do have a lot of experiences that allow me to generalize the ways in which men are socialized to treat women you can get on your notallmen pedestal all day but i won t be tuning in this same person also pointed out that i seem frustrated for only being 23 would you like a list of things life has thrown at me this isn t a competition my emotions are valid and so are yours i do respect my reader s comments even if i don t agree with them and i appreciate the lessons i can learn from them and the creative spark they can give me in that spirit i wanted to explore the intricacies of being single a little further in writing bedazzled with questions for thought or journaling don t like ads become a supporter and enjoy the good men project ad free what can being on our own mean and how do we use singledom to our advantage alone together an average of 50 2 of american adults are single so you can bet that being single means different things to different people you haven t found the person or people for you yet you re tired of looking you re focusing on your career or another aspect of your life you re working on yourself you prefer not to have a romantic partner we all have different reasons for not having someone to wake up next to they re all valid and they usually come with some complex emotions in my limited experience you may not experience complex emotions around being single day to day but loneliness sadness anger and feeling left out can become time to time visitors for some of us let s explore singledom as an opportunity this can be challenging on days we feel lonely resentful or discouraged emotions tend to pass but we re stuck with ourselves as someone that enjoys solitude and her own company here are a few of the ways i ve used my increased alone time singledom as a way to support myself none of these are exclusive to people who currently don t have a partner they are simply benefits i ve enjoyed from being single self reflection i tend to self reflect by journaling taking walks or meditating and it s a useful tool in the months after a breakup when the heat of the emotions has begun to fade i like to ask myself how can i grow from my last relationship what did i learn what could i have done better what will i not put up with in the future did i navigate conflict with compassion did i approach conflict as a team sport i apply these questions in my every day interactions as well and reflecting on my own actions in this way pushes me to examine my own intentions behind my actions and pushes me to grow towards what is healthy for me and out of harmful patterns of behavior opportunity to find fulfillment in other relationships we place a lot of stock as a society in romantic relationships i get it when we find a partner they become many things to us a best friend a confidant part of our family the person who watches trash tv with us the one who loves us even when we steal all of the covers i don t think this is exclusive to being single but i ve been personally able to create more space for my friendships and family relationships without so much intense focus on another person no one can be everything to you when one door opens another door closes a lot of doors have been closing been purposefully closed by me recently and the space left by what we leave behind can be daunting when all we re left with is ourselves we have time to make new friendships find events near us on facebook or meetup date casually or take up a new hobby some of the things i ve found more time for include writing reading painting walks gardening you are the center of your own life now you re in charge of what door is opening next what s something you ve always wanted to do but never had time for let those dreams soar finding joy in little moments or big moments make a massive breakfast for yourself on saturdays and eat it while watching reruns of your favorite show clean the house so hard paint travel go on that hike cook walk around wearing whatever you want don t shower for 3 days do what brings you joy play music all of the time and drink copious amounts of your favorite tea the only one calling the shots is you find beauty everywhere you can do this with family friends and with a romantic partner if you re single make yourself feel special by bringing this practice into your life pick those flowers for yourself watch the sunset with yourself it s a learned skill to find the beauty in every moment especially when we don t have someone to share that beauty with it s just as beautiful when you re capturing all of those moments with yourself and it s okay if complex emotions arise around not having someone there prioritizing your relationship with yourself we are often taught to put others first there is nothing wrong with this selfless way of thinking except when we begin to sacrifice bits of ourselves don t like ads become a supporter and enjoy the good men project ad free reclaim your time reclaim your desires and needs make a list of what you want out of life of what is non negotiable for you meditate every day become comfortable getting to know yourself again so many people can t stand to be alone with themselves go explore the places of yourself you may be hiding from and love them people use the phrase so and so person knows me better than i know myself very commonly know yourself best learn to listen to your soul and your body what will serve you today in what ways would you like to get to know yourself better where do you see yourself in six months the strongest anchor you have is yourself and as you grow your network of of people and perhaps find a partner again you can remain rooted in the joy of who you are final thoughts flying solo can be a fantastic opportunity to get to know yourself better i spent a few years mindlessly hopping from partner to partner and i m so proud of how far i ve come in my relationship with myself i can t wait to see the progress i ll continue to make we re all works in progress and we always will be no matter our relationship status finding happiness as a single human builds a strong foundation for a future relationship if you d like that my mom always said it takes two happy individuals to make a happy partnership i personally agree wholeheartedly thanks for reading support a creator here this post was previously published on medium com

q we have a pair of 1950s bathroom sinks we re looking to replace one hot water handle which is stripped our plumber tells us the replacement part is unavailable he also tells us that because of the age of the sink the entire faucet can t be replaced because of its size and that we ll need to buy two new sinks and new faucets we like the retro look can you help also a couple of small pieces in the corner of the tile floor are missing how can we find replacements a it shouldn t be necessary to replace two vintage sinks that appear to be in great condition just to fix one faucet handle but unfortunately it s not as easy as it should be because unseen but critical details aren t consistent from manufacturer to manufacturer or even within any one manufacturer s product line you don t say exactly what s stripped on the damaged handle but it s probably the gear type detailing that links the broach the top of the stem on the hot water valve to the lever handle with the help of a marker to keep track count how many pointed ridges the broach has because any replacement handle will need to match in plumbing lingo these ridges are called splines or points according to a chart on the website bonnetsandstems com various manufacturers use four to 38 points on their handles and a few use oval or d shapes rather than points a customer service representative for bonnets stems and accessories the store in tucson ariz which runs the website looked at the picture you sent and said he thinks your faucets were made by american standard which has manufactured faucets with four 16 and 22 points the store generally carries american standard lever handles but is out of stock he said the website faucetpartsplus com however shows a 22 point american standard lever handle that looks very much like yours and a customer service representative there said he too thinks your faucet is that brand a single handle part no 464126 is listed at 13 99 or you could buy a pair for 19 99 part no as1190pr if your faucet doesn t have 22 points per broach or if you re not sure whether those handles will fit you might want to shop in person at a well stocked hardware or plumbing supply company near you this will be especially helpful if you need to get a handle that isn t necessarily from the same manufacturer as your faucet because you can take along the hot water lever from the other sink or even the cold water one from the faucet you re trying to repair then before you buy you can ensure they match and check whether the screw threads holding the handle to the faucet are the same you might need to buy four handles so everything matches but check the return policy in case it s smarter to ensure that one fits before buying them all if you can t find handles that fit your faucet try getting a kit designed to adapt to a variety of faucet styles ace hardware for example sells a decorative lever handle in chrome and white porcelain for 19 99 in a kit that includes parts such as spacers and bushings which allows for customization to fit most faucets another approach is to shop at stores that specialize in used building materials like habitat for humanity s restores prices at these stores are such that if you find a full faucet assembly with handles that work it might cost less than buying four handles at a store that sells only new components if you can t find anything either new or used that is suitable ask for recommendations among friends or neighbors with midcentury houses that haven t been updated plumbing supply companies that cater to professionals sell a variety of adapters so a pro who likes preserving old pieces may come up with a solution if all else fails a new plumber could probably figure out how to install new stems or even a new faucet or two if you want them to match it s not clear what detail of the existing faucet made the original plumber declare that replacement isn t possible but at a minimum before you opt for what he suggested ask him to be specific certainly not all bathroom faucets from the 1950s have features that are impossible to get in faucets made today the website retrorenovation com says that kohler s triton bathroom faucets were introduced in 1941 they are still sold today if the faucet holes in your sink are 4 inches between center points the kohler triton bowe faucet with lever handles 120 11 at build com could be a good substitute this model doesn t have a pop up to control the sink drain however as for the missing tiles finding an exact match for the olive green and orange in your bathroom might be impossible but if you shop for a used faucet at stores selling used building materials check the tile displays too rather than finding a perfect match you might need to settle for finding pieces that are the sizes you need or that can be cut to fit then use paint to get them as close as possible to the right colors scuff up the tiles first with 100 grit sandpaper and wipe clean brush on a bonding primer let that dry then apply two coats of paint because the missing pieces are in a corner paint should stand up fine
washington u s employers added 943 000 jobs in july and drove the unemployment rate down to 5 4 in another sign that the economy is bouncing back with surprising vigor from covid 19 but there is growing fear that the fast spreading delta variant will set back the recovery the worry is that the resurgent virus could discourage people from going out and spending and trigger another round of shutdowns or other restrictions the data was collected in the first half of the month before variant related cases exploded in many parts of the country that is a definite downside risk said rubeela farooqi chief u s economist at high frequency economics the risk is from a more cautious consumer if they don t want to engage in outside activities you re also hearing about big companies that are delaying a return to work that might be something that slows things down the labor department collected its data for friday s report in mid july before the centers for disease control and prevention last week reversed course and recommended that even vaccinated people resume wearing masks indoors in places where the variant is pushing infections up still the july numbers looked good they exceeded economists forecast of more than 860 000 new jobs encouraged by their prospects 261 000 americans returned to the job market in july and the unemployment rate fell from 5 9 in june moreover the report found that as customers return and businesses scramble to find workers they are raising wages average hourly earnings were up 4 last month from a year earlier the labor department also revised its jobs numbers for may and june adding 119 000 jobs roughly two thirds of the overall increase in july payrolls was because of job gains in local education and leisure and hospitality other notable payroll gains were in health services transportation and warehousing and business services the stock market rose modestly on the news the dow jones industrial average climbed 0 4 and the s p 500 0 2 both reaching all time highs the economy lost more than 22 million jobs in march and april 2020 in a practically overnight recession as the coronavirus forced businesses to shut down and people to stay home since then the u s has recovered nearly 17 million jobs meaning it is still almost 6 million short americans classified as long term unemployed or those who have been unemployed for 27 weeks or more declined by 560 000 in july the biggest drop on record if the pace of hiring over the last three months continues all jobs lost due to the pandemic would be regained in seven months leslie preston senior economist at td economics wrote in a research report however the pace is likely to cool a bit and the risk of the delta variant looms the unexpectedly strong numbers come at a critical moment for president joe biden s agenda with the senate set to take up a 1 trillion infrastructure bill this weekend before moving on to a more than 3 trillion expansion of the social safety net pushed by democrats biden said the jobs report validates his efforts to stabilize the economy and slow the spread of the virus and he encouraged lawmakers to pass the rest of his agenda the bottom line is this what we re doing is working biden said adding we ve got a lot of hard work left to be done even so a stronger labor recovery could spur lawmakers to pare back biden s long term proposal for trillions of dollars toward child care education and other social measures virus surge the u s is seeing an average of more than 98 000 new coronavirus cases per day up from fewer than 12 000 a day in late june though still well below the peak of 250 000 reached in january the vast majority of new cases are among people who have not gotten vaccinated over the past week a growing number of state and local governments and major employers have made masks and vaccinations mandatory in a move that could help beat back the virus and protect the economy a failure to contain the surge could lead to more closings and cancellations of various events and prompt schools to roll back plans to reopen making it difficult for many parents to go back to work the next 10 to 14 days are going to be critical to try to get it under control said labor secretary marty walsh we need to get more people vaccinated where there are mask mandates in place we need to follow that he added it s really important that we take this seriously so we don t get into a situation where we have to go into shutting down parts of our country july s job figures mark a big step toward the fed s goal of substantial further progress in the labor market recovery fed officials including chairman jerome powell and gov lael brainard have indicated the labor market recovery had some way to go before the central bank could begin tapering asset purchases a lot of unknowns farooqi said she is optimistic that the job rebound can continue despite the variant but she is holding off on her forecast for august because there are a lot of unknowns right now some businesses blame federal unemployment benefits including an extra 300 a week tacked on to regular state jobless aid for discouraging americans from seeking work in response many states have dropped the federal assistance even before it is scheduled to expire sept 6 walmart is offering up to 5 more per hour to many warehouse employees as it

washington d c a 1 trillion infrastructure bill under debate by the u s senate includes a provision mandating the installation in autos of a technology for preventing intoxicated drivers from starting their vehicles in a bid to prevent more than 10 000 deaths per year for over 15 years automakers and government agencies have researched technologies for preventing the roughly one third of annual national traffic deaths involving impaired drivers this legislative effort has gained support from advocacy group mothers against drunk driving the auto insurance industry and some alcohol trade associations in its study the insurance institute for highway safety iihs said alcohol detection systems that prevent impaired driving could save over 9 000 lives annually noting that u s police departments arrest some 1 million people per year for driving drunk related deaths cost the country some 44 billion in economic harm and 210 billion in social costs according to a 2010 study in 2019 lawmakers told reuters that auto manufacturers could install touch devices on steering wheels and engine start buttons that can measure drivers blood alcohol levels or install sensors that can passively monitor drivers breath or eye movements the bill would require the u s transportation department to establish a technology safety standard within three years the bill does not specify the technology to be adopted but stressed it must passively monitor drivers performances and accurately identify whether they are impaired the national highway traffic safety administration and automakers have researched one system that samples a driver s breathing while another technology measures blood alcohol level by shining an infrared light through the driver s fingertip however questions remain about the accuracy of these technologies and their suitability for widespread adoption

safe there just does not seem to be any reason why mexico had suddenly gone on the red list it is a bit like the decision to stop people travelling to france by making them isolate when they came back

summer after officials waited until last week to ask the eu to accept the nhs vaccine passport app uk diplomats in brussels have been briefing for weeks that both sides were edging closer to a deal but senior european commission sources said that britain only formally applied for the app to be recognised across the 27 member bloc on july 28 it should take a few weeks for the process to be completed but i have no crystal ball said one eu official a british government spokesman refused to deny the july 28 date eu certificates are not automatically available to uk nationals due to brexit a deal with the eu executive would legally oblige all 27 eu countries to recognise the nhs covid app with britain accepting the eu s digital covid certificate in return the uk government said there were constructive technical talks between our experts and the eu before the application advertisement the cost of a flight back to britain was being sold for between 2 000 and 4 000 yesterday as many tried to beat the deadline there are between 5 000 and 6 000 british holidaymakers in mexico currently in a further blow the cost of hotel quarantine will increase from august 12 with the price for single adult travellers rising from 1 750 to 2 285 and a second adult paying 1 430 more than double the current rate of 650 one couple have been forced to cut their honeymoon from two weeks to two days student joe coward 29 said we feel incredibly sad and frustrated that the time that should ve been spent enjoying being newlyweds has been ruined nhs worker ayo faley 24 also only discovered she had just three days left to return home to avoid quarantine after landing in cancun yesterday she said she was absolutely distraught but plans to complete her holiday she asked how are planning to help individuals who have found themselves in a situation like this claire 30 from south london said i had access to the wifi so i found out in mid air i just wanted to grab the tannoy and tell everyone because i could see all these families looking forward to their holiday and it was obvious they didn t know it s crazy the lack of notice i had no inkling mexico was about to go on the red list another tweeted landing in mexico to find out it s been added to the red list whilst i was up in the air has got to be one of the worst things i ve ever experienced father of two david hing 40 arrived in mexico with his wife and children aged four and seven on july 31 they were supposed to stay until august 21 five days before the travel list is looked at again mr hing told mailonline we knew the risks and while at the moment it seems like a bad dream and is very stressful and i ve been up all night looking at alternative options we are just going to try to enjoy the holiday it broke my heart when my two little ones said they wanted to stay on holiday and would lend us money if we needed it the notice period doesn t really give long enough to make changes especially when it s hard to get through and talk to anyone at the airlines the slog back home grant shapps said up to 6 000 britons are currently in mexico after ministers warned they would place the country onto its travel red list at 4am on sunday those who have received both doses have unrestricted entry meaning they do not have to quarantine or provide a negative test result when travelling to germany france spain latvia romania and georgia but those who are not double jabbed are still subject to some regulations upon arrival and in the cases of germany and slovakia can be denied entry the price of the only direct flight from mexico city to london before mexico moves to the red list has soared to a staggering 6 878 the images of the food and hotels do not seem like they are worth the cost so that s why we are going to try and fly back somewhere else first i feel sorry for the people who were already on the flight from the uk and hope they can make alternative arrangements a young couple cut short their honeymoon in mexico from two weeks to two days after they discovered the new restrictions upon landing in mexico early on thursday morning joe coward 29 said basically we touched down to find that our two week honeymoon which had already been rearranged several times was going to be a two day visit we ve arranged a flight for tomorrow and will be spending today getting ready to turn right around and go home mexico is in the grip of a third wave of covid and on wednesday another 611 deaths were reported taking the total number of deaths due to the virus to 242 547 another 611 deaths were also reported and the country has recorded a total of 2 901 094 infections and 242 547 deaths the government has said the real number of cases is likely significantly higher and separate data published recently suggested the actual death toll is at least 60 above the confirmed figure seven european countries austria germany latvia norway romania slovenia and slovakia will turn green from sunday 4am india bahrain qatar and the united arab emirates will switch from red to amber meaning arrivals from those countries will no longer have to spend 11 nights at pricey quarantine hotels but mexico georgia and the french overseas territories of la reunion and mayotte are joining the red list up to 6 000 brits are on holiday in mexico and now scrambling to get back this weekend to avoid quarantine hotels with not enough seats to get them home hotel quarantine costs are to soar to more than 200 a night from a week today from next thursday the price will jump to 2 285 for a single person additional adults and teenagers will be charged 1 430 more than double the current 650 rate the decision to place mexico on the red list also reflects worries about a new variant which originated in colombia and which has concerned british scientists passengers arriving from mexico city at heathrow terminal 5 today slammed the new rules leidy corrales 35 a dental assistant who was travelling back to switzerland from playa de carmen in mexico said i m travelling back to geneva with my two children joshua and carla and my husband putting mexico on the red list is not logical because when you go there everything is normal they are taking all the same protections masks hand sanitisation and social distancing the quarantine costs are just unreasonable i think when people go on holiday they should just have to do two tests and only quarantine if it s positive mexico is a tourist hotspot and people here like going to hot places but the government doesn t want people to go on holiday they want to control them it s like a dictatorship of security in a democracy because they keep changing the rules and no one can afford that her husband denys added we re so happy to have been able to enjoy our holiday without having to pay for a hotel on the way back thank god changing travel rules what you need to know there have been more changes to the rules for international travel with some popular destinations climbing the ladder to the green list and others sliding down on to the red the government has also hiked the price of hotel quarantine meaning a trip to a red list country is a pricey affair here is the state of play for your summer holidays is there any good news seven countries will be added to england s green travel list from 4am on sunday the government announced on wednesday anyone returning from germany austria slovenia slovakia latvia romania and norway will no longer need to quarantine on arrival france has also lost its confusing amber plus status which meant all travellers and not just those who are not fully vaccinated had to self isolate for 10 days upon return our nearest neighbour had been in a category all by itself because of concerning levels of the beta variant of covid 19 there is that it sadly yes but it just got slightly easier to visit india bahrain qatar and the united arab emirates as they have been downgraded from the red to the amber list meaning arrivals will no longer have to spend 11 nights in a quarantine hotel there are currently 24 countries on the green list including the popular holiday destinations of barbados croatia and malta unfortunately 16 of these are on the green watch list meaning they could be suddenly be shunted up to amber australia and new zealand are both unambiguously green unfortunately neither are welcoming british travellers at the moment has anyone joined the red list yes mexico georgia and the french overseas territories of la reunion and mayotte are joining the red list if you have a holiday to one of those destinations already booked and want to press ahead bear in mind the cost for solo travellers in a quarantine hotel in england will be ramped up from 1 750 to 2 285 from august 12 the charge for an additional adult sharing a room will more than double from 650 to 1 430 to better reflect the increased costs involved the government said is my trip to spain safe there were fears in the travel industry that spain the most popular overseas destination for uk holidaymakers could be added to england s red list the government announced it would keep its amber status but urged travellers arriving in the uk from spain to take a pcr test for the mandatory pre departure test as a precaution against the increased prevalence of the virus and variants in the country many travellers have been relying on the cheaper lateral flow test kits which are less reliable than pcrs things keep changing what do i have to do when i get home again there are different rules for countries on the red amber and green lists that also differ according to a traveller s vaccination status passengers to england returning from a red list country must have proof of a negative covid 19 test before departure and must book a hotel quarantine package including two covid 19 tests even if they have had both jabs they must also complete a passenger locator form if you have come from an amber list country you need proof of a negative test before travel and those who are not fully vaccinated must self isolate 10 days upon arrival and take a pcr test on day two and day eight you might be able to get out of quarantine early if you pay for a private pcr test to be taken on day five under the test to release scheme those with two vaccines only need to take a pcr test on day two of their arrival and can skip self isolation the same rules apply to those who are under the age of 18 regardless of their vaccination status anyone returning from a green list country need only have proof of a negative covid 19 test before travel fill in a passenger locator form and take a test on day two after arrival do these changes apply elsewhere in the uk the devolved nations have control over their own amber red and green lists of countries as well as the rules around quarantine upon return and the recent changes have attracted criticism from some quarters the welsh government is still advising against all but essential travel abroad and those who have been to a red list country cannot even enter until they have completed 10 days of quarantine in england or scotland first in a statement a spokesman for the welsh government said we have long called for a clearer system of rules regarding international travel the ad hoc nature of the decisions made by the uk government on the issue does little to instil confidence or provide clarity for travellers we continue to advise against all but essential travel abroad because of the continuing risk of infection including with new variants of coronavirus which may not respond to our vaccines we will consider the latest changes announced by the uk government advertisement amy perez 39 a marketing director from putney south west london who has been travelling around mexico with her family said it s inconvenient and expensive and there seems to be an entire industry surrounding covid testing we were on holiday for two weeks and are really chuffed that we don t have to quarantine for 10 days we would have been locked up in a hotel with these two little monsters maxi 18 months and emilia who just turned four yesterday her husband jorge said the government wants people to get vaccinated but then people don t see the benefits it would have made more sense for us to take the fine rather than shell out thousands of pounds not be able to work and be locked up with our children alejandro seama 42 a filmmaker from london said i think it s terrible and stupid because it seems they just want rich people to be able travel look at my dad he s 72 he s been double vaccinated he s absolutely fine but for some reason they don t accept his vaccines here i had to spend 600 on mandatory covid tests just to get my parents here if the rules had already changed they would not have been able to visit and i would have never left i had no clue that mexico was going on the red list but thank god we came back today returning from mexico after the deadline will see britons face a steep hotel quarantine bill after the government raised the price to reflect increased costs involved a single person will have to stump up 2 285 from next thursday during their isolation while additional adults and teenagers will be charged 1 430 more than double the current 650 rate the price for children aged five to 12 will remain at 325 while under fives will continue to stay for free it means that for a family of four with two teenage children the cost will jump from 3 700 to a staggering 6 575 a rise of 78 per cent mr coward said if the couple do not receive a refund from british airways for their holiday based near cancun they will be several thousand pounds out of pocket he said staying is not an option due to the cost of quarantine hotels which from august 12 will rise to 2 285 for a solo traveller plus an extra 1 430 for additional adults sharing a room ayo faley a call handler for nhs test and trace in london also landed in cancun on thursday morning but she plans to stay for her holiday as planned and pay for quarantine she is returning on august 11 so will pay the lower rate of 1 750 but said she is absolutely distraught the 24 year old said i only found out travel restrictions had changed the minute i was able to connect to wifi at the airport i went into a state of panic i tried to locate other brits and see whether they knew and what their next plan of action was you could see the look of confusion fear and regret all in their faces i am absolutely distraught i ve decided to just stay and enjoy the time here i ll just have to face the consequences when i arrive ms faley works from home and had planned to do so on her return from cancun but said she will not be able to access her equipment in quarantine she added how are the government planning to help individuals who have found themselves in a situation like this leaving the uk thinking their country of destination was safe to then land and find out they better return asap or risk being stuck in a hotel for 11 days aaron who did not wish to share his second name is relocating his family to edinburgh in late august and will now have to pay for them all to quarantine on arrival the 43 year old arrived in mexico in early july to witness the birth of his son aviv and his wife who is from sinaloa had her uk visa approved on july 28 aviv was due to be born july by c section but they brought the date forward so i arrived in the airport at 3am and just made it to the hospital before my wife went to surgery aaron told pa aaron is a self employed data and audiovisual engineer and said he can t quantify how much quarantining will cost his business i have previously taken out a bounce back loan to keep my business afloat he added i have no idea why i should have to pay to isolate in a hotel when i ve had both astrazeneca vaccinations in edinburgh proof of vaccination took a test on my way here and will take one on arrival in scotland james dean 38 from bournemouth had already spent 8 000 on a fortnight in cancun with wife rebecca and their four children lilly 16 jack 13 isabella nine and fred six the office manager told the mirror that has just shocked me i m gutted to be honest i m going have to pay for us all to go in to quarantine as well i m still digesting it i m just gobsmacked john soones 62 from south west london was travelling to mexico with his wife and their 18 year old daughter he said it s just incredible it s terrible to get no notice that this is likely to happen and no time to change plans in more positive news it was announced that double jabbed tourists returning from france will be spared quarantine from sunday and seven european countries including germany and norway were added to the green list of destinations spain has also been spared being given red status potentially forcing thousands into 2 285 a stay quarantine hotels but the government is urging travellers to take a pcr test before they fly home from the iberian country grant shapps said today that people can travel without looking over their shoulders for the next three weeks as countries will not move lists unless something exceptional and unexpected happens but the transport secretary added that full vaccination for travel will be a feature for britons forever more and admitted that countries could turn red again by the end of the month tens of thousands more britons are now expected to head to france for august although tourism chiefs have warned millions more frenchmen are staying in the country this summer so there is serious a lack of accommodation if the traveller is without a second home there is a particular shortage of gites camp sites and hotel rooms in the south of the country especially near beach resorts such as biarritz narbonne île de ré and saint tropez while experts have said there are much larger numbers of tourists from holland belgium and germany in the country this year austria germany latvia norway romania slovenia and slovakia will all move to the quarantine free tier at the end of the weekend in a huge boost for those looking to book a late summer getaway on the continent but while there is no quarantine people will still have to take a negative test before returning and a pcr test on day two back in the uk meanwhile the status of india bahrain qatar and the united arab emirates will switch from red to amber meaning arrivals from those countries will no longer have to spend 11 nights at pricey quarantine hotels while spain avoided joining them those flying back will soon face higher testing costs after ministers urged holidaymakers to take a pcr for the mandatory pre departure test rather than the cheaper lateral flow alternatives as a precaution against the increased prevalence of the virus and variants in the country queues at st pancras international this morning as france was opened up both ways for british tourists and people jumped on the eurostar not wearing a face mask on the tube should be a criminal offence says sadiq khan sadiq khan has said that failing to wear a face mask on the tube should become a criminal offence the london mayor has been pushing the the government to allow transport for london tfl to impose a by law requiring face coverings on the capital s transport network since the easing of restrictions on july 19 freedom day passengers have only been required to wear a covering as a condition of carriage rather than a legal requirement this means tfl staff can tell non compliant customers to leave a bus or train but are powerless to impose fines but mr khan now wants a bye law put in place to effectively bring back the rule that was dropped on july 19 the rule change would also mean british transport police officers could be used to enforce it speaking to the bbc s newscast podcast mr khan said we are trying to lobby the government to allow us to bring in a bye law so it will be the law again so we can issue fixed penalty notices and we can use the police service and btp to enforce this advertisement with the guidance being advice rather than law many travellers may feel entitled to refuse to take the gold standard test which can cost as much as 175 per person french tourism chiefs have welcomed the news that britons can more freely come and go from sunday especially because britons are by far the biggest spenders in the country but only around ten per cent of the usual number of uk tourists are in the country this summer but in the past month mr macron has enforced a high alert covid 19 level hit in 37 departments in france because of rising cases of the delta variant and increasingly busy hospitals in occitanie in south west france a white alert has been imposed meaning medics on holiday can be forced to return to work because of increasingly packed covid wards changes to the traffic light system are a positive step forward but the government needs to make faster progress in opening up international travel industry experts have warned four countries are being removed from england s red list as part of the latest update to the international travel system while seven more including germany are being added to the green list it has also been confirmed that arrivals from france will no longer need to self isolate aligning the nation with other countries on the amber list from which arrivals only need to quarantine at home if they are not fully vaccinated scotland and northern ireland have followed england in introducing the same travel relaxations however the changes have attracted criticism from the welsh government which has continued to advise against all but essential travel confirmation that france is joining the amber list is positive especially during the critical school holiday period said mark tanzer head of abta the travel association but he warned the government is failing to capitalise fully on the success of the vaccine rollout with a very cautious approach to the green list and failure to relax restrictions on travel including requirements for multiple tests even when visiting low risk destinations karen dee chief executive of the airport operators association said the extension of the green list is a positive step forward but warned that the uk remains a long way off a full and meaningful restart of international travel tim alderslade boss of airlines uk the industry body representing uk registered carriers described the announcement as another missed opportunity covid cases in the uk and france look set to pass each other in the coming days as a wave of delta cases in britain drops while it is on the rise across the channel he added that the travel industry has not had anything like the reopening it was hoping for meanwhile rory boland travel editor at which welcomed the addition of more green list countries but warned that the constant chopping and changing would cause further disruption for many the cost for travellers can be significant he said some holidaymakers whose countries have now been placed in the red category will find that their airline or tour operator is unwilling to give them a refund other providers won t refund or even facilitate rebooking if a country is moved from green to amber paul charles chief executive of travel consultancy the pc agency said while there s some welcome progress the government is still being too cautious at a time when they should be opening up travel faster to help the sector s recovery johan lundgren chief executive of easyjet said now summer is fully under way this provides some reassurance to consumers by keeping the status quo for key holiday destinations as well as adding some green list destinations for last minute bookers where there are still great flight and holiday deals available but we remain disappointed at the double standards applied to travel versus the domestic economy with infection rates remaining lower in much of europe and the high vaccination levels in the uk if not now it is hard to know when the time is for much of europe to genuinely turn green and government urgently needs to tackle this expensive testing regime which is adding unnecessary cost especially for the fully vaccinated no one wants to see flying become a preserve of the rich again particularly when so many need to get away or reunite after such a long time is pingdemic mayhem finally easing number of alerts sent by nhs covid app plunged by 43 last week and that was before software was tweaked the number of alerts given out by the nhs covid app fell by 43 per cent in a week before it was made less sensitive official data has shown nhs figures show 395 971 alerts in england and wales were sent in the seven days up to july 28 down from 690 129 the week before in a sign that pingdemic mayhem may finally be easing thousands of people have deleted the app in recent week to avoid the alerts which tell people they have been in close contact with someone who had tested positive for coronavirus the alerts have forced millions into self isolation across the country despite not testing positive themselves leading to chaos as supermarket shelves were left barren with workers having to stay home earlier this week it was announced that the app is being updated so fewer contacts will be instructed to isolate dr mike tildesley a member of the scientific pandemic influenza modelling group spi m advising ministers insisted the app is still incredibly useful despite the swathes of people being asked to isolate but the changes were made after the latest data suggesting another reason is behind the drastic fall in alerts britain s covid cases began falling on july 21 but did not reach the rate of the drop off in alerts until july 28 the last date included in the most recent data it comes after academics claimed britain s covid self isolation sentence could be halved to just five days and be as effective data suggests 98 per cent of transmission occurs either before people become ill or within five days of symptoms starting nhs figures show 395 971 alerts in england and wales were sent in the seven days up to july 28 down from 690 129 the week before the number of alerts given out by the nhs covid app fell by 43 per cent in a week before it was made less sensitive official data has shown the nhs data today showed the number of venue check ins made with the covid app dropped from 6 6million to 2 3million in the most recent week a drop off of 65 per cent people are no longer required to use the app to check into venues since restrictions were lifted on july 19 but the trend gives an indication in the fall in usage mike tildesley a member of the scientific pandemic influenza modelling group spi m advising ministers described the app as incredibly useful despite large numbers of people being asked to isolate earlier this week health and social care secretary sajid javid said the logic behind the app was tweaked although the sensitivity and risk threshold will remain unchanged instead of checking contacts for five days before a positive test the app will only go back two days dr tildesley told sky news i know there have been some challenges in terms of particularly at the moment the so called pingdemic but in terms of being able to detect contact it has been extremely valuable obviously the challenge with that is that a lot of people are going into isolation and over the last few days the app has been made less sensitive dr tildesley said there is a worry that if too many people are pinged fewer may be willing to comply but he added that the tweak will hopefully guarantee higher levels of compliance fresh data from oxford university s pathogen dynamics group shows up to 40 per cent of transmission occurs before symptoms emerge but most of this happens during the two days before people fall ill which prompted the alteration of how the nhs covid app works around 35 per cent of transmission occurs within the first two days of people having symptoms however the data came from september before the highly infectious delta variant took off oxford university data suggests 98 per cent of transmission occurs either before people become ill or within five days of symptoms starting ministers are keen to replace quarantine rules with daily testing with scientists now investigating if it is safe to make the drastic move dr muge cevik an infectious disease expert at the university of st andrews told the telegraph given most transmission happens very early on the isolation period could be much shorter for the cases viral load peaks pretty quickly so people are highly infectious within the first few days also importantly many people have non specific mild symptoms before developing more noticeable ones like fatigue or myalgia so that s probably when people are highly infectious too but continue daily activity so the current self isolation guidelines especially given the lack of support provided for sick leave does not serve for the purpose just 3 3 of brits returning from mexico last month had covid compared to 2 9 from spain which is 35 times more popular among tourists so why did one get slapped on red list and the other escaped 2 065 covid infected travellers arrived in england from spain last month 2 9 of arrivals latest figures show meanwhile just 64 people coming from mexico had the coronavirus between july 1 and 21 3 3 of arrivals and more passengers arriving in england from 12 other countries tested positive compared to mexico but ministers only added mexico to the travel red list it was announced last night microbiologist dr simon clarke told mailonline there is barely any difference between the two countries advertisement infection rates are only marginally higher among travellers returning to britain from mexico compared to spain raising questions about why it was moved to the red list official government figures also show spain which escaped any further sanctions is 35 times more popular for tourists meaning hundreds of covid cases are actually being imported from the holiday hotspot only dozens of infected people are flying back from mexico british holidaymakers are now scrambling to get back from mexico before strict hotel quarantine rules come into place on sunday the decision gave people just three days notice with some only discovering the news while mid air plane tickets allowing britons to make it back in time are on sale for up to 7 000 but spain which scientists say has a similar shaped outbreak stayed in the amber category despite rumours that the holiday plans of tens of thousands of brits were on the brink of ruin experts have now called on ministers to publish the full set of data to justify last night s decision to place mexico onto the red list with the rules set to kick in at 4am on august 8 the department for transport released a spreadsheet of key statistics used by ministers to inform their policies raising questions on why mexico was singled out for the red list meaning travellers have to isolate in a hotel when they arrive in england latest figures show 457 people per million tested positive in spain yesterday while just 122 tested positive in mexico graph left meanwhile positivity rates among travellers returning from mexico was only marginally higher than spain 3 3 per cent compared to 2 9 per cent graph top right but just 1 940 flew in from mexico while 71 418 arrived from spain which swayed the percentages graph bottom right some 2 065 arrivals from spain tested positive while the figure for mexico was just 64 the government agency says countries are assumed to be amber unless they have a low public health risk with small outbreaks and a low prevalence of variants such as beta on the other hand countries are put on the red list if their epidemics have spooked the joint biosecurity centre a branch that decides the travel quarantine rules under this methodology the jbc assesses the prevalence of variants in each territory nhs test and trace data which is used by civil servants to make the list decisions shows only six samples were sequenced from travellers returning from mexico three were either delta or alpha the others were not marked as being ones of concern almost all of the swabs analysed among britons coming back from spain were alpha or delta no beta infected samples were spotted but exact breakdowns of other variant data were suppressed the dft says the vast majority of data used to inform the risk assessment is in the public domain however some data cannot be published due to the privacy risks that disclosure may have on individuals or groups similarly privately shared data from other governments or organisations cannot be published due to the undertakings given when obtaining the data the jbc also carries out a deep dive on the prevalence of covid in each country looking at testing rates infection rates and sequencing ability spain s daily covid infections are significantly higher than mexico s with 457 people per million testing positive every day at present according to our world in data one of the covid tracking websites civil servants use to monitor outbreaks the rate is also dropping for comparison the figure is three times lower in mexico 122 but is rising quickly and spain is conducting about nearly 15 times more tests in proportion to the size of its population than mexico which has a test positivity rate of almost 40 per cent and has only fully vaccinated a fifth of all adults the european holiday destination which has three times higher vaccination rates is also sequencing around 1 000 tests a day in contrast mexico has genetically analysed only 18 000 covid samples since the pandemic began under the third part of any travel quarantine decision the jbc look at an array of data available from the world health organization nhs test and trace and other official sources the most up to date figures from nhs test and trace which only go up until july 21 show just 3 3 per cent of arrivals from mexico tested positive for covid for comparison the figure stood at 2 9 per cent in spain britain s most visited holiday destination but because of the popularity of spain 35 times fewer cases are actually being imported from mexico just 64 of the 1 940 people who landed in england from mexico between july 1 21 had covid meanwhile 2 065 of the 71 418 travellers who arrived from spain tested positive positivity rates among travellers from mexico have doubled in since june but they have more than tripled among people arriving from spain and the numbers also show in addition to spain there are 11 other countries still on the amber list where higher number of positive cases are being imported from for comparison 344 people travellers positive after arriving back from greece while 217 travellers from portugal were infected more covid cases were also found in people flying to england from france 205 the us 164 italy 147 and nigeria 132 there were also more infected people coming back from cyprus 90 poland 89 the netherlands 85 romanian 82 and russia 65 france trips treble in price eurotunnel eurostar and easyjet are accused of hiking fares for lockdown weary britons just hours after quarantine rules changed britons trying to book for france have today accused eurotunnel eurostar and easyjet of ripping off customers who claimed the price of passage trebled as soon as the government announced it would scrap quarantine for tourists returning from sunday people trying to book trains from st pancras to paris claim that 50 was almost immediately added to the cost of a 89 one way ticket while mailonline research has found that the average price increase to travel this weekend is between 20 to 60 for a standard or standard premier ticket after grant shapps made the announcement last night one eurostar customer trying to get back to britain tweeted so now eurostar prices are double the price if not more expats are consistently fighting a losing battle another wrote that the website was crashing again and again with the price relentlessly going up adding took about 10 attempts and 50 quid more absolutely ridiculous one driver trying to book the eurotunnel to france from folkestone tweeted why are you doubling your prices from this sunday just as the new quarantine rules for uk people coming from france come into affect isn t this what s known as profiteering our ticket cost has doubled in 24hrs because we had to amend our booking and people trying to fly to france in august are also being hit in the pocket several accused easyjet of cancelling flights in order to force them into buying more expensive tickets one wrote easyjet has just cancelled all flights to nice in august so that prices can be hiked up outrageous my friend now has to find alternative flights at a vastly inflated cost another said easyjet our flight to france was cancelled 3 times so on the 3rd cancellation we took a voucher as we did not have a lot of time to think about it you have now increased the price can you offer the same deal at least the companies today denied they were taking advantage saying any rises were down to demand a eurotunnel spokesman said the cost of a ticket does not double overnight due to an amendment our pricing works like that of most travel operators as a dynamic model led by demand with the announcement last night we saw an immediate uplift in bookings and therefore certain departures are now in higher demand than previously conversely there are plenty of keenly priced departures available too eurostar and easyjet have been asked to comment advertisement however these figures were originally published last thursday meaning ministers may have seen more recent data that gave them cause for concern about mexico the final part of any travel quarantine decision made by the jbc is known as the outcome it is used to support decision making and allows ministers to take the risk assessments into account alongside wider public health factors to inform watchlists travel connections with the uk and details of the in country and territory vaccination profile are included as contextual information the dft also says a department of transport spokesperson said our international travel policy is guided by one overwhelming priority public health and traffic light allocations are based on a range of factors including genomic surveillance capability transmission risk and variants of concern asked about mailonline s analysis of the numbers dr simon clarke said he would absolutely agree that there is barely any difference between outbreaks in spain and mexico but the microbiologist from reading university warned civil servants making the decision would have inevitably considered other data that may have skewed the argument he said policymakers should release the raw data justifying the decisions echoing calls by other prominent covid experts dr clarke however said frankly i think the government don t want academics and scientists kicking over the stuff and questioning their decisions professor lawrence young a molecular virologist at the university of warwick told mailonline the whole international travel situation remains very confusing despite the government stating that this is a simplified system the criteria used for designating a country as amber green or red is not clear and is still subject to change there are rising cases of infection in mexico against a backdrop of around 20 per cent of the population being fully vaccinated what s important is not to get complacent the virus is still infecting people even some who have been fully vaccinated the testing regime for amber listed countries is very important to ensure returning travellers are not spreading infection we need to protect ourselves from importing dangerous virus variants professor gary mclean a molecular immunologist at london metropolitan university said it looks like mexico is being more carefully watched here due to rising case numbers particularly among those returning to the uk and the presence of another variant that originated in south america the current wave in spain is in decline much like the current uk wave the fears over the spread of the beta variant in spain have subsided somewhat allowing spain to remain amber however the wave in mexico is still rising despite similar daily case numbers to spain all of this put together has allowed spain to remain amber but unfortunately mexico jump to red the traffic light list and restrictions is really attempting to reduce the flow of cases from regions with higher and increasing case rates associated with variants that may escape immunity whilst it is imperfect it is surely better than a complete border closure at this stage of the pandemic where can you go on holiday now how double jabbed brits can visit latvia romania and germany with no tests needed while unvaccinated must provide proof they re covid free to enter spain double jabbed britons can visit latvia romania and germany with no tests needed while those who are unvaccinated must provide proof that they are covid free to enter spain it can be revealed those who have received both doses have unrestricted entry meaning they do not have to quarantine or provide a negative test result when travelling to germany france spain latvia romania and georgia but those who are not double jabbed are still subject to some regulations upon arrival and in the cases of germany and slovakia can be denied entry entirely and the spanish government requires all travellers from the uk to present either proof of a negative covid 19 test or that they have received two vaccinations at least 14 days before arrival there are still some rules for fully vaccinated people if they are visiting places such as abu dhabi in the united arab emirates where they have to carry out seven days of quarantine but this is less than the 12 days of self isolation required for britons who have only had one or no doses of the vaccine those who have received both doses have unrestricted entry meaning they do not have to quarantine or provide a negative test result when travelling to germany france spain latvia romania and georgia but those who are not double jabbed are still subject to some regulations upon arrival and in the cases of germany and slovakia can be denied entry entirely restrictions do not differ for double jabbed people if they are travelling from the uk to austria where they are still expected to quarantine for 10 days norway india and the french overseas territories of la reunion and mayotte the guidance comes amid the government s shake up of the traffic light system adding seven european countries to the green list of destinations and switching the status of india bahrain qatar and the united arab emirates from red to amber but there is growing anger about the decision to turn mexico red with just three days notice with panicked and f ing fuming britons trying to get home before 4am on sunday georgia reunion and mayotte will also turn red this weekend while spain avoided joining them those flying back will soon face higher testing costs after ministers urged holidaymakers to take a pcr for the mandatory pre departure test rather than the cheaper lateral flow alternatives as a precaution against the increased prevalence of the virus and variants in the country elsewhere as expected the government also confirmed that arrivals from france will no longer need to self isolate which could spark a surge in cross channel bookings as is the custom in august when traditionally more than four million britons make the trip france will be aligned with all other amber nations from which arrivals only need to quarantine at home if they are not fully vaccinated the changes to the travel lists come into force at 4am on sunday below are the regulations in full for visitors from the uk laid out according to their vaccination status to countries where travel rules have recently changed austria austria is one of the seven european countries being added to the green list of destinations those who are fully vaccinated must quarantine for 10 days and provide proof of a negative pcr test within 72 hours before departure the restrictions are the same for britons who are not double jabbed including 10 days of quarantine and showing a pre departure negative pcr test germany germany is also being moved from the amber to green list as part of the uk government s latest changes under entry requirements for germany those who are not fully vaccinated and do not meet the exemptions outlined such as being a german citizen or having an urgent need to travel may not currently enter the country unvaccinated children under the age of 12 can enter germany if they can show proof of a negative covid test and are travelling with at least one fully vaccinated parent meanwhile those who are double jabbed are permitted entry and do not have to quarantine latvia tourists travelling from the uk to latvia which is being added to the green list have unrestricted entry if they are fully vaccinated those who are not double jabbed must show a negative pcr test before boarding or crossing the border arrivals must also complete and submit an electronic form no longer than 48 hours after entering the country norway fully vaccinated visitors from the uk to norway which is being added to the green list are not allowed to visit unless residing in norway or if they are a close family member of a norwegian resident the same applies to those who have not received both doses this comes after the uk left the european union at the start of this year meaning that uk nationals are no longer classified as eu eea nationals and will not be allowed to visit norway unless they meet certain exceptions romania fully vaccinated people travelling to romania which is moving from the amber to green list do not have to quarantine or take a test the guidance states it allows britons who can demonstrate proof of a full course of vaccination against covid 19 to be exempt from self isolation people are not double jabbed will have to quarantine for 14 days unless a negative rt pcr test can be shown before their arrival and they leave within 72 hours afterwards slovenia for slovenia which is being added to the green list people travelling from the uk who are fully vaccinated must quarantine for 10 days if they do not have a permanent or temporary residency those without two jabs can similarly only enter if they quarantine for 10 days if they do not have a permanent or temporary residency they must also prove one of the following a recent covid test at least one vaccine dose astrazeneca janssen or covishield or a positive pcr test showing they have had covid within the last six months slovakia for slovakia moving to the green list it states entry is now permitted for fully vaccinated travellers from the uk however those who have not received both doses can only be admitted under certain exemptions such as being a resident or studying there bahrain bahrain which is moving from a red to amber list status requires pre departure arrival and day 10 prc tests for people who are fully vaccinated but says they do not need to quarantine those without two jabs must quarantine for 10 days and also take the pre departure arrival and day 10 prc tests india all regularly scheduled international flights remain suspended but a limited number are in operation those who do travel to india must go through thermal screening on arrival show proof of a negative private test not pcr and quarantine for 10 days quarantine this applies to everyone regardless of their vaccination status qatar the guidance for qatar moving to the amber list says there is no quarantine for those who are fully vaccinated but they must show a negative pcr test those who are not double jabbed must quarantine for seven days and also show a negative pcr test fury at expensive and unnecessary travel testing demands as ministers urge brits to take expensive pcr covid tests when returning from spain even though they are not mandatory aviation bosses have demanded the government take action on the cost of travel testing amid fears many families are being priced out of a trip abroad the government has made a raft of changes to its traffic light scheme extending the green list reopening quarantine free holidays to france and keeping trips to spain on the table after it was spared being moved to the red list testing remains a key component of the system with pre departure tests required for travel from red amber and green nations ministers have now stressed that all travellers returning from spain should take a pcr test because they are more accurate than cheaper lateral flow checks and can help officials keep track of coronavirus variants however travel chiefs believe the pcr tests which can cost up to 175 per person are expensive and unnecessary they want the pcr tests to only be required for travel from the most high risk nations and for lateral flow tests to be made acceptable in all other circumstances willie walsh director general of the international air travel association told bbc radio 4 s world at one programme i think a simpler system is definitely what is required to avoid confusion in the case of consumers and to provide some form of certainty for people who are wanting to travel and in some cases absolutely need to travel this expensive and unnecessary testing i think needs to be challenged and i think the government should demonstrate why they require it he added i think there is a valid reason and a concern and i would accept that maybe for some of these high risk countries that have been identified you can make the argument that some form of testing should be done but i don t think you can justify requiring 2 2 million people to undertake pcr tests when only 8 000 of those are subsequently sequenced advertisement united arab emirates fully vaccinated people travelling to abu dhabi in the united arab emirates being added to the amber list from the uk must quarantine for seven days show a negative pcr test on arrival and on their sixth day in the country people who have not received both doses must quarantine in abu dhabi for longer 12 days alongside showing a negative pcr test on arrival and on day 11 of their stay meanwhile if travelling to dubai all international tourists must show a negative pcr test before departure and will be subject to thermal screenings visitors do not have to quarantine spain britons travelling to spain moving to the amber list who are fully vaccinated are permitted entry and do not have to quarantine or show tests those who are not double jabbed are also allowed entry without quarantine but must show a negative covid test france people travelling from the uk to france which has lost its amber plus status under the latest update are permitted unrestricted entry if they are fully vaccinated they must present a completed sworn statement saying they do not have any symptoms upon arrival meanwhile britons without both jabs can only visit the country for essential travel only those allowed entry need to quarantine for seven days and provide pre departure and post quarantine pcr tests mexico the guidance for mexico moving from the amber to red list states for fully vaccinated britons that entry is permitted via commercial flights visitors must fill out a health questionnaire and are advised to avoid travelling within the country wherever possible there is no differentiation in the guidance between people according to their vaccination status georgia georgia switching to the red list says it allows unrestricted entry for citizens of any country including the uk who have documentary proof of having received a full course of covid 19 vaccination people who are not double jabbed must travel direct by air and submit a travel history in advance in addition to showing a negative pcr test on arrival and on day three of their stay réunion fully vaccinated britons travelling to the french oversea territory of réunion moving to the red list must only visit for essential travel only they must also self isolate for seven days in addition to showing a negative pre departure test and a post quarantine test the guidance does not differ for those who have not received both jabs mayotte the french oversea territory of mayotte switching from the amber to red list also requires the same restrictions for britons regardless of their vaccination status the country says britons should travel there for urgent family work reasons only self isolate for seven days and show a negative pre departure and post quarantine pcr test
the commonwealth cyber initiative has funded seven transdisciplinary projects for 450 000 to explore the role of cybersecurity in curbing the spread of disinformation and misinformation misinformation and disinformation spreads quickly in our connected society and prevents people from making decisions based on accurate information said luiz dasilva cci executive director we want to study how cybersecurity can help control the proliferation of these misinformation campaigns researchers are applying artificial intelligence techniques to detect the spread of misinformation through social media to provide tools for governments and individuals to counteract disinformation campaigns and to analyze how disinformation can impact connected devices and vehicles researchers from virginia tech george mason university old dominion university tidewater community college and the university of virginia are collaborating on the projects researchers represent a wide range of disciplines such as

and analysis of publicly available information sources such as social media for investigative purposes is a powerful method for combating disinformation and misinformation however this investigation technique is typically a manual time consuming process overwhelming investigators with a fire hose of online disinformation crowdsourcing with its ability to massively parallelize data analysis and provide access to highly specialized knowledge has the potential to assist the disinformation investigation researchers will build a pipeline where an expert investigator leverages ai assisted tools to narrow the search enlists crowdsourcing to refine the shortlist and reviews and confirms the results inspired by the model of volunteer fire departments the researchers will organize and evaluate a

computer engineering and faculty at the sanghani center for artificial intelligence and data analytics adrienne ivory associate professor communication both virginia tech project description responding rapidly to disinformation attacks is critical to minimizing the damage caused by these attacks as fake news is intentionally written to mislead readers during a short time period it is difficult for a human editor to differentiate between real and fake news for this project researchers plan to enable fast deployment of artificial intelligence ai based disinformation detection tools to do so researchers must build a large set of training data to train the ai based detection tool researchers will create techniques to strategically label valuable data by looking at different sets of features such as new content user profiles message propagation and social context while learning from this information and mitigating the effects of potential labeling noise on detection models in addition the researchers will evaluate public opinion about ai based detection methods because a better understanding of public perception can help inform social media companies about using disinformation detection to block content machine learning based disinformation detection and its human trust in autonomous vehicle systems principal investigator haiying shen associate professor

could become a distributed system of connected autonomous vehicles such as self driving cars and other related components vehicle to vehicle v2v communication can make vehicles vulnerable to attacks hackers can insert false information into the system so drivers think everything is ok but in reality an accident is about to happen current solutions to preventing the fault information attacks may be too slow at the same time human drivers need to be able to trust in the system that s behind the wheel adoption and acceptance of v2v depends on it to solve this problem this project will design a

llc huzefa rangwala professor computer science george mason project description during a crisis government agencies are especially vulnerable to targeted disinformation campaigns on social media a multidisciplinary team of computing and policy researchers is addressing this challenge through three avenues first researchers will create a program to characterize disinformation social media posts and show how these posts are connected and what they have in common second using computation methods that employ state of the art natural language processing and machine learning techniques they ll detect multilingual disinformation posts finally researchers will combine the results to create an interactive and predictive modeling tool which could help discover malicious social media attacks on government policies before they have a chance to take root and spread the project team will use the disinformation social media posts during the covid 19 pandemic to test their new method the

description fake scientific news has been spreading across the internet for years but even more so since covid 19 prompting such fake stories as mosquitoes spread coronavirus it may be easier for people to believe these pieces of news since they seem intuitively correct will they change their mind if they see the evidence against these news articles from scientific literature do they trust the credibility scores estimated by artificial intelligence algorithms will they still pass these news articles to their friends on facebook to find some answers computer scientists will collaborate with psychologists at old dominion university the project consists of three steps first a new algorithm will be researched and implemented to estimate how likely a scientific news article reveals the truth the algorithm will also provide evidence from scientific publications then a website will be built to show users what is found in the first step finally a study will be performed on news consumers to see their reactions when they are shown fake news articles and debunk information on the website we built the hope is to reveal the effectiveness of using scientific literature as weapons to debunk scientific misinformation and disinformation eventually curb their spread across society artificial intelligence based analysis of misinformation and disinformation efforts from mass media and social

project researchers will use artificial intelligence to investigate such misinformation disinformation campaigns in particular how they may generate anti u s public perception in other countries the project will rely on data from turkey a key u s ally and nato member the project will collect data from various social media and news sources analyze the trends using ai techniques and understand the roles of several actors in shaping public opinion by using misinformation disinformation campaigns the results could show how negative social media campaigns impact foreign policy
washington d c a 1 trillion infrastructure bill under debate by the u s senate includes a provision mandating the installation in autos of a technology for preventing intoxicated drivers from starting their vehicles in a bid to prevent more than 10 000 deaths per year for over 15 years automakers and government agencies have researched technologies for preventing the roughly one third of annual national traffic deaths involving impaired drivers this legislative effort has gained support from advocacy group mothers against drunk driving the auto insurance industry and some alcohol trade associations in its study the insurance institute for highway safety iihs said alcohol detection systems that prevent impaired driving could save over 9 000 lives annually noting that u s police departments arrest some 1 million people per year for driving drunk related deaths cost the country some 44 billion in economic harm and 210 billion in social costs according to a 2010 study in 2019 lawmakers told reuters that auto manufacturers could install touch devices on steering wheels and engine start buttons that can measure drivers blood alcohol levels or install sensors that can passively monitor drivers breath or eye movements the bill would require the u s transportation department to establish a technology safety standard within three years the bill does not specify the technology to be adopted but stressed it must passively monitor drivers performances and accurately identify whether they are impaired the national highway traffic safety administration and automakers have researched one system that samples a driver s breathing while another technology measures blood alcohol level by shining an infrared light through the driver s fingertip however questions remain about the accuracy of these technologies and their suitability for widespread adoption
you don t need to focus on the shiny new thing to get market beating returns everyone likes the shiny new thing that s true in retail and it is true of investing new companies operating in emerging industries tend to get the lion s share of investor attention in hopes of finding the next big thing without a doubt a lot of tech stocks have the potential to be big winners but you don t have to look exclusively to tech to find long term winners there are solid companies with the potential for market beating long term growth in industries that have been around for a long time you just have to know where to look here s why three fools believe gxo logistics gxo 1 15 ford motor company f 0 31 and goldman sachs group gs 0 86 despite operating in stodgy old industries are likely to outperform the market over time the next big thing in e commerce isn t an e commerce stock lou whiteman gxo logistics the explosive growth in online shopping has created a number of new retail titans including amazon and shopify and it has also put more of an emphasis on inventory management warehousing shipping and managing returns gxo is well positioned to take on that burden for retailers and it should be a huge beneficiary of the continued growth in e commerce technically gxo perhaps shouldn t be called old school as it was only spun out of xpo logistics on august 2 but transportation and logistics are about as old economy as an industry gets and gxo has been building its business inside xpo for years few retailers on their own have the size and scale needed to match amazon when it comes to logistics but with many retailers outsourcing that task to gxo they can gain efficiencies they would be unable to achieve on their own gxo operates from 885 locations primarily in north america and europe and it runs warehouses and manages supply chains for blue chip customers like apple nike walt disney nestle pepsico and whirlpool gxo expects to generate 17 adjusted ebitda growth and 10 revenue growth through 2022 today about 40 of its revenue comes from pure play e commerce and omnichannel retailers and the company said it has a 2 billion pipeline of new potential business on the horizon i fully expect e commerce growth to continue for the foreseeable future and i expect the top online retailers to continue to grow and benefit from that supertrend but arguably the wild west land grab stage of e commerce is now behind us and as the law of big numbers catch up to large companies like amazon outsized growth from retail will become harder to generate gxo today is a 7 billion business chasing an outsourced logistics market of more than 130 billion even before the pandemic companies were beginning to move more and more of their logistics to outsourcers a trend that has only increased due to covid throw in in house logistics operations and the total addressable market is more than 400 billion gxo likely won t take all of that market just as amazon will never be the only online retailer but gxo has the potential to double in size and then double again and still only own a small part of that total market i think gxo is up to the challenge and i expect it to produce returns that will handily beat the market for years to come electric trucks from a start up here s a better idea for your ev truck and your portfolio john rosevear ford motor company there are a lot of lofty expectations baked into the market caps of tiny electric vehicle makers like workhorse group lordstown motors and canoo all three of these companies are aiming to be players in the market for commercial vehicles but as of press time only workhorse had actually shipped any trucks and only a few i think we need to think bigger i think the company that will dominate the market for electric commercial vehicles at least in the u s and europe is the company that already leads those markets ford let s just consider one vehicle for now the f 150 lightning due next spring i think the f 150 lightning has the potential to be one of the most important electric vehicles of the era maybe the most important since tesla s landmark model s because of its potential to bring a whole lot of new mainstream buyers to the world of evs the lightning is loaded with clever features built by a company that commercial and retail customers know they can rely on and priced aggressively just about 40 000 for starters and around 50 000 if you want the longer range version sure lordstown might manage to ship a few of its endurance commercial pickups before the first f 150 lightnings reach customers but if you re a commercial fleet manager concerned about reliability and total cost of ownership why would you buy an endurance a brand new product from a brand new company that s already in hot water for 52 500 for starters when you could buy a ford a ford with equal or better specs for a lot less i think if we look out 10 or 20 years from now the market for electric commercial vehicles is going to be dominated by ford and the other global giants that dominate the market for internal combustion and hybrid commercial vehicles today and if the success of and critical praise for ford s mustang mach e is any indication i think ford stands a good chance of gaining market share despite all these wannabe new entrants that s one reason why i think the next few years will be very good for ford s bottom line and probably for auto investors holding its stock too value or growth why not both rich smith goldman sachs you say tomato i say potato and if you say that paypal holdings square and all the other newfangled stars of the new fintech industry are better investments than old school financial giant goldman sachs well i say you probably haven t looked at their valuations closely enough i admit paypal and square get a lot of headlines and in recent years that s translated into enormous stock price gains paypal is up 37 over the past 52 weeks and square is up 99 and yet have you taken a gander at goldman sachs stock price performance it s up 87 over the past year which is not too shabby and even after that run goldman sachs stock still sells for less than seven times trailing earnings that s not just a bargain relative to the 63 p e ratio on paypal stock or the 325 times earnings that square costs seven times earnings is a bargain price period but aren t paypal and square growing faster than old school goldman you ask well yes and no last quarter square did grow its revenue 266 which was faster than goldman sachs 32 growth rate paypal on the other hand grew only 19 and its profits declined and as for future growth according to the latest estimates compiled by s p global market intelligence wall street analysts have goldman sachs pegged for nearly 15 annualized income growth over the next five years true that s slower growth than the 24 rate posited for paypal or the 37 growth expected from square but goldman sachs 14 8 long term growth rate divided into its 6 9 p e ratio gives this stock a peg ratio of less than 0 5 hint value investors usually consider peg ratios below 1 0 a bargain and that s not even counting the bank s above market 2 1 dividend yield for investors seeking value i believe you ll make more money by investing in the tried and true rather than the shiny and new and i think 152 year old money printing machine goldman sachs is a better bargain than paypal or square
masks will be required at all illinois long term care facilities day cares and pre k 12 schools gov jb pritzker announced wednesday aug 4 amid a nationwide surge of covid 19 the masking requirement extends to indoor but not outdoor activities and sports the guidance applies to all schools public and non public pritzker said there are two routes to enforcing the mask mandate including civil liability for schools not enforcing the mandate and the removal of recognition status by the illinois state board of education the illinois department of public health also announced wednesday it is making free covid 19 testing available to k 12 schools across the state through the shield illinois saliva based test developed by the university of illinois urbana champaign the test can detect the virus and its variants in those with or without symptoms the testing would allow close contacts of a covid 19 positivie individual to stay in the classroom as long as they test negative funding comes from federal covid 19 relief packages by oct 4 all illinois state employees working in congregate facilities will be required to receive the covid 19 vaccine the order covers certain employees at the departments of human services veterans affairs corrections and juvenile justice working in congregate facilities and pritzker said the state has reached out to the unions representing those employees to work out the details illinois is also requiring universal masking in private long term care facilities and strongly encourages owners of private facilities to join the state in adopting vaccination requirements according to the governor s office pritzker said the state is evaluating every day the trajectory of the virus and other potential mitigations that may be needed vaccines work while gov jb pritzker has mandated masks at schools wednesday aug 4 the best approach to limiting the spread of covid 19 is still getting vaccinated he said it s also the best way to limit severe illness and death in illinois 6 5 million people are fully vaccinated or 51 2 percent of the population while 73 percent of the population that is older than 12 years of age has received at least one dose of the vaccine the state averaged 28 180 vaccine doses administered each day over the past seven days of the millions of fully vaccinated individuals just 714 have spent time in the hospital with covid 19 according to idph since january 180 vaccinated individuals have died of covid 19 symptoms accounting for just 2 58 percent of the covid 19 related deaths this calendar year that number increased by 11 from the state s reporting of the numbers last week that s about 0 01 percent of vaccinated individuals who have been hospitalized for the virus and 0 003 percent who have died of complications the overwhelming majority of cases the hospitalizations the deaths are among those who are not vaccinated ezike said and the majority of transmission is also among the unvaccinated but the key is that we actually have the tools to turn the tide on the next wave and that next wave wants to threaten us if we don t avail ourselves of these tools illinois department of public health director dr ngozi ezike said youth hospitalizations and infections have been rising about 5 5 percent of covid 19 cases were among those who are younger than 10 years of age in january ezike said but that number increased to 15 percent last month approximately 13 percent of cases in january were among those 10 19 years old increasing to 23 percent in july hospitalizations for those 20 years old and younger have tripled from 2 5 percent to 7 8 percent in that time span and yes while most children who get covid have fewer symptoms than adults they absolutely can still get covid 19 and they can absolutely spread it to others ezike said noting many cases of the virus have spread at youth camps this summer energy bill impasse with talks between labor and environmental groups at an impasse and with the clock ticking on the impending closure of two nuclear plants in illinois gov jb pritzker on wednesday aug 4 urged lawmakers to quickly take up the compromise package he put forth in june this is not something that s left to interest groups to decide this is a decision that gets made by the legislature and by the governor pritzker said during an unrelated news conference wednesday and here we are this bill has been put together after much negotiation over many many months and we now have a piece of legislation that is ready to go and it needs to be called in the legislature and voted on the bill that pritzker is pushing would put illinois on a path to 100 percent emission free power production by 2050 it includes nearly 700 million over five years in subsidies to keep exelon s fleet of nuclear power plants open incentives for the development of more wind and solar generation and a scheduled phase out of most coal fired by 2035 and natural gas plants by 2045 as part of a compromise pritzker also proposed allowing springfield s city water light and powder facility and metro east s prairie state energy campus to remain open through 2045 provided they could find a way to capture at least 90 percent of their carbon emissions one hold up was a substantive disagreements between labor and environmental groups over the phase out of fossil fuel plants especially two large coal fired plants in springfield and the metro east area near st louis exelon meanwhile has announced plans to close its byron generating station in september and its dresden generating station by november arguing they are too unprofitable to keep online together those plants employ about 1 500 workers the company made similar announcements in 2016 just before lawmakers passed the future energy jobs act which included financial support for two other exelon nuclear power plants and on july 28 the company filed paperwork with the federal nuclear regulatory commission detailing its long term plans for cleanup of the sites and disposal of their radioactive nuclear waste on monday aug 2 the illinois clean jobs coalition which is made up of several environmental groups and the labor backed climate jobs illinois both notified pritzker s office that their negotiations had reached an impasse with labor groups insisting that fossil fuel plants be allowed to stay in operation at some level in perpetuity menstual hygiene three new state laws will aim to break down barriers to feminine hygiene products such as tampons and sanitary napkins for those who can t afford them two of the laws make menstrual products available at state colleges and universities and require homeless shelters to stock the products budget permitting another would require the state to apply for a waiver to allow certain federal assistance funds to be used on the products provided the federal government makes such a waiver available gov jb pritzker signed the measures at southern illinois university edwardsville thursday aug 5 contrasting the state s efforts to pass women s health legislation to republican led states such as missouri seeking to overturn the supreme court precedent of roe vs wade as it pertains to abortion rights house bill 641 requires state universities and community colleges to stock feminine hygiene products in any restroom in a college building that serves students that measure passed the house 74 37 and the senate 42 13 each with mostly democratic but some republican support it takes effect immediately house bill 155 would require the illinois department of human services to apply for a waiver to the federal government to allow the use of supplemental nutrition assistance program and the special supplemental nutrition program for women infants and children to purchase diapers and menstrual hygiene products that bill had unanimous support in the general assembly house bill 310 requires homeless shelters that serve women and youth to make menstrual hygiene products available free of charge that requirement however is subject to the availability of funds in the homeless shelter s general budget according to the bill that measure passed the general assembly with only one vote against in the senate and three votes against in the house it will become law in january 2022 foid law gov jb pritzker signed a wide ranging bill reforming the state s gun laws monday aug 2 at the aurora police department advocates for the new law including illinois state police director brendan kelly hailed it as a measure that would provide the statutory backing and funding necessary to retrieve guns from those with revoked firearm owners identification cards while also streamlining the application and renewal process for law abiding gun owners the new law which was supported by gun reform advocates while the illinois state rifle association remained neutral creates a number of changes to gun statutes including state police must create a prohibited persons portal to track people who have had their cards revoked or suspended law enforcement agencies state s attorneys and the attorney general would have access to that portal isp must establish the violent crime intelligence task force to aid in enforcement of foid card revocation or suspension enforcement the 10 renewal fee for foid cards will remain the same under the law but beginning in 2022 half of it will go to the state police firearm services fund which oversees applications and renewals and half to the state police revocation enforcement fund previously 6 of that fee went to the state fish and wildlife fund while 3 went to the firearms services fund and another 1 went to the state police services fund foid card applicants would not be required to submit fingerprints but if they do or they share with the illinois state police the fingerprints they filed to receive their concealed carry license they would be eligible for automatic renewal without a renewal fee that process is to be

to a federal firearm license dealer within 10 days of receiving the gun state police must develop a stolen gun database through which potential buyers may search the serial number of a gun to determine whether it is stolen state police must monitor state and federal databases for residents charged with firearm related crimes and to correlate the records with foid and concealed carry licenses a foid card review board is created to consider appeals on denied or revoked cards foid and ccl can be combined into one license and isp can produce an electronic id for that license

three top stocks that are timely buys right now the energy sector has delivered incredible returns for investors so far this year the energy select spdr etf xle 0 26 is up 32 in total returns almost double the 18 for the s p 500 index over the same period as rising demand for oil and gas push energy prices and oil stock profits steadily higher yet at the same time the future of energy is still heavily pointed toward renewables and investors who consider both the near term and long term implications can find a handful of top energy stocks you can buy to benefit from today s surging demand for all things energy while still being positioned for profits in the low carbon future three top energy stocks that look very compelling today include wind turbine blade supplier tpi composites tpic 0 58 integrated energy giant phillips 66 psx 0 03 and infrastructure operator brookfield infrastructure bip 0 11 bipc 0 51 chances are there s something compelling that makes at least one a good fit for investors of all kinds if you re looking to add a top energy stock to your portfolio this month keep reading to learn which of these three might be the perfect timely energy stock buy for you messed up expectations creating a great buying opportunity over the past few years tpi composites has spent a lot of money building out capacity the company which primarily manufactures wind turbine blades for leading wind energy companies was predicting that this new capacity would start paying off this year however that s not looking likely to be the case after management trimmed its full year guidance in late july as a result tpi shares are down more than 50 from the high reached in january and management is now cautioning that sales could be flat through 2022 as well but i think the market s reaction might be short sighted at least for investors willing to think bigger picture and looking to take advantage of this sell off eventually demand for its new capacity should pay off in the interim the company generates solid operating cash flow so it should have little trouble continuing to fund its business during the current soft period in the cycle whether management continues tapping the debt markets to fund capital expansion remains to be seen let s be clear this isn t a value play shares are still more expensive than almost any time in the company s history prior to late 2020 it s a turnaround play with plenty of growth prospects on the other side if management can stay focused on a healthy balance sheet and getting to the next growth phase in the wind cycle investors who buy today should be very happy they did returning to profits today building a sustainable business for tomorrow the past year has been pretty brutal for phillips 66 the company makes most of its money refining and selling refined products like gasoline and diesel and last year s collapse cost it 4 billion in losses yet when it reported second quarter results on august 3 the strength of its business really showed up on the bottom line with 296 million in net income after losing 141 million last year cash flow is starting to surge too operating cash flow was 2 billion in the first half of 2021 1 7 billion of that in the second quarter alone more than double last year s first half result one thing that really stood out is that those profits came even with the refining segment still losing money refining operations reported a pre tax loss of 729 million but a big surge in profits from marketing and specialties fuel and refined products sales along with record profits from petrochemical manufacturing helped offset the continued losses in refining looking ahead it s likely the losses in refining are mostly over demand for fuel is surging and phillips 66 s cash cow is likely to start producing once again what about the low carbon future phillips 66 is making serious inroads there too having already converted one refinery to produce renewable diesel and now doing the same with its rodeo refinery in northern california moreover the company s significant natural gas pipeline and storage facility along with its huge petrochemical manufacturing operations are already set up to handle renewable natural gas as more supply of this product which is captured from human and agricultural waste becomes available phillips 66 s existing infrastructure will play an important role in the transition away from fossil fuels investors who buy now can capture a heady 4 7 dividend yield that s likely to move higher in the earnings release ceo greg garland said we anticipate return to dividend growth as cash flow recovers that high yield will make it a lot easier to hold the stock while the company transitions away from oil and to more and more renewables over time brookfield keeps buying pipelines and its cash flows keep going higher while this isn t a pure play on energy brookfield infrastructure makes the cut as a top stock with growing energy exposure that investors should buy now that s because over the past few years management has made a clear decision that some of the best capital allocation opportunities out there are in the energy logistics space specifically oil and gas pipelines storage terminals and processing facilities have been on the shopping list its latest deal to acquire inter pipeline ipl is the most recent and is expected to add almost 400 million in annualized adjusted ebitda to brookfield infrastructure s bottom line here s just how much management s focus on this segment has paid off in the first quarter brookfield infrastructure s midstream segment reported an 89 increase in funds from operations by far the highest growth of any part of its business lastly brookfield infrastructure is a diversified business giving investors exposure to telecommunications transportation and utilities infrastructure assets on multiple continents the nature of its business also results in steady cash flows making its 3 plus dividend yield very secure if you re looking for some exposure to energy but prefer a diversified business with lots of ways management can invest capital to grow the brookfield infrastructure might be the right stock to buy now

by james pethokoukis and brad stone few institutions held up better during the covid pandemic than amazon its supply chains successfully accommodated a massive surge in demand and continued to provide products to hundreds of millions of customers no wonder its stock price has almost doubled since march 2020 and yet amazon faces an uncertain future jeff bezos is stepping down as ceo and policymakers have grown increasingly vocal about their desire to break up big tech companies like amazon so what s next for this retail giant i recently discussed that question and much more with brad stone brad is the senior executive editor for global technology at bloomberg news as well as a writer for bloomberg businessweek he is also the author of four books the most recent of which is amazon unbound jeff bezos and the invention of a global empire released last may what follows is a lightly edited transcript of our conversation you can download the episode here and don t forget to subscribe to my podcast on itunes or stitcher tell your friends leave a review pethokoukis i remember when mark zuckerberg testified before congress and one thing that really struck me is that the people questioning him really did not understand how facebook made money and to me it seems facebook is a much simpler company than amazon so as you ve been doing interviews about the book do you sense that people understand how amazon works that s a really good question they certainly understand how the oldest and maybe still the largest part of amazon works primarily because they re customers when you go to any city but particularly washington dc and talk to regulators and legislators they understand amazon in part because they interact with it every single day probably like the rest of us and so when you talk about the retail business the third party marketplace maybe alexa and definitely the movies and tv shows i think there s an understanding maybe there s not a full appreciation for the complexity as it pertains to things like amazon web services and how it all fits together but i think because amazon is known as a store there is an understanding of a large part of what it does sometimes i get the sense talking to people even regulators and staffers that they believe amazon would love to be able to own and sell everything it seems like they believe amazon is looking to destroy all those small businesses and take data from them are they right and if not what is the strategy of the bulk of amazon s business maybe you re right in that there are now critics on both sides of the aisle there s this rare bipartisan consensus against the big tech companies in particular amazon and i think they may often attribute the very worst motives to the company amazon ceo jeff bezos testifies via video conference during a hearing of the house judiciary subcommittee on antitrust commercial and administrative law on online platforms and market power in the rayburn house office building on capitol hill in washington u s july 29 2020 graeme jennings pool via reuters so let s just take the specific issue of amazon s private label business and how it gleans data from its third party sellers to figure out what to sell and what to put under the amazon basics mantle to a certain extent maybe i m not so sure that they don t understand it you know there s a political argument being made here but the fact is that most retailers have very large private label businesses and of course they look at what s selling to figure out what they should sell and amazon does it too they ve been caught with their hand in the cookie jar because they ve proclaimed to have an internal policy against letting employees look at the data from third party sellers and as i recount in my book and others have recounted as well clearly employees have vaulted over the wall but when it comes to actual policy that might prohibit amazon from rolling out private label products it s unrealistic because then you have to consider costco walmart walgreens and everyone else who does it so i don t know we re in the realm of the political argument and there s not a lot of room for nuance about how retail operates in general one of my favorite writings on amazon is from the tech analyst benedict evans who had a great blog post maybe a couple of years ago called amazon is a boring retailer and let me just read what he wrote about amazon and get your thoughts i sometimes think that if you could look in the safe behind jeff bezos s desk instead of the sports almanac from back to the future you d find an encyclopedia of retail written in maybe 1985 there would be post it notes on every page and every one of those notes has been turned into a team or maybe a product amazon is so new and so dramatic in its speed and scale and aggression that we can easily forget how many of the things it s doing are actually very old and we can forget how many of the slightly dusty incumbent retailers we all grew up with were also once radical daring piratical new businesses that made people angry with their new ideas what i m getting at is that people just don t have a good sense of the history of business they may understand regulation and law but they don t understand the history of business and how what amazon is doing is very old they re just doing it way faster and way bigger yes and no in my first book about amazon the everything store i do talk about how bezos and his executives read the sam walton autobiography and took certain pieces from it and clearly they do utilize best practices from retail but there s so much about amazon that is unique the shelves are endless the variety is potentially endless there are also all these pieces at amazon where the connections are very opaque but they clearly reinforce each other so there s the way in which retail operates on amazon web services and ostensibly gets a pretty hefty discount for amazon s cloud infrastructure which then turns around and sells to other competitors at a markup or there s the way in which amazon s alexa devices sit in people s homes with a backend on aws and integrate other thriving pieces of the tech ecosystem like music streaming surveillance cameras and other things amazon is a collection of self reinforcing parts all adhering to the same business principles but with these very opaque and fuzzy connections between them and then throwing off tremendous amounts of cash and allowing amazon to invest in new things so i think yes the manual s there but amazon s really pioneering new territory as well you mentioned the previous book the everything store and i would recommend to listeners that it makes a fantastic companion to amazon unbound can they buy that in a beautiful box set or something have you produced that no unfortunately not maybe one day jim but you re right i really felt like it was a little bit like the godfather and the godfather part ii they re two pieces of the same epic story i ve talked to a lot of authors and you get the sense that when they ve written about something they may be forced to talk about it because they re promoting it but they don t want to go back to it they are just done with it but you apparently were not amazon ed out you were not bezos ed out you returned to it what did you find so compelling about this story that you wanted to devote a whole lot of time to talking and writing more about it mostly i was very proud of the everything store and i was talking about amazon a lot and came to realize that it was all outdated the company that i had written about in 2013 was a giant and was interesting but it had a 100 billion market cap with maybe 40 000 or 50 000 employees bezos was interesting but certainly wasn t the most famous guy in business and that all shifted the market cap zoomed to 1 5 trillion and bezos became the richest person in the world and changed before our very eyes physically his personal life the things that he was interested in and when i started amazon unbound i certainly didn t know that he was going to retire as ceo get divorced or further commit to his private space company blue origin so the landscape was changing and i needed to update my history and then really as i started to work on it i was just surprised by how good the story was i ve written quite a few blog posts about the everything store i just think it s such an amazing story jeff bezos could have had a fantastic career on wall street but he sees an opportunity and ends up in the basement of some other store in seattle packing books by hand it s a great entrepreneurial story and when people used to think about jeff bezos back then they thought of the guffawing laugh he was really a charming character now he s depicted as lex luther how did that happen i don t know that i m depicting him as lex luther but it s funny because i have gotten that question is bezos an evil villain maybe we have to disassociate our generalized distaste for extraordinary wealth at a time of huge and worrying income inequality with the particulars of bezos he obviously gets criticized and duly so in my book and elsewhere for amazon s relationship with its employees the corporate culture and some of the pressures that it s exerting on small businesses jeff bezos president and ceo of amazon and owner of the washington post speaks at the economic club of washington dc s milestone celebration dinner in washington u s september 13 2018 reuters joshua roberts but i still feel like his intentions are good he s investing in opening space with his private space company blue origin because he feels like this is something that humanity will need generations from now and he wants to start it same as elon musk and for all of amazon s faults i don t think i would have written two books if i didn t generally believe that in the end it s brought a lot of conveniences to our lives it s got a lot of things it needs to fix but it s also managed to innovate at scale and obviously was a complete lifeline during the pandemic so i don t really think that it s fair to call him a lex luther type i will say he can do a fairly poor job of evangelizing for his own interests like at the recent space launch when he inadvertently thanked amazon employees for paying for the whole thing he s unlike elon musk who manages to use his charisma to spin his followers into fans bezos just has a much harder time doing that and as a result i think he s easier to caricature and it seems like that caricature which is obviously a function of the size of the company bezos s wealth and broader concerns about inequality has caused a revisionist reframing i remember that for a long time there were questions about whether amazon was really a buyable business because they weren t recording profits people didn t understand that strategy now we look back at that strategy and say oh this is a predatory company that was not making money because it was undermining other companies and underpricing its product and that s part of why i think people just always have been befuddled by the business strategy of this company they thought it didn t make sense and then they thought it made too much sense and represented this intentionally predatory approach to business yeah that s interesting in my book i have this chapter that looks at how amazon developed the ad business and one of the interesting anecdotes there is how bezos really pushed back on his retail business using advertising money to subsidize their unprofitability he wanted the retail business to stand on its own and this in a way runs counter to that narrative as for the fact that amazon has lost money in some years and probably could be even more profitable than it is currently i think that speaks more to bezos s and now andy jassy s interest in just funding new things for example amazon is going to spend 12 billion this year on prime video through licensing tv shows and movies as well as making their own so amazon s profits go to this expansionist zeal new industries new inventions things like alexa whatever the new thing is that they re going to launch it s not really from undercutting prices or pricing below competitors bezos wants those older amazon businesses to stand on their own and be profitable it s a little bit more complex than amazon hides the ball to undercut competitors did jeff bezos think and does current management think that they have a pr problem certainly a lot of what you read about amazon used to focus on pay issues and now it s about life inside the warehouses drivers not getting bathroom breaks all that stuff but then you ll look at customers brand ratings and amazon scores very very high so does amazon management think they have a problem or do they just think business reporters the media and politicians like to attack the company but actual customers and regular people think amazon s great that s a good question you know i would point to the last bezos shareholder letter and some of the things that andy jassy has said recently they ve added a couple of principles to their 14 sacrosanct leadership values that they all study religiously they talk about being more employee centric and employee focused and also about looking at some of the possible ramifications of their actions for society to me that suggests a receptiveness to the criticism so i don t think they re fully in their shells of denial even if it s sometimes their public posture to say okay sure people are going to criticize us they just don t understand i think that these recent changes and some of the recent rhetoric suggests that while the halo might still be over their heads given these brand surveys some of the criticism is going to accumulate and make people question whether they want to continue to support the company and click on the buy now button so i do think that maybe some of the attempts to be a friendlier amazon are in response to a criticism that they do see as a bit of an existential problem you mentioned elon musk earlier he and bezos are two very very wealthy individuals but with very different personalities and the same goes for their space ambitions you have musk talking about being on mars and being a multi planetary civilization blue origin s mission statement is very different it s all about earth creating a space economy and lowering our environmental footprint it just seems far more rooted maybe more customer centric if you assume the customer is humanity any thoughts on that it s really funny because in the short term the companies are direct competitors putting aside all the space tourism and suborbital flights we ve seen over the past couple of weeks blue origin is competing and trying to catch up with spacex for contracts to send orbital rockets into space carry commercial and government satellites and take astronauts to the space station and then ultimately to the moon and blue origin keeps losing those contracts and then protesting that s because new glenn their rocket is years away from fruition and spacex has a complete collection of functioning rockets but the long term goal is different it s like we have these different visions attributed to the two ceos musk thinks that to ensure humanity s survival we need to be a multi planetary species so he wants to go to mars and set up a colony there and bezos simply thinks you might as well go to the north pole because it s going to be much more pleasant than mars you can actually breathe the air so instead his long term goal is to have huge space stations orbiting the earth comprised of material from the moon and harvesting the energy of the sun and that s humanity s future it s like we have these two science fiction geeks who read different books and have different visions is bezos in this for the long run he may be behind now but is he going to keep putting resources towards blue origin and do what we can because this is his legacy we re talking during a week in which bezos wrote an open letter to the nasa administrator basically pledging 2 billion of his own money to cover the development of a moon lander because nasa only had the funding to go and award spacex the contract so this guy is in it for the long term amazon and blue origin founder jeff bezos addresses the media about the new shepard rocket booster and crew capsule mockup at the 33rd space symposium in colorado springs colorado united states april 5 2017 via reuters isaiah j downing the question i think for people who are watching is should that money be deployed to more terrestrial philanthropic goals with a larger impact but for bezos this is his dream he gave his high school valedictorian speech about opening up the economy in space this is what he s going to do so yes in his remaining time on this planet i expect him to be fully into blue origin and funding this goal and look he basically just put his own life on the line to take the maiden crew voyage of the suborbital rocket new shepherd so i think he s fully in it is he as fully committed to the washington post i have no reason to think that he s not right now he has put the washington post on firm footing they ve got a new editor my understanding is it s profitable a great subscription business my only question is would he ever consider that his work is done there and move on but i have no reason to believe it i think that this has been successful for him and to some extent has probably burnished his image he appears to really love living in washington dc he s got a home there so yeah i think he s probably in that for the long term as well the book is called amazon unbound but certainly here in washington people see that as a problem they believe it needs to be bound do you think the company perceives a real regulatory risk i mean definitely a risk they re realistic they understand that the darts are aimed at them and that they will be coming from all sides from europe from the ftc from the state ags and from congress but i think they re ready for a fight and look breaking up a company or even trying to reform a company is a multi year effort you also have a conservative judiciary that just bounced back the ftc s lawsuit against facebook and i think it s really going to be difficult for regulators to make a case that amazon has any kind of a monopoly considering that it competes in these really large diverse markets from retail to enterprise computing and so i think in some ways they re ready for battle and they realize it s going to be a challenge but they re probably confident that despite the public rhetoric they ve got some advantages in the fight will the new ceo andy jassy be someone that people know will jassy be like a tim cook type of ceo where a lot of people know who he is i think so i think the difference is that cook could emerge from the shadow of steve jobs because unfortunately jobs passed away whereas bezos will be very much with us and i expect stories about amazon will still feature at least some bezos smiling photos or laughing photos they re going to try to bring jassy out he presents such a humbler target because he s not the wealthiest guy in the world he s very down to earth and he s quite an eloquent speaker and he s got an inspirational story starting at amazon almost at the very beginning so i do think they ll try to introduce him to the world and the question will be whether the media really focuses on jassy if bezos is still giving space press conferences and dipping in to launch amazon products do you think there s going to be a third volume to finish out an amazon trilogy what do you think might be the themes in that trilogy well i m in recovery now from barely getting through volume two i suppose in 10 years if the story is as good as it s been bezos has carved a whole new chapter the story of the regulatory pushback against amazon and the other tech companies comes to some satisfying conclusion yeah i would never rule it out i m not smart enough to have foreseen what amazon became after i published the everything store so it s hard to imagine where the story goes from here but i ll be watching it closely just like everybody else all right so pencil it in july 2031 back on this podcast thank you jim brad thanks a lot james pethokoukis is the dewitt wallace fellow at the american enterprise institute where he writes and edits the aeideas blog and hosts a weekly podcast political economy with james pethokoukis brad stone is the senior executive editor for global technology at bloomberg news as well as a writer for bloomberg businessweek

early 2019 but now americans are getting nervous that home prices are rising even faster than before the 2008 crash the 08 bust was one of the most financially disruptive events of the century housing is what i call a hot stove investment it burned a whole generation of americans and they ll be damned if they ever touch that stove again but this boom is nothing like 08 remember ninja mortgages banks handed out roughly 3 trillion to folks with no income no job and no assets leading up to 2008 you don t see any of this silliness today this year three in every four mortgage borrowers have super prime credit scores in other words fico scores above 760 unlike last time this boom isn t built on sand it s built on granite and it s being driven by a historic housing shortage that won t be resolved for years new analysis by the national association of realtors nar shows we need 6 4 million new homes just to meet current demand in fact nar data shows there are just 1 25 million homes for sale across the us that s one of the lowest readings since it started tracking data 40 years ago it would take just two and a half months to sell every home on the market the ceo of tricon residential who runs one of the largest pools of us rental homes recently told the wall street journal we get 6 000 calls a week for a home and we ve only got 200 available now a record number of house hunters are rushing into the market today s young adults as you probably know are called millennials they re the largest generation in us history bigger even than baby boomers and they re hitting prime homebuying age right now take a look at what i call the most important chart in housing it breaks down homeownership in america by age the percentage of kids who owned a home collapsed to record lows last decade but now that percentage is recovering as a tidal wave of young folks are buying their first homes millennials now make up the largest share of homebuyers for the first time ever according to nar in other words the largest generation in history is piling into the housing market at a time when there s a record shortage of homes to buy this is why us housing is smashing every record in the books millennials alone could snap up at least 15 million homes in the next decade according to mortgage specialist first american financial let me be clear this is the healthiest housing boom ever it s nerve wracking to watch home prices rise at their fastest pace in decades after living through 08 we re all waiting for it to crash again but this isn t another debt fueled binge as housing expert barry habib told me last year the most important driver of home prices is supply and demand today supply is tighter than it s ever been and with record numbers of house hunters entering the market it all but guarantees the housing boom has years left to run i m pounding the table on homebuilder stocks my research suggests you can at least double your money in builder stocks in the coming years many homebuilders went bust when the market turned in 08 many more had near death experiences this seared one thing into their minds don t overbuild ever again the number of new home starts recently jumped to their highest level since 2006 but builders are still being super cautious they re putting up just enough homes to meet demand rather than risk flooding the market new data from top real estate analysis firm john burns shows the number of finished homes collapsed 82 over the past year builders are in control of the most sought after good in america today homes this is frustrating buyers but it s great for homebuilders a record shortage of homes at a time when millions of first time buyers are rushing to buy all but guarantees housing will boom for the next decade the homebuilders etf xhb has doubled since i first wrote about this opportunity in early 2019 but the best is yet to come for this group now is a great time to buy xhb if you don t already own it
