fewer business wins during 2020 and reduced future revenue overall census growth for pace was below historical levels during 2020 and the first quarter of 2021 which reduced the carevention healthcare segment growth however since the second quarter of 2021 we have experienced some recovery from the covid 19 pandemic impact including with respect to pace census growth during the third quarter of

million or 29 to 50 6 million for the three months ended september 30 2021 compared to the same period in 2020 new business acquired from the october 2020 personica acquisition contributed approximately 1 9 million to this increase excluding the personica acquisition approximately 6 3 million of the increase was attributable to increased medication fulfillment volume from growth in the number of patients served by our existing clients medication mix of prescriptions filled and payer mix medications dispensed by our community pharmacy network on behalf of carevention healthcare contributed 2 6 million to the increase as a result of amended client agreements service revenue service revenue increased 4 8 million or 15 to 36 0 million for the three months ended september 30 2021 compared to the same period in 2020 carevention healthcare service revenues increased by approximately 3 5 million or 31 to 14 7 million for the three months ended september 30 2021 as compared to the same period in 2020 the acquisition of personica in october 2020 contributed approximately 2 2 million to the increase the remaining increase was attributable to new clients and growth with existing clients service revenues generated by our medwise healthcare segment increased by approximately 1 3 million or 7 to 21 2 million for the three months ended september 30 2021 as compared to the same period in 2020 this increase is attributable to a 1 7 million increase in software subscription services related to a new partnership with a leading online health insurance marketplace this increase was offset by a 350 thousand decrease in medication safety services which was primarily a result of a large mtm client contract that did not renew in 2021 and reduced fees in the final year of the emtm pilot program 36 table of contents cost of product revenue cost of product revenue increased 10 1 million or 35 to 38 8 million for the three months ended september 30 2021 as compared to the same period in 2020 new business acquired from the personica acquisition contributed approximately 1 8 million to the increase in cost of product revenue excluding the personica acquisition approximately 5 3 million of the change was due to increased medication volume from growth in the number of patients served by our existing customers medications dispensed by our community pharmacy network on behalf of carevention healthcare contributed 2 6 million to the increase as a result of amended client agreements the increase in cost of product revenue was also due to a 295 thousand increase in distribution charges related to higher shipping volume for the medications we fulfilled the remaining increase in cost of product revenue was primarily attributable to an increase in employee compensation costs including stock based compensation due to increased headcount to support our overall growth cost of service revenue cost of service revenue increased 1 8 million or 9 to 22 4 million for the three months ended september 30 2021 as compared to the same period in 2020 cost of service revenue related to our carevention healthcare segment increased 2 8 million or 38 to 10 3 million for the three months ended september 30 2021 as compared to the same period in 2020 of the total increase 1 1 million related to the acquisition of personica in october 2020 the remaining increase was primarily attributable to an increase in employee costs and investments in infrastructure in order to better scale the delivery of third party administrative services into markets outside of pace cost of service revenue related to our medwise healthcare segment decreased 1 1 million or 8 to 12 1 million for the three months ended september 30 2021 as compared to the same period in 2020 this decrease was due to hiring challenges during the quarter which resulted in lower employee compensation costs a decrease in the use of contract resources to deliver medication safety interventions and reduced printing and postage expenses research and development expenses research and development expenses decreased slightly by 117 thousand or 2 to 5 0 million for the three months ended september 30 2021 as compared to the same period in 2020 the decrease was primarily attributable to a higher capitalization rate related to development initiatives to enhance the software supporting our carevention healthcare and medwise healthcare offering partially offset by increased technology related expenses for new project management tools to support our software development teams sales and marketing expenses sales and marketing expenses increased 1 2 million or 24 to 6 2 million for the three months ended september 30 2021 from 5 0 million for the three months ended september 30 2020 the increase was primarily attributable to a 573 thousand increase in employee compensation costs related to additional headcount and increased employee benefits costs including bonus and commission expense a 227 thousand increase in marketing and public relations related expenses including consulting and advertising services and a 177 thousand increase in travel and conference related spend the remaining increase was primarily attributable to increased software licenses and technology related expenses related to an enhanced client and marketing management tool general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses increased 1 3 million or 11 to 16 9 million for the three months ended september 30 2021 as compared to the same period in 2020 the increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily attributable to higher employee compensation costs of 1 3 million mainly due to increased costs for health insurance premiums and other supplemental benefits including bonus expense also contributing to the increase in general administrative expenses was a 211 thousand increase in business insurance premiums and a 165 thousand increase in bad debt expense the acquisition of personica contributed 127 thousand to the increase in expenses which consisted primarily of employee compensation costs including stock based compensation and consulting expenses 37 table of contents partially offsetting these increases was a reduction in acquisition related costs of 572 thousand incurred in the prior year related to the acquisition of personica that was completed on october 5 2020 acquisition related contingent consideration expense during the third quarter of 2020 we elected to accelerate the payment of the acquisition related contingent consideration for an aggregate payment amount of 13 4 million which was satisfied by cash payments of 6 4 million and the issuance of 135 434 shares of our common stock with a fair value of 6 9 million during the three months ended september 30 2020 we recorded a 2 0 million charge to increase the fair value of the cognify acquisition related contingent consideration primarily due to the accelerated payment no charges were incurred during the three months ended september 30 2021 as the final amount of the cognify acquisition related contingent consideration liability was determined and fixed as of december 31 2020 in the first quarter of 2021 we made the final cash payment of 166 thousand in full satisfaction of the remaining acquisition related contingent consideration liability depreciation and amortization expenses depreciation and amortization expenses decreased slightly to 12 1 million for the three months ended september 30 2021 from 12 2 million for the three months ended september 30 2020 this decrease was primarily due to a 1 2 million decrease in amortization expense mainly due to increased amortization expense in the third quarter of 2020 related to changes in the estimated useful lives of certain intangible assets during 2020 and a 160 thousand decrease in depreciation expense the decrease was partially offset by a 1 3 million increase in the amortization of capitalized software related to new software functionality placed into service since 2020 to support our carevention healthcare and medwise healthcare segments interest expense interest expense for the three months ended september 30 2021 was 2 2 million a decrease of 2 5 million compared to the three months ended september 30 2020 of the total decrease approximately 3 0 million related to the adoption of asu 2020 06 on january 1 2021 which significantly reduced the amount of debt discount to be amortized the decrease was partially offset by 314 thousand of interest expense on the 2020 credit facility and 112 thousand of interest expense on the acquisition related notes payable related to the personica acquisition income taxes for the three months ended september 30 2021 we recorded income tax expense of 134 thousand primarily related to indefinite lived deferred tax liabilities for goodwill amortization which resulted in an effective tax rate of 0 8 the effective tax rate differs from the u s statutory tax rate primarily due to the full valuation allowance recorded that is currently limiting the realizability of our net deferred tax assets as of september 30 2021 accordingly the tax benefit was limited due to unbenefited losses in the three months ended september 30 2021 for the three months ended september 30 2020 we recorded an income tax benefit of 1 8 million which resulted in an effective tax rate of 7 8 the effective tax rate differed from the u s statutory tax rate primarily due to an increase in the valuation allowance that limited the realizability of our net deferred tax assets as of september 30 2020 accordingly the tax benefit was limited due to unbenefited losses in the three months ended september 30 2020 we calculate the provision for income taxes during interim periods by applying the estimated annual effective tax rate for the full year ordinary income or loss to the respective

compared to the same period in 2020 of the total increase 3 2 million related to the acquisition of personica in october 2020 the remaining increase was primarily related to investments in

related to our medwise healthcare segment decreased 5 0 million or 12 to 37 0 million for the nine months ended september 30 2021 as compared to the same period in 2020 this decrease was comprised of

2020 stock based compensation costs increased 1 7 million primarily as a result of equity awards granted during 2021 the increase in stock based compensation expense was offset by a decrease in

our carevention healthcare and medwise healthcare offerings 39 table of contents sales and marketing expenses sales and marketing expenses increased 3 2 million or 20 to 18 8 million for the nine months ended september 30 2021 from 15 6 million for the nine months ended september 30 2020 the increase was primarily attributable to a 1 9 million increase in employee compensation costs of which 908 thousand related to an increase in stock based compensation expense the remaining increase in employee compensation costs was related to additional employee headcount and increased costs related to employee benefits including bonus the increase also consisted of a 626 thousand increase in marketing related expenses including consulting and public relations services and a 384 thousand increase in software licenses and technology related expenses primarily related to an enhanced client and marketing management tool the remaining increase was attributable to increased travel and conference

services excluding costs related to the personica acquisition general and administrative expenses increased by approximately 4 9 million the increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily attributable to higher employee compensation costs of 4 1 million which included a 2 5 million increase in stock based compensation expense primarily related to equity awards granted during

recruiting expenses employee relations as well as bad debt expense acquisition related contingent consideration expense during the third quarter of 2020 we elected to accelerate the payment of the acquisition related contingent consideration for an aggregate payment of 13 4 million which was satisfied by cash payments of 6 4 million and the issuance of 135 434 shares of our common stock with a fair value of 6 9 million during the nine months ended september 30 2020 we recorded a 2 6 million charge to increase the fair value of the cognify acquisition related contingent consideration primarily due to the accelerated payment no charges were incurred during the nine months ended september 30 2021 as the final amount of the cognify acquisition related contingent consideration liability was determined and fixed as of december 31 2020 in the first quarter of 2021 we made the final cash payment of 166 thousand in full satisfaction of the remaining acquisition related contingent consideration liability depreciation and amortization expenses depreciation and amortization expenses increased 3 0 million or 9 to 35 3 million for the nine months ended september 30 2021 from 32 3 million for the nine months ended september 30 2020 this increase was due to a 3 6 million increase in the amortization of capitalized software related to new software functionality placed into service since 2020 to support our carevention healthcare and medwise healthcare segments this increase was partially offset by a 468 thousand decrease in amortization expense primarily due to higher amortization expense in the third quarter of 2020 related to changes in the estimated useful lives of certain intangible assets during 2020 interest expense interest expense for the nine months ended september 30 2021 was 7 0 million a decrease of 7 0 million compared to the nine months ended september 30 2020 of the total decrease approximately 8 7 million related to the adoption of asu 2020 06 on january 1 2021 which significantly reduced the amount of debt discount to be amortized the decrease was partially offset by 842 thousand of interest expense on the 2020 credit facility and 474 thousand of interest expense on the acquisition related notes payable related to the personica acquisition 40 table of contents income taxes on february 12 2021 we received a private letter ruling from the internal revenue service which determined based on information submitted and representations made by us that we met the requirements to deduct the interest expense resulting from the amortization of the debt discount associated with the 2026 notes as a result during the nine months ended september 30 2021 we recorded a deferred tax asset of 26 3 million and a corresponding 26 3 million increase to our valuation allowance as of september 30 2021 we have recorded a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets for the nine months ended september 30 2021 we recorded income tax expense of 466 thousand primarily related to indefinite lived deferred tax liabilities for goodwill amortization which resulted in an effective tax rate of 0 8 the effective tax rate differs from the u s statutory tax rate primarily due to the full valuation allowance recorded that is currently limiting the realizability of our net deferred tax assets as of september 30 2021 accordingly the tax benefit was limited due to unbenefited losses in the nine months ended september 30 2021 for the nine months ended september 30 2020 we recorded an income tax benefit of 5 7 million which resulted in an effective tax rate of 10 2 the effective tax rate differed from the u s statutory tax rate primarily due to an increase in the valuation allowance that limited the realizability of our net deferred tax assets as of september 30 2020 accordingly the tax benefit was limited due to unbenefited losses in the nine months ended september 30 2020 we calculate the

expense we consider acquisition related expense to include nonrecurring direct transaction and integration costs severance and the impact of purchase accounting adjustments related to the fair value of acquired deferred revenue adjusted ebitda margin is calculated as adjusted ebitda as a percentage of revenue we present adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin because they are some of the measures used by our management and board of directors to understand and evaluate our core operating performance and we consider them important supplemental measures of performance we believe these metrics are commonly used by the financial community and we present them to enhance investors understanding of our operating performance and cash flows we believe adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin provide investors and other users of our financial information consistency and comparability with our past financial performance our management uses adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin as measures of operating performance to assist in comparing performance from period to period on a consistent basis to prepare and approve our annual budget and to develop short and long term

our results of operations as determined in accordance with gaap in particular although depreciation and amortization are non cash charges the assets being depreciated and amortized may have to be

ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin do not reflect cash interest income or expense adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin do not reflect changes in or cash requirements for our working capital needs adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin do not reflect the potentially dilutive impact of stock based compensation adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin do not reflect tax payments that may represent a reduction in cash available to us and other companies including companies in our industry may calculate adjusted ebitda adjusted ebitda margin or similarly titled measures differently which reduces their usefulness as a comparative measure because of these and other limitations you should consider adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin alongside gaap financial performance

diluted eps excludes the impact of certain items and therefore has not been calculated in accordance with gaap we believe the exclusion of these items assists in providing a more complete

on a going forward basis our management uses this measure along with corresponding gaap financial measures to manage our business and to evaluate our performance compared to prior periods and the marketplace we define adjusted diluted eps as net loss before fair value adjustments for acquisition related contingent consideration amortization of acquired intangibles amortization of debt discount

subsidiaries to which beneficient usa provides administrative and technical services we believe that beneficient s operations will generally produce higher risk adjusted returns than those we can achieve from life insurance policies acquired in the secondary market however returns on equity in life settlements especially with the current availability of financings on favorable terms appear to be an attractive option to diversify our exposure to alternative assets and we have begun exploring the feasibility of acquiring such policies furthermore although we believe that our portfolio of life insurance policies is a meaningful component of a growing diversified alternative asset portfolio we continue to explore strategic alternatives for our life insurance portfolio aimed at maximizing its value including a possible sale refinancing recapitalization partnership reinsurance guarantees life insurance operations or other transactions involving of our life insurance portfolio as well as pursuing other alternatives to increase our exposure to alternative assets these operations are in addition to allocating capital to provide liquidity to holders of a broader range of alternative assets which we currently provide through gwg holdings and gwg life s investments in beneficient gwg holdings completed the transactions with beneficient in part to provide the company with a significant increase in assets and common stockholders equity in addition the transactions with beneficient may provide us with the opportunity for a diversified source of future earnings within the alternative asset industry we believe the beneficient transactions and the other strategies we are pursuing will transform gwg holdings from a niche provider of liquidity to owners of life insurance to a diversified provider of financial products and services with exposure to a broad range of alternative assets critical accounting policies critical accounting estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap requires us to make significant judgments estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period we base our judgments estimates and assumptions on historical experience and on various other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results could differ materially from these estimates we evaluate our judgments estimates and assumptions on a regular basis and make changes accordingly material estimates that are particularly susceptible to change in the near term relate to determining the assumptions used in estimating the fair value of our investments in life insurance policies determining the grant date fair value for equity based compensation awards determining the allowance for loan losses as an input to the allocation of income loss to beneficient s equity holders and evaluation of potential impairment of goodwill and other intangibles we believe these estimates are likely to have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements and accordingly believe these to be our critical accounting estimates below we discuss the critical accounting policies associated with these estimates page 43 table of contents valuation of life insurance policies we account for the purchase of life insurance policies in accordance with asc 325 30 investments in insurance contracts which requires us to use either the investment method or the fair value method we have elected to account for all of our life insurance policies using the fair value method we initially record our purchase of life insurance policies at the transaction price which is the amount paid for the policy inclusive of all external fees and costs associated with the acquisition at each subsequent reporting period we remeasure the investment at fair value in its entirety and recognize the change in fair value as unrealized gain loss in the current period net of premiums paid changes in the fair value of our life insurance portfolio are based on periodic evaluations and are recorded in our consolidated statements of operations as changes in fair value of life insurance policies the fair value of our life insurance policies is determined as the net present value of the life insurance portfolio s future expected cash flows policy benefits received and required premium payments that incorporates life expectancy estimates obtained when the policy was purchased and current discount rate assumptions we refer to our valuation methodology as the longest life expectancy methodology this methodology utilizes a portfolio mortality multiplier pmm that allows us to fit projections to actual results which provides a basis to forecast future performance more accurately the table below compares the actual to expected a2e mortality cash flow experience of our life insurance portfolio using this methodology we have achieved expected mortality cash flow experience accuracy of 96 under the longest life expectancy methodology through december 31 2020 should performance sufficiently deviate in the future from these projections the a2e analysis will be re examined to determine if the resultant pmm still results in the most accurate fitting of the projections to actual results adjustments to the pmm would then be made based on that analysis if warranted a discount rate is used to calculate the net present value of the expected cash flows the discount rate used to calculate fair value of our portfolio incorporates the guidance provided by asc 820 fair value measurements and disclosures we utilized an 8 25 discount rate to estimate the fair value of our portfolio of life insurance policies at both december 31 2020 and 2019 as we have ceased acquiring insurance policies we no longer have direct access market based factors that previously served as a key input to our discount rate however we engaged a third party firm to provide recent market data on comparable assets to support our discount rate as of december 31 2020 we also continue to use fixed income market interest rates credit exposure to the issuing insurance companies and our estimate of the operational risk yield premium a purchaser would apply to the future cash flows derived from our portfolio of life insurance policies as inputs to our discount rate the determination of the discount rate used in the valuation of the company s life insurance policies requires management judgment and incorporates information that is reasonably available to management as of the date of the valuation the discount rate we utilize assumes an orderly and arms length transaction i e a non distressed transaction in which neither seller nor buyer is compelled to engage in the transaction which is consistent with related gaap guidance the carrying page 44 table of contents value of policies held at the end of each quarterly reporting period is adjusted to current fair value using the fair value discount rate applied to the entire portfolio as of that reporting date we engaged clearlife limited owner of the clarinet ls actuarial portfolio pricing software we use to prepare a net present value calculation of our life insurance portfolio as of december 31 2020 clearlife limited processed policy data future premium data life expectancy estimate data and other actuarial information to calculate a net present value for our portfolio using the specified discount rate of 8 25 clearlife limited independently calculated the net present value of our portfolio of 1 058 policies to be 791 9 million and furnished us with a letter documenting its calculation a copy of such letter is filed as exhibit 99 1 to this report life expectancy estimates and market discount rates for a portfolio of life insurance policies are inherently uncertain and the effect of changes in estimates may be significant for example if the life expectancy estimates were increased or decreased by four and eight months on each outstanding policy and the discount rates were increased or decreased by 1 and 2 with all other variables held constant the fair value of our investment in life insurance policies would increase or decrease as summarized below in thousands change in life expectancy estimates minus minus plus plus 8 months 4 months 4 months 8 months

additional information related to our valuation of life insurance policies equity based compensation the company measures and recognizes compensation expense for all equity based payments at fair value on the grant date over the requisite service period gwg holdings uses the black scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options and stock appreciation rights for restricted stock grants including restricted stock units if any fair value is determined as of the closing price of gwg holdings common stock on the date of grant as it is not publicly traded beneficient uses various methods to determine the grant date fair value of its equity based compensation awards the fair value of the beneficient management partners l p bmp equity units is determined on the grant date using a probability weighted discounted cash flow analysis this fair value measurement is based on significant inputs not observable in the market and thus represents a level 3 measurement within the fair value hierarchy the resultant probability weighted cash flows are then discounted using a rate that reflects the uncertainty surrounding the expected outcomes which the company believes is appropriate and representative of a market participant assumption the fair value of ben lp s restricted equity units reus was determined for substantially all of the awards granted in 2020 by using the valuation techniques consistent with those utilized to determine the acquisition date equity values arising from gwg holdings obtaining a controlling financial interest in beneficient these valuation techniques relied upon the opm backsolve approach under the market method as more fully described in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for the reus granted in the latter portion of 2020 which is a de minimis amount of the total 2020 reus we utilized valuation techniques consisting of the income approach and market approach for awards granted in 2019 the fair value of the reus was estimated using recent equity transactions involving third parties which provided the company with observable fair value information sufficient for estimating the grant date fair value beneficient s income allocation net income loss attributable to noncontrolling interest holders is subject to beneficient s income allocation in accordance with the governing limited partnership agreement of bch as more fully described in note 11 page 45 table of contents the consolidated financial statements of beneficient reflect the assets liabilities revenues expenses investment income and cash flows of beneficient including after december 31 2019 all of the trusts in the exalt plantm on a gross basis and a portion of the economic interests certain of the exalt trusts held by the residual beneficiaries are attributed to noncontrolling interests in the accompanying consolidated financial statements interest income earned by beneficient from the exalt trusts is eliminated in its consolidation however because the eliminated amounts are earned from and funded by its noncontrolling interests beneficient s attributable share of the net income from the exalt trusts is increased by the amounts eliminated accordingly the elimination in consolidation of interest income and for periods after december 31 2019 certain fee revenue has no effect on net income loss attributable to beneficient or holders of common units for purposes of income allocation to beneficient s equity holders interest income is generally comprised of contractual interest which is computed at a variable rate compounding monthly interest recognized on certain of the exalt loans through the effective yield method and an amortized discount that is recognized ratably over the life of the exalt loan as a result of the change of control event discussed in note 9 to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements on december 31 2019 and the resulting valuation performed under asc 805 the existing loan portfolio between ben and the exalt trusts was evaluated as of december 31 2019 for credit deterioration based on the intentions of all parties that the income allocations provisions of ben operate under us gaap as if the exalt trusts were not consolidated for financial reporting purposes further as required under asc 805 each exalt loans between beneficient and the exalt trusts was evaluated and classified as either purchased credit impaired pci or non purchased credit impaired non pci for pci loans expected cash flows as of the date of valuation in excess of the fair value of loans are recorded as interest income over the life of the loans using a level yield method if the timing and amount of the future cash flows is reasonably estimable subsequently increases in cash flows over those expected at the acquisition date are recognized prospectively as interest income decreases in expected cash flows due to credit deterioration are recognized by recording an allowance for loan loss for non pci loans the difference between the fair value and unpaid principal balance of the loan as of the date of valuation is amortized or accreted to interest income over the contractual life of the loans using the effective interest method in the event of prepayment the remaining unamortized amount is recognized in interest income which is eliminated upon the consolidation of the exalt trusts for financial reporting purposes allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses which is eliminated in consolidation is an input to beneficient s allocation of income to equity holders of ben lp the allowance for loan losses is a valuation allowance for probable incurred credit losses in the portfolio management s determination of the allowance is based upon an evaluation of the loan portfolio impaired loans economic conditions volume growth and composition of the collateral to the loan portfolio and other risks inherent in the portfolio currently management individually reviews all exalt loans due to the low volume and non homogenous nature of the current portfolio management relies heavily on statistical analysis current nav and distribution performance of the underlying alternative asset interests and industry trends related to alternative asset investments to estimate losses management evaluates the adequacy of the allowance by reviewing relevant internal and external factors that affect credit quality the cash flows from the underlying alternative assets interests are the sole source of repayment for the exalt loans and related interest beneficient recognizes any charge off in the period in which it is confirmed therefore impaired exalt loans are written down to their estimated net present value interest income for purposes of determining income allocations to beneficient s equity holders is adjusted for any allowance for loan losses which was approximately 5 4 million for the year ended december 31 2020 goodwill and identifiable intangible assets goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets are initially recorded at their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition goodwill and other intangible assets having an indefinite useful life are not amortized for financial statement purposes in the event that facts and circumstances indicate that the goodwill or other identifiable intangible assets may be impaired an interim impairment test would be required intangible assets with finite lives are amortized over their useful lives we perform required annual impairment tests of our goodwill and other intangible assets as of october 1 for our reporting units the goodwill impairment test requires us to make judgments and assumptions the test consists of estimating the fair value of each reporting unit based on valuation techniques including a discounted cash flow model using revenue and profit forecasts and recent industry transaction and trading multiples of our peers we then compare those estimated fair values with the carrying values of the assets and liabilities of each reporting unit which includes the allocated goodwill if the estimated fair value is less than the carrying value we will recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount page 46 table of contents exceeds the reporting unit s fair value however any loss recognized will not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit for 2020 the annual goodwill impairment analysis did not result in any impairment charges our impairment evaluation included a qualitative assessment which considered whether there were indicators of potential impairment following the recent completion of the business combination accounting in addition our evaluation included a quantitative analysis which included multiple assumptions including estimated discounted cash flows and other estimates that may change over time for example a key assumption in determining the fair value of our reporting units is forecasting free cash flow generated by our business over the next five years and includes assumptions regarding expected growth of new service offerings and products while our assumption reflects management s best estimates of future performance the estimates assume beneficient capturing a significant market share of liquidity transactions during the next five years leading to a substantial rate of growth of new service offerings and products revenues and assets over the next five years ending december 31 2025 these estimations are uncertain to occur and to the extent the company falls short of achieving our expected growth in revenues and assets over the next four years material impairments of our goodwill may occur in the near term for example a 15 decline in our annual projected volume of liquidity transactions reflected in the company s forecasts would require impairments to begin to be recorded assuming all other assumptions on which the forecasts are built remain constant because the company s forecasts are predicated on estimating future volume for new service offerings and products the company s actual future volume of liquidity transactions reflected in the company s forecasts may fall short of management s forecasts by 15 or greater and may result in a partial or full write down of our goodwill balance which totaled 2 4 billion at december 31 2020 in light of beneficient s significant recurring losses from operations negative cash flows from operations and delays in executing its business plans there could be potential triggering events identified and resulting impairment of goodwill recorded during the annual impairment test during the fourth quarter of 2021 while management can and has implemented strategies to address these events changes in operating plans or adverse changes in the future could reduce the underlying cash flows used to estimate fair values and could result in a decline in fair value that would trigger future impairment charges of the reporting unit s goodwill balance in addition as reflected in note 23 to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements the company is evaluating potential strategic transactions that if consummated may result in the deconsolidation of beneficient as gwg holdings will no longer own a controlling financial interest in beneficient as we evaluate various strategic changes for the investment in beneficient we may make further changes to the company s forecasted cash flows and such changes could result in losses upon deconsolidation of our subsidiary or may result in increased risk of future goodwill impairment charges if future discounted cash flows become less than those projected by us future impairment charges may become necessary that could have a materially adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition in the period in which the write off occurs recent developments we define recent developments as material transactions or matters that occurred in the most recent fiscal quarter or in the period between the end of the fiscal quarter and the filing of the quarterly or annual

revenue realized from maturities of life insurance policies we recognize the difference between the face value of the policy benefits and carrying value when an insured event has occurred and determine that collection of the policy benefits is realizable and reasonably assured revenue from a transaction must meet both criteria in order to be recognized we generally collect the face value of the life insurance policy from the insurance company within 45 days of our notification of the insured s mortality but this collection time varies depending on the insurance company and individual policy change in fair value of life insurance policies we value our life insurance portfolio investments for each reporting period in accordance with the fair value principles discussed herein which reflects the expected receipt of policy benefits in future periods net of premium costs as shown in our consolidated financial statements investment income includes the change in net asset value of the alternative assets held by certain of the exalt trusts as well as the change in fair value of repurchase options issued by certain of the exalt trusts interest income during the year ended december 31 2019 and thus prior to the consolidation of beneficient interest income primarily included interest income on the promissory note and commercial loan agreement interest earned on the promissory note and the commercial loan agreement was eliminated in consolidation with beneficient beginning january 1 2020 as such interest income during the year ended december 31 2020 only includes interest earned from policy benefits receivable and cash held in banks other income includes changes in the fair value of beneficient s investment in put options l bond redemption fees and other miscellaneous income additionally includes income totaling 36 3 million recognized during the second quarter of 2020 by beneficient as a result of the forfeiture of vested equity based compensation related to one former director of beneficient during the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 our main components of expense are summarized below interest expense includes interest incurred under the second amended and restated senior credit facility with lnv corporation as amended from time to time lnv credit facility as well as interest on gwg holdings l bonds seller trust l bonds and other outstanding indebtedness including beneficient s debt due to related parties when we issue debt we amortize the financing costs commissions and other fees associated with such indebtedness over the

employee benefits also included are significant non cash compensation expenses totaling 110 7 million related to beneficient s equity incentive plans for the year ended december 31 2020 selling general and administrative expenses we recognize and record expenses incurred in our business operations including operations related to the purchasing and servicing of life insurance policies the origination and servicing of exalt loans and costs associated with trust administration these expenses include legal and professional fees sales marketing occupancy and other expenditures additional components of our net earnings include earnings loss from equity method investment prior to the investment and exchange agreements on december 31 2019 we accounted for gwg holdings investment in the common units of ben lp common units using the equity method under this method we recorded our share of the net earnings or losses attributable to holders of common units on a one quarter lag as a separate line on our consolidated statements of operations we also account for gwg holdings investment in foxo as an equity method investment which is also included in earnings loss from equity method investment in our consolidated statements of operations we had losses of 7 3 million and 4 1 million from equity method investments during the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 respectively gain on consolidation of equity method investment in conjunction with the consolidation of beneficient on december 31 2019 we remeasured our preexisting equity method investment to fair value resulting in a gain due to page 54 table of contents the increase in the estimated fair value compared to our existing book value the gain on consolidation of beneficient on december 31 2019 was 243 0 million refer to note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for further information results of operations 2020 compared to 2019 the following is our analysis of the results of operations for the periods indicated below this analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes dollar values in thousands net income loss attributable to common shareholders net loss attributable to common shareholders was 168 5 million for 2020 compared to net income attributable to common shareholders of 70 5 million for 2019 the results of operations for 2020 reflect the consolidation of beneficient compared to an equity method investment in 2019 the year ended december 31 2020 includes significant non cash equity based compensation expense of 110 7 million related to beneficient s equity incentive plans the net income for 2019 was primarily driven by the net gain of 243 0 million realized upon consolidation of beneficient more details regarding revenue and expenses in 2020 compared to 2019 are included in the discussion below revenue from secondary life insurance year ended december 31 2020 2019 revenue realized from maturities of life insurance

event of face value matured 46 0 55 2 revenue from changes in estimated probabilistic cash flows net of premiums paid was a charge of 8 0 million in 2020 compared to a credit of 1 6 million in 2019 the decrease of 25 7 million in gain on life insurance policies for the year ended december 31 2020 over the comparable prior year period was driven by a combination of no gain on policy acquisitions maturities of life insurance policies with a higher cumulative cost basis and higher premiums paid the company did not purchase any life insurance policies during 2020 the face value of policies purchased in 2019 was 97 3 million the resulting unrealized gain on acquisition was 6 9 million in 2019 the absence of an unrealized gain on acquisition in the current period is the result of a strategic decision to significantly reduce capital allocated to purchasing additional life insurance policies through the secondary market and to increase capital allocated toward providing liquidity to a broader range of alternative assets primarily through additional investments in beneficient on december 31 2019 gwg page 55 table of contents holdings obtained the right to appoint a majority of the board of directors of the general partner of ben lp as a result of this change of control event we reported the results of ben lp and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis beginning on the transaction date of december 31 2019 we believe that beneficient s operations will generally produce higher risk adjusted returns than those we can achieve from life insurance policies acquired in the secondary market however returns on equity in life settlements especially with the current availability of financings on favorable terms appear to be an attractive option to diversify our exposure to alternative assets and we have begun exploring the feasibility of acquiring such policies furthermore although we believe that our portfolio of life insurance policies is a meaningful component of a growing diversified alternative asset portfolio we continue to explore strategic alternatives for our life insurance portfolio aimed at maximizing its value including a possible sale refinancing recapitalization partnership reinsurance guarantees life insurance operations or other transactions involving of our life insurance portfolio as well as pursuing other alternatives to increase our exposure to alternative assets the face value of matured policies was 125 1 million for each period presented the net revenue recognized at maturity was 57 6 million and 69 1 million respectively reflecting a decrease in revenue attributable to maturity events of 11 5 million primarily from maturities of policies with a higher cumulative cost basis in 2020 compared to 2019 there were no net revenue charges from change in life expectancy evaluation in 2020 compared to a charge of 2 3 million in 2019 the resulting net revenue increase of 2 3 million primarily resulted from refinement of

certain of the exalt trusts and 61 7 million increase in fair value of repurchase options issued by certain of the exalt trusts interest income decreased 14 1 million during the year ended december 31 2020 compared to the same period in 2019 primarily due to the consolidation of beneficient which eliminated interest earned on the promissory note and commercial loan agreement beginning january 1 2020 interest income on the promissory note entered into on may 31 2019 was 2 2 million during 2019 interest income earned on the commercial loan between gwg life and beneficient was 11 3 million during the year ended december 31 2019 interest income recognized during the year ended december 31 2020 and 2019 also includes interest earned from policy benefits receivable and cash held in banks which in the aggregate was 1 3 million and 2 1 million respectively the decrease was driven by lower average cash balances and slightly lower interest rates in 2020 compared to 2019 other income increased during the year ended december 31 2020 compared to the same period in 2019 other income for the year ended 2020 includes 36 3 million of income recognized during the second quarter of 2020 by beneficient as a result of the forfeiture of vested equity based compensation related to one former director of beneficient a substantial majority of the former director s equity based compensation units were fully vested and the related expense was recorded in prior periods this income was offset by a 7 8 million decrease to the fair value of beneficient s put options during 2020 other income during the year ended december 31 2019 includes l bond early redemption fees and other miscellaneous income from legacy initiatives of gwg holdings page 56 table of contents interest and operating

financing costs increased 39 8 million during the year ended december 31 2020 compared to the same period in 2019 the increase in interest expense was primarily due to the increase in the average outstanding l bonds in 2020 compared to 2019 contributing 26 5 million of increased interest expense including amortization of deferred financing costs also the consolidation of beneficient beginning december 31 2019 increased interest expense by 11 3 million for the year ended december 31 2020 compared to the same period in 2019 related to beneficient s debt due to related parties additionally 3 8 million of increased interest expense including amortization of deferred financing costs during the year ended december 31 2020 compared to the same period in 2019 was due to increased interest paid on the lnv credit facility associated with a higher average principal balance outstanding finally these increases were partially offset by a 1 8 million decrease in interest expense on seller trusts l bonds related to the portion of seller trust l bonds eliminated as of september 30 2020 as a result of the collateral swap discussed in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements the increase in employee compensation and benefits in 2020 compared to 2019 was primarily related to the consolidation of beneficient on december 31 2019 specifically the company recognized 110 7 million of equity based compensation expense during the year ended december 31 2020 related to beneficient s equity incentive plans beneficient s board of directors adopted the equity incentive plans in 2018 and 2019 and approved the granting of equity incentive awards during the second quarter of 2019 to certain directors and in the first quarter of 2020 to certain employees awards are generally subject to service based vesting over a multi year period from the recipient s date of hire though some awards fully vested upon the grant date as of december 31 2020 over 78 of the awards granted under beneficient s equity incentive plans had vested expense associated with these awards is based on the fair value of the equity on the date of grant as ben lp s equity is not publicly traded the fair value of the equity awards is estimated on the grant date using the most recent valuation received from a reputable third party valuation firm which provides the company with observable fair value information sufficient for estimating the grant date fair value in addition to beneficient s equity based compensation expense we recognized additional retention severance and other costs in the first quarter of 2020 related to the relocation of gwg holdings principal offices from minneapolis to dallas in late 2019 the increase in legal and professional fees in 2020 compared to 2019 is primarily the result of the consolidation of beneficient on december 31 2019 which added 19 0 million of legal and professional fees during the year ended december 31 2020 the increase attributable to the consolidation of beneficient was partially offset by lower consulting fees during 2020 compared to 2019 the increase in other expenses during the year ended december 31 2020 compared to the same period of 2019 is primarily the result of the consolidation of beneficient on december 31 2019 which added 7 6 million of other expenses during 2020 these increases were partially offset by lower business insurance contract labor and other operating expenses of gwg holdings and subsidiaries during the comparable periods foxo initiatives during 2019 we incurred 5 5 million of expenses related to the development of intellectual property surrounding advanced epigenetic testing technology these expenses were included in the loss from our equity method investment in foxo during 2020 page 57 table of contents on november 13 2020 foxo bioscience llc converted to a corporation and is now known as foxo technologies inc gwg s previous membership interest in the llc converted to preferred equity in foxo we believe that as a separate entity rather than as a small subsidiary of a large financial services holding company the foxo businesses can reach their maximum potential in terms of marketing and branding attraction of talent appropriate peer group comparisons and ultimately return to its owners we expect foxo s costs to increase in the future which will affect our consolidated earnings through our earnings loss from equity method investment under gwg holdings subscription agreement with foxo we are obligated to invest approximately 20 0 million in foxo over a two year period ending in october 2021 of which 16 2 million has been funded through december 31 2020 income taxes we realized 16 4 million in income tax benefit and 71 9 million in income tax expense for the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 respectively which resulted in effective tax rates of 7 9 and 34 8 compared to the statutory federal income tax rate of 21 0 for both periods the following table

with respect to the fair value of the life insurance portfolio as of both december 31 2020 and 2019 valuation allowances were recorded against the total amount of non permanent deferred tax assets indefinite lived deferred tax assets of 2 8 million in 2020 were comprised of an interest expense limitation under internal revenue code section 163 j and the tax effected net operating loss nol created beginning in 2019 at december 31 2020 we had federal nol carryforwards of 58 0 million resulting in related deferred tax assets of 12 2 million and state nol carryforwards of 24 3 million resulting in related deferred tax assets of 1 9 million at december 31 2019 we had federal nol carryforwards of 29 7 million resulting in related deferred tax assets of 6 2 million and state nol carryforwards of 29 6 million resulting in related deferred tax assets of 2 3 million the nol carryforwards subject to expiration i e those generated prior to 2018 will begin to expire in 2031 future utilization of nol carryforwards is subject to limitations under section 382 of the internal revenue code this section generally relates to a more than 50 percent change in ownership over a three year period as a result of the exchange transaction a change in ownership for tax purposes only has occurred as of december 28 2018 as such the annual utilization of our net operating losses generated prior to the ownership change is limited however net unrealized built in gains on our life insurance policies result in an increase in the section 382 limit over the five year recognition period which resulted in 0 5 million of current tax liability in 2020 and a nominal amount in 2019 after the change of control transaction with ben lp on december 31 2019 gwg holdings moved its headquarters from minnesota to texas this move resulted in a change in the state deferred tax rate from 9 8 to 0 in the third quarter 2020 gwg holdings was allocated a gain from its investment in ben lp the tax effects of these items were recorded as discrete items the company currently records a valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets that cannot be realized by the future reversal of existing temporary differences due to the uncertain timing of the reversal of certain of these temporary differences associated with the constraint described below they cannot be considered as a source of future taxable income for page 58 table of contents purposes of determining a valuation allowance therefore the vast majority of the deferred tax liability cannot be utilized in determining the realizability of the deferred tax assets due to a prior deemed ownership change net operating loss carryforwards are subject to section 382 of the internal revenue code the company reassessed its valuation allowance during the third quarter of 2020 and determined it will no longer utilize the reversal of a temporary difference related to gwg holdings preferred equity ownership in ben lp until such time as the preferred equity is no longer constrained as a source of income to realize existing deferred tax assets related to the net operating loss and internal revenue code section 163 j limitations as a result we recorded a large net deferred tax liability as of december 31 2020 the effects of the reassessment of the valuation allowance on the deferred tax liability as of december 31 2019 are reflected in note 21 to the consolidated financial statements the net deferred tax liability as of december 31 2020 is specifically related to gwg life s investment in the preferred series a subclass 1 unit accounts described in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements the disposition of this investment is constrained by the pledge and security agreement in favor of the holders of the l bonds of gwg holdings as such the timing of recognition of the necessary taxable income related to this investment and the future reversal of this temporary difference cannot be predicted we continue to monitor and evaluate the rationale for recording a full valuation allowance for the net amount of the deferred tax assets in excess of the deferred tax liabilities that are not constrained we intend to continue maintaining a full valuation allowance on these net deferred tax assets until there is sufficient evidence to support the reversal of all or some portion of these allowances release of the valuation allowance would result in the recognition of certain deferred tax assets and a decrease to income tax expense for the period the release is recorded however the exact timing and amount of the valuation allowance release are subject to change on the basis of the level of profitability that we are able to actually achieve on march 27 2020 congress passed and the president signed into law the coronavirus aid relief and economic security act the cares act which included significant changes to u s federal income tax law however the only change that is expected to affect the company is the modification to section 163 j which increased the allowable business interest deduction from 30 of adjusted taxable income to 50 of adjusted taxable income revenue and earnings before tax by reportable segment 2020 compared to 2019 we have two reportable segments 1 beneficient and 2 secondary life insurance corporate other includes certain activities not allocated to

secondary life insurance revenue decreased by 26 6 million for the year ended december 31 2020 over the comparable period in 2019 primarily as a result of a 25 7 million decrease in gain on life insurance policies driven by a combination of no gain on policy acquisitions maturities of life insurance policies with a higher cumulative cost basis and higher premiums paid also contributing to the decrease in the secondary life insurance segment revenues was a decrease of 0 9 million in interest and other miscellaneous income during 2020 compared to 2019 beneficient segment revenue for the year ended december 31 2020 represents the consolidated operations of beneficient compared to an equity method investment in beneficient during the same period in 2019 as such the year ended 2020 includes 61 7 million of investment income recognized related to repurchase options issued by certain of the exalt trusts and a 17 6 million downward adjustment to nav of alternative assets held by certain of the exalt trusts which are consolidated subsidiaries of ben lp whereas the year ended 2019 primarily includes page 59 table of contents 11 3 million of interest income on the commercial loan between gwg life and ben lp and 2 2 million of interest income on the promissory note between gwg life and the exalt trusts both of which were eliminated in consolidation beginning december 31 2019 additionally there was 36 3 million of income recognized during the second quarter by beneficient as a result of the forfeiture of vested equity based compensation related to one former director of beneficient a substantial majority of the former director s equity based compensation units were fully vested and the related expense was recorded in prior periods finally this was offset by a 7 8

holdings investment in foxo the primary drivers of the changes in earnings loss before tax for the year ended december 31 2020 compared to the same period of 2019 were as follows secondary life insurance loss before tax increased by 32 0 million as a result of the following 25 7 million decrease in the gain on life insurance policies net as described above in the revenue discussion and 14 2 million increase in interest expense as a result of higher average debt outstanding partially offset by a decrease in operating expenses of 8 9 million primarily resulting from lower employee compensation and benefits lower business insurance costs and lower legal fees beneficient segment experienced a net loss of 139 6 million in 2020 compared to earnings of 222 4 million in 2019 primarily due to the consolidation of beneficient on december 31 2019 during 2019 we accounted for beneficient using the equity method on a one quarter lag and the amount reported represents our proportionate share of the losses of beneficient for the period presented the one quarter lag was discontinued with the consolidation of beneficient on december 31 2019 the consolidation of beneficient resulted in a net gain of 243 0 million related to the remeasurement to fair value of gwg holdings preexisting equity method investment in beneficient the loss of beneficient for the year ended december 31 2020 was primarily driven by 107 8 million of non cash charges for equity incentive compensation during the year ended december 31 2020 beneficient s losses were partially offset by 36 3 million of income recognized as a result of the forfeiture of vested equity based compensation related to one former director of beneficient as described in the revenue comparison discussion above corporate and other operating loss was lower during december 31 2020 compared to 2019 primarily due to lower legal and consulting fees as we incurred higher fees in 2019 as a result of the beneficient transactions page 60 table of contents liquidity and capital resources as of december 31 2020 and 2019 we had approximately 124 2 million and 115 8 million respectively in combined

we had approximately 54 3 million in combined available cash cash equivalents and restricted cash besides funding operating expenditures we are obligated to pay other items such as interest payments and debt maturities and preferred stock dividends and redemptions we have historically financed our businesses primarily through a combination of l bond sales preferred stock sales the lnv credit facility and the nf credit facility we have also financed our business through proceeds from life insurance policy benefit receipts cash distributions from the exalt trusts alternative asset portfolio dividends and interest on investments and beneficient s debt due to related parties we have traditionally used proceeds from these sources for policy acquisition policy premiums and servicing costs working capital and financing expenditures including paying principal interest and dividends we have also used proceeds to allocate capital to beneficient however if ben lp becomes an independent company per the term sheet discussed in the recent developments section above the company expects that ben lp would reduce its reliance on gwg holdings to fund its operations and would raise future capital from other sources ben lp s capital raising efforts and participation in liquidity transactions may include the issuance of equity or debt of ben lp or one of its subsidiaries and the newly issued securities may be dilutive to gwg holdings and gwg life s investments in ben lp and bch and may include preferential terms relative to gwg holdings and gwg life s investments in ben lp and bch as applicable we currently fund our business primarily with debt that generally has a shorter duration than the duration of our long term assets the resulting asset liability mismatch can result in a liquidity shortfall if we are unable to renew maturing short term debt or secure suitable additional financing in such a situation we could be forced to sell assets at less than optimal distressed prices substantially all of our life insurance policies are pledged as collateral under the lnv credit facility and the nf credit facility and we would not be able to dispose of them without compliance with the terms of those credit facilities we heavily rely on gwg holdings l bond offering to fund our business operations including among other things interest and principal payments on the existing l bonds and capital allocations to beneficient we temporarily suspended the offering of gwg holdings l bonds commencing april 16 2021 as a result of our delay in filing certain periodic reports with the sec including this 2020 form 10 k and were required to seek alternative sources of capital as a result of the suspension of gwg holdings l bond offering on june 28 2021 as described in more detail above we pledged additional life insurance policies as collateral and received an additional advance of 51 2 million under the third amended facility subsequently on august 11 2021 we entered into the nf credit agreement as described in more detail above and in note 23 to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements and received a one time advance of 107 6 million approximately 56 7 million of such advanced amount was used to pay off the remaining amount due including interest and penalties under the third amended facility and the additional pledged life insurance policies used as collateral for the third amended facility were released and pledged under the nf credit facility further on september 7 2021 dlp iv entered into the fourth amended facility that replaced the aforementioned third amended facility the fourth amended facility resulted in an additional advance of 30 3 million from lnv corporation with no additional pledged collateral primarily due to the current suspension of gwg holdings l bond offering the company may require additional capital to continue its operations over the next twelve months if our ability to sell l bonds dissipates or if we are forced to suspend the l bond offering however the company may not be able to obtain additional borrowings under existing debt facilities or new borrowings with other third party lenders to the extent that gwg holdings or its subsidiaries raise additional capital through the future issuance of debt the terms of those debt securities may include terms that adversely affect the rights of our existing debt and or equity holders or involve negative covenants that restrict gwg holdings ability to take specific actions such as incurring additional debt or making additional investments in growing the operations of the company if gwg holdings is unable to fund its operations and other obligations or defaults on its debt then the company will be required to either i sell assets to provide sufficient funding ii exercise our right to decline requests for early l bond redemptions or redemptions of preferred stock or iii to raise additional capital through the sale of equity and the ownership interest of our equity holders may be diluted substantially all of our life insurance policies are pledged as collateral under the lnv credit facility and the nf credit facility and we would not be able to dispose of them without compliance with the terms of those credit facilities page 61 table of contents we anticipate recommencing the offering of gwg holdings l bonds once we become current with our filing obligations and satisfy applicable nasdaq listing requirements once we become current with our filing obligations with respect to the l bonds we may be limited in the origination channels in which we sell our l bonds in the event that we are unable to meet the applicable nasdaq listing requirements in a timely manner which could result in the l bonds no longer being covered securities for federal securities law purposes which would subject the offer and sale of l bonds to potentially extensive state blue sky securities law requirements if for any reason we are forced to suspend gwg holdings l bond offering are limited in our origination channels in which we sell our l bonds or demand for gwg holdings l bonds dissipates our business would be adversely impacted and our ability to service and repay our debt obligations much of which is short term would be compromised thereby negatively affecting our business prospects and viability we had 97 4 million borrowing base capacity excluding any potential capacity for premiums and servicing costs under the lnv credit facility as of december 31 2020 additional future borrowing base capacity for premiums and servicing costs created as the premiums and servicing costs of pledged life insurance policies become due and by additional policy pledges to the facility if any exists under the lnv credit facility at the sole discretion of the lender the lnv credit facility has certain financial and nonfinancial covenants and we were in compliance with these debt covenants as of december 31 2020 and december 31 2019 and continue to be so as of the filing date of this report subsequent to december 31 2020 we received additional advances through amendments to the lnv credit facility and entered in to the nf credit facility as described in more detail above and in note 23 to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements beneficient is obligated to make debt payments totaling 74 5 million on certain outstanding borrowings through may 30 2022 under the terms of the amendment no 1 to the second amended and restated credit agreements as discussed further in note 23 to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements primarily due to both the forthcoming debt payments under the credit agreement and second lien credit agreement and the anticipated deconsolidation of beneficient from gwg holdings as discussed previously and in note 23 to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements which is expected to result in reduced reliance by beneficient on gwg holdings to fund its operations beneficient will require additional liquidity to continue its operations over the next twelve months we expect beneficient to satisfy these obligations and fund its operations through anticipated operating cash flows proceeds from distributions on the alternative assets portfolio additional investments into beneficient by gwg holdings and or other parties and potentially refinancing with other third party lenders some or all of the existing borrowings due prior to their maturity beneficient is currently in the process of raising additional equity which is anticipated to close during the fourth quarter of 2021 and or the first quarter of 2022 beneficient may not be able to refinance or obtain additional financing on terms favorable to the company or at all to the extent that beneficient raises additional capital through the future sale of equity or debt the ownership interest of its existing equity holders may be diluted the terms of these future equity or debt securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect the rights of its existing equity unitholders or involve negative covenants that restrict beneficient s ability to take specific actions such as incurring additional debt or making additional investments in growing its operations if beneficient defaults on these borrowings then it will be required to either i sell assets to repay these loans or ii to raise additional capital through the sale of equity and the ownership interest of our equity holders may be diluted moreover if beneficient were to sell assets to avoid a default of these borrowings then the price at which beneficient sold such assets may not reflect the carrying value of those assets as reflected in our consolidated financial statements especially in the event of a bulk or distressed sale as noted in the results of operations section above on november 11 2019 gwg holdings contributed the common stock and membership interests of its then wholly owned foxo labs and foxo life subsidiaries to foxo in exchange for a membership interest in the entity on november 13 2020 foxo bioscience llc converted to a corporation and is now known as foxo technologies inc with the corporate conversion gwg holdings previous membership interest in the llc converted to preferred equity gwg holdings has contributed 16 2 million in cash to foxo through december 31 2020 and is committed to contribute an additional 3 8 million to the entity through october 2021 all of which was contributed by such date the potential nasdaq delisting and our current inability to sell l bonds as discussed above in combination with significant recurring losses from operations negative cash flows from operations delays in executing our business plans and any potential negative outcome from the ongoing sec investigation discussed elsewhere in this form 10 k raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue

including various options musk asked for feedback saying he would abide by the twitter poll results some 58 of respondents favored musk selling tesla stock in the 24 hour survey a sale of 17 million shares would be worth about 21 billion at friday s close though he could sell more if he takes options into account musk selling a big tsla stock stake could be a headwind for shares especially at

gains shares surged friday in the wake of the expedia and airbnb earnings and the pfizer covid pill news moderna stock moderna stock plunged thursday and friday first on an earnings miss and then on the pfizer covid pill but mrna stock had flashed myriad sell signals in recent months that includes taking partial profits in early august just before the all time high on the downside investors got an early sell signal as mrna stock plunged through its 10 day line on aug 11 various 21 day line breaks could have offered further signals but breaking below the 50 day line on sept 28 followed by another gap down on oct 1 provided strong signals that the moderna stock run was over at least for a while in most cases a winning stock will peak before the fundamentals peloton stock much like moderna peloton stock crashed last week after offering many sell signals along the way pton stock plummeted 35 to a 16 month low on friday following a big loss weak revenue and slashed guidance bottom line with the covid pandemic waning people are exercising more outside the home after a long powerful run in 2020 pton stock broke out again at the very end of last year investors probably could have bought the peloton stock from the 50 day 10 week line a few days earlier but the breakout initially worked but after one week shares began to whipsaw up and down investors especially newer ones may have wanted to take some profits finally on feb 17 pton stock fell through its 50 day line then kept sliding for several weeks after finding 200 day line support peloton ran up to its 50 day line before reversing to fall through the 200 line pton stock did rebound again from early may to early july as the delta covid wave started to gain steam but since then shares have been in retreat apple stock apple stock now has a cup with handle base with a 153 26 buy point according to marketsmith analysis the handle formed after aapl stock rebounded from its 50 day line following mixed apple earnings but the relative strength line is at its worst levels since late june more broadly the rs line the blue line in the charts provided has been trending slightly lower since august 2020 reflecting apple stock s laggard status vs the s p 500 index of course a powerful apple stock move would quickly revive the rs line abnb stock had a lackluster rs line until friday s surge meanwhile news broke late friday that apple has hired tesla s former autopilot software director for its secretive apple car effort c j moore came under scrutiny earlier after he appeared to disagree with elon musk s optimistic statements about tesla self driving capabilities in moore s conversations with california dmv officials it s still unclear when apple will come out with a car expected to be electric and have self driving capabilities the apple car hiring news had virtually no impact on apple or tesla stock late friday market rally analysis the stock market had yet another strong week with the major indexes and even the russell 2000 hitting record highs the nasdaq is on a 10 day winning streak managing to advance even with mrna stock plunging 17 the composite is starting to look extended thanks to the likes of nvidia tesla and some near vertical giants though tesla and nvidia stock did close fractionally lower friday the nasdaq closed the week 6 1 above its 50 day line the nasdaq 100 is 6 7 above the 50 day line after topping 7 intraday friday when the nasdaq gets 6 and especially 7 above its 50 day line it s at higher risk of a pullback with the odds rising that any such pullback will be larger of course the market rally can keep moving higher for some time when it s extended and pullbacks often are modest it s also early in the latest market rally so it s less concerning on a related note the s p 500 index is 4 9 above its 50 day line the s p 500 may start seeming stretched if it s 5 6 above its 50 day finally a market rally pullback would likely be healthy letting leaders pull back to key levels or form new bases offering new opportunities to buy meanwhile the market is showing broad strength yes chips are leading the way right now along with other techs but travel plays are looking strong while ev makers retailers steel and industrials are all showing at least pockets of strength why this ibd tool simplifies the search for top stocks what to do now with the stock market rally starting to get extended investors may not want to build up their exposure substantially if you ve gotten deep into margin you may want to consider backing off taking some partial profits selling a winning stock into strength or on weakness both have their merits and there s no reason you can t employ both methods investors may want to consider adding exposure to sectors such as travel which could be ready to lead run your screens this weekend and build up your watchlists if the market rally does pause or pull back some leading stocks could form brief consolidations or pull back to key support so make sure you have capital ready to deploy yet another reason to take some small winnings now earnings season is off its peak but it s not quiet meanwhile nvidia may lay

common sense and shrewd judgment of men and politics said km de silva he had a fine memory he never took a note but remembered everything said haj hulugalle the remarkable thing about ds senanayake was that there was nothing remarkable about him said db dhanapala ds does not figure in the book by ramachandra guha on makers of modern asia observed km de silva i do not think the first prime minister of sri lanka can be dismissed in that manner ds did not lead the independence movement certainly he only functioned as its acceptable leader but ds did not play a completely passive role when soulbury commission visited sri lanka ds made sure that the commission saw a well functioning successful colony he took them on a conducted tour balanced between agriculture and culture to peradeniya minipe kandy dambulla sigiriya polonnaruwa minneriya and anuradhapura ds had also asked sri jayana to present a private performance of udarata dance before soulbury i came across this when writing on dance in british ceylon the soulbury tours involved a great deal of organization and the government officers and private citizens were warned ahead to provide a welcome ds wanted the commission to see that the ceylon government was efficient this effort of ds was very successful the soulbury commission made special mention of these tours in their report it was generally agreed in 1951 that unp was held together by the personality of its popular leader observed nayani melegoda under mr senanayake ceylon was the most untroubled country in asia said hulugalle in december 1951 ds accompanied by son dudley had visited australia there is a youtube clip on this which should be viewed by those who admire ds he was interviewed on his arrival he looked confident and spoke in fluent stylish english he said that he had come to see the agricultural advances made in australia he looked a highly westernized asian prime minister complete with shaggy moustache this news clip would have been shown in cinemas around the world it would have enhanced the image of sri lanka the link is jr jayewardene confirmed that ds was heavily pro british ds senanayake had to consider the question of defence said jr since we could not afford to look after ourselves ds decided the best people to look after us were the british and he signed a defence pact with them we would allow them to use our bases with our consent and we would help the british if they were attacked ds was aware that the englishmen were democratic at home and imbued with a sense of fairness once we got independence his distrust of them disappeared said jr ds was pro usa and against communism he gave harbour facilities to the us fleet on its way to the korean war ds permitted the rubber rice pact with china against america s wishes but at the same time was negotiating with america regarding selling our rubber in bulk to usa said jr however ds supported asian countries he refused to allow the dutch to use sri lanka s airport for military action against indonesia in 1951 he asked j r to speak on behalf of japan at san francisco from the very beginning unp gained the trust of the minorities muslims moors and christian were firm supporters said km de silva ds was on excellent terms with the president of the unp dr m c m kaleel ds was imprisoned during the 1915 sinhala muslim riots when he was released ds went all over the country in the company of abdur rahman the nominated muslim member of the legislative council and brought about peace between the muslim and sinhalese communities recalled imthiaz bakeer markar in 2021 at large gatherings i remember mr senanayake saying how he went and lived in muslim houses and had his meals with them ds included the tamil congress leader g g ponnambalam in his first post independence cabinet kandiah vaithiananthan later sir kandiah vaithiananthan was his permanent secretary for defence and external affairs the sinhalese complained that most of the new industries were located in tamil speaking areas such as valaichchenai paranthan and kankesanturai ds ignored the complaint the secretary of the ds senanayake memorial society wrote in 2018 to say that that ds was a great and exemplary leader with a deep commitment to buddhism when dudley was born dss had offered 25 acres of land to botale temple ds had restored ruvanveli rehabilitated the chaitya at mahiyangana and kirivehera at kataragama he established the salgala forest monastery he had attended religious ceremonies in major temples when he was sworn in as prime minister he had worshipped at polwatte temple in colombo 3 however it is well known that ds refused to consider requests to make sinhala the state language and buddhism the state religion when sinhala maha sabha brought before the unp the issue of making buddhism the state religion ds had said it goes against the concept of buddhism ds had also refused to set up a buddhist commission and the buddhist had to do it themselves d s senanayake became minister for agriculture in 1931 he held this position for 17 years in 1935 he drew attention to the need to use the mahaweli waters this is forgotten today my recall is that sa wickremasinghe also drew attention to the mahaweli waters at a talk given before the slma then ceylon branch of bma in the 1930s or 1940s in the 1930s ds senanayake started the process of restoring old abandoned tanks and irrigation systems in the dry zone and settling sinhala farmers from the kandyan areas as colonists in the anuradhapura polonnaruwa and kantalai areas said ajit kanagasunderam this was the central plank of ds s policy and was done to alleviate the acute land hunger among kandyan peasantry whose ancestors had their lands confiscated for coffee and tea plantations his objective was to create a nation of self sufficient prosperous peasantry these irrigation rehabilitation and settlement projects although piece meal were done at a very reasonable cost and can be considered a great success concluded kanagasunderam ds decided to shift landless families from the densely populated wet zone to the less populated dry zone ds thought it would be good to turn them into prosperous farmers of the dry zone the villagers were reluctant because there was malaria in the dry zone the state council was critical of this policy of colonizing the dry zone while plenty of land was available in the wet zone it was possible to bring into cultivation an extent of 10 000 to 15 000 acres of land in the south and western provinces at a lesser cost than the proposed new schemes land commission also was not enthusiastic about dry zone colonization dry zone had malaria drought scarcity of water and wild animals but ds went ahead ds wanted colonization of the dry zone minneriya was the first scheme the plan was to develop 50 000 acres of land at minneriya they were given six acres of wet land and 2 5 acres of dry land money was given as an outright grant and was not to be recovered the first group of land recipients under this scheme arrived at minneriya on april 30 1933 but as d s senanayake himself admitted some of them failed as cultivators they were probably not farmers to start with and did not possess the necessary skills they were engaged in low income jobs like casual labor back home some died of malaria these colonists of the 1930s faced elephant attacks junglewallah recalled that forest department officials had been asked by ds to drive off the herds of elephants that were devastating the cultivated lands of the colonists in the newly opened out settlements in minneriya and hingurakgoda the colonists were chiefly from mr senanayake s electorate mirigama including his ancestral botale and there had been numerous instances where the elephants had destroyed huts and killed the colonists the settlers were threatening to pull out and return home unless something was done to drive off the elephants the minneriya project was able to withstand these problems between 1936 and 1940 landless peasants as well as some middle class people of the wet and intermediate zones were settled in minneriya from 1936 onwards the government adopted a policy of paying money to new settlers to clear the land and build houses the minneriya colonization scheme became successful and a complex settlement pattern evolved of which 90 percent were agricultural settlements said wi siriweera the minneriya scheme was very successful agreed meegama minneriya was ds s great achievement said km de silva after minneriya came karaganda colonization scheme of 17 000 acres fed by balaluwewa this was followed by hingurakgoda bakamuna hunilowewa nachchaduwa and minipe colonization schemes climaxing with gal oya minipe ela scheme started in 1934 when i left minipe in 1945 malaria was coming under control and there was a clamor for allotments recalled m rajendra once malaria was controlled there was a dramatic change applications exceeded availability the size of allotment was reduced the restoration of the ancient irrigation system was also promoted gal oya project was started in 1949 this project was a shining example of what can be achieved all objectives were met it was financed from our own resources and managed by sri lankans and there was never any hint of scandal it was a pity that at the end communal anti tamil riots marred the record but this did not diminish the achievement itself said kanagasunderam ds decided that it was important to preserve the peasantry the preservation of the peasantry was to be the basis of the new land policy of the time decades later this was heavily condemned critics called it the unusual phenomenon of re peasantisation this new peasantry would be settled in the dry zone there would be outright grants of land leases under peasant proprietor scheme and a new tenurial system where alienation by the grantee by sale or mortgage would be restricted and lands alienated would pass to a nominated heir grantees could not subdivide the allotment thus preventing fragmentation also they could not mortgage the land ds s objective was to create a nation of self sufficient prosperous peasantry what he did however was to create an impoverished dependant peasantry philip gunawardena who became minister of agriculture in the 1956 government was very critical of the colonization schemes of d s senanayake the independent peasant small holder as dreamt by ds senanayake does not exist said philip the majority of the owner cultivators held less than one acre and that one acre could not provide a living for a family many small holders were wage laborers as well in a recent patha dumbara survey 45 neither owned paddy nor had anything to do with paddy production the remaining 55 also did not depend wholly on paddy cultivation a pauperized peasantry has been created this is the picture of the much idolized peasant proprietor said philip in 1957 many had become tenant farmers in these schemes there was indebtedness and wage laborers confirmed others increasing the peasant ownership of small lots of paddy would not solve anything said philip paddy cannot be grown in small un economic units you cannot offer land divided up into five acres and three acres as high land and low land and ask the farmer to cultivate because he cannot get a good return also the fertility of the land varies it was not possible to apply modern techniques of farming to small holdings of 5 or 3 or 2 acre farms either you need large units the land had to be worked in large units to be productive concluded philip ds was responsible for creating the government film unit in 1948 world war ii had ended and mountbatten s south east asia command seac was disbanding large stocks of military equipment went under the hammer but not the film section ds took all the equipment and sent it to the irrigation department stores in colombo it was a windfall there were cameras tripods and trolleys two professional mitchell 35mm cine cameras with full lenses in excellent condition also a 35 mm gaumont kalee and walturdaw projectors h a j hulugalle was made director of information and was asked to start a government film unit the mission hut building of the raf in ratmalana became the gfu headquarters ds was also responsible for hiring the documentary film maker guilio petroni to head the government film unit petroni had been recruited by three nationalist sinhala business men who had set up a company vishvaranga movietone company they had traveled to italy in search of a documentary filmmaker in order to train young aspiring ceylonese in the art of the film petroni arrived here with two others frederico serra and giogio calabria to find that the company no longer existed they were then recruited by ds senanayake to run the government film unit ds interest in cinema did not end there ds senanayake wanted a film made of his colonization schemes he wanted a film about a peasant family in the dry zone in the polonnaruwa area it was to be called new horizons and petroni was to direct it using a full shooting crew the prime minister came to the gfu in ratmalana to see the rushes he did not like what he saw he wrote to hulugalle saying that certain changes should be made to the film new horizons under production in the gfu this letter is reproduced in full in hulugalle s book on ds ds gave an elaborate list of all the things he wanted shown in the film ds wanted the film to start with an abandoned tank shown together with dagobas he suggested padaviya tank then some good village scenes showing the clearing and planting of chena by villagers this should be depicted in greater detail he said with reference to the rushes he saw preparation of both high and low land must be shown there should be a shot of watchers perched on the fork of a tree driving away wild animals there should be an elephant or two to show the difficulties famer has to undergo then the film must move on to the irrigation scheme a map of the whole area should be given with contours showing how the scheme would look when completed then the actual construction work done by the irrigation department should be shown this could be filmed at hurulu the complete anicut must be shown take minipe also elahera then clearing of jungle must be shown first the old method where the undergrowth is cleared by hand the trees felled and stumps taken out by hand then the new method at gal oya where it is done by bulldozers and heavy drag chains ds senanayake wanted a house belonging to a colonist shown together with the plan of the house they must show the man being given the keys to the house as well as plants to be grown on high land such as coconut jak lime mangoes and oranges then he must be taken to the cattle pool and advised that he could purchase two head of cattle cow and bull he must be told better get a cow for milking purposes and share the bull for cultivation with another bull the film must show the cattle being purchased on credit card and repayment made on installments the film must also show the medical services the last scene should not be a rest house scene village people do not dine that way said ds instead have a visitor come to the colony to meet a colonist who is now very prosperous the visitor must be shown eating well at a table piled with rice curries fruits etc the film must end with the visitor asking how he too can become a colonist hulugalle had doubts as to whether all this could be crammed into one film and whether the director would agree continued

greaney minn beryl novak bought 40 acres of forest here in 1966 for 700 eventually moved an old one room shack to the site for a deer hunting cabin and then liked it so much he moved in for good that was 1977 he hasn t lived anyplace else since he hasn t slept in any other bed not a single night away since may 1993 i m kind of a homebody novak said he also hasn t hunted deer anywhere else and on saturday morning nov 6 novak will be in his favorite deer stand a 5 by 8 foot tarpaper shack with a slide up window where odds are he will see some deer whether or not he gets a legal buck will be up to the fates of course much like the other nearly half million minnesota hunters out and about but don t bet against him advertisement beryl novak the stand is just 50 yards from his house about an hour s drive north of hibbing overlooking a mowed clearing with a backdrop of spruce and balsam about 140 yards out he has shot dozens of deer from this spot most with his trusty 270 winchester some of them just minutes into the first morning of the season the annual deer hunt has become part of his life s routine a rhythm that revolves around nature s seasons things like putting up firewood tending his big garden planting and grafting dozens of apple trees and walking hundreds of miles each autumn in search of grouse already this season he s bagged two dozen grouse by walking slowly watching and listening on forest trails beryl novak walks past a deer rub while grouse hunting monday nov 1 2021 steve kuchera duluth news tribune but it hasn t been easy i figure it s about 5 miles walking for each bird he said as we walked and talked in his woods shotguns at the ready on a brisk november morning we flushed a couple grouse that day but didn t get any shots advertisement over the years living out here novak has had close calls with wolves and has battled with bears but it all seems to come in stride for an outdoorsman who doesn t rattle easily who seemingly has seen and done everything the northwoods has to offer started young novak 71 shot his first deer at age 10 in 1960 hunting alone he still has the paper hunting license and aluminum buck tag pressed between pages in a photo album since then novak figures he s shot 75 deer in these woods northwest of cook beryl novak still has his deer license and tag from 1960 steve kuchera duluth news tribune he has a memory like a steel trap and rattles off dates and antler counts from hunting seasons a half century ago like they happened yesterday novak was born and raised in this country and graduated from orr high school in 1968 he liked cars of course and girls but his passion has always been the outdoors hunting fishing and trapping my dad died when i was 5 novak said but i had a mentor teach me grouse hunting joe kasun when i was 7 he gave me a single shot 22 to use and one 22 short bullet and took me grouse hunting and told me not to miss i got one deer hunting though i had to figure out on my own advertisement and he has a 10 year old beryl novak poses with the buck he shot in 1960 contributed beryl novack novak attended a vocational college and then with a low draft number looming enlisted in the u s air force and stayed in for nearly four years from 1970 74 he was stationed at several bases across the u s and spent eight months in vietnam at the 483rd usaf hospital at cam ranh bay where the base would come under occasional rocket attack and where he saw the horrors of war firsthand with a parade of wounded on display through his military service he would come home on leave scheduled around hunting seasons i came home to hunt he said it s what i thought about when i was over there related a northwoods living novak s one room home is 16 by 20 feet what city folks these days might call a tiny house it has no running water there s a hand pump outside a few steps an outhouse of course and a sauna shed too advertisement i don t have to worry about pipes freezing novak quipped it s an armstrong pump a big barrel wood stove heats the place when it s cold and novak has a few seasons worth of fuel stacked neatly outside there s a gas range for cooking a bed in the corner and a small tv that gets three stations over the airwaves beryl novak talks with a visitor in his one room cabin monday nov 1 2021 steve kuchera duluth news tribune why would you need any more than that everything on tv is all so damned depressing anyway novak said there s a 2017 calendar on the door still next to a reminder note for next year s dental appointment dusty cds and dvds and piles of outdoor and gardening magazines cover much of the kitchen table a few old buck antlers trophies from long past seasons are stashed in the corner a few mounted fish adorn the walls antlers from past hunts lay on a table in beryl novak s cabin monday nov 1 2021 steve kuchera duluth news tribune advertisement novak worked the usual northwoods jobs over the years including as a logger and then on a sand and gravel crew he trapped and sold furs beaver otter fisher and pine marten until the bottom dropped out of the fur market and prices plummeted he picked wild blueberries and sold them to grocery stores in town he cut and sold balsam boughs and firewood for a spell too novak formally retired in 1995 meaning that s the point he stopped trying to earn a living and focused on the living part there wasn t anyone left calling me who i wanted to talk to people would say but we can t get ahold of you and i d say that s the point beryl novak it doesn t cost much to live up here i get by pretty cheap he said it s not that he doesn t like people novak said just that he found it hard always trying to get along you can t satisfy people so i said the hell with it and here i am he said adding that he doesn t consider himself a hermit i get visitors just not as many as i used to everyone is dying off beryl novak unloads his shotgun outside the one room cabin he s lived in since 1977 after a grouse hunt monday nov 1 2021 steve kuchera duluth news tribune advertisement his last car broke down in 2005 and he hasn t driven one since although he does have a four wheel atv that can get him the mile or so down the road to another 43 acre parcel he owns and hunts on he keeps mowed trails on his land that attract deer grouse and other wildlife and make for easy walking he has planted hundreds of apple plum and pine trees along the trails novak depends on the kindness of a few friends and neighbors to get him to his annual doctor and dental checkups or to bring him fresh food on occasion in return he shares crops from his garden or maybe a cleaned and packaged grouse breast he stocks up on provisions in town a few times each year most everything else he grows or shoots on his own conservation officers occasionally add to his larder by dropping off an illegally killed deer this year s drought cut into his sweet corn crop but his melons onions and carrots did well with him carrying water from the pump a late may hard freeze crippled novak s apple crop though nipping the buds it s the first time i ve ever had a total failure for apples he noted his last dog died eight years ago and he s not planning to get another i didn t feel it was right to have a dog and not have a way to get him to the vet he said it s bad enough for people to have to take me to the doctor s but it s too much to ask someone else to take my dog to the vet simplifying life at his annual checkup in august in hibbing doctors proclaimed novak perfectly fit he takes no medications and goes years between suffering a cold or the flu because he doesn t mix in crowds and novak noted that he has been perfectly situated to guard against the covid 19 pandemic i ve been social distancing out

home area during one stretch between october 2020 and february 2021 he went 134 days without leaving more than four months between trips to cook just 25 miles away i didn t have any reason i had to go he said he hasn t shaved or had a haircut since 2001 when he grew it out to spite his mom who had been nagging him about his appearance she s long since passed but he still hasn t relented i don t have to live to suit anyone else he said his shoulder length hair falls out a lot it doesn t get that long novak cut off his landline service in 1995 tired of telemarketers and went 20 years without a telephone there wasn t anyone left calling me who i wanted to talk to novak said people would say but we can t get ahold of you and i d say that s the point in spring 2015 a neighbor whose hunting land he keeps watch on gave him an inexpensive cellphone to report problems on he got me one new one since and he s still paying the bills novak said it s definitely not a smartphone he has no computer no email and no facebook it s as if the last 25 years of technology have passed him by and it s clear he doesn t care as long as he has his rifle and shotgun and is fit to walk in the woods

when a life sciences company taps the public markets with a stock offering deep into the nine figure range these days it s a safe bet that the capital is for manufacturing and so it is for evotec a decades old biotech industry player that has more recently added new manufacturing capabilities the company aims to expand its biologics manufacturing sites in the u s and europe and its nasdaq debut has raised 435 million to support those plans sponsored post behavioral health interoperability and econsent meeting the demands of cms final rule compliance in a webinar on april 16 at 1pm et aneesh chopra will moderate a discussion with executives from docusign velatura and behavioral health providers on econsent health information exchange and compliance with the cms final rule on interoperability evotec might be new to many u s investors but it s not a newcomer to the public markets the hamburg germany based company has been trading on the frankfurt stock exchange since 1999 under the stock symbol evt the company s shares started trading thursday on the nasdaq under the stock symbol evo evotec offered 20 million american depositary shares for 21 75 each that s 2 million fewer shares than it had planned to offer for about 26 16 apiece evotec s closing stock price on friday was 22 55 in its prospectus evotec said the growing understanding of the molecular and genetic underpinnings of diseases is driving the need for advanced technologies that can interpret and translate the vast amount of data that are generated the company has developed such technologies including computational software that identifies biomarkers and analyzes how a drug is working evotec s artificial intelligence and machine learning capabilities generate and analyze data providing insights and predictions about a drug candidate s efficacy the company s business has been providing these technologies to biopharmaceutical firms that discover and develop drugs in that regard evotec is a service provider but its relationship with companies is not always strictly as a vendor evotec generates revenue in multiple ways the company can provide its offerings under a fee for service model similar to the relationships many contract research organizations have with drug companies in these instances the biopharmaceutical company holds all of the rights to its drug or drugs however in other cases evotec also strikes up partnerships in which the risk of drug development is shared evotec provides its technology and services in exchange for milestone payments as programs progress as well as potential royalties from sales of commercialized products according to the filing evotec has had a hand in 11 disclosed pipeline programs now in clinical testing and more than 100 programs in discovery or preclinical development evotec also invests in products or companies with the potential of generating returns in the future as those companies go public or are acquired the filing states that as of june 30 the company s equity investments spanned 90 active projects sponsored content a deep dive into specialty pharma a specialty drug is a class of prescription medications used to treat complex chronic or rare medical conditions although this classification was originally intended to define the treatment of rare also termed orphan diseases affecting fewer than 200 000 people in the us more recently specialty drugs have emerged as the cornerstone of treatment for chronic and complex diseases such as cancer autoimmune conditions diabetes hepatitis c and hiv aids though evotec has been in business since 1993 it has seen significant growth in recent years revenue in 2020 was 500 9 million a 12 2 increase over the prior year in the first half of this year evotec reported 271 3 million in revenue a 17 5 increase compared to the same period last year that growth has tracked with an increase in customers evotec said its customer count in 2020 was 829 compared with 769 in 2019 the largest three bristol myers squibb merck and sanofi combined for 24 of evotec s 2020 revenue according to the filing that s down from 30 in 2019 but the company attributed the decrease to revenue growth from other customers more revenue growth is expected from manufacturing services and that s one of the drivers of this week s u s stock offering in 2019 evotec acquired just biotherapeutics a seattle company that applies ai and machine learning capabilities to the discovery and development of biologic drug candidates just bio has a manufacturing facility in redmond washington that opened in august that site called j pod has a manufacturing agreement with the u s department of defense covering the production of monoclonal antibodies for covid 19 the redmond facility also counts merck as one of its pharma industry partners another manufacturing site in toulouse france was acquired from sanofi last year there evotec plans to construct a second j pod facility on the acquired land evotec said in the prospectus that about 100 million of the stock sale proceeds will go toward expanding the redmond site another 175 million is set aside for building additional biologics manufacturing capacity in toulouse evotec also plans to invest in its technologies about 35 million is earmarked for the company s precision medicine platform including the expansion of its induced pluripotent stem cell technology platform broadening the access to patient derived samples and disease relevant data along with expanding the ability to analyze those data though evotec has been a partner to drug companies the firm does have its own pipeline of unpartnered drugs evotec plans to spend 115 million to accelerate the development of these drugs and add more to the pipeline the company said that those drugs could find their way into the hands of pharma industry partners evotec s business model is profitable the company projects that net income for the nine months ending sept 30 will be between 245 million and 249 million compared to 5 8 million in the same period last year the company attributed much of that increase to gains from its investment in artificial intelligence biotech exscientia an evotec partner that completed its ipo last month io biotech s ipo raises 100m for a new twist on cancer immunotherapy io biotech a clinical stage company developing peptide drugs to address cancer targets raised 100 million in its stock market debut the copenhagen denmark based company priced its offering of 7 15 million shares at 14 apiece which was

the stock symbol iobt io formed in 2014 spun off from the national center for cancer immune therapy at herlev university hospital in denmark the company calls its technology platform t win io s drugs are intended to activate naturally occurring t cells to target mechanisms that suppress immune responses the company said in its ipo filing that t win drugs offer a dual approach first they kill tumor cells and cells in the tumor microenvironment that express immunosuppressive proteins the second mechanism is the ability to modulate the tumor microenvironment so that it s a more pro inflammatory and anti tumor place our t win technology is built upon our team s deep understanding of both the and a tumor s ability to evade surveillance and destruction by the immune system io said in the ipo filing our approach is in contrast to previous methods that have sought to either block single immunosuppressive pathways or to direct the immune system against specific identified antigens expressed by tumor cells io s lead drug candidate io102 io103 is designed to target the immunosuppressive mechanisms of two proteins ido and pd l1 in phase 1 2 tests in patients with advanced melanoma io said results showed meaningful tumor regression and a durable antitumor response the therapy s tolerability was also manageable in the 30 patient study the overall response rate was 73 the complete response rate was 47 the company now plans to advance io102 io103 into a pivotal phase 3 clinical trial that will evaluate the therapy in combination with the merck cancer drug pembrolizumab keytruda that trial targeting enrollment of 300 patients is expected to begin by the end of this year according to the filing io is preparing to evaluate its lead drug as a first line treatment in other solid tumor types those tests will go forward as a basket trial in which the study drug is tested against several different cancers that all have the same biological or genetic signature cancers that will be covered under the planned basket study include non small cell lung cancer squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck and urothelial bladder cancer in addition to evaluating the therapy as a first line treatment the company also plans to test it before surgery as a neoadjuvant which is a first step to try to shrink tumors before surgery io also plans to test it as an adjuvant therapy a post surgical treatment to reduce the chances of the cancer s return io s largest shareholder is lundbeckfond invest which owns a 14 2 post ipo stake according to the filing novo holdings owns 10 8 percent of the company after the ipo as of sept 30 io reported having 45 4 million in cash an additional 84 1 million was released to the company last month under an investment agreement that the company entered into earlier this year in the prospectus io said that it plans to deploy about 50 million toward the phase 3 test of its lead therapeutic candidate another 20 million will go toward developing that therapy in a planned phase 2 basket trial another program io112 is set to receive 10 million for a planned phase 1 2 trial in combination with io102 and io103 photo krisztian bocsi bloomberg via

workers dump cheese into a vat as they make cheese sauce at bates central kitchen the granite school district s central kitchen and warehouse in west valley city on friday nov 5 2021 from school employees wearing multiple hats and working extended hours to emergency runs to warehouse stores to bridge late deliveries of school lunch supplies labor shortages and supply chain issues are exacting a toll on utah schools here s five ways those impacts are felt pinched supplies even when products are available there are waits on the supplier end as they struggle to deliver due to driver shortages knowing this the granite school district orders some products up to 16 weeks in advance and they re still not being delivered on time said spokesman ben horsley empty shelves in the district warehouse illustrate the challenge this is the first year we ve not had that filled to the brim in fact it s less than 50 capacity right now because we just cannot get items in stock he said another complicating factor is that school purchasing is done through procurement process which means they must put their supply needs out to competitive bid then the struggle has been that not enough companies are actually responding to those bids because they can t guarantee the product to be delivered in a certain time beef and poultry products in particular are challenging horsley said the warehouse and central kitchen staff have labored to serve what s on school menus but substitutions occur when supplies do not materialize the school district prepares some 44 000 meals a day and the demand has never been greater he said workers process food for schools at at bates central kitchen the granite school district s central kitchen and warehouse in west valley city on friday nov 5 2021 scott g winterton deseret news fewer menu choices according to kathleen britton the utah state board of education s director of child nutrition programs supply chain disruptions and labor shortages mean reductions in menu variety and meal service options what does this mean for utah school meals in short reduced menu variety and meal service options and frequent menu changes britton said in a press release for instance americans appetite for chicken continues to grow but the chicken processing industry has been hit with unprecedented winter storms in texas as well as its own labor shortages this now means that orange chicken a favorite lunch entree at many schools is on the menu less frequently this school year she said not only are school districts struggling to source some types of food single use food trays and cutlery are also in short supply which means districts are returning to metal or plastic trays and flatware that requires washing which is labor intensive as is ensuring students don t throw them away when they are done eating as they are accustomed to do disposable food trays which were ordered in june and just arrived wait to be delivered to schools from bates central kitchen the granite school district s central kitchen and warehouse in west valley city on friday nov 5 2021 scott g winterton deseret news treasure hunts when districts and charter schools can t access sustenance from traditional sources some are forced to look elsewhere to meet their needs nutrition services administrators have on occasion purchased supplies and food from local grocery stores or warehouse stores to shore up supplies on an emergency basis the hunts for supplies add to already long days ensuring there are sufficient numbers of workers to meet granite school district s food service needs which have increased as students have returned to schools full time horsley said the stress is across the board our nutrition services director and leadership team are working 15 to 20 hours a day in some instances to go out and find supplies and food he said it s complicated by labor shortages at farms and ranches many food processors lack enough employees to maintain production levels there are shortages of truck drivers to haul food from factories let alone sufficient numbers of workers at suppliers warehouses keeping up with the increase in school meals and navigating through current circumstances has brought new challenges britton said workers process food for schools at bates central kitchen the granite school district s central kitchen and warehouse in west valley city on friday nov 5 2021 scott g winterton deseret news labor shortages prior to the start of the school year school districts started advertising higher starting wages for school bus drivers to help stem driver shortages with some districts offering more than 21 hours to start related why utah school districts are struggling to keep the wheels on the bus going round and round in granite district there is still a need for contract drivers but labor needs are more acute for school nutrition workers and paraprofessionals who support educators in classrooms paraprofessionals have always been a challenge simply by virtue of the fact that we just cannot compete with the private sector in this economy when our budgets are limited horsley said when school districts experience labor shortages current employees often work overtime to meet needs granite district s central kitchen staff is a third smaller than in previous years it just means things take longer and less people are doing the work so we have people coming in and working extra long hours horsley said at the school level there are also fewer employees to distribute meals so lunch times are prolonged in some instances and in some locations he said who s in the classroom many school districts along the wasatch front have increased pay for substitute teachers or are offering stipends to substitutes who work multiple days in a certain time period to help address shortages prior to the covid 19 pandemic davis school district had about a 95 fill rate for substitute positions in the last year the number slipped to 75 according to a school district statement to help meet its labor needs the district recently increased the full day pay for substitute teachers to 113 a day for certified or licensed substitutes long term daily pay goes up to 140 a day for licensed educators who spend 20 consecutive days in a classroom meanwhile the daily rate for substitutes with a college degree was also raised to 105 and 85 for people who do not have a college degree assistant superintendent john zurbuchen said the change helps the district compete for available employees in the workforce who prefer temp work when we get the best subs we get the best learning he said in some school districts midlevel administrators are also filling in as substitutes when needs arise and some teachers are filling in for absent teachers in their buildings opting to pick up a class and compensation during what is their preparation time they still have to prepare lessons grade papers and other activities they plan during their prep time in salt lake county at least many substitute teachers work for multiple school districts which increases the chances that they ll have more options for assignments at schools close to their homes that they get to work with administrators or faculty members they know or work with the age of child they prefer but it also means there is healthy competition for the same pool of workers bottom line it s less people and a more demanding job than it s ever been when it comes to public education said horsley

washington ap america s employers accelerated their hiring last month adding a solid 531 000 jobs the most since july and a sign that the recovery from the pandemic recession is overcoming a virus induced slowdown friday s report from the labor department also showed that the unemployment rate fell to 4 6 last month from 4 8 in september that is a comparatively low level though still well above the pre pandemic jobless rate of 3 5 and the job gains in august and september weren t as weak as initially reported the government increased its estimate of hiring for those two months by a hefty combined 235 000 jobs all told the figures point to an economy that is steadily recovering from the pandemic recession with healthy consumer spending prompting companies in nearly every industry to add workers though the effects of covid 19 are still causing severe supply shortages heightening inflation and keeping many people out of the workforce employers are finding gradually more success in filling near record high job postings this is the kind of recovery we can get when we are not sidelined by a surge in covid cases said nick bunker director of economic research at the employment website indeed the speed of employment gains has faltered at times this year but the underlying momentum of the u s labor market is quite clear the better than expected jobs report was welcomed on wall street where investors sent stocks further into record territory the dow jones industrial average rose more than 200 points or roughly 0 6 in friday trading short term treasury yields rose as some investors moved up their expectations for when the federal reserve will begin raising interest rates but longer term yields dipped amid muted expectations for inflation over the long term by most barometers the economic recovery appears solidly on track services companies in such areas as retail banking and warehousing have reported a sharp jump in sales sales of new and existing homes surged last month and consumer confidence rose in october after three straight declines at the same time though the nation remains 4 2 million jobs short of the number it had before the pandemic flattened the economy in march 2020 the effects of the virus are still discouraging some people from traveling shopping eating out and attending entertainment venues in october the pickup in hiring was spread across nearly every major industry with only government employers reporting a job loss mostly in education shipping and warehousing companies added 54 000 jobs the battered leisure and hospitality sector which includes restaurants bars hotels and entertainment venues gained 164 000 manufacturers despite their struggles with supply shortages added 60 000 the most since june 2020 and employers who have been competing to fill jobs from a diminished pool of applicants raised wages at a solid clip average hourly pay jumped 4 9 in october compared with a year earlier up from 4 6 the previous month even a gain that strong though is barely keeping pace with recent surges in consumer inflation those price increases pose a headwind for the economy higher costs for food heating oil rents and furniture have burdened millions of families prices rose 4 4 in september compared with 12 months earlier the sharpest such jump in three decades among people who are receiving pay raises some of the biggest beneficiaries are the record high number of people who have been quitting jobs to take new ones one of them is christian frink who has begun work as a business analyst at a digital consulting firm in his new job frink 27 of ferndale michigan helps business clients determine the technologies they need earlier this year frink held a marketing job but left it because like many people during covid he felt burnt out he then worked for door dash during the spring and summer to earn money and searched for new work although employers were complaining about a labor shortage several told him they wouldn t hire anyone without a college degree frink attended college but didn t graduate this past summer frink took coding classes at tech elevator a boot camp and then landed his new position now he s earning 35 more than in his previous job and says he s blown away that he already has health care coverage and doesn t have to wait months to become eligible yet it isn t only job switchers who are receiving pay raises chad leibundguth a regional director in tampa for the robert half staffing agency said the job market is the strongest for workers he has seen in his 22 year career before the pandemic he said you could fill a customer service job in florida for 14 an hour nowadays he said you ve got to be closer to 20 an hour because people have options job prospects are brightening even for people who have been out of work for prolonged periods the number of long term unemployed people who have been jobless for six months or more has fallen sharply in recent months to 2 3 million in october from 4 2 million in april that s still double the pre recession total but it s an encouraging sign because employers are typically wary of hiring people who haven t held jobs for an extended time at the same time disparities in the job market have persisted the black unemployment rate was unchanged in october at 7 9 for example while for white workers it fell to 4 from 4 2 the latino jobless rate dropped to 5 9 from 6 3 and though white collar jobs in professional services like information technology engineering and architecture are nearly back to their pre pandemic employment levels leisure and hospitality still has 1 4 million fewer jobs hari ravichandran ceo of digital security provider aura in boston says his 800 person company has 140 positions open mostly in software development ravichandran is willing to hire remote workers 170 of his staffers have never regularly worked in any of the company s buildings still hiring remains as tough as he s ever experienced one disappointing note in friday s report is that the workforce the number of people either working or looking for a job was unchanged in october that suggested that the reopening of schools in september the waning of the virus and the expiration of a 300 a week federal unemployment supplement have yet to coax many people off the sidelines of the job market in large numbers drawing many people back into the workforce after recessions is typically a prolonged process there are now 7 4 million people officially out of work just 1 7 million more than in february 2020 before the pandemic struck the economy yet millions more who lost jobs during the recession have given up their job hunts and employers might have to raise pay and benefits to draw them back in said aaron sojourner a labor economist at the university of minnesota even so some companies still can t find enough workers many parents particularly mothers haven t returned to the workforce after having left jobs during the pandemic to care for children or other relatives yet there was evidence of a small rebound last month the proportion of women who were either working or looking for work rose after two months of declines kourtni graves of detroit has been in and out of work during the pandemic because of her parenting duties she quit an administrative assistant job a year ago because her day care had shut down and she had to look after her 5 year old twin girls graves 27 looked for work from home jobs but many employers didn t want to provide the flexibility she needed they don t want you to

greaney minn beryl novak bought 40 acres of forest here in 1966 for 700 eventually moved an old one room shack to the site for a deer hunting cabin and then liked it so much he moved in for good that was 1977 he hasn t lived anyplace else since he hasn t slept in any other bed not a single night away since may 1993 i m kind of a homebody novak said he also hasn t hunted deer anywhere else and on saturday morning nov 6 novak will be in his favorite deer stand a 5 by 8 foot tarpaper shack with a slide up window where odds are he will see some deer whether or not he gets a legal buck will be up

hour s drive north of hibbing overlooking a mowed clearing with a backdrop of spruce and balsam about 140 yards out he has shot dozens of deer from this spot most with his trusty 270 winchester some of them just minutes into the first morning of the season the annual deer hunt has become part of his life s routine a rhythm that revolves around nature s seasons things like putting up firewood tending his big garden planting and grafting dozens of apple trees and walking hundreds of miles each autumn in search of grouse already this season he s bagged two dozen grouse by walking slowly watching and listening on forest trails beryl novak walks past a deer rub while grouse hunting monday nov 1 2021 steve kuchera duluth news tribune but it hasn t been easy i figure it s about 5 miles walking for each bird he said as we walked and talked in his woods shotguns at the ready on a brisk november morning we flushed a couple grouse that day but didn t get any shots advertisement over the years living out here novak has had close calls with wolves and has battled with bears but it all seems to come in stride for an outdoorsman who doesn t rattle easily who seemingly has seen and done everything the northwoods has to offer started young novak 71 shot his first deer at age 10 in 1960 hunting alone he still has the paper hunting license and aluminum buck tag pressed between pages in a photo album since then novak figures he s shot 75 deer in these woods northwest of cook beryl novak still has his deer license and tag from 1960 steve kuchera duluth news tribune he has a memory like a steel trap and rattles off dates and antler counts from hunting seasons a half century ago like they happened yesterday novak was born and raised in this country and graduated from orr high school in 1968 he liked cars of course and girls but his passion has always been the outdoors hunting fishing and trapping my dad died when i was 5 novak said but i had a mentor teach me grouse hunting joe kasun when i was 7 he gave me a single shot 22 to use and one 22 short bullet and took me grouse hunting and told me not to miss i got one deer hunting though i had to figure out on my own advertisement and he has a 10 year old beryl novak poses with the buck he shot in 1960 contributed beryl novack novak attended a vocational college and then with a low draft number looming enlisted in the u s air force and stayed in for nearly four years from 1970 74 he was stationed at several bases across the u s and spent eight months in vietnam at the 483rd usaf hospital at cam ranh bay where the base would come under occasional rocket attack and where he saw the horrors of war firsthand with a parade of wounded on display through his military service he would come home on leave scheduled around hunting seasons i came home to hunt he said it s what i thought about when i was over there related a northwoods living novak s one room home is 16 by 20 feet what city folks these days might call a tiny house it has no running water there s a hand pump outside a few steps an outhouse of course and a sauna shed too advertisement i don t have to worry about pipes freezing novak quipped it s an armstrong pump a big barrel wood stove heats the place when it s cold and novak has a few seasons worth of fuel stacked neatly outside there s a gas range for cooking a bed in the corner and a small tv that gets three stations over the airwaves beryl novak talks with a visitor in his one room cabin monday nov 1 2021 steve kuchera duluth news tribune why would you need any more than that everything on tv is all so damned depressing anyway novak said there s a 2017 calendar on the door still next to a reminder note for next year s dental appointment dusty cds and dvds and piles of outdoor and gardening magazines cover much of the kitchen table a few old buck antlers trophies from long past seasons are stashed in the corner a few mounted fish adorn the walls antlers from past hunts lay on a table in beryl novak s cabin monday nov 1 2021 steve kuchera duluth news tribune advertisement novak worked the usual northwoods jobs over the years including as a logger and then on a sand and gravel crew he trapped and sold furs beaver otter fisher and pine marten until the bottom dropped out of the fur market and prices plummeted he picked wild blueberries and sold them to grocery stores in town he cut and sold balsam boughs and firewood for a spell too novak formally retired in 1995 meaning that s the point he stopped trying to earn a living and focused on the living part there wasn t anyone left calling me who i wanted to talk to people would say but we can t get ahold of you and i d say that s the point beryl novak it doesn t cost much to live up here i get by pretty cheap he said it s not that he doesn t like people novak said just that he found it hard always trying to get along you can t satisfy people so i said the hell with it and here i am he said adding that he doesn t consider himself a hermit i get visitors just not as many as i used to everyone is dying off beryl novak unloads his shotgun outside the one room cabin he s lived in since 1977 after a grouse hunt monday nov 1 2021 steve kuchera duluth news tribune advertisement his last car broke down in 2005 and he hasn t driven one since although he does have a four wheel atv that can get him the mile or so down the road to another 43 acre parcel he owns and hunts on he keeps mowed trails on his land that attract deer grouse and other wildlife and make for easy walking he has planted hundreds of apple plum and pine trees along the trails novak depends on the kindness of a few friends and neighbors to get him to his annual doctor and dental checkups or to bring him fresh food on occasion in return he shares crops from his garden or maybe a cleaned and packaged grouse breast he stocks up on provisions in town a few times each year most everything else he grows or shoots on his own conservation officers occasionally add to his larder by dropping off an illegally killed deer this year s drought cut into his sweet corn crop but his melons onions and carrots did well with him carrying water from the pump a late may hard freeze crippled novak s apple crop though nipping the buds it s the first time i ve ever had a total failure for apples he noted his last dog died eight years ago and he s not planning to get another i didn t feel it was right to have a dog and not have a way to get him to the vet he said it s bad enough for people to have to take me to the doctor s but it s too much to ask someone else to take my dog to the vet simplifying life at his annual checkup in august in hibbing doctors proclaimed novak perfectly fit he takes no medications and goes years between suffering a cold or the flu because he doesn t mix in crowds and novak noted that he has been perfectly situated to guard against the covid 19 pandemic i ve been social distancing out

home area during one stretch between october 2020 and february 2021 he went 134 days without leaving more than four months between trips to cook just 25 miles away i didn t have any reason i had to go he said he hasn t shaved or had a haircut since 2001 when he grew it out to spite his mom who had been nagging him about his appearance she s long since passed but he still hasn t relented i don t have to live to suit anyone else he said his shoulder length hair falls out a lot it doesn t get that long novak cut off his landline service in 1995 tired of telemarketers and went 20 years without a telephone there wasn t anyone left calling me who i wanted to talk to novak said people would say but we can t get ahold of you and i d say that s the point in spring 2015 a neighbor whose hunting land he keeps watch on gave him an inexpensive cellphone to report problems on he got me one new one since and he s still paying the bills novak said it s definitely not a smartphone he has no computer no email and no facebook it s as if the last 25 years of technology have passed him by and it s clear he doesn t care as long as he has his rifle and shotgun and is fit to walk in the woods he s happy beryl novak poses with the eight point buck he shot in 1977 the first year he lived in his one room cabin contributed beryl novack novak keeps a tattered dog eared paperback of henry david thoreau s essays on the virtues of self reliant backwoods living near his bed it s become a sort of guidebook for his lifestyle it might even be in his pocket on saturday for the deer opener if people

politics u s employers shrugged off virus and stepped up hiring friday s report from the labor department also showed that the unemployment rate fell to 4 6 last month from 4 8 in september a hiring sign is displayed in downers grove illinois the number of americans applying for unemployment benefits fell to a fresh pandemic low last week another sign the job market is healing after last year s coronavirus recession jobless claims dropped by 14 000 to 269 000 last week ap photo nam y huh file the associated press washington ap america s employers accelerated their hiring last month adding a solid 531 000 jobs the most since july and a sign that the recovery from the pandemic recession is overcoming a virus induced slowdown friday s report from the labor department also showed that the unemployment rate fell to 4 6 last month from 4 8 in september that is a comparatively low level though still well above the pre pandemic jobless rate of 3 5 and the job gains in august and september weren t as weak as initially reported the government increased its estimate of hiring for those two months by a hefty combined 235 000 jobs all told the figures point to an economy that is steadily recovering from the pandemic recession with healthy consumer spending prompting companies in nearly every industry to add workers though the effects of covid 19 are still causing severe supply shortages heightening inflation and keeping many people out of the workforce employers are finding gradually more success in filling near record high job postings advertisement this is the kind of recovery we can get when we are not sidelined by a surge in covid cases said nick bunker director of economic research at the employment website indeed the speed of employment gains has faltered at times this year but the underlying momentum of the u s labor market is quite clear the better than expected jobs report was welcomed on wall street where investors sent stocks further into record territory the dow jones industrial average rose more than 200 points or roughly 0 6 in friday trading short term treasury yields rose as some investors moved up their expectations for when the federal reserve will begin raising interest rates but longer term yields dipped amid muted expectations for inflation over the long term by most barometers the economic recovery appears solidly on track services companies in such areas as retail banking and warehousing have reported a sharp jump in sales sales of new and existing homes surged last month and consumer confidence rose in october after three straight declines at the same time though the nation remains 4 2 million jobs short of the number it had before the pandemic flattened the economy in march 2020 the effects of the virus are still discouraging some people from traveling shopping eating out and attending entertainment venues advertisement in october the pickup in hiring was spread across nearly every major industry with only government employers reporting a job loss mostly in education shipping and warehousing companies added 54 000 jobs the battered leisure and hospitality sector which includes restaurants bars hotels and entertainment venues gained 164 000 manufacturers despite their struggles with supply shortages added 60 000 the most since june 2020 and employers who have been competing to fill jobs from a diminished pool of applicants raised wages at a solid clip average hourly pay jumped 4 9 in october compared with a year earlier up from 4 6 the previous month even a gain that strong though is barely keeping pace with recent surges in consumer inflation those price increases pose a headwind for the economy higher costs for food heating oil rents and furniture have burdened millions of families prices rose 4 4 in september compared with 12 months earlier the sharpest such jump in three decades among people who are receiving pay raises some of the biggest beneficiaries are the record high number of people who have been quitting jobs to take new ones one of them is christian frink who has begun work as a business analyst at a digital consulting firm in his new job frink 27 of ferndale michigan helps business clients determine the technologies they need advertisement earlier this year frink held a marketing job but left it because like many people during covid he felt burnt out he then worked for door dash during the spring and summer to earn money and searched for new work although employers were complaining about a labor shortage several told him they wouldn t hire anyone without a college degree frink attended college but didn t graduate this past summer frink took coding classes at tech elevator a boot camp and then landed his new position now he s earning 35 more than in his previous job and says he s blown away that he already has health care coverage and doesn t have to wait months to become eligible yet it isn t only job switchers who are receiving pay raises chad leibundguth a regional director in tampa for the robert half staffing agency said the job market is the strongest for workers he has seen in his 22 year career before the pandemic he said you could fill a customer service job in florida for 14 an hour nowadays he said you ve got to be closer to 20 an hour because people have options job prospects are brightening even for people who have been out of work for prolonged periods the number of long term unemployed people who have been jobless for six months or more has fallen sharply in recent months to 2 3 million in october from 4 2 million in april that s still double the pre recession total but it s an encouraging sign because employers are typically wary of hiring people who haven t held jobs for an extended time advertisement at the same time disparities in the job market have persisted the black unemployment rate was unchanged in october at 7 9 for example while for white workers it fell to 4 from 4 2 the latino jobless rate dropped to 5 9 from 6 3 and though white collar jobs in professional services like information technology engineering and architecture are nearly back to their pre pandemic employment levels leisure and hospitality still has 1 4 million fewer jobs hari ravichandran ceo of digital security provider aura in boston says his 800 person company has 140 positions open mostly in software development ravichandran is willing to hire remote workers 170 of his staffers have never regularly worked in any of the company s buildings still hiring remains as tough as he s ever experienced one disappointing note in friday s report is that the workforce the number of people either working or looking for a job was unchanged in october that suggested that the reopening of schools in september the waning of the virus and the expiration of a 300 a week federal unemployment supplement have yet to coax many people off the sidelines of the job market in large numbers drawing many people back into the workforce after recessions is typically a prolonged process there are now 7 4 million people officially out of work just 1 7 million more than in february 2020 before the pandemic struck the economy yet millions more who lost jobs during the recession have given up their job hunts and employers might have to raise pay and benefits to draw them back in said aaron sojourner a labor economist at the university of minnesota advertisement even so some companies still can t find enough workers many parents particularly mothers haven t returned to the workforce after having left jobs during the pandemic to care for children or other relatives yet there was evidence of a small rebound last month the proportion of women who were either working or looking for work rose after two months of declines kourtni graves of detroit has been in and out of work during the pandemic because of her parenting duties she quit an administrative assistant job a year ago because her day care had shut down and she had to look after her 5 year old twin girls graves 27 looked for work from home jobs but many employers didn t want to provide the flexibility she needed they don t want you to have to pick up your kids from school particularly during training she said for me as their mom i can t do that she said the father of her children who works in the auto industry helps financially but with the girls now in kindergarten graves broadened her job search and this week accepted a job at a clothing store she feels overqualified given her seven years working in administrative jobs but she is happy to be working they re paying pretty decent for retail she said it s definitely been a struggle and a journey this story has been corrected to remove an erroneous reference to a 25 pay increase at aura in the past nine months

the swirling controversy over the university of california santa barbara s proposed plan to add billionaire real estate investor charles munger s massive self designed dormitory building to its exhausted stock of student housing has been addressed by the university in a campus wide q a published yesterday in which it answered misconceptions about the project s design features and doubled down on its reasoning and necessity overall last week s revelation that architect dennis mcfadden had resigned in early october after a university planning meeting resulted in a heated letter to the design review committee making waves on our discussion board and even landing ucsb in national news outlets in part over munger s deep connections with billionaire investor warren buffett university officials failed to address mcfadden s indignation over its questionable contingent approval process but were able to issue a defense of sorts in the form of a self prompted answer sheet that claimed the building would be in fact be up to code safe for students and situated on lower ground in a bowl that would be both appropriate and comparable to other structures on its 1 127 acre campus a question from the prompt provided some insight as to the most apparent flaw in the 1 68 million square foot proposal intended to house more than 4 500 students the university stated that the floor plan was based on a traditional house system model and included significant access to natural light and fresh air ventilation and pointed to the argument that it did indeed include 1 000 exterior windows and had more than a few perimeter units facing the outside ucsb addressed the interior residences confounding lack of windows stating that the approach allows for more student bedrooms and amenities on the site and repeating its claim that the dorm s common areas all featured large external windows and therefore significant access to natural light a suite in one of the houses image courtesy ucsb the statements made by the project team also rebuked reports taken from mcfadden s claim that the dorm features a paltry two entrances stating the correct number is actually fifteen a more sensical amount for dorm buildings of a similar size according to the university another prompt addressed concerns over the design philosophy behind the building raised in the architect s letter claiming munger hall is larger than but very similar to the graduate housing building for the university of michigan and improves on many of the michigan concepts in a recent survey taken by veryapt an apartment survey guide 117 reviews about the michigan project were compiled and resulted in a score of 8 8 out of 10 in user satisfaction with particularly high rankings for the amenities and convenience while some residents expressed a dissatisfaction most are quite pleased with the building and do not mind the windowless bedrooms lacking even virtual windows such as those planned for l first floor plan of munger hall image courtesy ucsb again the statement continues the university recognizes that this communal and co living experience and environment is not for every student that is why there will be many other housing options both on and off campus the rest of the answers served more as a promotion of the building s sustainable concept and use as an alternative to off campus housing in the more expensive nearby santa barbara county communities the uc system as a whole is undergoing a tremendous housing shortage crisis that has consumed campuses up and down the coast in a mirror to the overall crisis affecting californians statewide archinect will publish further updates as they are provided the full public q a from the university can be found here

walking for each bird he said as we walked and talked in his woods shotguns at the ready on a brisk november morning we flushed a couple grouse that day but didn t get any shots advertisement over the years living out here novak has had close calls with wolves and has battled with bears but it all seems to come in stride for an outdoorsman who doesn t rattle easily who seemingly has seen and done

like a steel trap and rattles off dates and antler counts from hunting seasons a half century ago like they happened yesterday novak was born and raised in this country and graduated from orr high school in 1968 he liked cars of course and girls but his passion has always been the outdoors hunting fishing and trapping my dad died when i was 5 novak said but i had a mentor teach me grouse hunting joe kasun when i was 7 he gave me a single shot 22 to use and one 22 short bullet and took me grouse hunting and told me not to miss i got one deer hunting though i had to figure out on my own

the u s air force and stayed in for nearly four years from 1970 74 he was stationed at several bases across the u s and spent eight months in vietnam at the 483rd usaf hospital at cam ranh bay where the base would come under occasional rocket attack and where he saw the horrors of war firsthand with a parade of wounded on display through his military service he would come home on leave scheduled around hunting seasons i came home to hunt he said it s what i thought about when i was over there related a northwoods living novak s one room home is 16 by 20 feet what city folks these days might call a tiny house it has no running water there s a hand pump outside a few steps an outhouse of course and a sauna shed too advertisement i don t have to worry about pipes freezing novak quipped it s an armstrong pump a big barrel wood stove heats the place when it s cold and novak has a few seasons worth of fuel stacked neatly outside there s a gas range for cooking a bed in the corner and a small tv that gets three stations over the airwaves beryl novak talks with a visitor in his one room cabin monday nov 1 2021 steve kuchera duluth news tribune why would you need any more than that everything on tv is all so damned depressing anyway novak said there s a 2017 calendar on the door still next to a reminder note for next year s dental appointment dusty cds and dvds and piles of outdoor and gardening magazines cover much of the kitchen table a few old buck antlers trophies from long past seasons are stashed in the corner a few mounted fish adorn the walls antlers from past hunts lay on a table in beryl novak s cabin monday nov 1 2021 steve kuchera duluth news tribune advertisement novak worked the usual northwoods jobs over the years including as a logger and then on a sand and gravel crew he trapped and sold furs beaver otter fisher and pine marten until the bottom dropped out of the fur market and prices plummeted he picked wild blueberries and sold them to grocery stores in town he cut and sold balsam boughs and firewood for a spell too novak formally retired in 1995 meaning that s the point he stopped trying to earn a living and focused on the living part there wasn t anyone left calling me who i wanted to talk to people would say but we can t get ahold of you and i d say that s the point beryl novak it doesn t cost much to live up here i get by pretty cheap he said it s not that he doesn t like people novak said just that he found it hard always trying to get along you can t satisfy people so i said the hell with it and here i am he said

after a grouse hunt monday nov 1 2021 steve kuchera duluth news tribune advertisement his last car broke down in 2005 and he hasn t driven one since although he does have a four wheel atv that can get him the mile or so down the road to another 43 acre parcel he owns and hunts on he keeps mowed trails on his land that attract deer grouse and other wildlife and make for easy walking he has planted hundreds of apple plum and pine trees along the trails novak depends on the kindness of a few friends and neighbors to get him to his annual doctor and dental checkups or to bring him fresh food on occasion in return he shares crops from his garden or maybe a cleaned and packaged grouse breast he stocks up on provisions in town a few times each year most everything else he grows or shoots on his own conservation officers occasionally add to his larder by dropping off an illegally killed deer this year s drought cut into his sweet corn crop but his melons onions and carrots did well with him carrying water from the pump a late may hard freeze crippled novak s apple crop though nipping the buds it s the first time i ve ever had a total failure for apples he noted his last dog died eight years ago and he s not planning to get another i didn t feel it was right to have a dog and not have a way to get him to the vet he said it s bad enough for people to have to take me to the doctor s but it s too much to ask someone else to take my dog to the vet simplifying life at his annual checkup in august in hibbing doctors proclaimed novak perfectly fit he takes no medications and goes years between suffering a cold or the flu because he doesn t mix in crowds and novak noted that he has been perfectly situated to guard against the covid 19 pandemic i ve been social distancing out

have to live to suit anyone else he said his shoulder length hair falls out a lot it doesn t get that long novak cut off his landline service in 1995 tired of telemarketers and went 20 years without a telephone there wasn t anyone left calling me who i wanted to talk to novak said people would say but we can t get ahold of you and i d say that s the point in spring 2015 a neighbor whose hunting

computer no email and no facebook it s as if the last 25 years of technology have passed him by and it s clear he doesn t care as long as he has his rifle and shotgun and is fit to walk in the woods

commentary at the last minute gov gavin newsom canceled his much anticipated trip to cop26 the united nations climate change conference in glasgow the world s fifth largest economy california went unrepresented by its leader so too the first or second largest economy depending on how it s figured as chinese president xi jinping also stayed home there s a close relationship between the two economies as shown by the california china climate institute established in 2019 by former gov jerry brown at berkeley s school of law and college of natural resources back when he was governor brown showed the seriousness of his climate change principles by always flying to climate conferences on private jets russian president putin also stayed away president joe biden did attend and when not sleeping through presentations he attacked xi and putin for skipping out biden said the fact that china is trying to assert understandably a new role in the world as a world leader not showing up come on big mistake tuesday was the day biden s democratic party lost a major election for governor of virginia the united states russia and china also are the world s top nuclear powers meaning they decide their own policies and on tuesday in glasgow biden announced a major crackdown on methane production only in the united states of course the white house fact sheet from nov 2 read president biden is unveiling a u s methane emissions reduction action plan that redoubles efforts from across the government to dramatically reduce u s methane emissions cut consumer costs protect workers and communities maintain and create high quality union friendly jobs and promote u s innovation and manufacturing of critical new technologies the biden administration also is going to skirt congress by imposing new regulations appearing on msnbc white house national climate adviser gina mccarthy promised i m leaving in the verbiage about investments so you can read how these people think well what i would say is there s room for regulation but this package this framework that the president is looking at is all about investments it s not about penalties it s all about how we use our economic muscle to move forward and again win the jobs of today and the jobs of the future so they can talk about regulation all they want there s a place for it we re going to use it because there s opportunities that can t be captured otherwise but right now if you look at this framework you don t see regulations and rules you see opportunity after opportunity it s the old trick of creating jobs in a favored sector by taxing and regulating an unfavored sector the result always is fewer jobs especially for the middle class lt gov eleni kounalakis in glasgow the highest ranking californian to attend was lt gov eleni kounalakis on a tuesday panel she said newsom s executive order to end all sales of carbon powered cars by 2035 is already reshaping the future of our light duty vehicles and commercial vehicle travel across the world except as i reported previously in the epoch times the anderson economic group just produced a study that found electric vehicles can be more expensive to fuel than their internal combustion engine counterparts yesterday a corroborating study arrived in my mailbox in the december 2021 issue of motor trend magazine not yet online editor angus mackenzie wrote according to researchers at britain s university of cambridge building an ev produces 30 to 40 percent more emissions than building a conventional car most of the increase comes from battery production minerals such as lithium and cobalt currently require energy intensive mining techniques and long supply chains and today s battery factories have very high carbon footprints over time the researchers say the greater efficiency of evs during their active life cycle will more than offset that increase regardless of how the electricity is generated but they concede there could be a temporary increase in overall carbon emissions until there are enough evs on the road traveling enough miles to tip the balance and even then unless you use electricity generated from water wind or solar sources the first law of thermodynamics still applies evs are powered by energy derived from a heat engine mackenzie reported global ev use was 10 million in 2020 the international energy agency expects there to be at least 145 million by 2020 possibly 230 million over the same time period say mit researchers the number of vehicles with internal combustion engines is expected to increase from 1 2 billion to between 1 8 billion and 2 0 billion his conclusion for all the recent and forecasted future progress on the ev front we re still going to be pumping an awful lot of carbon into the atmosphere the oligarchs have landed another problem is all the multi billionaire oligarchs pushing a green economy making a profit for themselves also generate a massive carbon footprint in addition to their multitudinous mansions and island hideaways they fly everywhere in private jets the daily mail reported amazon founder jeff bezos 48million gulf stream has led a 400 strong parade of private jets into cop26 including prince albert of monaco scores of royals and dozens of green ceos as an extraordinary traffic jam forced empty planes to fly 30 miles to find space to park conservative predictions suggest the fleet of private jets arriving for cop26 will blast out 13 000 tons of carbon dioxide in total equivalent to the amount consumed by more than 1 600 britons in a year mr bezos who regularly lectures the world on climate change arrived in glasgow fresh from celebrating microsoft founder bill gates 66th birthday on a 2 million a week superyacht off the coast of turkey in an event that generated fresh claims of green hypocrisy he reached the boat by helicopter according to reports president biden alone will generate an estimated 2 2 million pounds of carbon to reach the summit thanks to a fleet of four planes the marine one helicopter and an enormous motorcade including the beast and numerous suvs great britain hasn t suffered so many foreign planes invading since the goering s luftwaffe attacked during the 1940 battle of britain not much will be done the fact is not much will be done after this conference first is the problem that it s questionable there is any extreme climate danger what if the problems we re facing can be worked out over the coming decades by adapting fourth generation nuclear power and more fuel efficient carbon based vehicles as to bezos he just donated 500 million to a renewable energy push the fact is not much will be done after this conference first is the problem that it s questionable there is any extreme climate danger what if the problems we re facing can be worked out over the coming decades by adapting fourth generation nuclear power and more fuel efficient carbon based vehicles then there are the economic problems in the two largest greenhouse gas producing countries china and india cnn business reported from hong kong flooding in northern china is hitting a major coal production center hard sending coal prices soaring and complicating efforts by beijing to tackle ongoing power shortages if xi lessened his heavy repression of civil liberties it would be easier to find solutions to these problems because the free flow of information would produce needed debate but that s not the policy he s following in any case it s obvious china is seeking more coal powered energy not less as to india the bbc reported more than half of the country s 135 coal fired power plants are running on fumes as coal stocks run critically low in a country where 70 percent of the electricity is generated using coal this is a major cause for concern as it threatens to derail india s post pandemic economic recovery india is a democracy so they are having lively discussions on how to solve this problem but they too are not near ready to cut back on using coal power plants

with less milk and more cheese butter is the odd man out published friday november 5 2021 the following is from lee mielke author of a dairy market column known as mielke market weekly u s butter stocks keep heading lower after falling below those a year ago in august for the first time since june 2019 the agriculture department s latest cold storage report shows the sept 30 butter inventory at 330 1 million pounds down 32 6 million pounds or 9 percent from the august level which was revised 4 2 million pounds lowered than what was reported a month ago stocks were down 13 8 million pounds or 4 percent below september 2020 american type cheese stocks jumped to 844 1 million pounds up 17 million pounds or 2 1 percent from august and were 71 5 million pounds or 9 3 percent above those a year ago the august level was revised up 3 5 million pounds the other cheese category climbed to 592 2 million pounds up 8 6 million pounds or 1 5 percent from august and 31 5 million or 5 6 percent above a year ago the resulting total cheese inventory stood at 1 46 billion pounds up 25 5 million pounds or 1 8 percent from august and 104 6 million or 7 7 percent above a year ago chicago based stonex dairy group says it expected cheese stocks to come in lower than forecast given how weak milk production was in september but instead were 45 million pounds heavier than they forecast cheese plants were likely getting more than enough milk in september explains stonex while the weak milk production does raise the upside risk for cheese prices the relatively heavy inventories are bearish for prices they add that with milk production down and cheese production still strong butter production has likely taken a hit which is allowing inventories to be pulled down we ll find out in the nov 4 dairy products report butter stocks were 7 million pounds lower than stonex forecast but they add the caveat stocks last year were very heavy so being down 4 percent still leaves butter stocks at adequate levels with milk production expected to stay weak and cheese production expected to stay relatively strong we are going to continue to pull butter stocks down and that should be supportive for prices cash dairy product prices at the chicago mercantile exchange ended october with cheese heading lower and butter powder and whey climbing as traders anticipated the next global dairy trade

and growing milk output milk usage kept offers quieter last week according to dmn looking westward food service cheese demand remains steady and retail sales are even year over year export interest is healthy says dmn but ports are still congested and shipping is not without difficulties production at some plants is limited by staffing shortages but other facilities are able to operate at capacity and work through ample milk supplies cheese inventories are plentiful and growing although block availability was said to be looser than barrels some contacts believe tighter barrel supplies may be contributing to the inversion cme butter had a good week closing last friday at 1 94 per pound up 10 50 cents on the week highest since june 10 2020 up 19 25 cents for the month and 55 cents above a year ago there were 14 sales on the week and 25 for the month down from 121 in september butter producers say cream remains tight if not tighter production schedules are reportedly stunted due primarily to plant employee and driver shortages there have been recent improvements in hiring but the timeframe for a more normal production situation is unpredictable according to plant managers as manufacturing geared for holiday retail order surges bulk butter availability has declined and prices have done the opposite butter market tones are notably bullish says dmn some believe this shift could be short lived while others are viewing 2022 through a different lens cream has been available and is meeting demand in recent weeks in the west but stakeholders are now trying to find a home for it after the fire at an idaho plant food service butter demand is holding steady says dmn but contacts report retail demand has softened retailers are looking to stock coolers in anticipation of strong holiday demand fresh inventories of butter are tight though older stocks are available labor shortages are causing producers to run shortened schedules but are running busy schedules when able

along with presents christmas trees may also cost consumers more money this year with some reports show prices may be up by 20 environmental and economic factors are to blame for that costlier tree as far as getting an artificial christmas tree problems start at the ports for the real thing droughts and wildfires are to blame if you re buying a tree that s been grown for 10 years for 200 there s a lot of transportation a lot of work in pruning maintaining and growing that tree said brian blake with whitfill nursery blake says one of his suppliers in california lost his entire farm in a fire and suppliers in oregon dealt with hot temperatures and drought conditions blake says they are doing their best to secure a full stock of trees as far as exactly how much more they may cost it is too early to tell we re yet to see what our transport costs are going to be this year but our california la shipments are double so we went from 1 200 a truck to 2 400 now so the christmas trees are still untold until we re actually moving the trees down but we expect shipment for trees to about double this year said blake trees arrive at whitfill right before thanksgiving and will go on sale at all of their locations the day after thanksgiving blake says if the tree is taken care of properly it will last until the new year other top stories tune in to fox 10 phoenix for the latest news download fox 10 apps for local breaking news and weather sign up for fox 10 email alerts newsletters

for months consumers have been hearing they ll need to shop early to keep supply chain issues from playing scrooge with holiday gift giving some are heeding that advice when shopping for thanksgiving feasts too about 400 people have ordered turkeys from paulina market twice the number of orders the lakeview butcher shop and specialty grocer would usually have this early in november said owner bill begale we have christmas orders already which is rare he said begale isn t worried about running short he ordered more than 1 400 turkeys from a minnesota farm in august grocery stores too say there s no reason to panic cranberries and canned pumpkin won t be as scarce as toilet paper and hand sanitizer were at the start of the pandemic still industry experts say people should avoid waiting until the last minute to shop and expect to pay more veronica nigh senior economist at the american farm bureau federation said she would expect the cost of a typical thanksgiving dinner to increase roughly in line with the u s department of agriculture s 3 to 4 forecasted rise in food prices for the year last year the national average cost of a thanksgiving dinner for 10 with a 16 pound turkey sides and homemade pumpkin pie was 46 90 according to the farm bureau s annual survey this year s estimate is not yet available but a 3 5 increase would add 1 64 to the price the turkey is the most expensive item on the farm bureau s shopping list accounting for about 40 of the total cost last year and it s also likely to see the biggest price increase this year frozen turkeys in a cooler at a pete s fresh market on nov 2 2021 in glen ellyn a 10 4 increase in meat poultry and fish prices drove the consumer price index for food up 4 5 in september compared with the same month last year poultry prices didn t spike as much as other meats but still rose 6 1 as of late last month the wholesale price for frozen turkeys weighing between 8 and 16 pounds was roughly 13 higher than last year according to the u s department of agriculture turkey production has been declining over the past couple years while demand is up as more consumers have been cooking at home during the pandemic pushing prices up said wells fargo senior vice president and agribusiness consultant kevin bergquist manufacturers are also facing higher costs tight staffing has pushed wages up and shortages of truck drivers have led to transportation bottlenecks he said it s not just meat and turkey first slice pie cafe with shops in ravenswood manor and andersonville is paying more for some ingredients such as condensed milk and pumpkin which first slice s supplier now considers a more expensive special order item said catering coordinator nicole mancha they re also spending more to send drivers to pick up items from alternate vendors when their usual suppliers are sold out first slice had to raise prices by about a dollar a pie though that doesn t fully cover its cost increases mancha said large pies serving 10 to 12 people cost between 26 and 33 at this point first slice isn t limiting the number of pumpkin pies people can order for thanksgiving but it isn t taking special requests for some pies not on its thanksgiving menu such as banana cream it s hard enough to get the product we need without worrying about additional things mancha said the foods themselves usually aren t in short supply but ongoing supply chain woes disrupt the process of getting products to store shelves from labor issues at food manufacturers and transportation companies to shortages of components such as packaging materials after a year of scaled back festivities more families will be planning big get togethers boosting demand for thanksgiving items said peter goldsmith professor and director of the food and agribusiness management program at the university of illinois at urbana champaign while consumers shouldn t be concerned about shortages don t wait until wednesday night he said some of pete s fresh market s suppliers have put items such as pie crusts dinner rolls cream cheese cranberry sauce and canned pumpkin and pineapple on allocation which means pete s isn t getting as much of those items as it wants even though the company placed orders months ago grocery buyer leno asuncion said in an email stuffing mix gravy and mashed potatoes are among thanksgiving items on display at a pete s fresh market in glen ellyn on nov 2 2021 corn muffin mix is stocked and on display among thanksgiving dinner items at a pete s fresh market in glen ellyn the company works with multiple vendors but has still been challenged to make sure shelves are stocked for thanksgiving he said buyers and suppliers at trader joe s have been working tirelessly to keep our holiday products in stock for as long as we can as consistently as we can a spokesperson said in an email still retailers of all kinds are facing supply chain issues and when demand for certain items increases product shortages are unfortunately a possibility some businesses said they re working to head off supply issues by ordering early chris dallas owner of harvestime foods in ravenswood said his turkey supplier wants orders in 10 days before thanksgiving earlier than usual but everyone who orders before the deadline will get one the challenge is guessing how customers plans to celebrate will shape shopping lists a lot of people are getting together and really doing it up he said we don t know what that s going to translate to when it comes to customers looking to buy things hoosier mama pie co with shops in east ukrainian village ravenswood and evanston plans to finalize its ingredient orders for thanksgiving pies this week and work ahead as much as possible filling their freezers with crusts said assistant general manager sally arenberg one location already sold all the thanksgiving pies available for advance orders though more will be available for walk up customers hoosier mama hasn t been able to get its preferred brand of gingersnaps used in some pie crusts since august arenberg said the company found other options but lemon puree has been tougher their usual brand is dealing with labor shortages and some of the substitutes they found are now sold out too we need to be able to give vendors a heads up it s just more careful planning she said sunset foods with five stores in the north suburbs ordered its thanksgiving turkeys several months earlier than usual because the farm warned it was having trouble hiring workers said dan humphrey the store s director of meat and seafood the turkeys are arriving and he isn t worried about shortages canned ham on the other hand is running low because manufacturers having trouble keeping up with demand tend to cut items that are less popular or more labor intensive but sunset foods feels like it s in a good spot especially now that a couple items they were waiting for such as canned pumpkin and nestle chocolate chips have arrived said grocery buyer chris hanson people should not panic said sunset foods spokeswoman sarah hanlon it might be a different brand or size but everyone s going to find what they need for a traditional thanksgiving lzumbach chicagotribune com

snap back from where they were in february is there anything comparable going on in major commercial office space either in manhattan or other large cities luis alvarado chief revenue officer and east region market leader henry this is luis alvarado look we re seeing recovery really across all the markets that you saw by the pickup in activity primarily this is really being driven by people finally making some decisions and making commitments to space although in our gateway cities i would tell you the office volume is still not back to the 2019 levels but certainly what s driven it is that a lot of the changes have been driven by growth in life science and industrial which is more than making up by some of the volume that is down in the office we believe that in those markets where we ve historically had a significant market share as these things improve which we believe will happen in january as people go back to the office we re going to continue to pick up market share and our revenues will continue to grow so we re very pleased with what has happened and we re optimistic about the return to the office in the january and specifically as you saw with the recent osha release that gives a little more guidance as to how people will return to the office henry coffey wedbush analyst great thank you jason mcgruder interim head of investor relations next question operator operator our next question comes from patrick o shaughnessy from raymond james please go ahead patrick o shaughnessy raymond james analyst hey good morning guys so obviously you guys announced some key hires and kind of foreshadowed some more global expansion and push into property and facilities management can you talk about what impact do you think that s going to have on newmark s margin profile over time michael rispoli chief financial officer sure patrick it s mike so i think what you re seeing is on a fee revenue basis we expect our margins to expand probably 50 to 100 basis points this year as compared to 2019 and we think that we can continue to expand those margins over time obviously it ll depend on mix but we feel pretty good about our ability to expand margins over time patrick o shaughnessy raymond james analyst got it okay thank you and then as we look at your liquidity at the end of the third quarter still pretty robust you still have i think a good chunk of the nasdaq shares on your balance sheet how are you thinking about deploying that liquidity between repurchases hires m a and other potential uses michael rispoli chief financial officer well i think you ve seen we continued to buy back shares in the third quarter and i think we ll continue to do that into the fourth quarter particularly where the stock is trading we still think it s there s a lot of room for upside there and then we think there s a lot of opportunity to invest in the business which we ve been doing you saw we did some things internationally in the quarter we ll continue to look globally as well as in the u s we still think there s a lot of white space to grow our business across all the business lines so we ll continue to invest back into the business patrick o shaughnessy raymond james analyst to follow up on that would you think you d be relatively more inclined to invest in the business by hiring and potentially some acquisitions as opposed to the pretty aggressive pace of repurchases the last couple of quarters or would you still expect to be pretty aggressive on the repurchase front barry m gosin chief executive officer i think we could do both we have as we said in the last quarter we have built the foundation for an opportunity to have significant gearing and scale we have lots of markets that are mature in respect to infrastructure but not in terms of market share really offering us enough white space to get the benefit of an increased margin and growth so we have lots of opportunities and lots of places to use our capital to grow smartly while maintaining margin we also have an enormous amount of white space and runway in around the globe which we ve now opened up and we re seeing quite a bit of reach out on the part of people who want to be a participant in what we ve created as a company and we re very excited about that global expansion michael rispoli chief financial officer yes and the last point i would add to that is in addition to the 1 billion of capital we have available to us today more than 1 billion we generate 400 million to 500 million of cash flow from the business every year and we expect that number to continue to grow over time patrick o shaughnessy raymond james analyst got it terrific and then one last question from me last quarter there was a conversation about the tax rate and the impact of maybe pulling forward some of that tax shield i think this quarter the non gaap or adjusted tax rate was around 21 is that the right number to be using going forward as well michael rispoli chief financial officer i think we should be around 18 on a go forward basis patrick somewhere in that neighborhood both this year on a full year basis and as we look ahead patrick o shaughnessy raymond james analyst okay terrific thank you operator thank you patrick we have jade rahmani back on the line from keefe bruyette woods so jade please go ahead your line is open jade rahmani keefe bruyette woods analyst thank you very much for the market overall what kind of growth rates do you think are reasonable next year for investment sales gse multifamily and leasing we re thinking something around 7 to 10 is reasonable for capital markets and for leasing something in the 15 to 25 range and i would assume the new market outgrow those estimates given its market share gains of late barry m gosin chief executive officer it s hard to determine exactly what the growth rate is i will tell you there s pent up demand in the office leasing once it settles out and people are secure about how they re going to come back to the office what we re seeing what we re not seeing is a lot of concierge multiple people using single desks companies are using their headquarters and their office space more as a place to attract people give them room and space to communicate and collaborate which is important so i think that the growth rate on office will certainly pick up on capital markets there s still the same enormous amount of liquidity 17 trillion or so of negative yield of zero yield negative yields around the world the u s and other parts are very attractive to invest and the allocation of institutional money toward real estate still continues to grow and interest rates remain low so interest rates remain low money is available demand will pick up the categories that have driven the market like multifamily industrial life science seem to have a really good runway ahead of us and office coming back is actually an opportunity with the fact that the new york and san fran have not come back and we ve done so well to me is a plus it s just once it starts to pick up and once the opportunity is there and we hit our volumes it ll bode well for our company jade rahmani keefe bruyette woods analyst thank you and many industries are facing a lot of issues with supply chain as well as labor constraints is that starting to impact newmark s business with respect to hiring perhaps pressure on wages that some of your peers have mentioned and in terms of the management services business as well as some of the other businesses are there any supply chain impacts currently being experienced barry m gosin chief executive officer so low interest rates and high inflation are generally historically good for real estate the one issue that could have an impact to supply chain but most people believe this is a temporary supply chain impediment which will be corrected and once the supply chain gets corrected there s pent up demand for goods and services and so that will pick up and catch up jade rahmani keefe bruyette woods analyst and lastly just wanted to clarify excluding the equity based comp and allocation of net income line is the comp and employee benefits line item all cash michael rispoli chief financial officer yes it would be all cash yes jade rahmani keefe bruyette woods analyst thank you very much operator it appears we have no further questions so i ll hand back over for any closing remarks barry m gosin chief executive officer we expect newmark to continue to grow and gain market share and are incredibly excited about our global prospects we also look forward to seeing you at our analyst and investor day on december 7 so have a great time operator duration 24 minutes call participants jason mcgruder interim head of investor relations

returns as of october 20 2021 john foley co founder and chief executive officer thank you peter good afternoon everyone thanks for joining us today before we recap the quarter and discuss our forecast i want to spend a moment providing some context for our updated outlook as you all well know stay at home and work from home orders coupled with commercial gym closures drove massive awareness gains for connected fitness accelerating an adoption curve that was already well underway given the unprecedented circumstances presented by the global pandemic we said last quarter that modeling the exit from covid and the massive growth we saw in fiscal 2021 would be a challenging task and that has certainly proven to be true with reduced backlogs our visibility into our future performance has become more limited from forecasting consumer demand to accurately predicting logistics costs our teams have never seen a more complex operating environment in which to guide our expected results this year as noted in our shareholder letter we are reducing our guidance for fiscal year 22 we have returned to presenting ranges given the uncertainty the swift timing of these changes since giving our initial guidance in august is not lost on us as we prepared our previous guidance we had to make assumptions about consumer behavior coming out of covid the impact of our original bike price reduction and the cost structure within our connected fitness segment all against the backdrop of a global supply chain crisis while we have had to manage carefully around many issues such as component shortages elevated freight costs and increased transportation costs i m proud of our team who has moved mountains to ensure that we have ample inventory across our portfolio ahead of the holiday season while we continue to see a nearly 100 two year growth cagr in both traffic and unit sales in q1 and into q2 we ve seen a greater than anticipated taper of our website traffic levels over the past two months and a slower than expected pickup in retail showroom traffic both of which are important inputs into our forward looking demand model this reduction in traffic has added increased near term uncertainty into our forecast as expected our original bike price reduction created a step shift in demand helping to broaden our demographic mix and expand our market opportunity the price move did significantly improve our e commerce conversion rate in fact greater than we expected but not enough to offset the year over year declines we have seen in overall traffic we saw a positive and sustained reception to the price moves in our international markets this was anticipated as our international consumers have proven to be more price sensitive to maintain a premium end to end member experience we made significant investments over the past year to scale manufacturing logistics and operations overall we believe we met the challenge but there s no doubt that in some cases we overcorrected that combined with the reduction to our demand picture and higher than expected costs across product transportation and delivery are causing a near term compression of our hardware margins however we are taking significant corrective actions to improve our profitability outlook which will impact the back half of fiscal year 22 and into fiscal year 23 while it s important for us to optimize fixed cost across the company we won t compromise our net promoter score position in the process we remain committed to our goal of winning connected fitness and our long term thesis of fitness moving into the home is unchanged we track our estimated market share closely and while sales are currently not meeting our previous forecast third party data suggests that we continue to build on our leading share of the connected fitness market we firmly believe at home fitness customers will want one subscription for a comprehensive home fitness platform and we are determined to be that one subscription moving on to thoughts on the quarter on august 30 we officially launched our new lower price tread in the u s and resumed sales in the u k and canada on september 28 we launched sales in germany and we look forward to bringing tread to australia in the not too distant future we have high expectations for our tread our tread platform provides members with both running and full body workouts taught by a great roster of instructors we have reimagined the tread experience in the same way we fundamentally improved the stationary bike experience with the launch of our original peloton bike since its introduction we have brought millions of people into home fitness through a dynamic ever changing fitness platform and our all new tread provides that same immersive experience but it will take some time to educate consumers that s ok we re committed to the platform and gained confidence from the high marks the product is receiving from both consumers and the press since the launch of our media support in late september we ve seen steady progress in building tread sales our tread net promoter scores are very encouraging with an initial nps in the u s of 89 points and with our planned investments in content and software our already great tread experience will continue to improve ask any bike member who joined the platform three years ago to compare the experience today versus when they purchased their bike there s no comparison and from an investment perspective as we ve said previously we expect the tread market to be foundational to our long term growth turning to our bike portfolio the original bike price reduction accelerated sales allowing us to convert more price sensitive households while we believe the wider price gap between bike and bike has resulted in some trade down impact we re comfortable with that outcome as we have said growing household penetration remains our primary objective on the engagement front we recently passed a significant milestone over 1 billion classes taken by our members we re honored to be playing such a positive role in our members lives and look forward to many billions more we finished the quarter with 2 49 million connected fitness subscriptions up 87 versus the year ago period end of quarter digital subscriptions were 887 000 up 74 versus a year ago and our global peloton member community now stands at over 6 2 million engagement per connected fitness subscription totaled 16 6 workouts per month declining modestly from q4 and more significantly when compared to last year s covid impacted quarter on a two year basis engagement was up 42 over the first quarter of 2020 as we have said summer months have traditionally seen lower engagement levels and we expect our first quarter to represent the trough quarter for engagement for the fiscal year as it has in every non covid year in our history in the quarter we continued to aggressively invest behind content and new software features for our members we produced over 2 500 new classes and launched features requested by our members examples include subtitles for live classes redesigned class filters a reimagined progress tracking feature and structured workout plans to help keep our members on track we also welcomed eight terrific new instructors bolstering both our new york and london based teams our new instructors will be teaching in english german and spanish with a focus on running tread boot camp strength walking outdoor and stretching finally this quarter featured the addition of 60 new running and cycling scenic classes which were taken over 1 million times in the period looking ahead we re about to enter our busiest time of the year our inventories are healthy and our logistics teams are well equipped for the seasonally strong sales period we have low expected otds across our portfolio as we know timely delivery is greatly appreciated during the holiday and new year s resolution periods now i ll hand it over to jill to review our q1 financial results and updated outlook jill woodworth chief financial officer thanks john i will start with a review of our first quarter results in q1 we generated total revenue of 805 million representing 6 year over year growth and an 88 two year cagr in terms of revenue drivers we had lower than expected financing penetration better than expected connected fitness churn partially offset by the 11 million adjustment to our return reserve for our tread recalls we added 161 000 net connected fitness subscriptions in the quarter bringing our end of quarter connected fitness membership base to 2 492 million up 87 year on year average net monthly connected fitness churn was 0 82 as a reminder we disclosed last quarter that we will no longer be offering forward churn guidance but will continue to report this metric we continue to expect low industry leading churn and high engagement especially as we head into colder weather at the end of q1 we had over 887 000 app subscribers representing 74 year over year growth slightly ahead of our internal expectations for the quarter we saw modestly better retention than expected but we re also seeing some challenges related to acquisition efficiencies as you likely know there have been some significant changes made by apple that are leading to some targeting headwinds like many other direct to consumer marketers we re seeing some disruptive impact as our teams adjust to the new data landscape looking ahead we remain bullish on our app business and its role as an important lead generation tool for connected fitness our teams will continue to adjust to the new marketplace reality and we expect our corporate wellness initiatives to begin to contribute more meaningfully to our app business as the year progresses moving to gross margin gross margin for the quarter was 32 6 which came in slightly below our expectations this was entirely due to our connected fitness product segment which had a gross margin of 12 below our guidance of 15 there were two primary drivers of our connected fitness gross margin shortfall an increase in our return reserve for our recalled tread products and some inefficiencies seen in freight out and logistics as we mentioned last quarter forecasting tread returns has proven to be very challenging while we saw an easing of return activity through late summer we believe the expiration of our subscription waivers motivated a higher than anticipated number of tread owners to initiate returns consequently in the quarter we increased our reserve to account for this activity as a reminder the impact of recall related returns is added back to our adjusted ebitda but is fully reflected on the revenue and gross profit line with this increase in our reserve we are attempting to capture the entirety of expected returns from now until the end of the recall related return window which lasts for another 12 months but there is the possibility that future adjustments will be needed excluding the impact of the unexpected increase to our return reserve our connected fitness margin in q1 would have been 14 and overall gross margin would have been 33 6 on the logistics front we saw some additional inefficiencies associated with middle and last mile delivery costs and precor related freight in expenses these negative impacts were partially offset by lower than anticipated bike financing rates and bike related reserve adjustments subscription gross margin was 66 7 and subscription contribution margin was 69 6 ahead of expectations as we continue to leverage fixed costs associated with content production as a reminder quarter to quarter we continue to see some variability but we now expect to reach our subscription contribution margin target of 70 by q4 of this year turning to operating expenses sales and marketing expense was 35 3 of total revenue versus the prior year period of 15 1 as we explained last quarter this deleverage was planned as we ramped marketing looking ahead we expect to realize substantial sequential leverage against sales and marketing expense as the year progresses g a expense was 29 8 of total revenue versus 14 3 in the year prior we invested over the last 12 months to scale operations including significant investments in team systems and member support while this led to a series of significant sequential step up in g a spending over the last year nearly all of this investment is completed looking ahead we expect a sequential increase in g a spend in q2 but anticipate our q1 spending level to represent a reasonable approximation of quarterly spend for the second half of the year r d expense was 12 1 of total revenue versus 4 8 in the year ago period the year over year deleverage reflects the onboarding of several acqui hires and the r d team from precor as with g a we expect roughly flat quarterly spend for the remainder of the fiscal year our q1 adjusted ebitda loss was better than expected at 233 7 million net loss for q1 was 376 million or a loss of 1 25 per basic and diluted share we ended the quarter with 924 million of cash and marketable securities and have additional liquidity in the form of an untapped 285 million credit facility now on to our outlook we are reintroducing ranges for our guidance as john alluded to earlier the overall consumer and logistics environments have been challenging to predict coming out of covid and we are providing guidance just a few weeks ahead of our busiest sales season for fiscal 22 we are now forecasting ending connected fitness subscriptions of 3 35 million to 3 45 million implying approximately 1 1 million net adds and representing 46 year over year growth and a 77 two year cagr for ending subs at the midpoint this equates to roughly a 6 reduction in our forecasted end of year connected fitness subscriptions at the midpoint our revised full year revenue forecast is 4 4 billion to 4 8 billion representing 14 year over year growth and a 59 two year cagr at the midpoint of the range for q2 we expect ending connected fitness subscriptions of 2 80 million to 2 85 million implying 333 000 net adds and representing 69 year over year growth and nearly 100 two year cagr for ending subs at the midpoint for q2 we expect revenue of 1 1 to 1 2 billion representing 8 year over year growth and a 57 two year cagr at the midpoint our revised guidance reflects a reduction in our expected bike portfolio sales and tread sales versus our original forecast given traffic trends over the past several weeks it also contemplates a greater than expected mix of original bike versus bike since the price drop and lastly headwinds in our commercial or precor business traffic and conversion are the key inputs in our demand forecast many of the modeling assumptions that predict e commerce traffic that we made in august were too optimistic our baseline traffic forecast reflected our unchanged view of the growing consumer interest in connected fitness our growing market share in the category our leading brand awareness and expected increased word of mouth however it is clear that we underestimated the reopening impact on our company and the overall industry importantly we also expected the price drop to further drive a traffic uplift and increased conversion while the price drop led to conversion rates that exceeded our forecast overall traffic has not met our initial expectations we have also seen a richer than anticipated mix of bike sales versus bike further impacting both revenue and our gross margin expectations as we ve said previously we are agnostic to which entry point members choose given that the ltv of our connected fitness subscriptions remains highly attractive moving on to tread we started selling our all new tread on august 30 and began our media support on september 27 we noted on our last earnings call that the rollout of tread would be slow to start in order to ensure that our members are receiving a positive delivery experience and we take the time to reposition inventory to match demand by region since launching media for tread we have seen a progressive increase in tread sales and remain bullish on the category and our ability to grow from our currently low product awareness our primary task today is educating the consumer about our all new tread and how it differs from other treadmills on the market however much like our bike portfolio our revised traffic estimates will also impact our tread forecast for the balance of the year lastly we have reduced expectations for our commercial channel or legacy precor business given both supply and demand dynamics while the commercial gym industry has made significant gains as the country reopened overall visits remain below pre covid levels leading operators across some commercial segments to delay capital investments in new equipment however more importantly sourcing certain component parts has become materially more challenging since we gave our guidance in august this has led to supply constraints in some precor products leaving us unable to fulfill some of our commercial demand moving on to margin the reduction to our demand outlook is creating margin compression in our connected fitness segment as we have a significant amount of fixed costs associated with our supply chain particularly within middle and last mile logistics migrating from quarterly sequential growth during covid back to our pre covid seasonality has proven challenging however we plan to optimize the mix of our own delivery and third party networks to help drive savings in the coming quarters on the variable cost side hardware cost efficiencies and ocean savings that we expected in q2 won t start to materialize until the second half of the year given the lower than expected demand profile for q2 on freight specifically we are locking in better long dated rates we also intend to shift toward in sourced unit production at tonic and evaluate other strategies that will benefit our cost structure in future quarters also within our commercial business we are seeing incremental pressure and additional sourcing constraints that will weigh on our margins for the remainder of the year in light of the current cost increases in units freight and delivery and while we expect some of this pressure to abate in the back half of the year we are evaluating ways to improve our fixed cost efficiency and move to a more variable cost structure in addition to other strategies to better balance growth profitability and member experience all in we now expect a connected fitness product gross margin of 7 in q2 and 16 for fiscal year 2022 as we ve said before we are more focused on connected fitness gross profit dollars than margin percentage with the goal of using those gross profit dollars to offset our sales and marketing expense this is an extraordinary year where this goal is difficult to achieve but we are committed to making material improvements to our cost structure that will help us get back toward being net cac neutral in fiscal 2023 for our subscription business we expect a contribution margin of 69 in q2 and 70 for the full year with the improvement to last year reflecting continued fixed cost leverage and some benefit from identified cost savings rolling up our segments we now expect total company gross margin of 24 in q2 and 32 for fiscal 2022 turning to opex in response to our revised sales and margin outlook for fiscal 2022 we have identified material savings across our operating expenses though some of these actions may take a quarter or two to show improvement some of these identified areas of savings include making significant adjustments to our hiring plans across the company optimizing marketing spend and limiting showroom development identifying areas of efficiency improvement and member support and streamlining our product development teams while maintaining a focus on new products and expanding software features inclusive of the headwinds in cogs and planned cost efficiency initiatives our current estimate of adjusted ebitda loss for q2 is between 325 million and 350 million our revised outlook for full year fiscal 22 is a loss of 425 million to 475 million on an adjusted ebitda basis despite these near term headwinds and our reduced revenue outlook we continue to expect to be adjusted ebitda profitable in the back half of fiscal 2022 and for the full fiscal year 2023 we re making the necessary adjustments to keep us on our path to profitability and our long term view of our opportunity is unchanged we have confidence in our bike portfolio we re seeing growing momentum behind our all new lower priced tread and we are optimistic regarding new products in our pipeline the commercial and corporate wellness opportunities and continued international growth turning to capex we are evaluating ways to optimize our u s manufacturing expansion and costs but continue to believe that this is the right long term move especially in light of the supply chain challenges we are facing today with freight and delivery costs needed supply chain flexibility and the benefit that will come from stateside expertise in manufacturing as we look to manage our costs we now expect approximately 400 million of capex spend through the balance of fiscal 2022 while the next several months present a forecasting challenge in our business we have many levers to control our costs and will implement the appropriate strategies to support our continued growth in our member base revenue and path to profitability i will now hand it back to john john foley co founder and chief executive officer thanks jill as you all know we ve been managing through an unprecedented 19 months since covid began going from extreme demand to extreme supply shocks and coming out of covid consumer behavior and supply chain inputs have been very challenging to predict in the short term as clearly evidenced by our new outlook but please note that the entire peloton management team is focused on making the best decisions for the long term health of our business despite the challenges we are currently facing we know the positive impact we are having on our members lives and while our growth is not what we had expected just a few short months ago we are extending our lead in home fitness cardio and becoming a leader in strength we make the best most immersive and interactive home fitness products available and we have more on the way in the coming weeks and months we will come out of the other side of this uncertain operating environment a much stronger and more nimble company we will be vigilant in managing our cost structure for both growth and profitability in conclusion i want to let you know that managing this business is incredibly personal to me and the entire team here at peloton as one of the founders and the biggest individual shareholder i can t tell you how much we care about peloton and we want every piece of it to be beautiful including the financial model and performance i am incredibly proud of the vision that we have laid out and i m energized by the clear path to get there nothing is in our way we see exactly what needs to be done and we are going to do it continued growth innovative new products smart performance marketing improved hardware margins rightsized opex and a relentless focus on the value that our members receive from their peloton membership all of this is within our control we are operators and leaders we love what we do and we have never been more excited about our future than we are today with that i ll turn it over to the operator for questions questions answers operator our first question comes from the line of doug anmuth of j p morgan your line is open doug anmuth j p morgan analyst thanks for taking the questions i have two first just hoping you could help us understand is how much of your reduced forecast is due to bike versus tread if there s some more color that you can add there and then second i think just in terms of balance sheet and cash flow you ve burned about 650 million in cash in 1q and obviously looking at further ebitda losses ahead so with 924 million in cash on the balance sheet just curious how much cash you re comfortable operating the business with going forward jill woodworth chief financial officer yes doug it s jill thanks for your questions i think i ll just answer your second question first and i think that s a little bit of a shorter answer than the first i think just cutting to the chase we don t see the need for any additional capital raise based on our current outlook as we mentioned we re taking significant steps to adjust our expenses across cogs and opex with this revised revenue guidance then we have a lot of levers to pull in addition what we re also going to do is reevaluate the cadence of some of the capital investments that we re making inclusive of pop and while we know that pop is a decades long right term strategic move for us there s definitely ways for us to find ways to make that a more economical spend over the next couple of years in terms of your first question certainly i would say as we think about the three or four contributors to the reduction of guide i would say bike portfolio is the largest and that is obviously a decrease in the demand profile but secondarily as you know with the mix shift it is also more heavily weighted toward the original bike right or the lower priced bikes than bike and so that does have revenue implications and ebitda implications and effectively connected fitness gross margin implications relative to what we thought and just giving you a little bit more detail there as you know we re agnostic on entry point but certainly before we did the drop in original bike we were seeing about a 50 50 mix that expanded a lot after we dropped the price it s come down a little bit but call it more like three quarters original bikes so that s also contributing but again just remember we re agnostic to entry point and that has no impact on sub growth and then tread we re still in very early days but obviously the traffic trends that we re seeing on bike are the same for tread and so we have also taken down tread and then the last piece would be precor or commercial business where we ve moderated some of our expectations for the year given some of the headwinds we saw in q1 so those are the that s the order doug anmuth j p morgan analyst got it thank you jill operator thank you our next question comes from edward yruma of keybanc capital markets please go ahead edward yruma keybanc capital markets analyst hey good afternoon guys thanks for taking the questions john just a bigger picture question on tread obviously you indicated that results have improved once you kind of deployed more marketing but just kind of what are the initial consumer feedback on the device do you think that people understand that it s a total body fitness solution or are they comparing it to kind of conventional treadmills and then as you look forward are there other things you can do to help the consumer understand the attributes of the product john foley co founder and chief executive officer yes i m glad you asked we were very excited about tread you heard in our prepared remarks that we have a fantastic 89 net promoter score out of the gate which is just off the chart incredible reception from our members the press reviews have been coming in i encourage you to read them and gadgets has had a great review this week so the reception to the product has been fantastic you are pushing on a i think that it s a real dynamic that treadmill is being having been in the market for decades and decades there s some we talked about last quarter there s an asset and a liability with the awareness of what a tread is where you see it and you think it s something to run on and certainly it is ours is the best tread to run on but to your point it s also a portal to a full body workout as we call it and circuit workouts are so popular if you think about orangetheory and bootcamp classes and then even crossfit huge category huge opportunity so tread on the hardware side is huge and then the content from a circuit training perspective is a fantastic huge opportunity huge market and huge consumer demand and so we do have some education to work through in the coming quarters and coming years it s the same education we went through with the bike where people would say years ago why do i need a 2 000 stationary bike and it s like well it s not a stationary bike it s a portal to a fantastic indoor cycling class with the community and the quantified itself and the instructors and the programming and the music and everything that the peloton bike brought similarly the tread is so innovative that there is some education and we re going through that i will point out we ve only been call it 30 days on television trying to start telling that story and the trend of sales of tread has been fantastic so we re bullish on this year we re bullish on the coming years and it s going to be a huge new product line for us so we re super excited william i don t know whether you wanted to add anything on top of that william lynch president no i ll just add to ed s question as evidence of the awareness john mentioned we measure awareness of our various products in the brand and track empty measures and our unaided awareness among the target is only at 11 and you have to go back to close to 2000 late 2015 to find that kind of awareness on bikes so we actually view that as a massive opportunity our formula for growth that we ve been able to hone on bike and then as we roll out internationally it starts with product experience we deliver the best product experience in connected fitness and tread within 89 as high as what we ve seen on bike and so when we start from there is the core we start to build awareness we build the installed base to john s point on momentum we get people talking about it and we have an expression that our members sell more bikes than we do we re seeing that word of mouth with tread just start and we feel like as we climb with these investments in marketing through the holiday we re really excited about our holiday campaign which we announced today we feel very good that tread is going to be everything we hope short mid long term in terms of growth we ve actually said we think it could be a bigger category than bike everything we re seeing early suggests that could be true but it s all about getting the awareness up edward yruma keybanc capital markets analyst thanks so much operator thank you our next question comes from justin post bank of america your line is open justin post bank of america merrill lynch analyst great thanks i would like first on the acquisition model first churn looks good so part of the model was you acquired people at a gross profit on the equipment that covers your marketing costs i know that s a little off right now do you see that getting back to covering your acquisition costs or has there been a change there on the front end obviously the churn doesn t look different on the back end and then second jill maybe you could talk about the sub guidance it looks like it s about 300 to 350 in the december quarter adds and then 600 in the back half yes how conservative or what kind of factors did you put into that guidance to make sure you really reset at a beatable or achievable bar jill woodworth chief financial officer great thanks very much for the question in terms of net cac you rightly point out what we ve tried to solve for really is a net cac neutrality meaning that the gross profit dollars in the units that we sell offset the fully loaded remember it s all fully loaded it s showrooms it s merchant fees it s acquisition marketing media fully loaded cac certainly this year given the pressure we re seeing on cogs and that is combined with the fact that we ve returned to media spend in the near term net cac is positive and so you can sort of think about a ballpark number for the year in the 300 to 400 range certainly as you know with the high engagement and high retention we have we continue to expect as you alluded to an incredibly attractive even with those economic ltv to cac but also just keep in mind that we ve just begun marketing tread right about a month ago so we saw a little bit of media spend in q1 but obviously we expect to continue to ramp to build product awareness of tread so as you know for a more nascent product where you have lower volumes you have to build that volume up over time to really get some cac efficiency that s also working against us and then of course we talked about in our prepared remarks some of the headwinds we re seeing on cogs which we believe will get better throughout the year so certainly a departure from previous years but i think what you can expect is us to get back toward net cac neutrality in fiscal 23 and in terms of i think what you were asking really is the confidence level in the new guide yes we are confident in the ranges that we ve provided for both q2 and full year we certainly moderated expectations in the guide reflecting the traffic trends we saw and i think that includes across the company that s like portfolio that s tread that s commercial and also some of the mix shift elements that i had talked about earlier we ve learned a lot right we ve learned a lot since the price drop around what are the traffic trends what do conversion trends look like and so those two months were a great learning for us to obviously have a base off of which to give a guide going into q2 as you know the next 12 weeks our critical holiday period as well as new year s resolution we have a great campaign that launched today we have inventories in great place which in a great place which means otds despite the volumes that we re projecting we re going to be in a great place and then of course we re looking at sales ramps from previous years right last year is a tough year to use as a model but we have previous years where we know what the seasonal spikes in our business looks like and i think we ve taken a good approach in looking at previous years combined with this current data since the price drop to arrive at our guide justin post bank of america merrill lynch analyst great thank you operator thank you your next question comes from youssef squali of truist securities your line is open youssef squali truist securities analyst great thank you maybe one question for john and one for william if i may so john engagement remains a key obviously to the peloton story this is the second quarter of the client engagement i think in your prepared remarks you spoke about q1 being the trough maybe speak to what you re doing proactively to kind of fix that outside of the basically the reopening is it a content issue is it just something else altogether that maybe we didn t talk about and then william can you discuss the precor integration i think you guys mentioned that it s the performance is trailing a bit behind your own expectations but i care more about the how is the integration going and particularly as you look at their kind of richer product offering how much of it do you think is susceptible to you guys offering as maybe part of that one subscription model that you john are envisioning for the model for the business going forward john foley co founder and chief executive officer yes youssef thank you william i ll take this one first to go in order so yes with respect to engagement we always expected the engagement to come down slightly coming out of covid i mean it s just the idea that gyms are available people can get out of their house now they re not locked down so we knew that we weren t going to see those crazy elevated covid engagement numbers forever but i will say that the two year cagr in the prepared remarks you might have heard there was over 40 quarter to quarter but to answer your question there are a whole host of things we re doing and we are always innovating on content and software features and building every time we launch a new content vertical or content category or a new instructor we re not retiring other categories we re just it just continues to get more selection more music genres more instructor styles and so what you saw in q1 is a seasonal impact that we ve always had going back six seven years in our business so some of this you can t fight i mean in the cold winter months coming out of new year s resolutions people are working out on our platform more than they are in august and that s just there s only so much we can do to shift that but i will say we continue to be dramatically better to see dramatically better engagement than any gym or any other connected fitness product platform so we feel good and we re bullish about the coming quarters and how that s going to play out with engagement william lynch president and then youssef on precor just reminding everyone why we made that acquisition first and foremost it was about building the substantially the best connected fitness equipment manufacturer in the world we feel like one of our objectives internally and we ve said this is to build a structural advantage not only in scale and our ability to build connected fitness equipment i ll remind everyone this has been a very fragmented market where any one line making tens of thousands of things was remarkable or making millions of things and that s been challenging to build that capability over time especially with our growth but we ve done that and then also build a structural cost advantage and quality advantage while we build that scale advantage we feel like to win connected fitness as john noted you have to be best of breed in that and precor s talent rob barker greg may that team is remarkable we thought it was the best team when combined with ours and everything we ve seen in terms of the integration some of the work we ve done out of the whitsett with the north carolina facility on domestic manufacturing staging for pop it has been going remarkably well and everything we believe and hoped in our diligence has been true there in terms of channel as jill noted there s softness there the operators on the key verticals within those channels have been slow whether it s hospitality or gyms to reopen and certainly not at the rate that we d expected and so hence the take down in the guide but it doesn t daunt us for what s going forward we think we ll have the best catalog to offer we do today when we combine precor grade equipment with ours and then also that channel not only is a good business for us as it reemerges it s also an incredible lead generation channel just an example of that is in hospitality when we have a peloton bike in a hotel for a year it sells on average seven bikes into the home and that talks to the quality of the experience that it offers when a traveler goes into a westin and gets on their peloton in the morning and tries it using our trial we get that lead capture and we know given the strength of the experience they come home and they buy peloton and so it s not only a business that we think has a lot of financially has a lot of upside going forward given the catalog not only have they been helpful on the manufacturing side it s very strategic for our at home business as a trial channel certainly in hospitality but also when you think about universities and other verticals youssef squali truist securities analyst ok thank you both operator thank you our next question comes from eric sheridan of goldman sachs your question please eric sheridan goldman sachs analyst thank you so much maybe i ll ask a two parter if i can in terms of stimulating demand what do you see now as sort of the key levers to pull in the business whether it s mining existing digital subscriptions or how we should think about demand within your control versus demand without of your control and along those lines it seems like what you were saying there with the variable cost structure is we should be almost rethinking about maybe margins longer term just want to make sure i heard that messaging clear and what the takeaways were in terms of a more variable mix of cost in the model jill woodworth chief financial officer sure i might just change the order of your question very quickly just to address what i meant when you think about during covid right we had several quarters of sequential growth and what i m specifically thinking through is we ve obviously built a warehouse footprint we ve obviously invested in a lot of field operations which has been great for our business it s been great for our members but i do think going forward as we think about our growth right we re now going to have a more seasonal business again right so i do think as we think about future growth layered on top of those fixed costs right i think we have to get more creative in thinking through how to strategically use 3pls right it s not like we re going to just keep building out our warehouse footprint we re just going to have to think about and i think it s in addition to that there s also some opportunity within our member support model so i just think as we have a seasonal business right i think one of the ways in which we can gain advantage is looking for ways to have fixed cost leverage and also improve variable cost structure so i think it s just more to think about coming out of covid right how do we rightsize our business model for the demand that we see in our business and the seasonality in making us have the most robust profitability william lynch president and this is william on the demand side in terms of leverage you sort of need to think about it by product and i ll just start with tread we i think we ve all made the point about how excited and bullish we are on tread and it s really about it s so unique to start with a product at 89 nps and it s to the credit of our product team led by tom cortese and jen cotter we ve got the best product and content team on the planet and it s a market or stream to be able to get the word out and that s what we have to do 11 awareness 30 days in it s just about scaling awareness getting more people buying that product them doing the work for us on word of mouth we know that formula very well and we jill mentioned the new campaign that started today really pushing the tread educating people to john s point about it s not just running it s this incredible full body experience we ve got the best instructors in the world so that s going to be a foundational growth engine for us going forward that has us very excited on bike had we not been comping the massive bike growth in covid in isolation the bike units this year would look incredibly exciting jill talked about the net sub adds largely coming from the sale of bike this year that s a lot of volume and so we have to keep penetrating the huge opportunity in sam we ve said it s early days both in sam and tam we dropped the price on bike just recently and it s getting the word out it s also our messaging and creative we do a lot of consumer insights work on how we get people over the fence and coming into peloton on the bike and we feel great about that it s new channels we re opening up we referenced corporate wellness and others huge partnership with unitedhealthcare that s just getting off the ground so we like our headroom on bike we like international markets we added australia australia sold just three times within the first month in terms of an international launch three times the number of units that we ve sold in u k canada or germany any other new international markets so we ve got amazing growth prospects in front of us and it s just about being focused being disciplined getting over this covid comp and also getting more efficient with our marketing but we know how to do all that operator thank you our next question comes from laurent vasilescu of exane bnp paribas your line is open laurent vasilescu exane bnp paribas analyst good afternoon thank you for taking my questions two part question here during last year s investor day you provided a lot of great stats about the income brackets of the consumer the demographics embedded in your full year guidance for this year like who is your target consumer considering the price cut on the bike and then secondly more of a modeling question but i think you mentioned there was a new digital marketing landscape now with apple sales and marketing was 35 of sales how do we think about those metrics for the second quarter and the full year jill woodworth chief financial officer great in terms of i might just take your the second question first yet again because i think it s an easier question to tackle are you just asking what percentage we believe the leverage we re going to see in the sales and marketing line versus leverage certainly versus q1 we expect our sales and marketing to come down fairly dramatically throughout the year as you can imagine in sales and marketing right obviously in q1 we began ramping our bike media to talk about the price drop and of course that was our seasonal level of revenue so sales and marketing as a percentage of revenue was obviously at a seasonal high for us as we move through the year q2 will be also a big key sales season for us essentially you can expect through the year to probably end in the low to mid 20s on overall sales and marketing as a percentage so it does come down almost sequentially through the year so that is and then did you have a question i think embedded on digital marketing laurent vasilescu exane bnp paribas analyst that was the part of the question because of the new landscape like how much is marketing as a percentage of your sales going forward for this year but yes that s in the first part of the question jill woodworth chief financial officer yes digital marketing yes if you re talking about more of the media spend aspect of it obviously our full sales and marketing line does have obviously our it s all of our fully loaded showroom costs and merchant fees and of course everybody on the team so are you asking specifically what breakout is variable media spend laurent vasilescu exane bnp paribas analyst yes that would be great and also just overall guidance on sales and marketing total as a percentage of sales for the year which i think you just gave jill woodworth chief financial officer yes and i will say on this point as you know tv has always been an incredible medium for us to convey the peloton value proposition and so i would generally say we re more heavily weighted there so i don t think the changes that we talked about in the digital landscape are going to impact us much i do think from a variable media spend we are a little bit more weighted and there s a lot of other channels like ott but certainly tv is a big category for us so we re not concerned with the media landscape but certainly it does have some impact and then i think william you re going to take the demo question william lynch president sure i can we don t want to go too much into kind of our secret sauce but we have customer segments that we used to buy media against you re asking specifically about demographics i think the general push there that i can talk about is we want to continue to penetrate younger and less household income and we ve been successful doing that part of the thesis strategically on the price drop was we wanted to bring this amazing experience to more and more people and obviously we want to do that against the mission john talked about in his closing remarks it s also good for business it allows us to really penetrate the tam and sam given the size of that segment and it s the fastest growing meaning meaning the under 35 000 and 50 000 and under it s been our fastest growing segment for i think it s been the last year we think i m almost sure that s the case and so as we think about the opportunity we talk a lot about connected fitness and our leadership there but we really see it much more expansively if you look at the price of fitness which is a massive global market it s really about there are 181 million people globally gym memberships globally and you look at the 6 2 million members that john referenced and you think about our experience and the convenience of home and the value that we offer and engagement and it s why we re so confident this if we do our job continue to do our jobs it comes to us so that s we think about a broad segment we have members that are 80 plus and we have 20 year old members and so it s really a wide demographic laurent vasilescu exane bnp paribas analyst thank you very much operator thank you our next question comes from john blackledge of cowen your line is open james kopelman cowen and company analyst hi this is james on for john in light of the traffic trends you mentioned how are you thinking about the role of retail showrooms to drive conversion of the treadmill and bike prior to the pandemic i think you said somewhere around half of treadmill conversions were due to first hand experience i e customers trying out treadmills on the show is that still the right way to think about conversions for the lower cost treadmill and then a second question on the product portfolio in light of the supply chain issues and inflationary pressures does that potentially impact product release cadence as we get through fiscal 2022 john foley co founder and chief executive officer yes james i ll jump in on the first one i m glad you asked because as you know we have over 100 fantastic store retail stores worldwide and we are whenever we launch a new product those stores become an even more important strategic asset and we will see that when we watch our daily sales throughout the week and how much better the tread does on saturday and sunday as those stores are full and so for a more mature product you might feel comfortable buying it online like a bike because you ve ridden before whether it was a hotel or your friend or whatever and so you have a familiarity with that product obviously with the tread the new tread being two months new in some markets and even newer in other markets going to those stores and getting on and having an experience and more and more going to the back and actually doing a workout in some of these stores is a huge asset and while a lot of people are shutting down stores we love our retail stores for just this reason we think it s a really critical strategic asset when we bring new products to market and we talked about the tread is new and we re going to have other new products in the coming quarters that we re excited about and they also benefit from the retail footprint i ll take another product cadence question sorry about that we did say this year is going to be a big year for product launches we stand by that we re excited if you caught in my prepared remarks i alluded to the coming weeks and months of some new announcements one that i m very excited about and then potentially another one next year hopefully in h2 and we re pushing we ve had a lot of fantastic r d in the hopper for years at this point and we are super excited to bring it to our members and to expand our opportunity that s all i can say right now but we are a technology and innovation company and we re going to show what that means in the coming quarters operator thank you at this time i d like to turn the call over to john foley for closing remarks john foley co founder and chief executive officer i guess that s it thanks everybody we ll talk to you next time operator duration 63 minutes call participants peter stabler head of investor relations john foley co founder

the executive team join andrew and me on calls to display the depth of our team i d like to welcome david cohen to today s call david a key leader in our organization is co founder of ready capital s bridge lending business which has grown to be one of the premier sources of capital for owners of lower middle market properties in transition providing loans on transitional value add and event driven commercial and multi family real estate david leads his core lending strategy which accounts for nearly one half of our capital allocation turning to results we reported distributable earnings per share of 0 64 23 growth from the prior quarter this marks the six consecutive quarter where both return on equity and dividend coverage are in excess of our 10 and 105 targets both metrics are among the highest at our peer group reflecting continued contributions across our multiple diverse business lines at a high level results continue to reflect post covid recovery and net interest margin in our core small balance commercial or sbc lending business with stable contribution from our government sponsored gain on sale segments the post covid recovery in the sbc property market is lagging the large balanced commercial real estate market reflected in 36 and 11 year over year increases in sbc property sales to over 150 billion and prices through july this trend is driving loan demand across our diverse product offerings we originated 1 billion of sbc loans in the quarter holding consistent with record originations in the prior quarter the volume was dispersed across our range of products which target all stages of an sbc properties lifecycle from heavily transitional to stabilized agency loans in our freddie mac small balance loan program we originated 136 million and expect annual volume to exceed 700 million in freddie mac and bridge to freddy volume by yearend despite quarterly volume declines due to changes in freddie s affordability criteria and rate increases in the third quarter demand from multi family housing remains elevated freddie s recent rate reduction to as low as 2 6 in top markets is expected to drive increased volume through the end of the year in the quarter activity in our conventional fixed rate segments picked up for the first time since the start of the pandemic these products target stabilized or stabilizing properties with our fixed rate product providing flexibility and term repayment options and property types originations in the quarter where the segment exceeded 1055 million fixed rate originations of 71 million had an average rate of 4 1 and are expected to generate a low team levered yield over their nine year duration cmbs originations of 34 million would be contributed to the company s first stand alone cmbs offerings and we ll generate gain on sale revenue our bridge lending business which targets both heavy transitional to light transitional projects was the star performer with over 730 million originated in the third quarter i m going to turn it over to david to provide additional insight andrew ahlborn chief financial officer thanks tom since the onset of covid in 2020 and after the initial shock of the assumed negative implications on the commercial real estate lending market there has been a fully looking momentum in the market as lenders reentered the lending arena the ready capital bridge lending platform quickly adapted to the change market by focusing on certain preferred asset types and markets we remain disciplined on credit this is evident in evaluating approximately 1500 new deals in the third quarter and closing on 3 5 for 730 million to accomplish our continued growth and market share capture we focus on several key areas first our closed transaction volume was driven in particular by our ability to provide sponsors and brokers with certainty of execution through our unique upfront due diligence review process in this market of uncertainty execution certainty is paramount to be designated as the lender of choice to accomplish these objectives the bridge lending platform enhance its infrastructure in the third quarter with the hiring of an additional for employees to support transaction execution in the areas of production and credit second we continue to focus on the financing demand for value add multi family and industrial properties multi family properties accounted for 87 of the third quarter volume and 88 of volume funded year to date our focus on multi family assets is based on the company s proprietary geo tier scoring model which factors in local macroeconomic migration and demographic and absorption trends as well as the predisposition toward the better classes of assets with qualified and experienced sponsors and operators that have the proven ability to execute a well defined business plan in addition to our geo tier model overlay we are also focused on the property level credit analysis which includes evaluating the achievable pro forma rent levels for the value add improvements from the loan proceeds vacancy concessions and bad debt along with property a loan basis additionally we underwrite traditional credit metrics such as stabilized loan to value and debt yield this strong and detailed underwriting focus provides us with the confidence in the loan that upon stabilization there is a clear path for an exit to a sale or refinancing into a fixed rate or agency loan another favorable sector focus for us benefiting from ongoing covid dislocation is industrial with the continuous increase of e commerce sales the industrial segment continues to show strength as supply chain demands is driving the need for industrial assets with industrial specifically some key factors we evaluate are the properties location and corridor accessibility and weather suited for local and or national tendency and last mile distribution to the end user as well as understanding the properties functional capabilities or obsolescence this has been an incredible year for our bridge lending platform as we continue to build relationships and build upon our strong reputation as a prominent small and middle market balanced bridge lender we will continue our path of consistent growth and increase market share by working with best in class and experienced brokers and sponsors and providing a well structured loan with the certainty our customers have come to expect let me turn the call back to tom tom capasse chief executive officer thanks david to supplement our sbc direct lending we also acquired 168 million in the quarter the acquisitions included 49 loans with an average ltvs of 58 and rates of 4 4 the assets will be contributed to the company s 11th legacy loan securitization and are expected to generate a 15 return over a four year duration the current acquisition pipeline remains robust at 350 million i want to highlight the growth in our cre lending business and acquisitions business in 2021 our expectation is that the 2021 volume across all products will exceed 4 billion 2x our normalized pre pandemic originations in 2019 although the market backdrop has been constructive to this growth we believe our investment and expanding our capabilities the increased recognition of the ready capital brand and the flexibility certainty and reliability we provide to our customers has been a significant factor in this growth in our small business lending segment which focuses on the small business administration s or sba 7 a loan program post covid recovery and small business loan demand continues to drive origination volumes during the quarter sba 7 a volumes reached 138 million which along with the sba s 90 guarantee and secondary market premiums averaging 12 resulted in significant gain on sale margins the sustained demand from small business is reemerging from covid the opportunistic staff and technology investments made into the business over the last four quarters and product expansion such as the 7 a small loan program will continue to drive growth in this segment our expectation is that annual volume in 2021 will surpass 425 million almost 2x an average run rate from 2018 through 2020 i would also like to highlight that we completed the sbas fiscal year which ended september 30 as the sixth largest lender nationwide now turning to our residential mortgage business originations remain consistent at 1 billion but as expected average margin declined 15 basis points and averaged 92 basis points additionally quarter over quarter rate lock commitments fell 17 to 455 million while the channel mix remains steady with purchase volume at 55 on the mortgage servicing rights front a high retention rate of 32 aided the growth of our msrs to over 10 7 billion principle balance with a low pool weighted average coupon of 3 4 we expect volumes to decline 20 in the fourth quarter due to seasonality and potential rate increases overall commercial portfolio growth was healthy with sbc and sba loans posting a 13 gain to 6 1 billion ready capital s portfolio is not only differentiated from the peer group but provides a superior risk adjusted return the portfolio is one of the lowest risk in the peer group highly diversified across 4 500 loans with the largest asset accounting for only 2 of the portfolio and a conservative average loan to value of 64 sbc credit performance in the portfolio continues to improve with only 1 7 of loans 60 day plus delinquent and only 10 basis points in forbearance sba performance also continues to improve with 50 basis points of loan 60 day delinquent and 80 basis points in deferment remarkably we have yet to realize a loss on a new origination on the corporate development side we remain focused on further building scale as a market leader in private debt solutions for our core middle market commercial real estate client base across the property life cycle the merger with mosaic real estate investors is the next phase of our growth plan and a natural fit for our existing business mosaic founded in 2015 is a leading non bank lender having originated over 2 5 billion of loans across construction lending preferred equity light value add multifamily and preconstruction development financing the 470 million transaction includes the acquisition of the existing mosaic portfolio with an initial purchase price equal to 82 5 of the portfolio value in a 98 million future earn out depending on the achievement of certain milestones additionally all origination and asset management staff will be merged into our existing sbc lending operations this transaction furthers ready capital s competitive advantage via seamless expansion and our product mix from heavy transitional bridge to construction lending few non banks offer a lower middle market sponsor of full lifecycle financing solutions from construction to agency takeout but now we do aside from the product expansion the transaction is expected to be accretive to earnings due to the 12 portfolio yield and unlevered balance sheet pending shareholder approval we expect the transaction to close by the end of the first quarter of 2022 more information on the transaction can be found in the transaction presentation on the ready capital investor relations website in terms of the outlook the business continued to benefit from our diverse channels as well as the increasing scale and reach of our lending activities the combination of growing net interest margin and servicing revenue the increased scale of our gain on sale businesses and the remaining benefit from our ppp efforts will continue to produce attractive returns for investors over the foreseeable future and strong support of our best in peer group dividend with that i ll turn it over to andrew andrew ahlborn chief financial officer thanks tom and good morning gaap earnings and distributable earnings per share were 0 61 and 0 64 respectively for the quarter distributable earnings of 49 4 million represents a 19 growth from the prior quarter and 17 3 return on average stockholders equity distributable earnings without ppp hold at 0 45 per share a 20 increase from the prior quarter the continued strength in earnings were driven by the growth in the portfolio due to increased lending volumes the attractive economic climate for our gain on sale segment and the realization of deferred revenue associated with ppp stable and recurring revenue from net interest income and servicing increased 22 quarter over quarter to 47 3 million the growth in net interest income was driven by 13 increase in the portfolio which as of quarter had a weighted average coupon of 4 9 and average margins of 240 basis points additionally we recognize a 4 5 million increase in quarter over quarter equitable payoffs which were partially offset by 2 5 million reduction in interest income on mortgage backed securities due to the continued liquidation of the existing anworth portfolio the servicing portfolio increased to 15 8 billion with a weighted average servicing fee consistent at 29 basis points gain on sale revenue from our sba 7a and freddie mac sbl operations remain notable at 19 7 million sba production in the quarter continued to be at a 90 guarantee and given the strength of the secondary markets a 117 million of sales resulted in net profits of 14 2 million as we discussed last quarter we are currently selling a portion of production at below market premiums which eliminates day one recognition of earnings but increases the retained yield over the loans duration freddie mac sales totaled 110 million in the quarter generating 1 8 million in revenue with margins remaining consistent at 160 basis points as expected net revenue from residential mortgage banking activities declined 15 6 to 12 9 million despite consistent quarter over quarter production due to the normalization of margins in 92 basis points additional income statement items of note include a 1 2 million increase in other income related to origination fees which were offset by increases in compensation expense related to continued growth in staffing and bonus accruals professional fee accruals and fees due to ready capital s manager included in this quarter s earnings were 2 million in net income contribution from redstone which was acquired by ready capital on july 31 pre tax ppp related income totaled 17 7 million which includes 18 7 million of interest income offset by 1 2 million of interest expense and 200 000 of other income on a tax affected basis ppp increased net income available to stockholders by 13 3 million as of september 30 we had 82 9 million of deferred revenue remaining as well as 8 9 million of reserves pending resolution of their forgiveness process ppp assets declined 400 million due to the forgiveness of roughly 18 of the portfolio through september 30 and we expect a majority of the deferred revenue to be accreted into earnings over the next three to four quarters on the balance sheet we continue to focus on the growth of the portfolio the capitalization of the business and funding the growth of the franchise to start book value per share increased to 15 06 and we expect further growth of book value to both the mark to market on the msr asset as well as the retention of earnings inside our taxable reit subsidiaries on the asset side of the balance sheet the loan portfolio increased to 5 9 billion as a result of 1 1 billion in originations and acquisitions net of 500 million in payoff 73 of the portfolio is floating rate which 70 of the remaining fixed rate loans match funding this growth was complimented with a 25 8 million increase in the servicing asset due to net additions including those acquired with redstone as well as mark to market improvements to fund the growth of the portfolio we liquidated 140 million of the remaining anworth rmbs positions in the quarter the increase in unconsolidated joint ventures was due to the inclusion of 35 6 million of assets related to the business combination with redstone as of september 30 total leverage inclusive of the paycheck protection program liquidity fund was 5 9x with recourse leverage at 2 2x we recently closed a 350 million 4 5 senior secured note offering to refinance our existing notes as well as to fund the robust pipeline this deal continues the trend of reducing the company s cost of capital as we scale today the weighted average cost of corporate leverage is 5 3 compared to 7 on december 31 2020 additionally the successful repositioning of the preferred stock inherited in the anworth transaction is reflected in the new ready capital series e on the september 30 balance sheet in the quarter we also completed the company s sixth and largest to date cre clo loan the transaction securitized 653 million of originated bridge loans at an advance rate of 83 and weighted average cost of 133 basis points with the most senior bond having a plus 95 spread we plan to be in the market with our seven cre clo in the fourth quarter with that we will open up the line for questions questions and answers operator thank you ladies and gentlemen at this time we will be conducting a question and answer session our first question comes from the line of tim hayes with btig please proceed with your question tim hayes btig analyst hey good morning guys first question around the mosaic acquisition can you just give us a little bit more color around the profile of these loans how does the collateral compare to what you might lend on from a transitional standpoint can you talk about kind of the credit profile and how these loans performed through the pandemic and kind of since the company started since 2015 any material realized losses in that business to talk about or also just want to touch on the maturity schedule what that might look like over the next couple of years thanks tom capasse chief executive officer thanks tim hand off to adam just as a preference adam we did adam and his team conducted extensive due diligence there s roughly what is it andrew adam roughly 35 38 loans over the last six months so maybe you can kind of bit of a deep dive in terms of the broad profile credit profile of the portfolio adam zausmer chief credit officer yes sure hey this is adam thanks for the question tim so the overall credit profile this portfolio strong we have a healthy basis in the loan portfolio got moderate weighted average as is ltv is based on fresh valuations that we ordered through our due diligence process the portfolio is good property type and geographic diversity approximately 95 of assets are in what we call geo tiers one through three which is the largest and most liquid assets excuse me most liquid markets across the country approximately 25 of the portfolio was backed by multifamily properties which obviously is a lower volatile asset class that we re very excuse me bullish on majority of the construction projects are well into construction phase with guaranteed maximum price contracts this mitigates rising construction costs that the markets s experiencing due to materials and labor shortages and then also supply chain issues in terms of a breakdown of the portfolio construction represents about 60 of the assets i d say from a geographic perspective about 40 of the assets are on the west coast markets that we like los angeles etcetera from a credit performance perspective the performance through the pandemic has been positive with over 90 of the portfolio fully performing today two assets are in default and there are three reo assets two of the reos were due to the pandemic and there was one legacy reo three to four assets have experienced a lead due to the pandemic which is material supply shortages and or crossover runs but we re comfortable with the assets due to the projects being backed by reputable well capitalized developers and sponsors who during the pandemic contributed additional equity as needed and had executed completion interest in carry guarantees at closing up the deals there s six deals that received extensions since the onset of the pandemic and i want highlight that six deals have been repaid at par since the beginning of our due diligence process which is extremely favorable tim hayes btig analyst that s great color i appreciate that and then just the maturity schedule there are these what are the duration on these loans do you expect to be facing some repayments in the near term yes i ll leave it there and then maybe one or two follow ups tom capasse chief executive officer yes sure the typical tenure of these loans is three to excuse me it s three to four years and these have various extension options and then also i d say the weighted average is about two years remaining on the majority of these and then in terms of refinances and payoffs there s certainly a number that are in process where we re working closely excuse me where mosaic is working closely with the sponsors on their refinance and asset sales tim hayes btig analyst okay got it and then the collateral here i mean are these natural candidates for you guys to then offer some type of heavier transitional loan at once it completes construction or is it different type of collateral than you re normally targeting tom capasse chief executive officer it s very similar given the bridge program that david walked through i mean there s certainly a significant amount of opportunities for us to do bridge financing on some of these assets specifically where there s where the projects are in the horizontal phase and the entitlements are complete the pre development phase is complete and they re looking to go vertical so david and his team they re going to be building out a construction product at ready capital where we can offer these clients bridge and then additionally on the more stabilized assets that are within the portfolio there certainly would be a very good fit for our cmbs and fixed rate platforms so certainly a lot of opportunities there and then also we have multiple investments in multifamily properties focused mostly in the south east where we can work with some of our partners on the agency side to offer some of the large balance agency fannie or freddie conventional tim hayes btig analyst got it got it okay it sounds like a yes nice kind of leading pipeline for other parts of the business too and then you just talked you mentioned earnings accretion from the deal any can you size that for us in the near long or near intermediate term what you kind of expect the earnings contribution from this portfolio to be upon closing and maybe where you see it growing andrew ahlborn chief financial officer tim this is andrew i think you got to look at it or we re looking to it in two ways the accretion is going to come from the fact that the portfolio on an unlevered basis is earning above our target returns so it s roughly around 12 on levered return here so that ll be the first part the second part will be just the operating leverage that comes with integrating that business into our existing infrastructure so we certainly expect accretion from that as well and then just the reinvestment of the additional 470 million of capital whether through leverage or just the natural cash portfolio into our existing product and so when you look at the return profile of the company today given ppp is pushing it north of 15 that s a hard hurdle to overcome but as that runs off over the next two three quarters the profile of this equity is certainly in excess of the sort of the net run rate of the existing business tim hayes btig analyst right makes sense okay appreciate that andrew and then just last question for me around the acquisitions this quarter it looks like a portfolio of low ltv high yielding loans can you just give us a little bit of color on where this acquisition came from what kind of loans these are and if you think you can even improve the advance rate looks pretty low on assuming that the financing on the loans there i mean are you able to kind of put those on new lines and get better leverage there and boost that roe a bit any color on that would be helpful tom capasse chief executive officer adam do you want to you have to take them adam zausmer chief credit officer yes sure on the recent acquisitions very consistent with the type of acquisitions that we ve done historically small balance loans spread about a nice geographic profile nice diversity sourced through a regional bank and as you can see certainly extremely low ltvs clean pay history is historically nice amortization given the seasoning in these assets again just from a diversity excuse me from a diversity profile it fits very well with what we ve been doing and those assets are performing extremely well tim hayes btig analyst got it thanks for the color guys appreciate taking my questions this morning tom capasse chief executive officer thanks tim operator our next question comes from the line of stephen laws with raymond james please proceed with your question stephen laws raymond james analyst hi good morning one quick follow up on tim s question as you mentioned that 12 unlevered yields how much leverage is you think is appropriate for this type of construction loan and kind of how do we think about the type of financing you ll use andrew ahlborn chief financial officer yes we certainly think to the extent we apply as a level of financing to the portfolio probably going to have advanced rates slightly lower than where our existing products are but we do think the balance sheet provides optionality and whether we apply asset specific financing or we do something like a term loan given the unencumbered nature of the balance sheet so we ll work through those options depending on the markets between now and close but we do think it provides us with that flexibility tom capasse chief executive officer yes one thing i would just add to that andrew is that one of the unique aspects of construction loans is the existence of a fairly liquid syndication market either notes so that s another way we re going to look at leverage on this portfolio we re looking to manage the overall exposure terms of net equity that kind of 10 to 20 on a pro forma basis this will be what andrew is 16 net of reserves that s kind of how we re thinking about the managing the net equity exposure as well as the overall amount of recourse leverage stephen laws raymond james analyst great switching to the resi mortgage banking business can you talk about you ve done a great job of maintaining volumes even as you ve seen your mix shift more toward purchase the last six months can you talk about the outlook both on volumes and what you re seeing in margins across the channel and then any opportunities or headwinds created by the likely increase in conforming limits here in the near future tom capasse chief executive officer gmfs has continue to outperform and will in the in terms of their versus their peer group as measured by stratmor and other data we track but to answer your question i think our guidance is for a decline of roughly 20 in the next quarter but as far as margins i think we ve normalized to a it was 92 basis points this past quarter i think andrew you can chime in but our expectation is a normalized range now of mid 90s to a little call it 1 to 1 25 in terms of a bandwidth so i think you re seeing the expected normalization is occurring but i will point out that if you look at some of the larger public comps they ve outperformed in terms of the both volume and margins and also the stability remember the strategy with our residential mortgage banking segment is to utilize is to retain msrs as a hedge for production declines which has worked out very well in terms of normalized roe and there we also they benefit from a much lower volatility in their lower convexity brisk in their msr book due to the nature of the underlying geographic area louisiana etcetera and the lower whack in the portfolio as well stephen laws raymond james analyst great and lastly andrew one follow up you mentioned 83 million of ppp income remaining role and earnings for the next three to four quarters is there any lumpiness to that is it going to be sort of straight line recognition how do we think about putting that into our models andrew ahlborn chief financial officer yes i do think there s going to be some volatility and how that rolls through earnings if you look at the speed at which the first round of ppp was forgiven there were certainly spikes in that processing between month six and ten of which were sort of were rolling into so i do expect there s going to be some increased activity over the upcoming months with the tail coming behind it so unfortunately not straight line do think there s going to be some increased activity over the fourth and first quarters and then probably the effects will be less pronounced as we ve moved from there stephen laws raymond james analyst great appreciate comments this morning operator our next question comes from the line of crispin love with piper sandler please proceed with your question crispin love piper sandler analyst thanks and good morning everyone first on the mosaic transaction i m just looking for a couple of metrics is it fair that i guess as it stands right now that earnings should be a run rate around 50 million to 55 million and i m just curious of what mosaic should be on a deferred revenues and are those revenues primarily or vast majority manages income therefore if there s anything else there tom capasse chief executive officer yes i can talk about the current earnings profile as you look at the numbers this quarter the normalized business in the absence of ppp is certainly running higher than our expectations on return on equity as well as the dividend when you layer on 82 million and change of earnings to be recognized over the upcoming quarters we certainly think that s going to push earnings to levels we re seeing this quarter for at least the next call it two quarters and then in terms of the earnings contribution post closing the way i would look at it is that the equity allocated into the mosaic strategy is going to earn roughly an 11 bottom line return with the majority of that revenue in fact coming on the interest income line item given there s no real leverage flowing through the financials today the offset to that is going to be in the form of just some of the normalized outback crispin love piper sandler analyst okay great thanks that s helpful and then just broader on the ready capital business can you speak to this trajectory and the sustainability of core earnings you ve definitely posted a really solid quarter this quarter at 0 64 so i m just curious a little bit about what you think that trajectory could be and what some of the puts and takes will be i know recently like a will soften a little bit as you noted with a 20 drop in originations but sbc originations have remained very strong so do you expect that momentum to continue and just kind of how it should flow through and impact the overall core and core earnings of the business andrew ahlborn chief financial officer yes it s a good question when we look at our 2022 business plans what you re seeing is the trends if you will the transfer from the large gain on sale revenues resulting from the pandemic stimulus packages notably ppp to the relevering of the sbc origination and acquisitions book such that you re going to see kind of a more prorated mix between right now the equity allocation if you look on the deck i forgot what page it is but it shows that we re now at about 90 90 10 sbc equity allocation and 10 on the gain on sale businesses so what you re going to see in some subsequent quarters is a normalization of the nim related to that core sbc capital heavy business and that s being supported by record originations right we did 4 billion we will likely do 4 billion this year 2x the normalized 2019 and so we see that continuing especially in dave s bridge business so that and that and the other thing to point out there is that with the capital markets execution on our in particular cre clos which only trade about 5 basis points higher on the aaas than the benchmark loans like blackstone etcetera our roes are better than what they were pre pandemic call it maybe by 100 basis points or so on the on those businesses so that that will continue to support kind of a high single digit roe and then the gain on sale businesses continued to grow post pandemic in particular the sba with the rollout of the we hired number added 20 staff to that business and also are rolling out new products like this sba 7 a small loan program so we expect continued market share gains in that segment and then we re adding incremental businesses like redstone which are capital light and also our benefit from government sponsored programs in that case the freddie mac tax exempt program and that will be offset a little bit by as we talked about by the normalization of the residential mortgage banking they re kind of a long way to answer your question but we are very bullish on the prospects of on the origination front going in 2022 which will support continued growth in the core nim high which supports a high single digit roe supplemented by the 1 or 2 points attributable to the gain on sale businesses crispin love piper sandler analyst okay thanks tom thanks for all the color there and if i could just sneak one more in during prepared remarks you talked about the 90 guarantee on sba do you think that do you expect that 90 guaranteed stuff holds going forward or do you think it could be moved back to 75 if that were to happen and any big impacts to the business tom capasse chief executive officer well it s a good question it s actually in the reconciliation bill right now to continue the 90 the 90 remember was a was borrowed from the obama incentives from the gfc and then obviously implemented as part of the cares act so but it is in the current reconciliation bill but that s the way that works from we re pretty active in our trade non bank trade association we re getting guidance from them that it s a bit of a coin flip as to whether that stays in but from our standpoint our base case scenario on earnings assumes that a normalization back to the 75 but if we get the 90 that would be upside in the sbc gain on sales contribution sorry sba gain in sale contribution crispin love piper sandler analyst great thank you for taking my questions and congrats on a great quarter tom capasse chief executive officer thanks andrew ahlborn chief financial officer thanks crispin operator our next question comes from the line of jade rahmani with kbw please proceed with your question jade rahmani kbw analyst yes thanks for taking the questions tom i m curious what you make of the current lending environment lot of the mortgage reits have seen a surge in production lot of the cre brokers are citing debt funds as the most competitive and many have a clo exit and also secondarily how comfortable are you with the increase in average loan size that the mosaic portfolio will introduce to the ready cap business tom capasse chief executive officer well first on loan demand and that s obviously being significantly driven by transaction volume and remember were you mentioned the other mortgage reits they re in a rarefied space right they re at large balance their average balances on the transitional loans might be in the hundreds of millions and ours is roughly in the call it the 5 million 12 million to 15 million so we squarely focused in the lower middle market and there you re seeing kind of a lag recovery in terms of transaction volume through july was up i forget what it was 17 to 150 billion so that s driving a lot of the growth in david s business and david maybe you can just comment on that i ll comment on them and adam comment on the mosaic exposure but dave just maybe you could comment on what you re seeing in terms of your core business in terms of competition from debt funds and demand from your client base david cohen co president of bridge lending yes i think it s very competitive right now and as i mentioned in the dissertation before that the certainty of execution is paramount right now and i think that a lot of our clients are looking for us through this upfront process we have to review deals to go from beginning to end without much change now the volume is definitely being driven across the board all states there s a lot of movement and migration to the sun dealt wherever it may be but the demand in particular for multi family has been very very ferocious it s been very there s been a lot of volume in that market i think that since we focus on asset types the multi family and industrial in particular that s where we re seeing the most value add opportunities right now and then followed by i would say self storage and minimal on the hospitality retail and then some office but the demand is across the board and it s going to continue so long as there s a good work from home platform that tenants are looking to work from and yes i think it will continue going forward but the volume is the highest i ve seen it in a while tom capasse chief executive officer yes and just last point on that and adam maybe touch on the mosaic in a moment but dave i think another point you make in our management meetings is the competition in your strata of the market lower middle market is not as great in terms of new entrance and pricing and credit aggressive being aggressive on credit in the large balance based correct david cohen co president of bridge lending that s a 100 correct tom and once you get up to the over 50 million or even over a 100 million of loan size the whole sphere changes in terms of the competitive nature but there are very few lenders in the 5 to 20 and since we focus in that area in the middle market small balance it s definitely given us an advantage to want to have diversity and also to be able to structure and close on those transactions tom capasse chief executive officer yes that s helpful so in terms of the second part of the question adam maybe just touch on the current mosaic transaction how you and your team are going to manage the existing exposure and then the go forward in terms of we re bringing on they have a very strong team in mosaic mosaic was formed by a visionary and a pioneer in the cmbs market ethan penner and they so that team is going to be based in california and will continue to we ll be integrated and continue to originate the construction notes but maybe just adam very briefly touch on the existing exposure and then the go forward adam zausmer chief credit officer yes jade i think you touched on the comfort around the larger loan sizes i think regard to loan sizes i like to say that the smaller deals the underwriting on those are often more complex than the actual larger transactions right the risks are the same etcetera but you typically have with a smaller loan less sophisticated sponsor etcetera but i think with those mosaic portfolio these larger loan sizes the sponsors and developers or end developers are often more institutional than the small amounts borrowers like i mentioned more experienced well capitalized should they run into issues they can easily tap into their equity partners if needed so that certainly gives us some comfort on the loan sizes and then also in david s bridge business you ve seen over the years within our own portfolio the existing portfolio that are large that our average loan sizes have been increases i think that also helps with economies of scale in terms of underwriting and expenses related to the business to tom s second point about the team that we re bringing on during the due diligence process we spent a lot of time out in these markets with the mosaic asset managers with their leaders etcetera growing the markets growing the assets doing deep dives at the asset level and what we came around with is that these are very experienced solid asset managers that have strong relationships not just from a sponsor and client perspective but from a third party perspective from local partners in the market that that can assist with just local intel that that you need on these types of assets so working with those has been fantastic and we re going to be bringing them on to ready capital team and that also gives us some significant comfort that they re going to be helping us manage these assets going forward jade rahmani kbw analyst thank you and just on mosaic manager you mentioned ethan penner wondering what will his role be with respect to ready capital i think the language says that the mosaic manager will continue to provide investment management services to certain prospective and existing clients which i assume is of their own clients but just curious about the role that they ll have with respect to ready capital tom capasse chief executive officer yes mosaic will be retained as essentially in a specialist asset manager role to manage the number of the assets in terms of disposition strategies advanced how we syndication etcetera and that there s an alignment there in terms of their existing lps because there is the contingent equity right mechanism the 98 million which will accrete 90 to the existing mosaic shareholders so that we think this arrangement creates a strong alignment of interest both for ready cap as well as the mosaic lps jade rahmani kbw analyst thank you very much tom capasse chief executive officer thanks jade andrew ahlborn chief financial officer thanks operator our next question comes from the line of steve delaney with jmp securities please proceed with your question steve delaney jmp securities analyst thanks hey good morning everyone congratulations on the really strong results yes i think it s when look at what you ve done with your performance the legacy businesses and the acquisitions that you ve bolted on in the last six months i think you ve really taken investor focus off of the ppp and the timing of that etcetera so props for that i think that s good for the stock starting off to i think tim nailed it on his first question i think the question of the day is understanding the port the mosaic portfolio in terms of property types in geo and you certainly covered that we also know that the team s going to stay how many people are you said they re based in california just roughly how many people are coming over to manage that portfolio tom capasse chief executive officer adam you want to touch that adam zausmer chief credit officer yes sure on the asset management side it s about eight individuals and then there s an origination team of two individuals so the combination of that right the origination folks that obviously originated as loans underwrote them etcetera that s going to be a huge benefit for us as you know we move forward here so it s about 10 folks based in california steve delaney jmp securities analyst okay great and that group obviously you ve got the existing portfolio tom if you look forward is this something that you structure something as a separate trs or do you see this group as sort of a sub manager to waterfall itself how does i guess what i m really asking tom is do you see this other than acquiring a portfolio do you see this having legs and if it does kind of how does it fit into the overall structure of the company tom capasse chief executive officer yes no that s a good question steve this unequivocally is a great bolt on fit for our existing product mix because think about it if you re a sponsor a lower middle market sponsor what we offer them now through dave s business is a so called heavy transitional right whether we could acquire it there ll be a lot of capex but it s not ground up construction so now we go to ground up construction which is typically the bailiwick of the banks very to non banks in this space and so like bank of ozarks etcetera they have much their ltvs by just given the nature of the high capital charges for construction loans with banks they re more in the 50s ish 60 most and as a non bank we can go a little bit up the ltv spectrum not by a lot but kind of like a unit tranche leverage loan but for us this clearly is a new existing product offering that is a yes will fit our existing sponsor base but for example just to give you one example with the redstone they do construction lending right for affordable with a take right from freddie well now we can provide that even more enhanced their business by offering affordable construction sorry offering construction lending for affordable multi family with a yes with a known takeout with the freddie tax exempt bonds so this clearly is a product fit and the individual alex who would come on who s coming on board is very well respected in the industry he s been he was with ethan back in the more days 25 plus years ago so i think we see a very seamless product that for this construction lending vis a vis dave s transitional lending business steve delaney jmp securities analyst great that s great to hear and then a quick follow up on redstone since you mentioned it i ve been trying to understand exactly how they fit into the mix and whether do they focus more on low income housing tax credits syndications or actually buying the mrbs and the gils exactly what is can you kind of clarify exactly the products they have to support low income affordable housing tom capasse chief executive officer adam you want to touch on that i mean just to be upfront though that they re not a syndicator they basically utilize the freddie mortgage tax exempt bond program but adam maybe you could just kind of touch on their core business adam zausmer chief credit officer yes yes sure steve so their sole focus is really providing construction and permanent financing for the preservation and construction of affordable housing primarily utilizing tax exempt bonds so just some things that they ve done over the years so they ve closed over 5 billion of multi family affordable 60 000 units they got a 1 7 billion pipeline today affordable projects they have a freddie mac seller servicer license for the targetable affordable housing they d done like 19 tax exempt bond securitizations to date through the freddie mac program so to tom s point i mean yes their sole focus is really construction and permanent vice financing for affordable housing and clearly there s a significant demand from a tenant perspective to get into the these affordable projects steve delaney jmp securities analyst got it so yes highly specialized and focused loan brokerage kind of platform and obviously next year starting next year yes we got an increase in the caps to 78 billion but 50 has to be affordable so sounds like a really nice piece addition so listen thanks for the questions and for the comments this morning thank you tom capasse chief executive officer thanks steve adam zausmer chief credit officer thanks steve operator our next question comes from the line of chris nolan with ladenburg thalmann please proceed with your question chris nolan ladenburg thalmann analyst hi my questions have been asked and answered thank you tom capasse chief executive officer

executive officer thanks matt good morning and welcome to victory capital s third quarter 2021 earnings conference call i m joined today by mike policarpo our president chief financial and administrative officer as well as matt dennis our chief of staff and director of investor relations we had a very successful and active third quarter in a number of areas and carried that momentum into the year s final quarter with yesterday s announcement of our agreement to acquire westend advisors i ll start today by providing an overview of the launch of our alternative investment platform with the acquisition of new energy capital which closed on november 1 then i will cover our planned acquisition of westend advisors which will position us as a leader in the very attractive model delivery segment of the industry following that i will highlight our excellent operating results achieved in the quarter and then cover our investment performance which continues to be strong after that i will turn it over to mike who will review our third quarter financial results in greater detail following our prepared remarks mike matt and i will be available to take your questions turning to slide 5 we have had a desire to expand into alternative investments in private markets for several years and have done a significant amount of market research over that time we have spoken to the leaders of many alternative firms and worked with industry experts to gain knowledge and have the confidence to invest and compete in this space the traditional side of our business has grown from 17 billion 8 years ago when we became an independent company to approximately 160 billion today now with greater scale financial stability and a deeper understanding we are well positioned to diversify our business into alternatives leading up to this milestone we ve been making deliberate investments to prepare for success in the alternative space some examples are we recently developed a dedicated team of highly experienced ria multifamily office sales specialists and have made investments in certain technology and data to support this expansion since its founding in 2004 nec s business has focused exclusively on investing in the clean and renewable energy sectors the fact that their focus happens to be on investing in projects and companies involved with the transition away from carbon based energy sources is a function of the team s background and expertise they have launched and managed credit hybrid and equity funds so they have a wide range of investing experience in this space they ve always upheld an alpha first investing approach with nec we had an investment franchise that exemplifies investment performance excellence shares victory s entrepreneurial and agile culture and lives every day guided by a client first philosophy consistent with our franchise model on the traditional side of our business we ve created economic alignment with the nec team through a revenue sharing arrangement and an earnout structure that is based on achieving targeted revenue growth in addition we will provide technology support and distribution and collaboration with nec s leadership alternative investments in private markets present an appealing new growth vertical for us and will complement the ongoing growth in our core traditional business with attractive margins fee rates asset flows and long dated capital there is a lot to like about alternatives longer term we envision creating value by leveraging our product development capabilities to create new vehicles that can democratize access to private markets for retail investors rapid advances in technology are driving a convergence of private and public markets and victory capital is ideally situated to participate in this evolution we see tremendous opportunity to broaden access for mass market investors through investment strategies that have previously only been available to credit investors our guiding principles will remain the same with alternative investments we will support investment autonomy ensure that economic incentives are aligned for the present and the next generation of each investment team and we will focus on high quality franchises with proven investment processes and teams with the closing of nec now behind us we are starting to prepare for the next growth phase of that franchise turning to slide 7 yesterday we announced that we reached a definitive agreement to acquire 100 of westend advisers which will become our 12th investment franchise westend is a leading third party etf model strategist with approximately 18 billion of assets this acquisition is transformational for victory capital in that it provides us with a high quality investment platform in the fast growing model segment of the industry this transaction is also structured according to our guiding principles in that we have an earn out component of the purchase price that is based on achieving significant revenue growth targets and we will also have a revenue sharing arrangement in place we intend to retain the entire employee base and add to their team in areas such as distribution client service and investments over time to support the significant growth opportunity that lies ahead of us our existing distribution team will be additive to westend s activities by leveraging our wider geographical footprint and having more sales personnel in market to drive increasing penetration at platforms where westend currently has shelf space compounding this growth will be our ability to leverage our team s long standing relationships to assist in securing new shelf space with numerous financial intermediaries for westend as you can see from the graphics on this slide their three primary etf strategies make up approximately 90 of our assets all of those strategies have outperformed benchmarks for the latest 1 3 5 7 and 10 year periods ended september 30 these returns are net of fees and demonstrate westend s investment value proposition for clients turning to slide 8 westend is well positioned to continue benefiting from multiple industry trends which i will highlight in a moment they are one of the largest third party etf model strategists in the industry westend does not use any proprietary products in their model portfolios by using only third party etfs to gain the desired sector exposure they avoid the types of conflicts faced by home office models at broker dealers and asset manager models that use their own proprietary products also unlike proprietary models delivered by asset managers which tend to be more static westend models have active strategic and tactical components that feature sector exposure over style categories such as growth or value westend s approach also provides financial advisors with a valuable and independent solution westend currently has recommended shelf space on the largest warehouses and has grown client assets to more than 1 billion at six different platforms through these and other platforms they re working with approximately 3 000 advisors to put this opportunity into context today victory is working with nearly 100 000 advisors and we believe our current advisor relationships will be instrumental in increasing advisor penetration on these existing platforms for westend moreover there s a great opportunity to expand westend s presence to include the many platforms that our existing products are currently on and theirs are not we view this transaction as an excellent means of further utilizing and monetizing the investments we have made over the past years to build out our distribution system beyond their model delivery which is typically used by advisors for a holistic or a completion solution providing another source of alpha westend delivers complementary services to help advisors grow and gain scale in their own practices they provide valuable collateral around their investment thesis as well as market commentaries and other client ready educational collateral that advisors can repurpose directly with their clients this extra value add is greatly appreciated by financial advisors as evidenced by westend being named envestnet asset manager and strategist of the year in 2021 on slide 9 we illustrate several secular industry trends that are creating strong tailwinds for etf models first investors increased preference for competitively priced etf vehicle wrappers for investment exposure second more intermediaries are promoting adoption of model portfolios for regulatory reasons as well as to free up advisors to focus on client service and gathering assets rather than portfolio construction lastly the ongoing migration of advisors away from commission based business models to fee based revenue models all of this bodes well for continued accelerated organic growth for westend which is nicely positioned in the middle of these major industry trends that are evolving the asset and wealth management landscape additional evidence of these material trends is illustrated on slide 10 overall model portfolios have grown 29 annually over the last 3 years inside of this shift etf models are growing faster than mutual fund models and have been gaining market share as the total market pie grows in size needless to say we are very optimistic about this acquisition and how it will enhance our overall organic growth trajectory on slide 11 you can see that westend s growth has significantly exceeded that of the industry with assets growing at more than 40 annually from the end of 2016 through 2020 in the first 9 months of 2021 assets increased another 53 with most of the growth coming from positive net inflows the 3 5 billion of positive net flows generated by westend in the first 9 months of this year represents more than 30 of their assets at the start of the year even with this rapid growth they had very low single digit penetration at most of the platforms where they currently have shelf space this provides a very long runway for sustainable asset growth this acquisition is also a sufficient size that we expect it will have a meaningful accretive impact on our overall net flows and it will steepen our overall organic growth trajectory on slide 12 we provide a summary of the financial structure and pro forma estimates of the acquisition which illustrates the value creation opportunity for our shareholders alongside the compelling strategic rationale we will be making a 480 million cash payment at closing this will be financed through an incremental term loan b facility that is already fully committed we do not anticipate any significant changes with this incremental facility from our current term loan westend will add approximately 9 of eps accretion in year 1 which will grow double digit accretion in year 2 and by year 4 we expect accretion to exceed 20 or well over 1 per diluted share over the same time frame we expect westend will generate strong positive net flows fueling this growth a final aspect to point out is that this acquisition is strategic and thus we do not anticipate any significant cost reductions to be generated from the transaction we may very well achieve some minor cost reductions from leveraging our operational platform however to be conservative we have not included any cost synergies in our projections there also should be minimal integration costs incurred turning to the quarterly business overview that begins on slide 14 we ended the quarter with 160 billion of aum earlier this year i featured a number of our products with significant open capacity that have been attracting assets as investors continue to recalibrate portfolios this has led to record long term gross sales of 22 4 billion in the first 9 months of the year which is 28 higher than during the same period last year a few examples of the products are a morningstar 5 star rated victory floating rate fund and the victory market neutral income fund which have continued to experience positive net flows in the current market environment additionally our victoryshares etf platform generated positive net flows for the fourth consecutive quarter moreover the net flow improvements in our direct investor business have persisted into the most recent quarter all this culminated in our second consecutive quarter of positive net flows revenues grew 2 sequentially and were up 20 versus the same quarter of last year adjusted net income with tax benefit per diluted share grew to a record 1 25 which was up 6 from the second quarter and up 25 from last year s third quarter our integrated operating platform continues to demonstrate the efficiency of our model with adjusted ebitda margins coming in above 50 for five consecutive quarters we continued to reduce debt during the quarter at the same time we accumulated cash to fund the nec acquisition and other cash needs including the second usaa earn out payment yesterday we also announced that our board declared the sixth consecutive increase in our quarterly cash dividend raising it 13 to 0 17 per share on slide 15 i ll review the direct investor business and new product developments during the quarter our contact center fielded approximately 110 000 investor calls with an average speed to answer of less than 1 minute with superior customer satisfaction scores as i mentioned earlier flows improved for the past five consecutive quarters in our direct investor business which is encouraging as we continue to build out enhancements and look forward to adding many new features and products during 2022 our referral agreement with usaa continues to support new account growth on average we ve added more than 5 000 accounts per month since the acquisition inclusive in this number are new clients acquired outside of the referral agreement and we are encouraged about the long term opportunity that is in front of us with regard to account growth our 529 plan has also been a positive contributor adding new accounts during the first nine months of 2021 and since the acquisition in 2019 the 529 plan has been net flow positive in the third quarter we also launched our mobile app for direct investors it has gotten off to a strong start and has already been downloaded from the apple and android stores by approximately 100 000 users by enhancing the ways in which direct investors can digitally engage with us we are simultaneously increasing investor satisfaction while enhancing our operating efficiency regarding new product development in august we launched a private crypto fund part of our exclusive agreement with nasdaq and global crypto focused asset manager hashdex this is a differentiated product that provides the credit investors with access to a diversified basket of digital assets with competitive pricing and no lockups the fund tracks the nasdaq crypto index ticker nci which is a multi coin crypto index that employs strict eligibility criteria and rebalances constituents quarterly this structure creates beta like exposure to these assets for investors in a dynamic and adaptable manner earlier in the current quarter we also launched three actively managed esg focused etfs turning to perhaps the most important page in the presentation our strong investment performance is illustrated on slide 17 our investment franchises continued to generate attractive investment returns for our clients during the third quarter the number of mutual funds and etfs with a 4 or 5 star rating from morningstar increased to 45 at the end of september and approximately two thirds of our aum is in mutual funds and etfs with 4 or 5 star ratings which is an increase from last quarter for the trailing 12 months ended in september 21 of the mutual funds we manage ranked in the top quartile of their peer groups with that i will turn it over to mike for a more in depth discussion of the financials mike michael d policarpo president chief financial officer chief administrative officer thanks dave and good morning everyone the financial results review begins on slide 19 revenue was up 2 sequentially from the second quarter reaching 226 3 million this was a 20 increase over the same quarter in 2020 adjusted ebitda margin was 50 8 up 20 basis points from the second quarter and up 10 basis points from the third quarter of last year year to date adjusted ebitda margin was 50 5 which is a 290 basis point improvement over the comparable period in 2020 gaap net income and earnings per share set new quarterly records at 74 2 million and 1 per diluted share respectively and adjusted net income with tax benefit was a record 92 6 million or 1 25 per diluted share which is up 6 sequentially and up 25 year over year we continued to reduce debt paying down 35 million in the first half of the quarter before we began accumulating cash in preparation for the nec transaction close as the quarter progressed we repaid a total of 454 million of debt since the acquisition of usaa mutual funds and 529 business just over 2 years ago we returned a total of 19 million of capital to shareholders in the form of cash dividends and share repurchases in the quarter which brings the year to date total capital returned to just over 51 million lastly the 13 higher quarterly cash dividend of 0 17 per share is payable on december 27 to shareholders of record on december 10 turning to slide 20 total aum declined 1 during the quarter to 159 9 billion this was driven by negative market action that was partially offset by positive net flows in the quarter aum is up 21 from the same time last year with our long term aum ending the quarter at 156 7 billion the business continues to be highly diversified by clients as evidenced by the bar chart on this page we have three deep distribution channels with each representing over 25 of our firm aum on 21 we cover long term asset flows gross sales declined sequentially primarily due to a couple of previously disclosed institutional mandates that were funded in the second quarter and seasonal volatility more importantly year over year gross long term sales improved 12 in the third quarter to 5 7 billion compared with 5 1 billion in last year s third quarter year to date gross long term sales were 22 4 billion which is a 28 improvement over gross long term sales of 17 5 billion in the same 2020 period as dave mentioned this was our second consecutive quarter of positive net long term flows year to date net long term outflows are approximately 0 5 billion which is a significant improvement from the 9 4 billion of long term outflows in the first 9 months of last year year to date flows have been well diversified by investment franchise distribution channel and client type more specifically we have seen better net flows in our direct investor business strong sales of many of our high performing products and have picked up this year in institutional activity turning to slide 22 quarter over quarter revenues increased by 2 and year over year revenue was up 20 due to higher averaged aum in each respective period average fee rates in the quarter was 55 3 basis points which was down 0 9 of a basis point from the second quarter gross investment management fees were 0 8 basis points lower due to channel and asset mix net management fees were helped by better fulcrum fee performance and lower fund waivers and reimbursements in the quarter this was partially offset by higher money market yield support while we have seen improvement in the fulcrum fees on the usaa mutual funds the impact for the quarter was negative 0 3 basis points there is upside as we have mentioned previously on our fee rate on both the fulcrum fees and as we see improvements in the rate environment on our money market fund yield support which was negative 0 9 basis point in the quarter fund administration distribution and ta fees were down 0 2 basis points versus the second quarter based on channel and product vehicle mix fee rates will fluctuate quarter to quarter based on client and asset mix it is important to note that our margins did increase during a period in which our fee rates contracted highlighting the power of our operating model as we look ahead the management fee rate realized by westend is approximately 30 basis points which is below our current average management fee rate and given that there are no associated fund admin distribution for ta fees associated with westend s model business we expect product mix shift will result in lower average consolidated fee rates following the close of that transaction that said as we ve repeatedly stated we are much more focused on margins than fee rate our business model is designed to maximize efficiencies and enable us to earn healthy margins on very competitively priced products this is evident in the current year with the uptick in margins and net income despite lower realized fee rates moving to slide 23 you can see our total expenses increased 1 from the second quarter in line with higher aum revenue and earnings lower quarter over quarter cash compensation expenses were offset by higher acquisition restructuring and integration expenses which increased by 1 9 million in the quarter related to the nec and usaa asset management acquisitions as a percentage of revenue cash compensation remained steady at 23 shifting to our non gaap metrics for the quarter please turn to slide 24 adjusted net income with tax benefit per diluted share increased to 1 25 up 6 from the second quarter and 25 higher than in last year s same quarter adjusted net income of 92 6 million achieved in the quarter included a 6 9 million tax benefit year to date adjusted net income with tax benefit grew more than 27 to 263 million or 3 55 per diluted share adjusted ebitda margins widened slightly compared with the second quarter we are continuing to make investments in the business and thus we will maintain our adjusted ebitda margin guidance of approximately 49 as we ve discussed in the past this can fluctuate quarter over quarter or even year over year depending on aum levels and the timing of the investments being made to drive future growth taking a look at our financial condition on slide 25 you can see that we have been actively preparing our balance sheet to provide capacity in support of our inorganic growth strategy our interest rate and our absolute cost of debt have declined dramatically since we originated the term loan a little over 2 years ago this is the result of reducing the outstanding debt and two repricings that lowered the spread we pay on the debt as well as lower libor our primary cash needs for the business in the final quarter of this year include consideration for the nec acquisition which was paid at closing earlier this week the second earnout payment for the usaa acquisition which is once again a full earnout payment of 37 5 million due to revenue exceeding projections and the westend acquisition which is being financed with an incremental term loan b facility that as dave mentioned earlier is fully committed marketing for the debt deal will commence next week as we are on track to close the westend acquisition by year end we do not anticipate any significant changes to the term loan associated with the incremental facility on a pro forma basis the term loan extension will increase our leverage ratio to approximately 2 3 times based on estimated run rates at closing this is lower leverage versus when we entered into the original term loan 2 years ago our pro forma run rate ebitda from this transaction is projected to be in excess of 500 million or approximately 30 higher than the ebitda run rate of 385 million at the time of origination as in the past we intend to deploy the majority of this higher cash generation to reduce debt additional capital management activities are detailed on slide 26 cash flow from operations was approximately 100 million in the quarter after repaying 107 million in debt in the first half we paid down an additional 35 million early in the third quarter returned a total of 19 million to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends during the quarter we repurchased an additional 189 000 shares in the third quarter at an average price of 33 29 per share this increased year to date share repurchases to 763 000 shares through the end of september at an average cost of 28 46 per share we also announced the sixth consecutive increase in our quarterly cash dividend yesterday which is up 13 from the dividend paid in the third quarter that concludes our prepared remarks i ll now turn it back over to the operator for questions questions and answers operator your first question comes from robert lee with kbw robert lee keefe bruyette woods analyst great thanks good morning thanks for taking my questions i guess maybe my first question is on westend so i m just curious i mean how you re thinking about the distribution leverage you can add or maybe what they could bring to you i guess they already seem to be in many of the larger or mid size distribution platforms so already have a presence there pretty good growth so i mean how much do you think you could possibly accelerate and then maybe by the same token what does this do to your overall sma business is this to what extent do you think this helps maybe the rest of your platform of products that you may have in the sma market david c brown chairman chief executive officer good morning it s dave and thanks for your question westend is let me start by saying westend is a transformational transaction for us it s going to put us into a segment of the industry that s growing very quickly there s a huge shift going on at the intermediary platforms evolving to models evolving to more fee based type of accounts and so for westend the opportunity set to partner with us is to really have first more sales professionals in the field to have a wider geographical reach so when you think about one of the stats we gave in the prepared remarks of they do business with 3 000 advisors and we do business with 100 000 advisors there s an unbelievable opportunity just to get more advisors to learn about westend and there are a lot of platforms that they don t do business with that we do business with so we ll be able to introduce their product set to that group of platforms and then within the platforms they do business with today we ll be able to introduce their product to more of the advisors as we said in our prepared remarks we are keeping 100 of their employees their entire distribution force our distribution force is unbelievably excited as they learned about this yesterday and i think there s a real opportunity to accelerate what they ve already done and they ve done a tremendous job growing their business and establishing their business to be one of the largest third party etf model providers in the industry as far as our existing business there s a real opportunity for us to cross sell products with advisors to get introduced to advisors that maybe we re not doing business with today but we look at this as all additive and this really allows us to utilize and really monetize the investments we ve made in distribution even further than what we re doing today robert lee keefe bruyette woods analyst great and then maybe just a quick follow up i m assuming post transaction there s no change in how you re thinking about cash and capital management just got in place is kind of paid down at a steady pace to kind of reload so i d assume that doesn t change david c brown chairman chief executive officer exactly no change in our overall capital policy the strategy we ve employed over the last few years is to use the primary free cash flow to pay down debt and then to have a flexible balance sheet to take advantage of the consolidation that s happening in the industry and to put ourselves in a position to be flexible and nimble and when you think about what we ve accomplished in 2021 with announcing nec and closing it and then the anticipation of the close of westend before the end of the year that s really available to us because of the flexibility of our balance sheet and how prepared it is robert lee keefe bruyette woods analyst great thanks for taking my questions operator your next question comes from alex blostein with goldman sachs alexander blostein goldman sachs analyst hey guys good morning thanks for taking the question couple of questions on nec curious if you could expand a bit on the different products and really the wrappers that they currently have to distribute their product sort of anything on the open ended side anything on the perpetual side just to get a better understanding for the duration of capital there and then how quickly do you think victory s distribution could start to add to sort of the organic growth profile on that entity david c brown chairman chief executive officer hi alex so today nec really has only a private only has a private fund option available to accredited investors or qualified investors our vision for that business is to continue down that path and also as we said make it available to a larger investing base through some of our wrappers that we have today that s in development we think it s a great opportunity to really take return streams and really access to private markets and make that available to the masses i think you ve seen a lot in the last few weeks with some of the announcements in the industry that we ve seen there s a real opportunity to do that and we think we re well positioned to do that alexander blostein goldman sachs analyst got you okay great and then on westend i think i ve heard you guys say it s a 30 basis point fee rate business how stable has that fee rate been over time call it over the last couple of years and as you think about sort of the forward on the fee rates here what s the competitive moat for this entity you think that will prevent fee rates from coming down as they might i guess as we ve seen with maybe some of the other wrappers are ultimately more kind of passive point in the vehicles michael d policarpo president chief financial officer chief administrative officer hey alex good morning it s mike thanks for the question the westend fee rates as we said in the prepared remarks are about 30 basis points and they ve been consistent really since the beginning of their access of their products to the retail platforms that they sit on we believe going forward that the fee rates will remain stable they provide really active etf model portfolios on these platforms and they re differentiated in both their structure and how they provide their investment thesis and so we feel pretty confident that going forward the basis points that they re charging that have been consistent will remain the same because of the differentiation that they provide within these platforms alexander blostein goldman sachs analyst got it great thank you very much michael d policarpo president chief financial officer chief administrative officer sure operator your next question comes from cullen johnson with b riley securities cullen johnson b riley fbr analyst hey thanks good morning thanks for taking my questions so new energy is currently about 1 billion so not yet maybe a huge piece of aum but you could probably see some positive net flows there would that start to support the fee rate at the margin assuming some meaningful aum growth in that segment michael d policarpo president chief financial officer chief administrative officer hey cullen it s mike yes at 1 billion it probably won t provide significant support since we re 160 billion overall but as we have said nec s fee rates are typical to private equity private credit structures and we do expect that we ll continue to raise assets going forward with that from a math perspective it s just a little bit too small to provide significant support but we do feel like the opportunity set for organic growth with nec is pretty substantive going forward and it does create the opportunity for us now with an alternatives platform to attract additional alternative products to put within the operating platform cullen johnson b riley fbr analyst got it that s helpful and then just looking at expenses distribution and asset based expense i guess kind of late 2019 early 2020 you saw it may be closer to the 50 million range but lately it s been running low 40s low to mid 40s is that probably a fair way to think about that value in the intermediate term here michael d policarpo president chief financial officer chief administrative officer yes i think the current kind of run rates are definitely the opportunity set going forward for kind of our distribution and aum related expenses in 2020 we had with the transaction within usaa some declining as we were able to execute on some incremental synergies with respect to those expenses cullen johnson b riley fbr analyst got it that s helpful those are all my questions thanks michael d policarpo president chief financial officer chief administrative officer sure operator your next question comes from kenneth lee with rbc capital markets kenneth lee rbc capital markets analyst hi thanks for taking my question one on the westend in terms of the projections you talked about in the prepared remarks wondering how much of the projections are assuming a certain amount of expansion based on benefit from victory capital s distribution capabilities versus i guess just further growth within the current platforms or clients that westend already has thanks david c brown chairman chief executive officer it s dave hard to segment that out i think what we thought about is we are going to take westend s existing distribution penetration their existing distribution people combine it with ours and we think putting that together is going to be pretty powerful going forward we re anticipating the same type of growth that they ve achieved over the last 4 years going forward and that accelerating this is really hitting a couple as we ve talked about a couple key points in the industry there are secular tailwinds that we think we re going to be right in the middle of and then with our distribution and really it really allowing us to utilize all the investments we ve made in our distribution we think it s going to grow quite significantly but we have not segmented out what exactly victory is going to bring versus what westend would bring but we know putting it together it s going to be pretty powerful kenneth lee rbc capital markets analyst that s helpful and just one follow up if i may and perhaps this is a little bit more broadly in terms of alternative products and as you build out the capabilities in offering alternative products i wonder if you could just talk a little bit more about what kind of changes do you envision for your distribution platform i think you talked about within your prepared remarks some additions of more specialized sales but just wondering at a high level what sort of changes do you think are needed for your distribution platform in order to start distributing alternative products more widely going forward thanks david c brown chairman chief executive officer yes it s dave again well we ve been making those changes already i think we ve talked about really preparing and evolving our distribution platform and our overall platform so some of those changes have occurred with investments in technology and data and some of the different pieces of our distribution we ll evolve going forward in our institutional channel in our intermediary channel but there won t be major changes needed the alternatives platform like we said we have studied alternatives for years we ve talked to a lot of industry leaders we ve prepared our platform and we think it s a great opportunity going forward and i think as the buyers evolve for these kinds of products i think we re really well positioned to take advantage of it with the resources we have today and the continued evolution the alternatives platform for us our approach is going to be exactly what we ve done with our traditional platform we built it over a number of years we built it methodically we built it efficiently i think we ve built it smartly and i think the success speaks for itself and that will be the same path we ll take on the alternative side we re in no rush we re looking for high quality franchises that are really value added to clients portfolios nec is a perfect example and i think what will guide us is our principles but from a distribution perspective specifically we re in good ways there and we will evolve the rest of the way as we continue to expand it out kenneth lee rbc capital markets analyst great helpful thanks again operator your next question comes from owen lau with oppenheimer kwun lau oppenheimer analyst good morning thank you for taking my question could you please talk about your appetite for further acquisition in the near term how should investors think about the pace of the acquisition will you take a pause while you re finding the right target or you re in active dialogue with potential sellers and getting close to the finish line thank you david c brown chairman chief executive officer hi it s dave again i would say 21 is going to turn out to be a really active year for us from an acquisition perspective thb nec and now westend all should close before the end of the year the last four transactions are all what i would term as growth transactions all areas where we re investing in growth and i think 22 is going to be a year where we re going to really see the impact of that growth on all four of those as you think about alderwood fundraising in 22 and thb starting to really come online and then nec fundraising in 22 as well and then the impact of westend i think you ll see a real impact to our business when it comes to activity i ve said this quarter over quarter we are active we will be able to immediately go to another acquisition after we close westend we ll pay down debt very quickly we have lots of different ways to structure transactions and we re talking to a lot of folks today our platform is really appealing and i would anticipate that we continue this pace we re not going to rush anything there will be pockets of time where we don t do anything but it doesn t mean the dialogue is going to stop but i can tell you that we are active we are talking to groups actively and there are a lot of great opportunities out there for us our guiding principle on acquisitions is pretty simple it has to make our company better and i think what we ve done has made our company significantly better and that will be the approach we use going forward kwun lau oppenheimer analyst got it that s very helpful and then could you please also give us more color of your crypto strategy what do you see in terms of the institutional adoption of digital assets these days thank you david c brown chairman chief executive officer i did not understand the question can you repeat it kwun lau oppenheimer analyst sorry i just wanted to see whether you can give us more color of your crytpo strategy anything related to digital assets and what do you see in terms of the institutional adoption of digital assets david c brown chairman chief executive officer sure so we launched the crypto product a few months ago we have seen really good interest we re in an education phase with a number of our potential clients we ve had some clients purchase the product and i think when we think about the institutional side we are in an educational part of the process given that it s a new asset class i think longer term you re going to see institutions use the crypto asset class as a diversifier as an enhancement to a larger portfolio we ve seen an instance a large institution actually buy crypto which i think is the first step so we have high hopes for it we re talking about it with a lot of clients it s resonating and we re really in the process of educating which i think is the step before actually purchasing kwun lau oppenheimer analyst got it thank you very much operator your next question comes from michael cyprys with morgan stanley michael cyprys morgan stanley analyst hey good morning thanks for taking the question just on the model portfolio space certainly a growing part of the industry but it s getting a little crowded too so can you just talk about what westend is doing differently in the marketplace that is resulting in the growth and can you also talk about the competitive landscape how do you see that evolving and what do they need to do right in order to be a winner in 5 years david c brown chairman chief executive officer hi it s dave well first their investment process they are active they ve had excellent investment performance over a long period of time they re well experienced they give excellent client service really value added to the advisors when they re taking what they do and packaging that up for the advisors for themselves and the advisors to use for their clients they have a very tax efficient portfolio utilizing etfs they don t utilize any of their proprietary products so this is truly a third party makeup of etfs where they re able to be selective on how they re getting their exposure to different sectors if you look at the landscape and you look at what they have to offer it s really either a holistic solution for an advisor or a complement to an overall portfolio where they re maybe 10 to 30 of the portfolio and when you think about how they ve performed over the different market cycles and also couple that with the tax efficiency and what they re doing from an education of the advisor giving collateral to the advisor it s a really compelling proposition going forward i think it s going to be what they re doing today there could be some product expansion that we have discussed which i think could be quite interesting as well but i think they re very well positioned crowded when you look at the overall model industry but they re in a certain part of the industry where i think they really have been able to stand out and will continue to be able to stand out with what they re doing michael cyprys morgan stanley analyst great and then just on the earnout can you help quantify what the range of potential earnout payments could be how significant is that could it be as large as the upfront payment and what sort of metrics need to be met for that to be fully paid versus partially paid michael d policarpo president chief financial officer chief administrative officer mike good morning it s mike yes the earnout is i mean the upfront purchase is a majority of the total potential purchase price so the earnout really is the minority of the purchase price and what i d say is it s earned out and it s up to the potential to earn it out over 5 5 years post the transaction and how that will be earned is really based on material revenue growth over that period and then revenue growth just from a sizing perspective really will be and needs to be in line with their kind of recent growth trends that they ve experienced to earn the full earnout it is a capped turnout and we look at it as should they hit the cap on the earnout it will be self funding from a cash flow perspective based on the growth that s delivered michael cyprys morgan stanley analyst great thanks for taking my questions operator your next question comes from ken worthington with jpmorgan kenneth worthington jpmorgan analyst hi good morning i want to dig deeper into alternatives how do you see filling out your alternative suite of products and what alternative areas are sort of must have if you re going to meet your vision for this business and what does pricing sort of look like for alternative asset manager acquisitions it seems like such a hot area that pricing could possibly be a challenge to growing that business is that possibly the case and can you use deal structure to mitigate high prices david c brown chairman chief executive officer hi ken so to answer the first part of your question as far as filling out the different buckets and alternatives we really start with the client portfolio and think about areas where clients will allocate and we can compete so we don t really look at it where we must have this kind of capability or that kind of capability some areas that we re interested in is definitely private credit direct lending we ve thought about real estate and so those are areas that are interesting to us but i wouldn t say any of them are must haves we really do start from the client side and really where we think we can add value and compete from a deal cost or pricing perspective i would say when we speak to alternative managers the managers that want to partner with us are really thinking about growth going forward they re thinking about how do we get access to a much larger client base given our distribution reach and i think that when you have those kinds of conversation upfront pricing is important and you have to be competitive and yes it s more expensive structuring definitely can get you there but i think it s more of a holistic discussion of what does the future look like and what is the future opportunity to create value and earnings and so the firms that are looking to if you will cash out or monetize are probably not the kinds of firms that we re a good partner with i think it s the firms that are really looking at how do we get access to a larger client base how do i get to the next levels in organization but we don t see pricing today something that we can overcome with structuring with the ability to pay fair prices and really with showing our platform and what we have to offer kenneth worthington jpmorgan analyst thank you and then in terms of structure following up on alex s question you implied or talked about bringing some of these alternative products to nonaccredited investors and you re working on sort of product structure how small investments do you think your wrappers could handle like how far down market do you anticipate being able to go with the alternative platform is this something where you get down to 50 000 sort of investments could it be 20 000 could it be 10 000 could it be 5 000 like how small can you support in terms of structure for these alternative products that you envision david c brown chairman chief executive officer i think that is a complicated answer and what i would say is it really depends on the specific facts and circumstances of the product how you package the product but i think the longer term opportunity set for us is to go down to the smallest investor all the way to the largest investor and i think that that is a great opportunity it s why you re seeing some of the transactions you ve seen announced in the last few weeks and i think we are well positioned to take advantage of that but a lot of it is facts and circumstances dependent but i don t see if you will a bottom cap that would prohibit you from taking a certain type of product in a certain situation down to a very small investor which will be very additive to that investor in a properly allocated portfolio kenneth worthington jpmorgan analyst thank you very much operator your final question comes from robert lee with kbw robert lee keefe bruyette woods analyst thank you thanks for taking my follow up and i apologize if you may have covered some of this but i had to jump off the call a little bit but just going back to westend and some of the inputs into the guidance on accretion so there s 30 basis points but can you maybe just refresh on kind of what kind of baked in growth you have in that and it would seem just given the moving pieces that it s maybe a higher than even though it s 30 basis points it s maybe a higher than average ebitda margin or that goodwill tax the core goodwill benefit will be pretty significant michael d policarpo president chief financial officer chief administrative officer thanks rob it s mike yes as we mentioned the fee rates on westend are 30 basis points what i would say is it will be accretive to our overall margins westend is a highly scaled business today and as we think about integrating them into the victory operating and distribution platform we will really be able to utilize efficiently our platform and would expect that there ll be minimal incremental investments that we ll need to make to support the growth that we foresee and dave had mentioned before that we really see a lot of complementary opportunities with our distribution with the relationships that we have that we look at supporting the levels of growth that westend has accomplished on their own there s tremendous upside to that as well as we move forward robert lee keefe bruyette woods analyst okay thank you for taking my follow ups and have a good weekend michael d policarpo president chief financial officer chief administrative officer thanks operator that concludes the q a portion of today s call i would now like to turn the call back over to mr david brown for closing remarks david c brown chairman chief

turn the call over to our ceo david o reilly david r o reilly chief executive officer thank you john and thank you all for joining us today welcome to our third quarter 2021 earnings call to start the call i d like to provide a brief recap of our quarterly performance and cover the highlights of both our mpc segment and the seaport our head of operations dave striph will cover the results of our operating assets segment followed by our president jay cross who will provide details on our development activity and speak to the results at ward village and finally our cfo correne loeffler will conclude the call with a review of our financial results before we open the lines for q a before we dive into the results of the quarter i would first like to highlight the release of howard hughes 2020 annual esg report which was published just a few days ago and can be found on the sustainability portion of our website this report displays the impactful esg results we have produced so far and reflects our commitment to environmental and social best practices which are integrated throughout our communities across the country now on to the highlights of the quarter we closed out the third quarter of 2021 with strong results across all segments as howard hughes continues to capitalize on the high levels of demand that exist throughout our various mixed use communities to put our performance in perspective most of hhc s year to date results in 2021 have surpassed the year to date pre covid activity of 2019 mpc ebt is up 29 operating asset noi is higher by 1 even with lingering impacts from the pandemic and ward village condo sales were just shy of 2019 levels despite having limited available inventory and this was all accomplished while reducing our g a cost by 30 during the third quarter we saw healthy land sales driven by superpad sales in summerlin our operating asset noi grew for the fourth consecutive quarter condo sales in ward village accelerated despite a shrinking supply of available units under construction and the seaport saw steady improvements from the return of the concert series at pier 17 and the growing popularity of our unique restaurants we expect these results to grow stronger especially with the recent addition of douglas ranch our latest mpc spanning 37000 acres in phoenix west valley in october we announced our 600 million all cash acquisition of this fully entitled shovel ready mpc which further adds to our depth of opportunities by strategically redeploying the net proceeds from our noncore asset dispositions we now have the ability to transform this blank canvas into a leading community focused on sustainability and technology a community that is entitled for 100000 homes 300000 residents and 55 million square feet of commercial development following this transaction we are still left with a healthy cash position to continue executing on our existing development pipeline to meet the growing demand within our mpcs while we have already had approximately two million square feet of development underway we re pleased to announce new commercial projects in the medical office and single family for rent sectors which jay will touch on in a moment but we re not stopping there we ve long believed that howard hughes trades at a steep discount relative to its net asset value as such we are pleased to announce our recent board approved share buyback program amounting to 250 million we believe there is great value that is yet to be reflected in our stock price and view this buyback initiative as an excellent use of capital that when coupled with our development projects will help deliver meaningful value all of these recent announcements put a significant amount of capital to work to unlock tremendous value for our dedicated shareholders now let s turn to the performance of our master planned communities our mpcs had another great quarter despite encountering headwinds including supply constraints the delta variant and weather delays particularly in houston housing supply still remains low throughout houston and las vegas while demand continues to persist at elevated levels which leaves us well positioned to deliver residential land at appreciating prices homebuilders are currently sitting on record low inventory and they will need to replenish their depleted landholdings in order to meet its outsized demand during the third quarter our mpcs recorded earnings before taxes of 54 1 million a 48 increase compared to last year largely driven by the robust superpad sales activity in summerlin as well as the strong performance of our summit joint venture in addition to these impressive results we continue to see a steady pace of new home sales proving the strength of our communities remains clearly intact so far in 2021 there have been 2163 new homes sold in our mpcs a 6 increase over last year indicating further demand lies ahead overall we re seeing a lot of positive momentum when it comes to land sales and looking ahead we expect our fourth quarter to be the strongest quarter yet as such we are raising our full year 2021 mpc ebt guidance by 60 million at the midpoint to a range of 275 million to 285 million primarily due to stronger than expected superpad sales in summerlin this is our second time raising mpc guidance in 2021 as this segment continues to exceed our expectations speaking of summerlin this mpc drove a substantial portion of the positive results for the quarter selling 47 acres mostly made up of superpads this mpc generated 45 6 million in ebt a staggering 130 increase compared to the prior year period additionally year to date new home sales have eclipsed over 1200 units and are 20 higher over the same period in 2020 which if you recall was one of the strongest years in summerlin s history another significant driver to summerlin s results has been our joint venture at the summit our exclusive 550 acre community in summerlin the total earnings from our share of equity during the quarter totaled 8 3 million driving year to date earnings to 54 6 million versus only 4 4 million during the first nine months of 2020 the activity at the summit over the last year has been tremendous and these positive results have been primarily attributed to an influx of california buyers purchasing these custom lots and built product turning over to houston our bridgeland mpc experienced a decline in land sales as supply constraints continues to have an impact as we highlighted last quarter a majority of the homebuilders have extended their lead times for home deliveries due to ongoing supply disruptions that have resulted in higher material costs and delayed delivery times we ve started to see some of these bottlenecks subside and expect a more normalized environment heading into next year this quarter s land sales were also impacted by inclement weather as significant rainfall in the houston area delayed horizontal development resulting in slower lot deliveries to homebuilders despite these factors demand in the area remains incredibly strong we view the significant imbalance between undersupply and robust demand as a strong catalyst for elevated activity as we move into 2022 lastly in the woodlands hills despite lower quarterly land sales due to the similar impacts experienced in bridgeland the residential price per acre grew 18 over the prior year period to 353000 while new home sales were up 15 which points to future growth ahead as we accelerate activity across this mpc moving over to the seaport we saw heightened activity throughout the quarter as events and concerts at pier 17 helped draw in spectators during the quarter noi improved 43 compared to the same period in 2020 indicating the return to normalcy is near in july we launched our 11 week summer concert series on the pier 17 rooftop of the 30 concerts hosted 20 were fully sold out the turnout for these contracts proved to be very strong with approximately 74000 guests in attendance representing 90 of our available ticket inventory we were glad to welcome back this series after canceling last year s lineup due to the pandemic and we look forward to building on this momentum for next year in addition to concerts we hosted several other major events including the sps in july and the world tour for the fujis who debuted at pier 17 for their first show together in 15 years it s these type of special events that continue to set the seaport apart from other destinations in manhattan all of these events help drive substantial traffic to our restaurants we saw an uptick in activity as more and more locals and tourists experience our variety of cuisines from acclaimed new york city chefs as a result our restaurant saw their average monthly sales increased 65 versus last quarter while labor constraints have marginally improved we continue to see improvements in this space quarter after quarter many of our restaurants are now closely approaching their stabilization targets as higher volume has contributed meaningfully to the growth of our bottom line overall we see the seaport heading in the right direction and the upcoming completion of the tin building followed by its grand opening in the first half of 2022 will help bring the seaport closer to stabilization with that i m going to stop and hand the call over to dave striph dave david m striph executive vice president head of operations investor relations thank you david our operating assets had a standout quarter as our portfolio delivered strong sequential and year over year noi growth for the third quarter we reported 60 6 million of noi when you layer in the activity from our three hotels that were sold in september this segment generated 62 9 million this marks the fourth consecutive increase in quarterly noi as our portfolio of income producing assets continues to expand as the economy continues to reopen and activity within our regions improves we have seen a corresponding increase in our retail noi these assets generated 16 1 million of noi during the third quarter the highest level since the first quarter of 2019 this is in large part due to a stronger tenant base coming out of the pandemic in addition to consistent increases in collections for the third quarter we collected 83 of our retail rents with summerlin leading the charge for the highest collections in our portfolio as we have highlighted previously our retail at ward village has been materially impacted over the last several quarters due to sharp declines in tourism as a result of the pandemic however as travel restrictions to oahu have been recently eased we ve seen a corresponding improvement in our retail performance in fact ward was the largest contributor to the sequential increase in retail noi partly as a result of a onetime payment of deferred rent of approximately 1 4 million we expect our retail portfolio to continue on this path of growth as collections work back to pre pandemic levels coupled with the continuous lease up of our remaining space to creditworthy tenants at the las vegas ballpark we were able to host the remainder of the aviator season at 100 capacity this resulted in 5 4 million of noi a 74 increase over the last quarter where the beginning of the season was limited to 50 capacity to comply with covid 19 protocols this is a stark comparison to the same period in 2020 where the ballpark lost nearly 1 million as the season was canceled entirely due to the pandemic so needless to say we were glad to welcome back fans into our stadium and look forward to another strong season next year our multifamily assets produced 9 2 million of noi during the third quarter a 24 sequential increase almost exclusively attributable to strong leasing momentum at our most recent developments in 2020 we completed construction on three multifamily projects between the woodlands and columbia and during the third quarter these new developments made up 2 3 of the increase in sequential noi growth in addition to this robust leasing velocity we ve been able to push rents higher and are currently commanding some of the highest rents compared to our surrounding metro areas in addition to our existing product we have three more multifamily developments underway in downtown columbia bridgeland and summerlin to meet this ongoing demand which will drive our noi even higher our office assets have experienced steady increases in noi over the past few quarters despite a sluggish recovery in the return to office environment for the third quarter we generated 27 8 million in noi a 6 increase sequentially and a 17 increase compared to the same period last year the bulk of this increase was driven by the roll off of free rent at select assets including 6100 merriweather our latest office building in downtown columbia overall we are seeing a noticeable increase in leasing activity and expect our pipeline of opportunities to accelerate into 2022 as tenants look for additional space and folks continue to return to an office setting and now with that i ll turn the call over to our president jay cross l jay cross president thanks dave and good morning everyone to build on the momentum we are seeing within our operating asset portfolio we are pleased to announce some new product types in addition to our traditional mix recently we have expanded into the medical office space to continue to provide residents with the highest quality convenient medical care we have noticed a growing need for this type of asset as the volume of residents in our communities continues to grow with that we are pleased to announce the launch of two medical facilities spanning 106000 square feet throughout downtown columbia and the woodlands in downtown columbia we will launch our first medical office building on the shoreline of lake kittamaqundi this new development will sit adjacent to our successful whole foods in the former rouse headquarters building helping to establish downtown columbia as a prominent health and wellness destination encompassing approximately 86000 square feet we have already secured an anchor tenant for roughly 20 of the entire space we expect to break ground on this project during the first half of 2022 and this will kick start our major development pipeline in the lakefront district in the woodlands we will launch development on a 20000 square foot build to suit medical office building for memorial hermann this project will serve as a primary local facility to cater to the medical needs of nearby residents and is expected to break ground by the end of this year lastly in bridgeland we will be constructing our first single family for rent community which will commence in the first half of 2022 these 263 homes will span a combined 328000 square feet and offer a unique hybrid between single family homes for sale and multifamily for rent adding yet another new product to our operating asset portfolio given this is an extension of multifamily we plan to leverage the expertise of the property managers who oversee our existing portfolio in houston to assist in managing this build to rent community in total these three projects represent over 430000 square feet and 114 million of development as we continue to put our capital to work and enhance our stream of recurring income we have already had a number of developments under construction in summerlin columbia and bridgeland so the announcement of these additional developments demonstrates the immense demand we are seeing throughout all our regions moving to the seaport construction of the tin building is now in the final stages and will be substantially complete by the end of the year the launch of the tin building has been highly anticipated and our team has been working in close partnership with the jean georges team to prepare for the grand opening of this 53000 square foot food hall in the first half of 2022 lastly we continue to make great strides through new york city s ulurp process to obtain the necessary approvals for the development of a 26 story mixed use building at 250 water street in october the city planning commission granted us approval for this project another hurdle passed through this rigorous land use process we are nearing the end of our review which we expect to conclude before the end of the year at the new york city council the prospective development would replace the one acre parking lot with market rate and affordable residences commercial and community space further enhancing the character and vibrancy of this neighborhood we look forward to updating you on our continued progress as we continue to close in on the final stages of this process at ward village the pace of condo sales continues to exceed all expectations despite having less inventory under construction the number of condos contracted during the quarter has only grown across our three recent towers a ali i koula and victoria place we were 90 presold as of the end of the quarter with koula and victoria place still under construction this robust velocity has led to the presales launch of our eighth tower the park presales activity at the park began in july and as of the end of october we have already contracted 64 of the total units the sales activity across these four towers just in the third quarter translates to 316 contracted units secured by hard deposits during a period of time when travel to the island of oahu was discouraged surrounding delta variant concerns the pace of these sales is truly remarkable we ve been able to establish a mark on this community where residents want to live and our historical sales pace has reflected increasingly faster sellouts with the launch of each new tower subsequent to the end of the quarter we completed construction on a ali i and began welcoming residents to their new homes in october as of november two we closed on 495 units totaling 332 million in net revenue revenue that will be recognized on our fourth quarter income statement and will contribute meaningly to our bottom line with that i d like to now hand the call over to our cfo correne loeffler who will review our third quarter financial performance correne s loeffler chief financial officer thank you jay the results of the third quarter clearly demonstrates the strength of our business as we continue to benefit from the strong demand throughout our communities across the country in summary our mpcs produced 54 1 million of earnings before tax or ebt during the third quarter a 22 decrease compared to the last quarter and a 48 increase compared to the prior year period it s important to note that while ebt decreased from the last quarter it was largely attributed to nonrecurring costs such as the early extinguishment of debt upon the retirement of our woodlands and bridgeland credit facility in addition the top line only declined slightly due to the lack of commercial land sales in summerlin compared to the last quarter our operating assets recorded a 62 9 million of noi when including the contribution from the three woodlands based hotels which represented a 9 increase compared to the last quarter and a 65 increase compared to the prior year period as dave touched on earlier the strong performance was due to a continued improvement across our retail portfolio a strong minor league season at our ballpark robust lease up activity at our multifamily assets and the roll off of free rent at select office assets at ward village we contracted 316 condo units which were made up of 61 units from our three towers under construction and 255 units at the park which launched presales during the quarter combined sales at a ali i koula and victoria place were up 36 compared to the prior quarter and increased 154 compared to the prior year period finally at the seaport we recorded a 3 6 million loss in noi resulting in a 19 improvement over the last quarter and a 43 improvement compared to the prior year period taking a look at gaap earnings for the third quarter we reported net income of 4 1 million or 0 07 per diluted share compared to net income of 139 7 million or 2 51 per diluted share in the prior year period the decrease in net income from the prior year was attributed to a onetime noncash gain of 267 5 million for the third quarter of 2020 which was related to the deconsolidation of our 110 north wacker office tower in chicago if we remove this onetime gain our quarterly earnings were substantially higher than our prior year period due to strong activity to play throughout the entire business with only one quarter remaining to finish out the full year we remain on track to meet or exceed all previously disclosed guidance targets for 2021 as david mentioned earlier our mpc segment has done particularly well which has led us to raise our ebt target for the second time this year our previous guidance range for 2021 was 210 million to 230 million we are now raising our guidance by 60 million at the midpoint thus revising our range to 275 million to 285 million as we are expecting a strong end to the year given the recovery we are experiencing in our operating assets we are raising our full year noi guidance by 5 million to a range of 200 million to 210 million we are raising this segment s guidance despite the fact that we will not receive any hospitality related noi during the fourth quarter as we just sold our woodlands hotels in september for 252 million the sale of these assets generated 120 million of net proceeds and brings our total net proceeds from noncore asset sales to 376 million since the announcement of our strategic transformation plan in late 2019 we are also revising our full year condo profit guidance at ward village by 7 5 million at the midpoint our previous guidance range for 2021 was 100 million to 125 million with elevated condo sales following the completion of a ali i in october we are expecting condo profits to range between 115 million to 125 million please note that this target excludes the 20 million repair cost incurred at waiea during the first quarter which we fully expect to be reimbursed for lastly we remain on track to meet our previously disclosed g a guidance of 80 million to 85 million for 2021 now let s take a look at our balance sheet for the quarter we ended the third quarter with 1 billion of cash on hand leaving us plenty of runway to execute on the recent capital initiatives we discussed earlier additionally we closed on several financings at attractive rates while at the same time extending our maturity profile a couple of our recent financings include two construction loans for our latest project in downtown summerlin a 75 million loan for our 1700 pavilion office development and a 59 5 million loan for our tanager echo multifamily development in addition we refinanced the woodlands and bridgeland credit facility into a new 275 million loan secured by bridgeland notes receivables and land to support future horizontal development lastly subsequent to quarter end we closed on a 250 million loan for 1201 lake robbins resulting in net proceeds of 248 million which helps elevate our overall cash position additional activity following the close of the quarter include the repayment of a ali i construction loan upon the completion of the project as jay mentioned earlier we welcomed residents in october and paid off the 230 million outstanding on this loan using proceeds from the closing of the towers we continue to push out our near term maturities and remain focused on executing new financings to support our latest development projects as well as securing long term funding for our stabilized assets please refer to our third quarter 10 q and supplemental package for additional details on this activity now i d like to turn the call back over to david for some closing remarks david r o reilly chief executive officer thank you correne we re going to open up the lines for q a but before we do i just want to hit on a few key points first we remain committed to driving our net asset value higher on a per share basis and are laser focused on closing the gap between our stock price and the true inherent value of howard hughes and the actions taken over the last quarter to deploy capital into projects that we believe will achieve outsized risk adjusted returns reflects that strategy we acquired a new fully entitled shovel ready mpc we announced the launch of three new development projects and we announced the 250 million share buyback all of these initiatives will unlock tremendous value for our shareholders in the near medium and long term second our balance sheet remains strong even after allocating capital to the various projects i just mentioned our disciplined capital allocation approach has allowed us to conserve capital and leaves us with sufficient excess liquidity to evaluate additional opportunities to further expedite growth in addition the cash flow generated by future land sales condo sales and recurring noi combined with the proceeds from our remaining noncore asset sales will only drive our cash position higher third our financial results through 2021 represents the strength of our business as we are now exceeding pre covid levels and the guidance targets we have established for the full year points to an even stronger fourth quarter ahead with that we d now like to begin the q a section of the call we will answer the first few questions that have been generated by say technology and will be read by john saxon john can you please read the first question questions and answers john saxon investor relations associate sure david our first question asked what potential material effects are expected if the woodlands township voting causes it to incorporate into a city david r o reilly chief executive officer thanks john and appreciate the question that came in from our shareholder here the biggest impacts potential impacts of incorporation in the woodlands were really safety and cost and according to multiple law enforcement experts and financial experts that if this city were to incorporate we would have compromised the security and low tax rate that has helped make the woodlands the number one place to live and that vote for incorporation was held this past tuesday on the second and i m thrilled to announce that almost 70 of the residents voted against incorporation and they saw that we don t need to fix what wasn t broke and kind of stood side by side with us as fellow residents and as the developer to maintain the woodlands as according to niche com the number one place to live john saxon investor relations associate thanks david our next question as management wants to be more focused on mpcs to accelerate developments there what activity have been done in the past and what can be done in the future in order to reach the endpoint faster l jay cross president thanks john for this one we only just reached our 11th anniversary as a company and i think as we look back i would say the results produced over that last decade have indicated a constant focus on executing quickly to meet as much market demand as possible if one looks at our operating asset portfolio we ve increased noi from 46 million in 2011 to 240 million of annualized noi today by monetizing our raw land we developed commercial assets we now own and operate several million square feet of diversified real estate in office retail and multifamily and so we re constantly focused on accelerating these development pipelines through the introduction of new product types such as medical office and single family to rent as we mentioned on today s call and we ll continue to look to see how we can expand our portfolio within our mpcs john saxon investor relations associate thanks jay for our next question how do you think about the 2 billion in nonsegment debt and does it make sense to pay down to further protect yourselves from the eventual recession correne s loeffler chief financial officer i appreciate the question just to be clear the nonsegment debt is made up of our three tranches of unsecured senior notes that we actually went out and issued last september as well as earlier this year we did that by taking advantage of the capital market s opportunities to jump in there and really be able to secure this long term debt at some attractive rates that allowed us to take out shorter term maturities that are at higher rates so net net it actually was an improvement to our overall balance sheet so we feel very comfortable with where we are today in our debt maturities and the overall levels of debt john saxon investor relations associate thank you correne now we have a couple of questions related to douglas ranch the first one do you still anticipate jdm and el dorado coming back into douglas ranch how will personnel costs be split if hhc employees are doing most of the work anything to help understand the relationship with jdm and el dorado when it comes to costs and earnings is appreciated david r o reilly chief executive officer sure it s a good question and as we announce next quarter we ll get into more details as this is a transaction that closed after the end of the quarter but big picture jdm not el dorado but jdm only has the option to reacquire 50 and they put in 34 million for their deposit to reacquire that 50 stake while i very much expect that jdm will come back in as our partner we view either scenario as favorable for hhc when it comes to personnel costs yes hhc is a managing member and will be the boots on the ground team executing there and we ll be paid to cover that overhead so it should not be a cost center for us in any way and assuming that jdm does come back in our partnership will be a 50 50 split so we ll receive 50 of the earnings 50 of the cost and the same holds true for trillium the first village of douglas ranch john saxon investor relations associate thanks david and then continuing on with douglas ranch can you discuss the challenges that water scarcity presents in phoenix and what if anything the company has done to secure water for this mpc david r o reilly chief executive officer it s a great question and we thoroughly investigated douglas ranch access to water leading up to this acquisition and announcement it was one of the main points in our diligence over the past six months there is an aquifer directly under douglas ranch that we can tap into and we have water rights for trillium along with a meaningful portion of douglas ranch already in hand and our master plan at douglas ranch is going to integrate the best in water conservation and sustainability it will be woven throughout the design and into the community from the very early stages as this is just a blank canvas under which we can put in the best processes at day one and we have experienced developing large scale master plan communities in desert environments like summerlin and those state of the art technologies will be replicated at douglas ranch summerlin was nevada s first community to implement water smart conservation guidelines and it was the earliest adopter of desert landscaping we ve gone beyond the imposed restrictions for new construction improving low water use techniques that save millions of gallons of water each year on top of that heath melton who will be the president in phoenix and run douglas ranch has led the development of bridgeland and they ve won multiple awards for integrating local ecology and low impact sustainable design and we re going to continue to work with industry experts to make sure that we are at the leading edge of sustainability and conserving all of our natural resources john saxon investor relations associate thanks david this is going to be our last question that was pre submitted through say how is the outlook for 2021 through 2022 david r o reilly chief executive officer well we re not providing guidance today for 2021 to 22 but as we announced during the call we have raised guidance across our mpcs operating assets and condos for the remainder of this year and as a result i think it s clear that we very much expect to close out 2021 with a very strong fourth quarter and i believe that this momentum will carry us into 2022 in 2022 we will begin lot sales at douglas ranch we ll continue to execute on our incredible development pipeline that jay is growing every day we re going to complete construction at koula and ward village and we will have the grand opening of the tin building at the seaport sitting here today on this call i have no reason to believe that 2022 will be nothing short of another excellent year for howard hughes in all of our segments john saxon investor relations associate thanks david all right operator we can open up the lines for those with questions on the call operator our first question is from daniel santos with piper sandler please go ahead daniel santos piper sandler analyst hey good morning everyone thank you for taking my question my first one is on 110 north wacker and apologies if you covered this during your prepared remarks but can you walk us through what the rest of the lease up for that asset looks like and when do you expect the asset to stabilize david r o reilly chief executive officer sure so we re approximately 80 leased at 110 north wacker and as you know it s anchored by bank of america and the vast majority of the building is on long term leases so we have a weighted average lease term there of over 12 years which is we think tremendous the majority of the remaining lease up space is in smaller chunks and some option space that our larger tenants have so we only have the option to build these to lease those for some shorter durations i think that given that the leasing pipeline has started to rebuild post pandemic in chicago i m hopeful that we can get some more leases done over the next quarter or two but as you know dan we re in the market with that asset and we talked about this last quarter we re hopeful to get some potential bidders on that over the next several months and be able to execute on a sale of that noncore asset as quickly as we can at the right outcome for the company and as correne highlighted with our liquidity position we re not in a rush we re going to wait for the right price not the first price daniel santos piper sandler analyst got it i appreciate that i was wondering if you could give some more color on the large pads out at summerlin there seems it s like a 13 million apartment deposit it would seem like a pretty significant sale so just any color on that would be helpful david r o reilly chief executive officer i think the best color i can give you dan is back to the remarks we made regarding the increased guidance in our mpc ebt for the remainder of the year and obviously by taking that guidance up as much as we did at the midpoint we feel very confident that there is great demand for builders for our land both in summerlin and houston and that increased guidance reflects that deposit and as well as other transactions that we believe will come in during the fourth quarter daniel santos piper sandler analyst thank you just one last one if i may over at ward village would you consider accelerating the development to maybe two towers a year just given the strong demand or do you still feel pretty comfortable with that one tower a year kind of pace david r o reilly chief executive officer well look our job is to build as quickly as we can to meet market demand and i think that while we launched one tower already this year we have the opportunity to launch a second that would not be competitive and that may be more of a workforce housing tower and then hopefully toward the early to middle of next year launch our next tower but we re thrilled with the progress i can t believe that i m sitting here only three months later after our launch in july at the percent presold that we are it s really a testament to the team and that has been with three price increases over this three month period and despite those increases demand continues to remain strong so we feel great sitting where we are we re always trying to accelerate to meet market demand if we could launch two at the exact same moment i think that may be a little bit too much but if we can get them every six to nine months instead of every 12 to 15 months that might be a way to better tap into that demand daniel santos piper sandler analyst appreciate the comments thank you operator the next question is from peter abramowitz with jefferies please go ahead l jay cross president hey peter peter abramowitz jefferies analyst hi thank you good morning how is it going l jay cross president good peter abramowitz jefferies analyst good good i just want to ask at the seaport could you give an update just on leasing prospects for some of the retail vacancies there as well as some of the office space that you have left l jay cross president thanks peter i appreciate the question clearly retail in new york city coming out of the pandemic has been impacted and we ve been impacted like so many of those other areas in the city we ve been able to backfill a lot of the vacancies the bankruptcies and those tenants that haven t survived like 10 corso como with some great new concepts like the long club and a restaurant by wylie dufresne and that s been great and those spaces are getting built out now and we re hopeful that we ll be able to open those in the next several months and then some of the other smaller spaces in the historic district we ve been able to bring in some great shorter term tenants some activations that have helped keep it alive and drive some revenue for us which has been great as we continue to look for the right long term users in that space from an office leasing perspective on the pier we are continuing to market that space and at this point we re waiting for the right tenant that s going to appreciate that space the way that we do and someone like nike and espn that sees the value of having water views on three sides and we do think that as the tin building opens next spring and the construction fence comes down and we really open up the pier to the world we re going to see that demand grow peter abramowitz jefferies analyst okay got it that s helpful and then in your office portfolio in your core mpcs what s utilization physical utilization looking like currently and kind of how is the return to work that s slowly happening how is that impacting some of the vacancies that you re looking to lease up in your office portfolio l jay cross president sure so we re like most markets we re seeing utilization rates picking up every week every day and sitting here in houston i can tell you that there are more and more cars in the parking lots here on a daily basis and that s great and the leasing velocity here in houston has continued to grow as well and probably three quarters ago peter i would have told you that we were talking to tenants that were 5000 to 10000 square feet and a quarter or two ago we started working on some full floor deals here which are the 20000 to 30000 square feet and now the tenants that are touring are even larger in size so we see that momentum continuing to grow here in houston in vegas it really never stopped because our two office buildings there are entirely full in addition to the two buildings that are 100 leased to aristocrat and our new construction 1700 has over 50 of the building under loi already so that pipeline has been great and in columbia a very similar story in that 10 through 70 continues to perform very very well one and two merriweather are basically entirely full and we re working on a deal as we speak that hopefully will take the balance of 6100 so we re feeling very good on the office leasing front as that momentum continues to gain steam coming out of the pandemic and folks get back to the office peter abramowitz jefferies analyst got it and are you able to quantify kind of what physical utilization is is that something like 40 or is it closer to 60 or 80 l jay cross president i would say it s between 50 and 60 but it depends on the building it depends on the market if we have a building that has a tenant for 50 and they re not back to the office yet clearly that building is not in that same range but in general across our portfolio i d say it s in the 50 to 60 peter abramowitz jefferies analyst okay got it that s helpful and then final one for me could you just are you able to quantify kind of the yields that you re underwriting to on the single family for rent and the medical office product and then for the medical office building is that something you view as a long term hold or is that something you could develop and then look to take advantage of the depth of private market demand l jay cross president i d say well as we start construction on those projects and they get into the supplemental the yields and stabilization dates and expected timing will all be thoroughly disclosed i think it s safe to say that with any new development that we re doing we re trying to achieve those outsized risk adjusted returns and develop a yield well in excess of underlying cap rates and for these projects you should expect nothing different than what we ve done in the past for the past 11 years in terms of medical office as a core hold i think for those buildings that are the multi tenant users that are synergistic with having a dominant market share that s something that we want to continue to hold i think the unique situations where we have a build to suit for m d anderson for a very unique use like a cancer treatment center versus a traditional medical office that presents a different opportunity for us to create value peter abramowitz jefferies analyst got it that i s all for me thank you l jay cross president thanks operator the next question is from vahid khors and with bws financial please go ahead vahid khorsand bws financial analyst hi good morning thanks for taking my question first question david you were talking about in texas the properties there the mpc that the homebuilder sentiment not necessarily sentiment i guess but their supply issues and their build out issues whereas in summerlin there seems to be a difference could you just talk a little bit about why summerlin is seeing a different homebuilding era right now versus woodlands and bridgeland david r o reilly chief executive officer so i would say that woodlands and bridgeland compared to summerlin has some similarities and those supply constraints that they re seeing and whether it s front doors or windows or appliances have been very consistent there have been also some meaningful differences as well in that one in summerlin we re selling superpads whereas in bridgeland woodland hills and woodlands we sell lots so therefore the lead time for a builder is much longer when they buy a superpad and therefore they re buying their superpads today for those home sales out into the future versus buying a lot today to sell that home tomorrow so their appetite remains strong because they re buying a little bit further into the future the other big difference in the two has been just the weather and that it has been so wet this summer in houston that it has slowed down our ability to deliver lots to builders by about three months and the approval and permitting process has been backlogged because there is a rush to supply lots we re at an all time low in terms of developed lots on the ground for builders and we re in a sub eight month supply across the region and in the far northwest where bridgeland sits that supply is below six months so we re working hard and trying to get caught up but the weather has put us behind some of the approvals have put us behind and there is a tremendous demand from the builders we just have to expedite our delivery to meet that demand vahid khorsand bws financial analyst so in the same vein i think i brought this up when you first brought up the idea of single family rental homes in bridgeland has there been any pushback from the homebuilders or is there so much demand that just 200 something i think it was 200 something homes doesn t really make that much of an impact david r o reilly chief executive officer no there s been no pushback from the builders and i think that if you look at some of the public builders they re actually either working directly or in venture to get into this business because they see what we see which is the home renter is not the same person as the home buyer and it s not necessarily directly competitive it s meeting a segment of the market that is not necessarily a home buyer because it s a nearby issue or it s a temporary job or someone who doesn t have a deposit but there is a meaningful component of the population out there that is looking for a single family for rent option that is not necessarily looking at it instead of a home purchase vahid khorsand bws financial analyst okay and then my last question it s about ward village and i think the part i don t see an income type of building category like i know in victoria place s ultra luxury and koula is upscale but as you re now seeing this extra demand that you re seeing is coming in and prices going higher do you are you entitled or is there any limitations on maybe the next one being workforce versus ultra luxury or do you have the freedom to just go ultra luxury if that s where the market is david r o reilly chief executive officer so other we have a limitation that 20 of the units need to be workforce and the first portion of that was met with ke kilohana and we expect our next tower that we re working on right now to meet the remaining requirement for all workforce housing other than that our ability to build is up to us and we can do ultra luxury upscale moderate wherever we see the deepest pockets of market demand and for us if we re able to have a balance in the type of product we re delivering between the first second and third row we can hit the widest potential pocket of demand the most potential buyers that are out there in the market and accelerate the value creation as fast as we can vahid khorsand bws financial analyst got it thank you very much david r o reilly chief executive officer good operator the next question is from alex barron with housing research center please go ahead alex barron housing research center analyst thank you and good morning great job on the quarter david r o reilly chief executive officer alex barron housing research center analyst i wanted to ask a question on the new phoenix mpc i think you indicated you could sell about 1000 lots in the first year wondering if you could give more specifics on what quarter do you think those first sales would happen and is there any guidance you can offer as far as approximate price of those lots is it in the 75000 or 100000 what s the approximate range david r o reilly chief executive officer so when we announced the transaction alex we said that we expected to transact on at least 1000 lots in the first half of next year and that s probably about as granular as i can get at this point in time but i feel very good that we re going to be able to get that done in the first half and we had talked on our announcement the douglas ranch call at about that 70000 to 75000 range per lot but that will depend on lot size and density etc depending on which neighborhood again we really focus on price per acre we think that s kind of a great equalizer in terms of the variability in terms of lot size and density alex barron housing research center analyst okay and when you say that 1000 in the first half is that meant to imply that in the second half there could be nothing or you just don t have enough visibility in other words i m trying to get a sense of is it going to be consistent sales every quarter pretty much or is it going to be more spotty kind of like the way summerlin works where you sell a big pad of land and then maybe nothing for a few quarters david r o reilly chief executive officer yes i think that you could expect it to be a little bit more lumpy i think all of our land sale business is lumpy but i would expect that we would work hard in phoenix and at douglas ranch to use the same methodology that we use in summerlin which we think creates the most value for the company and that does create a little bit more lumpiness in the results but it drives much better cash flow to howard hughes so i would expect that if we re able to transact at those 1000 lots in the first half of next year we might not sell much more for the remainder of the year and 1000 lots is a meaningful amount of supply for a new community just getting started and if you think of summerlin selling 1400 homes last year or bridgeland selling about 900 homes last year to be in a position where we could do 1000 a year as our first year as a new community is exciting but that s a lot so to think that we could do 1000 lots every six months i think is a little bit aggressive for community s first year in existence alex barron housing research center analyst right well the good news is that market is pretty land constrained so i think you ll find plenty of demand from builders david r o reilly chief executive officer we agree with you wholeheartedly alex alex barron housing research center analyst yes you guys got a good deal there second question is on the hawaii condos so congratulations on the first closings on time in a ali i can you give us a sense on koula and on victoria place and on this new part ward village what are the expected closing dates on those three towers david r o reilly chief executive officer so we expect to close koula at the end of next year and then victoria place should be about a year after that alex barron housing research center analyst okay david r o reilly chief executive officer now the park which we just started presales on in july we haven t started construction yet so until we have a construction start date it s tough for me to pin down a closing date or completion date because again we don t start construction until we re 50 presold which we re almost there basically there and so we have a construction loan in process which we don t have yet for the park and a gmp from our contractor which we don t have yet every time we start a new tower there s a great internal race between our construction team and the sales team in terms of who can get done first 50 presold or gmp contract and our sales team has won i think for the last four towers in a row which is great news for us we love that but we do want to make sure that we are prudent and thoughtful before we start construction that we have our costs completely buttoned down and we have financing in place so that we can deliver that project with the appropriate amount of equity alex barron housing research center analyst makes sense and on this park ward village can you give us a sense of where the price is some type of price range for that condo tower david r o reilly chief executive officer so the park ward village is directly across from the victoria ward park from koula so it is a second row tower with great sweeping views right behind victoria place and i think that you should expect pricing there to be a little bit higher than koula but perhaps not as high as victoria place in the front row and the passage of time and appreciation that we ve seen in ward village has allowed us to make sure every time we sell that next front row project or that next second row project we ve been able to achieve a meaningful premium from the last one alex barron housing research center analyst okay thanks a lot and best of luck david r o reilly chief executive officer thank you i appreciate it operator this concludes our question and answer session i would like to turn the conference back over to david o reilly for any closing remarks david r o reilly chief executive officer thank you again for joining us today hopefully we ll see a lot of you at our upcoming conference schedule and roadshow and if there s any questions between now and then we re always available to help thank you again talk soon operator duration 58 minutes call participants john saxon

greaney minn beryl novak bought 40 acres of forest here in 1966 for 700 eventually moved an old one room shack to the site for a deer hunting cabin and then liked it so much he moved in for good that was 1977 he hasn t lived anyplace else since he hasn t slept in any other bed not a single night away since may 1993 i m kind of a homebody novak said he also hasn t hunted deer anywhere else and on saturday morning nov 6 novak will be in his favorite deer stand a 5 by 8 foot tarpaper shack with a slide up window where odds are he will see some deer whether or not he gets a legal buck will be up to the fates of course much like the other nearly half million minnesota hunters out and about but don t bet against him advertisement beryl novak the stand is just 50 yards from his house about an hour s drive north of hibbing overlooking a mowed clearing with a backdrop of spruce and balsam about 140 yards out he has shot dozens of deer from this spot most with his trusty 270 winchester some of them just minutes into the first morning of the season the annual deer hunt has become part of his life s routine a rhythm that revolves around nature s seasons things like putting up firewood tending his big garden planting and grafting dozens of apple trees and walking hundreds of miles each autumn in search of grouse already this season he s bagged two dozen grouse by walking slowly watching and listening on forest trails beryl novak walks past a deer rub while grouse hunting monday nov 1 2021 steve kuchera duluth news tribune but it hasn t been easy i figure it s about 5 miles walking for each bird he said as we walked and talked in his woods shotguns at the ready on a brisk november morning we flushed a couple grouse that day but didn t get any shots advertisement over the years living out here novak has had close calls with wolves and has battled with bears but it all seems to come in stride for an outdoorsman who doesn t rattle easily who seemingly has seen and done everything the northwoods has to offer started young novak 71 shot his first deer at age 10 in 1960 hunting alone he still has the paper hunting license and aluminum buck tag pressed between pages in a photo album since then novak figures he s shot 75 deer in these woods northwest of cook beryl novak still has his deer license and tag from 1960 steve kuchera duluth news tribune he has a memory like a steel trap and rattles off dates and antler counts from hunting seasons a half century ago like they happened yesterday novak was born and raised in this country and graduated from orr high school in 1968 he liked cars of course and girls but his passion has always been the outdoors hunting fishing and trapping my dad died when i was 5 novak said but i had a mentor teach me grouse hunting joe kasun when i was 7 he gave me a single shot 22 to use and one 22 short bullet and took me grouse hunting and told me not to miss i got one deer hunting though i had to figure out on my own advertisement and he has a 10 year old beryl novak poses with the buck he shot in 1960 contributed beryl novack novak attended a vocational college and then with a low draft number looming enlisted in the u s air force and stayed in for nearly four years from 1970 74 he was stationed at several bases across the u s and spent eight months in vietnam at the 483rd usaf hospital at cam ranh bay where the base would come under occasional rocket attack and where he saw the horrors of war firsthand with a parade of wounded on display through his military service he would come home on leave scheduled around hunting seasons i came home to hunt he said it s what i thought about when i was over there related a northwoods living novak s one room home is 16 by 20 feet what city folks these days might call a tiny house it has no running water there s a hand pump outside a few steps an outhouse of course and a sauna shed too advertisement i don t have to worry about pipes freezing novak quipped it s an armstrong pump a big barrel wood stove heats the place when it s cold and novak has a few seasons worth of fuel stacked neatly outside there s a gas range for cooking a bed in the corner and a small tv that gets three stations over the airwaves beryl novak talks with a visitor in his one room cabin monday nov 1 2021 steve kuchera duluth news tribune why would you need any more than that everything on tv is all so damned depressing anyway novak said there s a 2017 calendar on the door still next to a reminder note for next year s dental appointment dusty cds and dvds and piles of outdoor and gardening magazines cover much of the kitchen table a few old buck antlers trophies from long past seasons are stashed in the corner a few mounted fish adorn the walls antlers from past hunts lay on a table in beryl novak s cabin monday nov 1 2021 steve kuchera duluth news tribune advertisement novak worked the usual northwoods jobs over the years including as a logger and then on a sand and gravel crew he trapped and sold furs beaver otter fisher and pine marten until the bottom dropped out of the fur market and prices plummeted he picked wild blueberries and sold them to grocery stores in town he cut and sold balsam boughs and firewood for a spell too novak formally retired in 1995 meaning that s the point he stopped trying to earn a living and focused on the living part there wasn t anyone left calling me who i wanted to talk to people would say but we can t get ahold of you and i d say that s the point beryl novak it doesn t cost much to live up here i get by pretty cheap he said it s not that he doesn t like people novak said just that he found it hard always trying to get along you can t satisfy people so i said the hell with it and here i am he said adding that he doesn t consider himself a hermit i get visitors just not as many as i used to everyone is dying off beryl novak unloads his shotgun outside the one room cabin he s lived in since 1977 after a grouse hunt monday nov 1 2021 steve kuchera duluth news tribune advertisement his last car broke down in 2005 and he hasn t driven one since although he does have a four wheel atv that can get him the mile or so down the road to another 43 acre parcel he owns and hunts on he keeps mowed trails on his land that attract deer grouse and other wildlife and make for easy walking he has planted hundreds of apple plum and pine trees along the trails novak depends on the kindness of a few friends and neighbors to get him to his annual doctor and dental checkups or to bring him fresh food on occasion in return he shares crops from his garden or maybe a cleaned and packaged grouse breast he stocks up on provisions in town a few times each year most everything else he grows or shoots on his own conservation officers occasionally add to his larder by dropping off an illegally killed deer this year s drought cut into his sweet corn crop but his melons onions and carrots did well with him carrying water from the pump a late may hard freeze crippled novak s apple crop though nipping the buds it s the first time i ve ever had a total failure for apples he noted his last dog died eight years ago and he s not planning to get another i didn t feel it was right to have a dog and not have a way to get him to the vet he said it s bad enough for people to have to take me to the doctor s but it s too much to ask someone else to take my dog to the vet simplifying life at his annual checkup in august in hibbing doctors proclaimed novak perfectly fit he takes no medications and goes years between suffering a cold or the flu because he doesn t mix in crowds and novak noted that he has been perfectly situated to guard against the covid 19 pandemic i ve been social distancing out here for 20 years he said beryl novak checks one of several deer stands he has near his home monday nov 1 2021 steve kuchera duluth news tribune sometimes he goes weeks even months without leaving his home area during one stretch between october 2020 and february 2021 he went 134 days without leaving more than four months between trips to cook just 25 miles away i didn t have any reason i had to go he said he hasn t shaved or had a haircut since 2001 when he grew it out to spite his mom who had been nagging him about his appearance she s long since passed but he still hasn t relented i don t have to live to suit anyone else he said his shoulder length hair falls out a lot it doesn t get that long novak cut off his landline service in 1995 tired of telemarketers and went 20 years without a telephone there wasn t anyone left calling me who i wanted to talk to novak said people would say but we can t get ahold of you and i d say that s the point in spring 2015 a neighbor whose hunting land he keeps watch on gave him an inexpensive cellphone to report problems on he got me one new one since and he s still paying the bills novak said it s definitely not a smartphone he has no computer no email and no facebook it s as if the last 25 years of technology have passed him by and it s clear he doesn t care as long as he has his rifle and shotgun and is fit to walk in the woods he s happy beryl novak poses with the eight point buck he shot in 1977 the first year he lived in his one room cabin contributed beryl novack novak keeps a tattered dog eared paperback of henry david thoreau s essays on the virtues of self reliant backwoods living near his bed it s become a sort of guidebook for his lifestyle it might even be in his pocket on saturday for the deer opener if people would read what thoreau wrote in the 1800s it might help them today novak said simplify your life that s what i ve done people out there working to make more money are just chasing their tails john

financial results at this point i will turn the call over to jon jon serbousek director president and chief executive officer thank you alexa welcome everyone and thank you for joining our third quarter 2021 results conference call on today s call i ll provide an update of our third quarter performance i will then review each of our strong progress we ve made against each of our strategic initiatives before handing the call over to doug who will provide our financial update i ll close with our perspectives on the balance of 2021 before opening the line for questions starting with our third quarter performance total revenue in the quarter was 112 4 million growing about 1 over 2020 on both a reported and constant currency basis during the quarter we experienced the negative impacts of hospital restrictions on elective and complex procedures and hospital staff shortages in each u s key geographies namely the southeast mid atlantic and south central regions however despite these covid 19 challenges we were able to grow relative to 2020 highlighted by double digit growth in both our global spinal implants in orthopedic businesses our performance in the quarter was aided by our diversified portfolio that includes therapies and sites of service less impacted by covid as well as our international footprint that includes areas beginning to recover from covid restrictions despite these disruptions in the third quarter we made solid progress against all of our growth initiatives and remain confident in the investments we have made and will continue to make in product development commercial channel and operational excellence now let s turn to the performance of each of our product categories starting with bone growth therapies or bgt sales for the quarter were 45 2 million down 4 compared to the third quarter of 2020 the decrease in the quarter was largely a result of increased covid 19 related restrictions affecting complex overnight procedures which are a large part of the patient population receiving bgt spine therapies these restrictions were a reversal of the positive trends we saw in the last quarter the decline in the quarter for spine procedures was offset by somewhat by 13 growth in our physiostim our bone healing therapy for non union of long bone fractures our commercial channel investments are yielding benefits in these non elective trauma segments moving to spinal implants which includes spine fixation and motion preservation revenue was up over 10 on both a reported and constant currency basis compared to 2020 this growth was primarily driven by u s m6 artificial cervical disk and international spine fixation sales in the u s gains were led by the m6 disk revenue driven by our continued success in attracting new users as a result of our ongoing education and training efforts internationally growth was driven primarily by a mix of new distributors coming online and existing stocking distributors reinvesting following covid delays turning to our biologics portfolio revenue was down 16 compared to 2020 the decrease was not surprising given that a large percentage of the procedures where our biologics products are used are complex elective procedures requiring multi day hospital stays and these procedures were impacted by restrictions in key u s covid affected geographies mentioned prior this decrease was partially offset by the increase in new customers driven by new distribution and strong early adoption of new technologies lastly moving to our global orthopedics business sales were up 14 on a reported basis and 12 on a constant currency basis over 2020 the increase was primarily due to the rebound in the international markets from covid restrictions and reorders from international stocking distributors following covid elective delays during the third quarter we also saw a solid contribution from the fitbone limb lengthening system with over a 30 sequential growth over the second quarter of 2021 and encouraging physician training trends with over 180 surgeons trained since the acquisition of this technology platform before providing an update on our key initiatives i want to share how excited we are to have wayne burris join our board of directors he brings over 35 years of experience in u s and international finance from various diagnostics pharma and orthopedic businesses mr burris spent much of his med tech career at roche diagnostics where he served in a number of executive roles including cfo of north america from 1996 through his retirement in 2019 we are excited to add someone with his financial and business leadership experience and we look forward to working with him for years to come now moving to our first initiative product innovation and differentiation during the quarter we made solid progress in our efforts to develop and acquire products and procedure solutions to address unmet needs in the marketplace since january 2020 we have launched 23 spine and orthopedic products which include expansions into key product categories during the quarter within spinal implants we expanded our firebird si 3d offering by launching new implant and instrument additions in this high growth market segment further improving our differentiated mif solution designed to compress and stabilize the sacroiliac joint within biologics we expanded our portfolio with the full market launch of our opus mg set an osteoconductive injectable scaffold to fill non structural bony voids or gaps during orthopedic fracture care or trauma surgery applications i will now touch on our second initiative underway commercial channel development for this initiative we are focused on our u s channels for biologics spinal implants orthopedics and working to make these channels as dedicated and predictable as our bgt channel in q3 our u s strategic channel partners which we define as distribution partners that commit to orthofix and carry both hardware and biologics generated over one third of our spinal implants biologics and orthopedics u s revenue revenue related to these strategic distribution partner has grown 9 when compared to the current third quarter as compared to third quarter of 2019 despite being mostly in the heavily impacted covid regions our investment in these channels is ongoing we have made steady progress in this initiative to date our final initiative is operational execution given the recent regional occurrences of covid 19 our global supply chain remains our top priority our goal is to make our company as nimble as possible with efficient structures and processes that encourage product innovation our success in securing a future supply of microchips for our bone growth therapies devices in light of the continued disruption of global supply chain highlights the improvements we have made in our operational execution there will always be continuous improvement in operational efficiency and we intend to adapt as needed to keep up with the changing macro environments and build value within orthofix i m very pleased with our results in the quarter despite the return of covid 19 in certain geographies we ve kept moving forward with our transformation laying the groundwork for long term growth and innovation while maintaining operational execution we re excited to build on that momentum as we approach year end with that i ll turn the call over to doug to review our financial performance doug doug rice chief financial officer thanks jon and good morning everyone i will provide some additional details into our net sales and earnings results and then discuss some of our other financial measures because many of the financial measures covered in today s call are on a non gaap basis please refer to today s earnings release for further information regarding our non gaap reconciliations and disclosures starting with revenue as jon mentioned total net sales in the quarter were 112 million up 1 on a reported basis and on a constant currency basis when compared to the third quarter of 2020 in the u s total net sales of 86 million for the third quarter were down 4 over the third quarter of 2020 mainly due to hospital restrictions on elective procedures offset by u s m6 c growth that jon mentioned earlier international total sales of 26 million were up 25 as reported over the third quarter of 2020 reflecting the growth from our fitbone limb lengthening system as well as strong sales to stocking distributors gross margin in the third quarter of 2021 was 75 compared to 76 in the prior year period the decrease was primarily due to sales mix and a short term increase in electrical procurement costs due to the global microchip shortage offset somewhat by decreased non cash inventory reserves for the full year 2021 we now expect gross margin to be approximately 75 to 76 which reflects the continued impact of the changes in our sales mix as well as an expected short term increase in microchip costs as a result of the global microchip shortage sales and marketing expenses in the third quarter of 2021 were 50 of net sales up from 48 in the third quarter of 2020 the increase was primarily a result of the timing of three major trade shows in the third quarter of 2021 that did not take place in person in 2020 as well as an increase in travel expenses as anticipated spending in the third quarter was more in line with our pre covid levels in 2021 we still expect sales and marketing to approximate our year to date average of 48 5 of net sales as travel and event spending has seen a return in line with historical spend and as we invest further in our commercial channel gaap g a expenses in the third quarter of 2021 were 15 of net sales right in line with the prior year period as a reminder spending levels in the third quarter of 2020 reflected several cost savings measures including 401 k math suspension a travel freeze and a pause in investment spending offset by succession related expenses in 2020 gaap r d expenses for the third quarter increased to 11 of net sales up from 9 in the prior year period the increase reflects spending to support new product development clinical studies fitbone integration expense as well as costs associated with our eu mdr compliance efforts we will continue to ramp up our efforts to drive organic innovation and differentiation invest in clinical studies such as rotator cuff and our m6 c two level indication study and continued spend to build a robust product pipeline in both spine and orthopedics as a reminder this was causing our r d spending as a percent of net sales to significantly outpace revenue growth in the near term due to the timing of certain expenses we now expect 2021 gaap r d expense to be approximately 11 of net sales including an impact of about 175 basis points related directly to our eu mdr compliance efforts for which we adjust within our non gaap financial metrics adjusted ebitda in the third quarter decreased to 11 9 million or 11 of sales compared to 19 7 million in the third quarter of 2020 driven by the investments we ve made in r d related to product development and clinical trials as well as increased spend in marketing trade shows as they return to in person our cards have also increased with the changes in our sales mix and the expected short term increase and microchip costs we mentioned all of these investments in temporary increases during our second quarter call so the reduction in adjusted ebitda is in line with our expectations now turning to tax we had gaap income tax benefit for the quarter of 400 000 or 14 of loss before income taxes as compared to gaap income tax rate of 12 of income before income taxes in the same period of 2020 the primary factors affecting tax rate for the third quarter of 2021 were the financial expenses not recognized for tax purposes related to the acquisition related remeasurement as well as losses in certain foreign subsidiaries for which we did not recognize a tax benefit for our non gaap results we continue to use 27 as our adjusted long term effective tax rate which normalizes for acquisition related expenses certain law changes and operating losses that have no gaap tax benefit for the third quarter of 2021 we reported gaap loss of 0 11 per share as compared to gaap earnings of 0 24 per share in the third quarter of 2020 after adjusting for certain items and when normalizing for tax using our non gaap long term effective tax rate adjusted earnings for the third quarter of 2021 was 0 10 per share compared to an adjusted earnings per share of 0 31 in the third quarter of 2020 the decrease was primarily driven by the increased short term expenses due to the global microchip shortage increased r d spend to drive organic innovation and differentiation and increased travel and marketing trade show spend regarding cash we continue to maintain a strong liquidity position with 83 million at the end of the third quarter of 2021 compared to 81 million at the end of the second quarter of 2021 we currently have no borrowings outstanding under our 300 million senior secured revolving credit facility we commenced repayment of the 14 million 2020 medicare advance in the second quarter the balance as of september 30 2021 is about 8 million we still expect the repayment to be substantially complete by early q2 next year net cash provided by operating activities was an inflow of 6 4 million in the quarter down 15 5 million compared to an inflow of 21 9 million in the third quarter of last year primarily due to the recruitment of the 2020 medicare advance inventory investments this quarter and the savings in 2020 related to the cost reduction initiatives such as the 401 k math suspension travel freezes and conferences only being held virtually capital expenditures were 3 million in the quarter compared to 3 4 million in the prior year period due primarily to the timing spend for instruments to support our future growth plans we now expect capex to be in the 19 million to 21 million range for 2021 the decrease over prior guidance is due to the timing of the deployment of instrument sets and the implementation dates of certain projects consistent with our decreased operating cash flow our free cash flow which we define as cash flow from operations minus capex was a 3 4 million inflow during the quarter which was down from an 18 5 million inflow in the third quarter of 2020 as anticipated our free cash flow has decreased significantly in 2021 compared to 2020 due to several items including the repayment of the medicare advance additional investments in our sales channels and product innovation to support our future growth and the spinal kinetics milestone payment as well as increased spending on the eu mdr compliance efforts i ll now turn the call back over to jon jon serbousek director president and chief executive officer thanks doug looking to the remainder of 2021 we remain highly focused on our three near term growth drivers including m6 c fitbone and our comprehensive spinal interbody portfolio i d like to provide a quick update on each of these growth drivers starting with m6 c artificial cervical disk demand for m6 s innovative motion preservation technology continues to grow as evidenced by over 1 000 u s surgeons we have trained since the launch in 2019 and the recently surpassed milestone of 60 000 global m6 c implants we remain confident that our ability to attract and onboard new surgeons as well as support expanded utilization by existing surgeons will allow us to expand the market and take market share to drive growth for the foreseeable future from a u s indication expansion perspective we are progressing the m6 c two level clinical trial which remains on track sites are actively enrolling and we expect to continue to initiate additional sites for both the m6 c investigational and concurrent acdf control study arms we are also recently kicked off a real world evidence study that will access over 3 000 patients and bolster our body of clinical evidence in support of m6 the second key near term growth driver is fitbone we have made quick progress in commercializing the fitbone system with the third quarter revenue contribution of 2 million as compared to 800 000 in the third quarter of 2020 early demand has been strong with over 180 surgeons trained since the acquisition the majority of whom are located outside the u s a key differentiator and growth opportunity for fitbone is its adult and pediatric labeling which no other intramedullary limb lengthening solution has in early september we announced the first u s pediatric patient implanted with fitbone for the femur and tibia given the current limited options available for pediatric surgeons and the clinical performance of the fitbone system e expect to see accelerated adoption and use as more surgeons are trained the third key near term growth driver is our technology leading interbody portfolio overall we believe we have one of the most comprehensive interbody portfolios in the industry with technology offering spanning peak ptc and now 3d printed titanium materials all 3d printed titanium designs incorporate our innovative nanovate technology and optimize design porosity and surface that allows bone to grow on into and through the device we are seeing accelerated adoption of these technologies with strong performance of our forza xp expandable plif tlif cage and our new construx mini titanium 3 d printed cervical interbody product which we expect to see continued focus in the future in addition to a number of exciting near term growth opportunities we also have slipped kinds of our business and we believe will drive growth over the medium and long term periods first is expanding our commitment to the bone growth stimulation market the second is the expansion of the fitbone technology platform from limb lengthening to spinal deformities third is our spinal fixation platform expansion in the areas of posterior cervical mis anterior column support and deformity correction and last is the focused expansion of our biologics portfolio offering i want to highlight two key updates on these initiatives the progression of our bgt portfolio as part of our igea partnership and the launch of new biologics products as announced during the second quarter we entered into a partnership with igea to commercialize a portfolio of stimulation devices in the u s as part of this we recently submitted a pma application to the fda for the approval of accelstim bone healing therapy a low intensity pulsed ultrasound product for the healing of fresh fractures and non union fractures upon approval this will expand our bone growth therapies portfolio and complement our current pemf technologies that focus on non union fractures and spinal treatments positioning us as a leader in regenerative bone healing technology the initial market release is expected during the second half of 2022 within biologics our goal is to have a comprehensive offering of biologics products and solutions for surgeons to use with our spine and orthopedic procedures with the recent additions of opus mg set bonvoy pillar and fiberfuse strip which we launched in partnership with mtf biologics we have meaningfully bolstered our portfolio which we believe will not only support the top line growth of our biologics segment but will also help drive incremental pull through of our spine and orthopedics hardware offerings now shifting to guidance for the full year 202 we now expect top line revenue to be in the range of 460 million to 464 million which includes approximately 1 million in fx rate headwinds since our last guidance update this range assumes modest seasonality disruption due to the continued covid impact throughout portions of the u s and certain european markets we now expect our adjusted ebitda to be in the range of 57 million to 58 million and our adjusted earnings per share is expected to be between 0 71 and 0 75 using a non gaap long term tax rate of 27 despite an increase in covid 19 pressure on procedures across the business that we have experienced we continue our transformation concentrating on executing against not only our short term but long term goals of providing physicians with innovative products and solutions to care for their patients we made significant progress already and expect to continue to do so in the last quarter of this year and beyond in closing and with enduring gratitude i would like to thank our worldwide team for all their hard work resiliency adaptability and commitment to delivering our patient centric mission with that i d like to transition to the question and answer session operator please open the lines questions and answers operator thank you your first question comes from mathew blackman with stifel mathew blackman stifel analyst good morning everybody thanks for taking my questions three questions maybe to start reflecting on the quarter is there a way to quantify how much covid impacted 3q results and is there also a way to maybe tease out how much of that headwind was volume based versus let s call it mix headwinds jon serbousek director president and chief executive officer hey matt this is jon thank you very much for the question what we look at as far as the volume base is we re seeing the same macroenvironment that everyone else is in the marketplace and those volumes are basically in the mid to single mid to high digit double digit rate single digit rate excuse me and so with that we bring our technology forward in that area and we adapt as far as what are the site application for those procedures we saw restrictions greater in the hospital on large multilevel procedures which impacted not only our biologics or our bgt business in the long term but on the asc or the same day surgery activity we saw more volume increase there so it s a mix story between type of procedure and the covid impact mathew blackman stifel analyst all right i appreciate that and i don t know if you re willing to comment on sort of how october played out but if so how does that fit with what s sort of baked into the 4q guide as we think about covid headwinds and some of the persisting staffing headwinds and then how should we think about deferred procedure recapture cadence is it fourth quarter will bleed into the first half of 2022 just help us think through that and then i have just one follow up on a product jon serbousek director president and chief executive officer yes let me start with the covid impact we saw covid impact august and september we believe it peaked toward the back half of september and started to come reside into october which we re still with it and we re going to see it through the fourth quarter and how it impacts ourselves we ve taken those into accommodations with our views forward when it comes to procedural reallocation we know that those larger cases those multilevel cases those more revision cases are out there those patients want to be cared for the surgeons want to do those cases and take care of those patients and the hospitals want to provide those cases so we know they re out there how they come back into will be dependent upon how open hospitals are and that s also a regional discussion because there are we ve highlighted there were certain regions in the u s that are being more heavily impacted in the third quarter we re also seeing some other dynamics as far as lifting in some of the northern states some more reemergence of covid so it s going to be a region by region case by case basis the good news is in the international markets that we ve seen more of a level setting more of a stability of those covid cases and so we re seeing a little bit more predictable business in the international markets so as we look forward in the quarter we ve accommodated through those dynamics in our view mathew blackman stifel analyst all right i appreciate that and i ll sneak this last one in could you just remind us of the opportunity maybe addressable market opportunity with accelstim and as we think about sort of primarily 2023 2023 and beyond what kind of impact could it have on segment growth thanks so much appreciate it jon serbousek director president and chief executive officer yeah thank you matt accelstim when we looked at that market in the u s we were up around 100 million of the market opportunity and we ll launch this in the second half of 2022 based on all the variabilities we ll deal with the fda that s our prediction as far as what we know as the fda works but i think we have a good commission going in and so how we look at that as far as it s a portfolio for us we have a very strong distribution channel with bgt and as we highlighted in our remarks we saw an uptick in physiostim 16 in the quarter dealing with nonunion care and that nonunion care we looked at that as far as a portfolio and it s another piece of that activity where we can go after fresh fractures as well as nonunion care mathew blackman stifel analyst thank you so much operator your next question comes from anthony petrone with jefferies anthony petrone jefferies analyst thanks and hope everyone is doing well first question will be just sort of a macro question then i ll go into a couple of product specific questions and so maybe just kind of going through jon the themes of this quarter which certainly is still delta but also staffing shortages at hospitals and then supply chain if we could just kind of go over those three headwinds you spoke on delta maybe a little bit deeper on staffing shortages we re hearing a lot about that this quarter and then anything on the supply chain of note that may or may not be impacting orthofix and then i ll have a couple of product specific questions jon serbousek director president and chief executive officer sure thanks anthony we talked about the delta side of it and we re still in delta i mean covid delta and we see that we see more hospitals opening up and they re gradually coming back the key thing is that the surgeons are there the patients are there and the hospitals want to basically care for these patients provide care for these patients so that will come most of those people do not go away they re not getting better on their own so they re out there and how they come back in over the next month two months and into 2022 will be dependent on how those dynamics play out regarding the staffing shortages we believe they re real i will give you a real life point we had a very high volume surgeon in visiting us and he said i m back to doing the number of cases i was before however i don t know how long that s going to last because i ll start at 7 a m in the morning and where i typically would end at 3 in the afternoon it now takes me until 8 p m to finish those so i essentially burned through two shift of staffing to do what i used to do and that s anecdotal but the fact is those are the type of things we re hearing that the cases are there and the patients are there and there s a willingness to do those but with staffing shortage we also comes into that many of there s transportability in some of those that staff those nurses can go locum tenens and basically go to different parts of the country where they can make money and basically different lifestyle we re seeing that as well play out in different parts of the country as well regarding supply chain we focus on that as far as not only microchips will be highlighted but all the other materials we deal with and always make sure we have adequate supply and so we ve actually increased our inventories and touched to make sure that when the cases come back we ll have all the adequate products to basically address any needs that are put in front of us we ve also spent time working with our sales teams basically mapping out where those might occur so the supply chain can adapt and make sure the correct products are there and appropriate for those surgeries anthony petrone jefferies analyst that s helpful maybe just a quick follow up on staffing i mean if there s any if you could use your own crystal ball i mean how long do you think that particular headwind lasts and is it transient or is it maybe perhaps a couple of quarters and then on product specific questions just m6 it looks like another record quarter maybe just a little bit on the specific q over q dynamics with m6 in terms of adoption and then anything you can share as it relates on the ide for the two level indication and then i ll hop back in the queue thanks jon serbousek director president and chief executive officer crystal ball on staffing as far as it s so regionally variable i will tell you that we track it there s also we saw we ve been hearing from some of the hospital systems that some of the people have taken early retirements and those will have to fill the funnel with new nurses and hospital staff it s not just nurses either though because it comes down to its turnover in rooms and things of that nature that basically they have to find staffing for so they re struggling with it and they re doing a great job trying to accommodate for it for sure i can t tell you whether it s a quarter or two quarters i ll give you a point that we have in the uk where it was published that they re looking for 70 000 new nurses over the next four years so they re trying to basically refuel that and that s an educational process so we map all those data we look at but right now the cases are being done and i think that that s part of the reason why some of the systems have been a little stressed out there regarding m6 we ve stayed on a continual cadence as far as continual cadence as far as m6 and what it looks like is that we continue to track new surgeons we continue to track surgeons that basically want to do m6 for all of its features it s the only device out there that has six degrees of natural motion compression ability and so what it comes down to it s unique and it s naturally appealing to a surgeon because it looks like a natural disk so we track those surgeons additionally we also once the surgeon uses them we track whether they become users in fact because on multi cases we track that as well and so we re seeing a good lift in those that become not only first time users but also continue to use that product m6 has been nice because we ve been able to use not only in the hospital on same day surgery but also in asc environment and that s helped us basically continue through covid environment on the two level study we re making good progress in adding really key sites to that that s a focus for us and so we ll continue to add sites and we ll continue to basically enroll not only the study patients with m6 but also the acdf patients that we re going to collect a database that will allow them to be able to use it in the future operator your next question comes from jeffrey cohen with ladenburg thalmann jeffrey cohen ladenburg thalmann analyst good morning thanks for taking the questions just to follow up to anthony s question on timing on the m6 study what does that look like or what s your current anticipation as far as filing and a commercial launch jon serbousek director president and chief executive officer thanks for the question jeff we initiated that study in late july and it s a traditional prospective randomized study it s in a four to five year window with accelerate on our enrollment which we re basically putting good energy behind so as we map it out we can look at it in that range as far as the four to five year horizon before there i would note that we do multilevel cases throughout europe and that s part of our real world evidence plan that we put together and i highlighted so we re going to track those patients in europe and also bolster our ide with the real world evidence because we have great results in europe as well and so we look at it as standard basis and this is one of those items we want for future benefit and we re going to continue to put m6 in the market with the current indication we have and be relative there jeffrey cohen ladenburg thalmann analyst fantastic and some of that study some of the enrollment is coming out of outside the u s as opposed to the u s what s the breakdown jon serbousek director president and chief executive officer all of the enrollment for the u s ide two level is coming from the u s we have bolstered a second study of real world evidence where we re going out to collect data of patients that have already been treated with m6 outside the u s the fda allows us to bolster that ide study with real world evidence that doesn t impact our study it s a two level study per se but it just bolsters our overall portfolio clinical evidence for m6 jeffrey cohen ladenburg thalmann analyst i got it that s helpful and then for accelstim you did submit a pma for that so and what does that look like as far as timing jon serbousek director president and chief executive officer yes we did submit a pma submission to the fda and as we highlighted we project to be in the market in 2022 and that s typically pma submissions have anywhere from 180 day window to basically be reviewed and approved or basically reviewed and set for questions avoiding any secondary questions it could be six seven months from now to have the approval putting to a second round of questions it could be three months longer than that jeffrey cohen ladenburg thalmann analyst got it and then lastly for me could you talk about external fixation and specifically how those channels look for europe and how the outlook looks there jon serbousek director president and chief executive officer just on external fixation it s one of the real strong points for our orthopedics business and specifically in the u s i mean in europe i will tell you right now there s 12 surgeons being trained on external fixation in our building in our skills lab today they were just here today there s a keen interest in external fixation in a couple of different areas one in the foot and ankle area specifically for charcot most of those charcot patients get external fixation in europe it s a little different it s used not only in those patients but also in a broader trauma application and so we d use our tl hex for rings and lengthening deformity activities we also use our galaxy product for external fixation and we proceduralize those so there s a galaxy shoulder and a galaxy ankle and those are very attractive procedures for surgeons in europe and other parts of the world and so the team in europe this year is really excelling in that external fixation area jeffrey cohen ladenburg thalmann analyst got it thanks for taking our questions jon serbousek director president and chief executive officer thank you jeff operator your next question comes from jim sidoti with sidoti and company jim sidoti sidoti company analyst hi good morning and thanks again for taking the questions first one is with regard to distribution you did a really good job today laying out all the new products you have in the spine fixation and biologics and stimulation but can you talk a little bit about what changes you ve made over the past 12 to 18 months on distribution and how that s been impacted by covid and where you think that s going over the next couple of years jon serbousek director president and chief executive officer jim thanks for the question distribution channel is one of our key investment areas and drive areas let me break it down a little bit as far as us and ous in the u s we re looking to bring in strategic distributors and we re looking to bring them in not only in our spine business but in our orthopedics business strategic distributors are those that commit to orthofix to use both our fixation products and our biologics products and in doing so we invest in specific regions initially and but we re going to go broadly for all regions in u s for strategic distributors and that those people who build an organization will want to build more and more of their volume being committed to orthofix and so we track it we track it by daily basis we ve had two of them in here this week and we re looking to basically engage and there is a continual effort for not only the spine leadership and also the orthopedics leadership in the u s outside the u s we use a combination of distributors and also our subsidiaries and so we continue to invest in our subsidiaries those are company managed areas and those are the large areas in europe and so we continue to invest in distribution sales reps in those areas as well as distributors to go to different parts of the world that we may not want to set up a subsidiary so distribution channel is an area where we have our sales management keenly focused on it and bringing talent that can basically sell a broader portion or a broader array of our products jim sidoti sidoti company analyst and has covid helped you add or has that been more of a headwind in regards to distribution jon serbousek director president and chief executive officer covid has been i would say neutral it s plus or minus distributors that have an ongoing business that may not be 100 satisfied with where they re at it maybe a little bit slow to change as far as in a covid environment because they have a situation and they don t want to jump to a new situation where they ll have to bring in new products and convert their business but at the same time it gives us more time to talk to those individuals and begin to build a relationship and to build trust with those individuals because this is a it s a long term process of bringing a distributor into your organization we have a seasoned and experienced team they have great relationships throughout the industry and so we are working on both building those relationships and making those conversions on a daily to monthly basis jim sidoti sidoti company analyst and then the last one for me is on strategic investments you re calling out several million dollars a year on strategic investments can you just remind me exactly what that is is that you shopping for new deals or what else is involved in that jon serbousek director president and chief executive officer we have both organic and inorganic strategies and i highlighted some of the key features on the organic side as far as building in the spine business and also in the orthopedics business on the external side as far as inorganic we look at technology we look at tuck ins and i stated previously that we were not looking for bigger deals because we couldn t consume them but actually we re expanding our view that we could be looking for mid sized deals that could basically complement our existing portfolio and bring the channel with it as well jim sidoti sidoti company analyst and similar question with covid has that process been hindered or is it possibly more people are likely to sell as a result of covid jon serbousek director president and chief executive officer i think in the first year there were people that may have panicked a little bit and wanted to sell i don t think that s the case right now i think that the valuations are quite high and people are very proud of it i think it does allow you time to work with these companies and basically get to know them and then see and they actually want to mature their companies a little more right now before they transact but at the end of the day it s variable and we have a great team that looks at these deals and does diligence on these deals and so we combine that with our commercial teams and also our in house product teams and we have a good process going here and we look forward to being active in that space jim sidoti sidoti company analyst all right thank you operator your next question comes from david turkaly with jmp securities david turkaly jmp securities analyst thanks good morning the 100 million you mentioned for accelstim i was just curious is that fresh fractures and non unions or can you segment that at all jon serbousek director president and chief executive officer it is fresh fracture and non union and it s with lipus ultrasound david turkaly jmp securities analyst so that s your view of sort of the ultrasound market as it sits today correct so the addressable market is probably much larger but that s sort of your guess of maybe what exogen is doing jon serbousek director president and chief executive officer yeah david thanks for raising that we think that the whole bgt market is actually has areas that have potential to expand and so that s the reason why we re investing here accelstim is focused ultrasound fresh fracture nonunion but we think that that market as i highlighted is 100 million will expand if you think about the dynamics in today and part of the reason we had the lift and our physiostim is that it s non operative it s done in the office and so where some of those patients may have gone back to be revised in the or now it s a good opportunity to go ahead and try the ultrasound before you go back and operate so i think we re seeing some traffic there and from a fracture standpoint it avoids the second surgery for a patient and it s a good opportunity for them to seek a firm fusion in that fracture david turkaly jmp securities analyst and when you think about pemf versus ultrasound i guess will you play or will there be data that you could maybe not apples to apples but look at sort of how those devices work i mean are they maybe they re very similar i don t know the answer to that but what are your thoughts there jon serbousek director president and chief executive officer the energy source is very different and pemf is a very proprietary process that we basically have developed over decades and so it is our mainstay we have all of our clinical data in spine we have our nonunion data and so we re not going to steer away from that at all that is part of that robust portfolio we have the accelstim with ultrasound is going to be focused at fresh fracture and basically put us in that market to expand the portfolio not only accelstim and there s other technologies out of the igea license agreement that we have opportunities to explore as well david turkaly jmp securities analyst thanks a lot jon serbousek director president and chief executive officer thanks david operator at this time there are no further questions i will now turn the call back over to jon serbousek for closing remarks jon serbousek director president and chief executive officer thanks operator thanks everyone for joining the call i appreciate your interest in learning more about orthofix and the progress we re making and with that i ll close the call and thank you very much have a wonderful day operator duration 47 minutes call participants alexa huerta senior director of

morning everyone we are approaching the anniversary of our investor day an important moment in our journey of transformation that established one our commitments for the newly combined elanco as well as provided unprecedented transparency as well as marking an inflection point toward sustainable value creation this quarter of delivery represents our fourth quarter of consistently exceeding revenue guidance since our investor day as we progress through 2021 it is clear our long term growth algorithm is on track and we are executing against our ipp strategy and commitments as laid out last december third quarter revenue on slide 4 was 1 131 billion which surpassed the midpoint of our guidance range by nearly 45 million with over performance once again in both sides of our business pet health and farm animal our adjusted eps of 0 19 was 0 02 above the midpoint of guidance and adjusted ebitda of 211 million was 4 million above the midpoint we are expanding margins while also reinvesting for future growth despite inflationary pressures as discussed in august today we are raising our 2021 full year revenue guidance and maintaining adjusted ebitda and adjusted eps guidance we provided in august all three of which stand well above our initial targets from the december investor day you can see that on slide 5 at the midpoint we anticipate revenue of 190 million or 4 higher than the original december guidance adjusted ebitda guidance is 85 million or 9 higher than originally stated and adjusted eps is 0 11 or 12 higher 2021 is shaping up to be a strong step toward our long term growth algorithm providing total year expected revenue up approximately 7 reflecting the durability and diverse nature of our combined business our growth this year includes gains for our focus brands momentum at retail global execution for parasiticides and pain and share gains in u s farm animal these tailwinds are balanced with competitive dynamics reemergence pressure reemerging pressure from african swine fever and generic challenges we are also making steady headway toward our long term margin targets with approximately 300 basis points of adjusted ebitda expansion anticipated this year on a pro forma combined company basis our margin expansion in 2021 is representative of a companywide priority given this important metric with a comprehensive plan to sustain this trajectory toward our goal of 31 by 2024 our teams are well positioned to execute on the core business while several recent strategic actions are enabling accelerated long term value creation the kindredbio acquisition closed at the end of august and advances elanco access to the fast growing billion dollar plus dermatology market with the combination of elanco s internal pipeline plus the kindredbio additions we expect to be a key leader in this next era of pet health growth kindredbio s three potential blockbusters launching by 2025 as well as full ownership of the canine parvovirus therapy adds approximately 100 million to our innovation revenue expectations bringing the total to 600 million to 700 million by 2025 as part of our increased focus on high value late stage pet health pipeline progress we welcomed ellen de brabander our new head of innovation a few weeks ago she is a highly accomplished r d leader with a proven track record in animal health blockbuster development and is ideally suited to drive execution ultimately building on the strong foundation established during shots tenure ellen is now leading the potential carve out of our early stage microbiome r d platform in which we may retain in minority stake the separation is expected to be completed by the end of the first quarter of 2022 we hope to have more details to share with you as this date approaches finally on the productivity front in june we announced the exit of three manufacturing sites on august 1st the sale of the shawnee site closed and further streamlining our footprint we are accelerating our gross margin efforts reducing annual capex and improving working capital we believe all these strategic actions will combine to support consistent double digit adjusted ebitda and adjusted eps growth ahead on slide 6 we provide the key drivers of our third quarter revenue performance on a pro forma combined company basis we grew approximately 6 assuming the bayer acquisition had occurred on january 1 2020 pet health drove approximately one third of the upside versus the midpoint of guidance reaching 527 million in revenue for the quarter trends are moderating on incrementally tougher comparisons leading to low single digit year over year increases in u s vet clinic traffic during the quarter however growth is still very healthy on a multi year basis in turn our vaccine business saw strong edi performance as we evaluate the stickiness of the trends in pads post covid the matter first improved vet clinic experience as well as the wellness programs and improving compliance should represent longer term market expansion factors on the other side of the pandemic turning to parasiticides third quarter seresto revenue was 52 million while global advantage family revenue was 121 million each up 9 year over year both saw healthy gains in the u s and let our continued strength in international pet health seresto revenue was up 28 compared to 2019 back more in line with historical two year trends as the otc parasiticide channel rebounded from transient weather related challenges in may we remain on track toward full year expectations for seresto with key initiatives already in place going into next year creating a long runway to grow this trusted brand moving to credelio the global franchise is performing well and a competitive field credelio is the second fastest growing brand in global oral parasiticide market according to the industry data for the second quarter the most recent available data the flagship product achieve quarter and year to date edi growth in the u s supplemented by international expansion and the launches of credelio plus and credelio cat we continue to see good traction in the pairing opportunity with interceptor plus and our sales and marketing teams across the world are driving our otc and scripted parasiticide portfolio across retail e commerce and the vet clinic as rising pet numbers in greater compliance provide a favorable and durable industry backdrop anticipated and expected declines in our older brands trifexis and comfortis as well as the divested product drove legacy elanco pet health down 2 for the quarter finally in therapeutics galliprant outpace the branded u s instead market according to the kynetec data the brand continues to grow nicely as a leader in pain making progress toward becoming our tenth blockbuster turning now to the farm animal business legacy elanco was up 8 in the third quarter we saw a demand driven strength and share growth in our global cattle business in the us cattle on feed numbers have remained elevated versus historic levels and placements were higher year over year we achieved strong bdi performance in cattle and swine for rumensin optaflexx and denagard in the quarter our u s farm animal growth reflects our value based products and a presence of higher fee cost as well as our comprehensive portfolio our value beyond product offerings and the beneficial industry dynamics in china swine we experienced ongoing headwinds from the reemergence of african swine fever as discussed on our last call on august over supply through financially induced herd liquidation has kept hog prices broadly at their lowest levels for the year down about 60 since the start in january we expect these macro challenges to continue in the fourth quarter our overall swine business remains competitive with a strong portfolio targeting larger producers that are better position in the market so in turn we believe we are well positioned for outside success as the market rebounds our total chinese business is still poised to deliver at least a percentage point of growth to total elanco revenue in 2021 finally we drove double digit growth in international poultry and aqua as many of our international markets recovered from the 2020 pandemic impacts global poultry markets have seen significant improvement with most regions now moving into profitable conditions benefiting from increased demand and reopened economies in aqua salmon prices have been consistently positive year over year since mid july which is driving the use of our dna vaccine clynav to protect atlantic salmon from pancreatic disease turning to slides 7 and 8 since our investor day we are growing we are transforming and elanco is elevating our business while prioritizing innovation we have consistently outperformed revenue guidance since q4 of last year at the same time we are on track toward our synergy commitments and our long term margin and net leverage targets we are moving with speed and decisiveness to several recent strategic actions to drive disciplined execution against each of the three pillars of our ipp strategy to enable accelerated value creation slide 9 outlines our innovation progress in 2021 with details around all eight products which have now launched we continue to expect these launches to contribute 65 million to 85 million in revenue this year on the pet health side where innovation is running above expectations credelio plus launched in australia in the quarter in time for the local parasiticide season credelio cat and elura are performing well and expanding our feline portfolio in farm animal experior acceptance continues to grow with both producers and packers the total value proposition is being substantiated in the field with expanded use from those that have tested the product and production systems we have doubled the number of cattle on the products since the second quarter we continue to see potential for blockbuster status for this unique product the first u s fda approved product labeled to reduce ammonia gas emissions as part of elanco s pledge to be our customers lead partner on their journey to net zero emissions we hosted leaders from across the global animal protein industry ahead of the united nations food systems summit to position animal agriculture as a meaningful solution to climate change while identifying opportunities to help our industry accelerate progress additionally elanco was recently named among the top 20 of fortune s 2021 changed the world list which recognizes companies that have made an important social or environmental impact through their profit making strategy and operations our team s commitment to our purpose and continued execution in creating value for farmers pet owners veterinarians stakeholders and society as a whole with that i ll hand it over to todd to provide more color on our results and our outlook todd young cfo thanks jeff slide 10 summarizes our financial performance highlights including our reported net income and earnings per share on slide 31 to 33 in the appendix you can find the summary of the adjustments made to the reported results to arrive at our adjusted presentation i ll focus my comments on our third quarter adjusted measures in order to provide insights on the underlying trends of our business so please refer to today s earnings press release for a detailed description of the year over year changes in our reported results looking at the adjusted measures on slide 11 you will see that total elanco revenue increased 27 on the quarter on a reported basis with one pointed benefit from foreign exchange for legacy elanco on slide 12 is a visual representation of our revenue outperformance versus the guidance range we provided in august the key drivers in order of magnitude were global cattle up performance global pet health in the retail channel international poultry recovery aqua and currency tailwinds adjusted gross margin as a percent of revenue was 55 7 an increase of a 150 basis points compared to the third quarter of last year the year over year improvement which was achieved despite higher logistics costs reflects the bayer acquisition the benefit of positive price and volume on elanco s legacy portfolio and continued productivity gains the sequential deceleration of 240 basis points versus the first half of this year reflects seasonality as we move past the northern hemisphere parasiticide season total operating expense increased 19 in the third quarter driven by the addition of the bayer animal health business and kindredbio operating income increased 67 reflecting the bayer animal health acquisition our top line execution expense leverage and discipline and synergy capture our adjusted ebitda was 211 million and our adjusted ebitda margin for the quarter was 18 7 up 200 basis points versus last year at the bottom line q3 adjusted net income increased 55 to 93 million and our effective tax rate in the third quarter was 23 5 now let s discuss our revenue performance more closely on slide 13 you will see a breakdown of the contribution from legacy elanco and legacy bayer portfolios by category legacy bayer products contributed 421 million in the quarter pet health drove 527 million of revenue or 47 of total elanco the sequential step down to less than half of our mix reflects seasonality cattle contributed 256 million or 23 of total elanco revenue in the quarter poultry added a 173 million representing 15 swine 110 million or 10 and aqua 44 million or 4 on slide 14 you can see the effect of price rate and volume on our revenue performance to aid your analysis for our performance the full benefit of the bayer acquisition for the quarter is reflected in volume on the slide we ve achieved a 2 increase for legacy elanco year to date and expect that to hold through the full year as well looking further ahead we are focused on levers to drive revenue including greater price increases than we have implemented historically for certain skus as inflationary pressure has risen especially in transportation costs slide 15 provides a breakdown of overall performance between the u s and our international operations we have further outlined our geographic performance by pet health and farm animal as well as contract manufacturing all of which benefited from the addition of bayer we expect to file our 10 q very soon but moving to slide 16 let me offer a few words on working capital and debt we ended the third quarter with 453 million in cash and equivalents on our balance sheet and net debt of 5 97 billion on august 12th we entered into a new seven year 500 million credit facility consisting of a senior secured term loan to retire our 500 million of senior notes that matured on august 27th this new loan bears interest of uploading rate of libor plus 175 basis points the terms of generally consistent with those of our existing term loan b at the end of q3 elanco had 250 million drawn on its revolving credit facility that was used to fund the 440 million acquisition of kindredbio we used 194 million of cash on hand to pay the remainder of the purchase price net leverage was 5 8 times at the end of the quarter and we continue to expect approximately 5 5 times at the end of 2021 in line with our original projection from december 2020 additionally as we regularly update you our aggregate channel inventory levels of distribution remained consistent with prior quarters in the u s and across our global business that will transition to our full year and fourth quarter 2021 outlook starting on slide 18 we are raising our full year 2021 guidance for total revenue and maintaining our ranges for adjusted ebitda and adjusted eps despite a higher expected full year 2021 tax rate at approximately 24 5 than previously expected at approximately 24 we now anticipate 2021 revenue of 4 73 billion to 4 77 billion we also expect adjusted eps of 0 97 to a 1 03 and adjusted ebitda of 1 035 billion to 1 075 billion based on an adjusted gross margin of 56 75 to 57 we are updating our reported eps guidance to negative 0 91 to negative 0 83 reflecting two non cash impacts from the third quarter as part of our r d processes we terminated a farm animal portfolio project due to observed efficacy results this action required a write down of the value of this in process r d asset through the p l the second is a chart associated with the establishment of a liability for future royalty and milestone payments relating to our license agreement with kindredbio for the parvovirus therapy which was settled upon the closing of the acquisition moving to slide 19 we are providing guidance for the fourth quarter of 2021 we expect revenue of 1 078 billion to 1 118 billion adjusted ebitda of a 190 million to 230 million and adjusted eps of 0 13 to 0 19 our fourth quarter revenue guidance reflects a year over year decline i want to emphasize that we do not have a fundamental change in our core business performance but are reflecting a number of well known one time impacts from last year these fourth quarter comparisons include four items of note first we had a large retail customer order for approximately 10 million of the otc parasiticides in the fourth quarter of 2020 versus the first quarter of 2021 second we had 10 million from incremental u s cattle vaccine and implant revenue due to competitor stock outs third we are facing a 20 million year over year decline in contract manufacturing due to the sale of our shawnee manufacturing facility to trirx and the discontinued human growth hormone production for lilly from our speke facility fourth we exited certain low margin product sales at the start of 2021 representing 20 million excluding the 60 million in total revenue specific comparisons our range reflects underlying growth of flat to 3 5 also incorporating the challenges of african swine fever flipping from a tailwind in 2020 to a headwind in 2021 our global teams continue to pursue productivity initiatives and synergy capture on both cost of goods sold and opex which are expected to drive fourth quarter adjusted ebitda up 35 million year over year at the midpoint of our guidance range and adjusted eps up 0 04 at the midpoint as we close out 2021 and head toward 2022 i want to note that we will provide initial 2022 guidance with our fourth quarter results in late february while our balanced global portfolio continues to provide solutions to farmers pet owners and veterinarians around the world we look forward to discussing our continued progression against our long term growth algorithm with our anticipated growth in revenue adjusted ebitda and adjusted eps in 2022 now i ll hand it back to jeff for closing comments jeff simmons president ceo thanks todd to summarize we continue to consistently post strong quarterly results as we move to 2021 further extending our track record of execution since acquiring bayer animal health the durability and diverse nature of our global business and our commercial execution is expected to drive approximately 7 of revenue growth this year and adjusted ebitda growth of approximately 21 and an increase in adjusted ebitda margin by approximately 300 basis points our teams are focused on delivering on our financial commitments in 2021 and excited to continue to grow revenue adjusted ebitda and adjusted eps in 2022 while delivering on our vision of food and companionship enriching life finally i d like to wish tiffany success as she leaves elanco after today to pursue an exciting opportunity outside of animal health our treasurer dave pugh with 27 years of combined experience across lilly and elanco will serve as our interim head of investor relations i expect a seamless transition in our shareholder engagement under dave s leadership and we will continue to prioritize consistency transparency and accountability with that i will turn it over to tiffany to moderate the q a tiffany kanaga head of investor relations thanks jeff we d like to take questions from as many callers as possible so we ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow up lisa please provide the instructions for the q a session and then we ll take the first caller questions and answers operator your first question comes from the line of michael ryskin with bank of america michael ryskin bank of america great thanks for taking the question guys and congrats on the quarter i m going to squeeze in both my first and my follow up right away so first jeff in light of your comments just now that this year you re seeing 7 performance growth how do we take that comp into account when we re thinking about next year and the year beyond is the numbers we should be thinking of more comp adjusted relative to that long term run rate of 3 to 4 and for the follow up you highlighted kindred and the potential derm blockbusters maintained 2025 innovation target of 600 million to 700 million can you provide any updates on timing for some of those blockbusters specifically a derm product or a combo endo or ectoparasites parasiticide is early 2023 doable or should be thinking more like 2024 for those areas thanks jeff simmons president ceo thanks michael first on 2022 as we said we do continue to see growth on revenue ebitda and eps going forward we also as todd stated will share that guidance in our q4 results in february i think a few things just important to note to backup very clearly i think this quarter now four sequential quarters is proving the strategy and the algorithm are right 21 is creating momentum that will carry into 22 we have a more durable and diverse company i think our plans are more balanced and here s what i think will be the key contributors as we go forward for growth in 22 i mean first our focus brands seresto galliprant the credelio franchise to innovation this year s innovation and next year s innovation the omni channel with digital support and the farm animal business continuing we believe to lead growth in that segment against good industry backdrops for our portfolios in both pet and farm animal and will convert that revenue growth as well as anybody in the industry and continued margin expansion so we re going to hold to the in our belief in this growth algorithm that we shared a year ago and that will be really our northstar as we go forward and i want to emphasize we do see durable growth as we go into 2022 by these things that i just mentioned relative to kindred i would just back up and say first of all we closed it in august michael world class team we ve kept all that team in place retained all the key people there is already becoming a really nice complement and leverage between our derm development teams and their derm development teams we re engaging on a regular basis ellen has been onboard only a couple of weeks but has already engaged and very much integrated right into the center of all that and yes we solidify the 100 million before assets we believe these assets can be differentiated play nicely in our portfolio i m not going to highlight specifics any more than what we highlighted during the investor day conference at this time as innovation progresses and starts to impact the results and the plans we ll continue to communicate more of that as we go forward tiffany kanaga head of investor relations all right thanks mike we ll take the next caller operator your next question comes from the line of umer raffat with evercore isi michael difiore evercore isi hi this is mike difiore in for umer thanks so much for taking my questions and congrats on the quarter i just got disconnected so apologies if i missed this a question for ellen just general thoughts and color on your vision for the r d organization that may be newer may have difference from the past and my follow up is what explained the seemingly sudden turnaround in international poultry and aqua given that the prior social headwinds and macroeconomic pressures experienced there it seemed like in the first half of the year it s been consistently messaged that producers are suffering this macro pressure that all of sudden there s this turnaround in 3q maybe you could offer some color there thank you jeff simmons president ceo thanks michael first of all ellen is not a part of the call today we will look to have ellen part of the calls as we go forward as i just mentioned she s a couple of weeks in no problem on that i will say just a quick highlight that she s been part of the 2022 planning process she s integrated into the team and the pipeline in a great way and is engaging and will be key in sharing some of her insights and we ll be able to answer those questions i know as we go into 2022 so i think that s important relative to poultry yes we have seen a significant rebound as we had shared in the beginning of the year we had predicted that in the second half of the year we would see this a lot of this is driven by the economic pullback that was caused by covid in mid sized markets that we had high market shares in we re seeing that recovery as people are now returning to stores as well as restaurants and purchasing poultry and we re seeing prices rise and with those chickens are being placed back into barns and our portfolios are winning zoashield is right now just a u s based product and really unrelated to that international poultry market rebound tiffany kanaga head of investor relations thanks mike we ll take the next caller operator your next question comes from the line of nathan rich with goldman sachs nathan rich goldman sachs hi good morning maybe jeff to follow up on the last question on r d i guess do you expect there to be any reprioritization or narrowing in the focus of r d priorities you talked about maybe a greater focus on pet health but could we see any change in the pipeline to maybe focus on some of the larger opportunities that you re going after and then just a question on probably for todd on the inflation that you re seeing and the ability to pass on costs is there any kind of difference in your ability to maybe take price increases on the farm animal side versus the pet health side could you just maybe help us understand the dynamics there thank you jeff simmons president ceo thanks for the question nathan i will start on the r d one absolutely i think you highlight and as we made the announcement on ellen during the quarter i would just put this in the line just like the kindred acquisition and just like the trirx and reducing our footprint this is just another strategic move to strengthen our value proposition going forward what i would share is ellen brings a lot of experience on not only refilling pipelines but late stage development as she has her name against some of the biggest pet blockbusters in the industry with our carveout of our early stage microbiome platform that is allowing us to have increased resources and focus on these especially late stage assets it is very clear what we must do in the portfolio we ve got an increase in pet s as a percentage an increase in blockbuster potential products going into larger markets like parasiticides derm pain and even wellness so that will be the clear agenda ellen is already as i ve shared integrated into that i don t see any change to that agenda i will say the change of the microbiome coming out has removed work which allows increased resources and focus and what i believe is relative to our size one of the most robust late stage pipelines in the industry todd young cfo hello nathan on the question of inflation as we called out we ve increased prices 2 year to date and expect that to hold for the full year we are looking for more targeting greater price increases on a lot of our consumer otc retail e commerce type products as we do think the best in class products like seresto have some space there with your question farm animal versus pet health on the farm animal side we re very value based product provider to farmers across the globe and look to continue to do that and where it makes sense for our products continue to keep animals healthy we ll look to see what kind of price we can bring at the same time there s a little bit more generic pressure on that side of the house at the moment as well tiffany kanaga head of investor relations thanks nate we ll take the next caller operator the next question comes from the line of chris schott with jpmorgan chris schott jpmorgan great thanks so much just following up on those inflation comments i think you d previously said there was about 3 or so impact this year from the supply chain and inflation i m sure to get some sense of like as we look out to 2022 should we like annualizing that type of impact or do you think there s going to be offsets i m just trying to get a sense of how is this a shorter term phenomena versus a longer term impact and the second question which is just on trirx side as you think about heading into i guess next year as the next season etc have you felt most of the impact on products like trifexis from the newer triple coming to market or is that something we should be thinking about either accelerating or greater impact as we go out to next year i know with the otc products are doing well i m just trying to get sense of that legacy prescription business and just are we hitting a floor there or is there more erosion to come there thanks so much todd young cfo first on your inflation question chris we ve got a lot of productivity initiatives continuing on a companywide basis a lot of that is to offset both input costs at our manufacturing facilities as well as the transportation costs that transportation bottlenecks with shipping imports across the globe are certainly something our team are paying a lot of attention to and working to open up new trade routes to get our products out to our customers so we re continuing to fight through it but it certainly has been a headwind this year and will likely be a headwind into next year but the team is doing a great job of finding ways to continue to try to strive to reach our goal of keeping costs flat as we grow volumes jeff simmons president ceo relative chris to the parasiticide market i think you ve hit on the key thing which is this is not a surprise that some of the dynamics that played out so far this year and what we see going forward were legacy brands ours and others are the ones being impacted and i do see parasiticides as the largest market it is growing because of i think the entrance of innovation but it s also very dynamic and very competitive what i think as you can see in our results this quarter and as we go forward is more of a global holistic approach to parasiticide that we took not only with our r d strategy but also with the acquisition of bayer so new innovations expanding the market new innovations taken from legacy brands i would know credelio being the second fastest growing oral brand shows playing a franchise across cat s credelio plus which is very competitive outside of the us and then our holistic approach which is the combination products of credelio working with and interceptor plus in the us credelio plus outside the retail and then our partnerships we re going to continue to partner use digital utilized distribution as we go forward and we believe that s working so a holistic global approach continuing to grow going forward legacy brands will continue to be impacted we haven t noted specifically how much but we do see us and our strategy working as we go forward tiffany kanaga head of investor relations thank you chris next caller operator the next question comes from jon block with stifel jon block stifel great guys thanks good morning first question i ll ask both upfront as well i guess just wide range for 4q ebitda in innovation for ebitda is in the ranges of 40 million is essentially as wide as revenue so todd maybe you could just call out some of the variables that would take us to the high end or the low end considering we ve got roughly two months left for the year and then a quick tack on jeff just on the credelio side i think i heard growth i wasn t sure it had been double digit so for credelio was the third quarter of 21 another quarter of double digit growth of the company or did you just reference growth overall thanks guys todd young cfo so jon on the ebitda as you saw we beat the sort of midpoint of our guidance in q3 by only 3 million we essentially carried over the q3 beat into our q4 guidance but otherwise have maintained one thing to know we ve had less depreciation than we previously forecasted that s helping us offset some of the inflationary costs and allowing us to deliver on gross margin but it has been negatively impacting ebitda as there s less to add back so your overall we re continuing to drive through and confident in delivering the guidance we re providing this morning jeff simmons president ceo yes jon relative to credelio overall we won t haven t given a specific bi country product growth in this category what i will say is we are seeing growth come first globally from the credelio franchise driven initially by credelio plus and a very strong launch with that product between japan europe and australia and then credelio cats and yes credelio in across the globe is as i ve shared very competitive continues to grow and will as we go into 2022 that s as much detail at this time that we ll get into tiffany kanaga head of investor relations thanks john next caller operator your next question comes from the line of balaji prasad with barclays balaji prasad barclays hi good morning and congrats on the results just two specific questions from me firstly on the now kindred had demonstrated its case bold indications on the expectation that there would be submitting the therapeutic claim in june and my conversations with kindred s management that indicated they expect approval of both the prophylactic and therapeutic indications by the end of the year is that still the goal and if so can you provide some context into the launch next year and on your understanding or thought expectations around the market secondly on interest do you still believe that with three additional can generate two lateral license to come and do you see us about to grow of growth for this more product over the next couple of years thanks jeff simmons president ceo thanks balaji great questions what i will say on the parvovirus is we are continuing to progress that nicely through our pipeline we are expecting approval and launch into the market in 2022 we re not giving a whole lot more detail than that we are working with the regulators and things are progressing nicely we ll likely make more comments on this as we get into our 2022 guidance what i will say also is what we see as a market here that has is we re looking at the launch one that does not have needs as you ve heard from some of the data from kindred banfield study shows there s 250 000 puppies every year with parvovirus and they re spending thousands of dollars was not really a great solution and so we re going to create a market that s one factor two is our supply chain being able to have this product available in some complexities in the supply chain as well as manufacturing these are all factors that will drive the timing and the size of the launch but we re excited about this product being a great complement to our portfolio but even more so to veterinarians today that really can t offer that new puppy owner a solution if they have parvovirus and we believe this will give a veterinarian across the country a new opportunity on increxxa what i d say is there s two markets out there there is a europe where there s a lot more generics there s numerous generics and in the us there s really only two us and one other company and there will be more that we re anticipating will enter this is balaji we ve said from the beginning this is a portfolio play we are leaders and confined beef cattle with our portfolio we picked up significant number of products from bayer in that portfolio and then launching increxxa it gives us a very strong bovine respiratory disease portfolio increxxa is performing a little above our expectations at this point in the us and mostly because it s a value based approach in a portfolio offering to cattle producers in the us and that will be the continued case and we continue to see this being a nice brand within our portfolio and we ll continue to update you as we move forward especially through the fall season as we re wrapping up now tiffany kanaga head of investor relations we ll take the next caller please operator your next question comes from john kreger with william blair john kreger william blair hi thanks very much jeff could you just give us an update on where you go next with the bayer integration to drive some of the margin goals you have and then todd maybe a quick one for you a year from now where would you like to see the receivable dso relative to the 81 that you just reported thanks jeff simmons president ceo yes john really quick without question just as we ve shown by our behaviors this year constant energy around a productivity agenda we have a companywide productivity agenda that is well in play looking at everything from footprint skus to infrastructure costs so as we look at kind of the next areas and our focusing on is how we can continue to optimize all aspects of the company especially anything that is non value oriented relative to pipeline commercial or key capabilities that we need so as we ve shown with novartis and others we will continue on this journey with this companywide productivity and be very very aggressive against it and we ll continue to update you but it ll be mostly across that infrastructure and skus that maybe are not as valued but mostly infrastructure todd young cfo john thanks for the question on dsos we re continuing to work across the globe to be focused on cash thinking about collections the change relative to q2 is driven by having more international farm animal which has got longer payment terms as a general matter than our u s retail business but it s influenced by the seasonality in the first half of the year so overall we continue to get more efficient and operating our two different systems and collecting cash from our customers around the globe so i think we should be inside the 81 in q3 of next year as we continue to focus on collecting our cash on a timely basis tiffany kanaga head of investor relations thank you jon next caller please operator your next question comes from elliot wilbur with raymond james elliot wilbur raymond james thanks and maybe i could just follow up that line of questioning todd specifically little bit difficult to track cash movement given some of the acquisitions and the swings in working capital but thinking about this quarter and exiting the year would you expect the company s still be operating cash flow positive on a full year basis and a question for jeff just around a growth opportunity in china i heard your earlier comments obviously you re still on track to deliver incrementally percentage point of growth to the top line from the chinese market but certainly there s going be a lot more pressures there particularly in the livestock side going forward so can you just talk about some of the other initiatives and growth levers available to you in terms of continuing to drive an increasing contribution from china maybe outside of just the swine market thanks todd young cfo elliot on your question your operating cash flow you ll see in the 10 q we re going to file shortly a year to date is 216 million and we expect that to continue to grow in q4 and to progress again in 2022 jeff simmons president ceo yes elliot on china absolutely i would start though with swine and say that we do believe that african swine fever has allowed us to really target these large producers continue to bring our portfolio we brought therapeutic claims to our performance based portfolio and i believe that we re well positioned as i mentioned because of the size of its relative to our business we do see this as something as i mentioned that will outsize ourselves we believe in this rebound i think the other side is poultry that a long history with a concentrated industry in the poultry business there we brought in nutritional health and continue to play very nicely in the poultry business and then what bayer has brought and i really will be to answer your question specifically the most material change to elanco will be a strong business in the pet side we re putting a lot of energy relative to reaching pet owners integrating and working with veterinarians advantage and seresto are the key lead brands as well as drontal and doing very well and then lastly i would say that the kind of the fourth leg to the stool in china is our aqua business our warm water business that we have there a warm water aqua where it s a nice growth driver it s still smaller but it will it has a nice long runway of growth as well so diverse portfolio for key business units a great chinese leadership team and spending a lot of time on share of voice and reaching appropriate customers the most efficiently but we continue to see nice growth prospects even going into 22 for china tiffany kanaga head of investor relations thanks elliot next caller operator your next question comes from the line of yvonne chan with citi yvonne chan citi hi good morning on poultry you continue to restore continued switch to low cost products so have you benefited from it in the u s and globally and do you see it as a durable trend and i have a second question on the sec inventory destocking and then if you could discuss any recent dialogue with sec thank you jeff simmons president ceo thanks yvonne what i would say is what i ve learned over 30 years in the poultry industry and spend a lot of time with those customers as they are very value based they have the strongest analytics of any protein group and this becomes it s really not about low cost it s all about maximizing value and so what we ve seen is we bring one of the largest databases our performance in health with our customers and that service offering with our portfolio is what s allowed us to continue to grow share and really have the number one poultry business globally relative to sec there s nothing new to report there s no change in the scope or the context or cooperating with the sec and again i want to emphasize we believe strongly our actions were appropriate and confident that our business strategy and our changes in distribution were also done very appropriate that s all i have to comment nothing else new to report tiffany kanaga head of investor relations thank you we ll take one more caller operator your next question comes from david wester with guggenheim securities david wester guggenheim securities hi thanks for taking the question so i apologize if i missed it but is there any way to think about kind of the value to wait context in the value to weight of mfas in context of access freight costs that we might be seeing in the industry and then my second question is just on generally on livestock macro can you remind us on any of the macro trends that we saw this year that might be comping next year both in a positive and negative direction as we kind of do our models there thank you jeff simmons president ceo yes dave just quick like at a high level if i miss anything todd you can jump in here but i think there without question you touched on something that is correct i mean not every portfolio is the same across the animal health companies we do have mfa s and products that have more complexity more weight and more dynamics in the supply chain as todd said we are working with productivity agenda and a lot of other interventions to offset those costs but yes there is an added context and challenge to some of our portfolio relative to that on a livestock basis what i would say at the highest level is one on swine i think we want to watch for as there is an extremeness of up and down that we ve seen with african swine fever we believe that that usually means you will see a rebound and probably in extreme way as well as we go in maybe to 2022 but continued pressure in q4 but it will be i think the swine market will be going against a very strong first half last year not just in china but that benefited globally i think that s number one and then i think number two is i think cattle continues to be a beneficiary of what the challenges were with asia exports have grown the most for beef feed yards are as full as they ve been in a long time and i see that sustaining and then poultry again we see probably a positive compare in the first half of these economics continue to remain strong especially on the international markets so those would be the three key material ones that i would highlight tiffany kanaga head of investor relations thank you jeff we ll take a closing remark from you now jeff simmons president ceo okay i would like to say first of all thank you for your interest in elanco i would like to thank tiffany as she enters a new great opportunity for her that she has been very very important to us and our relationship with all of you and i wish her all the best going forward and look forward to dave pugh as our interim ir leader i want to just emphasize i believe this quarter represents a key milestone four quarters of consistent delivery what is working is our algorithm our investor day conference highlights of our strategy the bayer acquisition our distribution changes these decisions that we re making have been the right ones and it s been representative of four quarters of delivery we have lots of work to do there are appropriate headwinds with the tailwinds we do see a durable industry with a positive backdrop both on the pet side as well as for us in our portfolio on the farm animal side we re a more strengthened company that s driving transformation and we re executing everything from the new pipeline to a companywide productivity agenda our engagement scores have risen this quarter as we ve got a very loyal focused employee base that i want to say thank you too as well in very trying challenging times in our world elanco continues to execute well and do work in very important way as noted by some of the things that we re doing on the side of improving society with animals so with that thank you again for your interest and everybody have a great day operator duration 1420 minutes call participants tiffany kanaga head of investor relations jeff simmons president ceo todd young cfo michael

trust of america brad brad blair chairman good morning and thank you for joining us for healthcare trust of america s third quarter earnings conference call joining me today is peter foss our interim chief executive officer robert milligan our chief financial officer and amanda houghton our executive vice president of asset management before we get into discussing another strong quarter for hta i wanted to provide some additional insight to the hta board priorities and actions which have certainly accelerated since july first we announced the preliminary conclusion of the company s previously disclosed investigation into allegations reported through its whistleblower hotline as outlined in yesterday s sec filing the audit committee and the company investigated allegations stemming from the whistleblower reports the company received in july 2021 the allegations included claims related to the whistleblower policy and potential retaliation as well as the company s policies related to personal expense management around corporate cards and corporate aircraft use given the seriousness of the claims and the potential impact to those involved the board undertook a very thorough and extensive investigation that utilized independent counsel to come to an objective conclusion of fact counsel for the audit committee worked closely with counsel for the company to conduct the investigation which involves collection and review of a significant number of documents and interviews of numerous witnesses the investigation concluded this week and found that the former ceo engaged in conduct that was either in violation of or inconsistent with various company policies as it relates to the whistleblower policy personal expense reimbursements and personal use of the company aircraft the financial impact of the inappropriate expenses that were specifically identified in these preliminary findings would not result in any material impact to the company or cause any financial restatements as a result of these findings the board and the audit committee have begun a process with the assistance of counsel to address the results of the investigation the board and the audit committee also intend to enhance the company s policies and procedures regarding personal expenses and aircraft usage the whistleblower policy and disclosure controls and procedures we are encouraged that hta s commitment to empowering employees to raise legitimate concerns coupled with the board s seriousness in addressing allegations of inappropriate behavior has served the greater purpose of ensuring accountability across the organization as it relates to scott our former ceo declined to be interviewed for the investigation he designed of his own volition without any reason this occurred at a time when the board was just beginning its investigation process since then the board has elected to limit any dialogue and has turned this focus exclusively to moving the business forward we will not make any further comments or statements related to his resignation and respect his privacy at this time second the company continued its search for a permanent ceo as announced in september the search is being led by a leading executive search firm and an independent search committee consisting of three independent board members we believe the search for a permanent ceo to be a critical component in the board s overall evaluation of the strategic alternatives lastly the board regularly reviews the company s strategic plan priorities and opportunities in order to enhance shareholder value as such we have been reviewing and continue to review the company s strategic plan as it continues to evolve among viable alternatives as previously disclosed we engaged advisors including jpmorgan to assist us in fulfilling our commitment to act in the best interest of hta shareholders with their help we are actively evaluating a number of alternatives including among others a corporate sale or merger joint ventures and partnerships or asset sales during the board s evaluation hta will continue to adapt its strategic plan and position the company in its portfolio for growth success and value creation as we will continue to discuss on this earnings call i want to stress that there can be no assurance that any transaction result from the strategic review process and we do not intend to disclose developments relating to this process unless and until the board has approved a specific agreement or transaction or has terminated its review we continue to execute and position hta in its portfolio for growth success and value creation that said the purpose of this call is to discuss our financial results as a board we have split the chairman and ceo role so that the board can focus on the strategic alternatives while peter is focused on running the business with his capable team to this end we will be unable to answer any questions on our strategic evaluations and we ask that you keep your questions focused on the company s current performance with that i d like now to turn the call over to peter peter foss interim president chief executive officer director thanks very much brad before amanda and robert present our specific growth for the quarter i d like to provide you some of my initial observations as i approach 100 days as the company s interim ceo and believe me it s gone by very quickly and with a lot of great events as you d expect i ve spent a significant amount of my time focused on people our teams shareholders our key tenants and health system relationships and i can report to you that our people are excited about the potential of this great company to turn the page and deliver significant value in ways that we haven t before i ve been fortunate in my career to be associated with some great growth businesses helping to grow ge plastics from less than 1 billion to over 7 billion in sales over a 15 year period and turning the olympics for ge into 1 billion revenue source for the ge businesses we in those adventures use both scale size and capabilities to accelerate growth that s exactly the positioning of hta a franchise that has size scale and capabilities that s ready to be unleashed in the past few months i ve spent my time getting to know our team in my time as an independent board director we frequently interacted however there was no replacement there is no replacement for the daily interaction as a ceo i ve been very impressed with our team s expertise sophistication and when it comes to operating our assets and their community of the inherent complexities in the mob sector there s nobody better while we have a strong team we ve added exceptional talent to our company and roles that can help us accelerate our growth and profitability in leasing in investments and operations we re also focused on adding infrastructure to assist in our growth investments in hr and technology and market analytics that will help us scale and add value to our larger customers while also helping us to operate as an efficient team with a relentless focus on delivering value in this quarter alone we ve made great strides in growing and improving our hr team while also making significant investments in market and healthcare analytics adding staff and capabilities that will make us faster and help us be more insightful we can do that without adding significant costs by working on our structure and developing our people investments that will pale relative to growth they will produce on the top line during the past few months i ve also spent time touring our portfolio and meeting with many healthcare leaders as i toured these markets it is apparent the quality of our assets the communities we play and our healthcare provider tenants are the best our strategy has been clear to establish critical scale in gateway markets with dense patient bases with assets in an operating platform that can create value for top healthcare providers in my time working with ge healthcare and running various healthcare foundations i ve worked closely with many leading healthcare providers across the country as i call them these leaders with members of the hta team they re excited about the opportunities to work with each other and move their businesses forward on top of all this our team has continued to execute in the third quarter without missing a beat and despite all the noise that surrounded us in the quarter alone we executed leases for 670 000 square feet of space 227 000 square feet of which represented new leases the highest levels of new leasing in over four years this allowed us to increase our same store lease rate by 0 4 and for the 450 000 square feet of leases that were renewed in the quarter our releasing spreads were an impressive 2 9 sic 2 7 we also closed on over 130 million of acquisitions and move forward on our development pipeline with more than 300 000 square feet of lois currently outstanding on our development pipeline assets this shows that our team remains focused while moving things forward in summary my first 100 days as interim ceo have further confirmed my views of the company which were formed over my six years as an independent director it s clear to me that as a result of our people platform and portfolio hta is uniquely positioned to deliver value to our tenants and our stakeholders let me restate that you have my commitment to continue the development and growth of this hta franchise that scott and this team great team have created now i d like to turn it over to amanda to discuss the quarterly performance and specific leasing activity amanda houghton employee value proposition of asset management thank you peter our operating performance remained strong in the third quarter highlighted by same store noi growth of 2 5 this meaningful portfolio growth was led by strong performance from both our leasing and operations team our new leasing totaled 227 000 square feet was one of the highest levels since 2017 driven by growth in markets like north haven dallas and charlotte our teams have seen a notable pickup in new leasing activity and increased willingness of health systems and physician partners to invest long term in our assets as reflected in the increasing level of term for new leases over seven years for the last two quarters in addition to new leases we had over 400 000 square feet of renewals that resulted in 83 retention for the same store portfolio and rent growth of 2 9 year to date leasing activity has totaled over two million square feet with nearly 600 000 square feet coming in the form of new leases our annual escalators for new leases signed in the third quarter were 2 7 reaching 2 8 on a year to date basis continuing our trend of increasing escalators to approximately 3 and as we manage lease expirations in our portfolio as a result our leased rate increased on a sequential basis by 30 basis points for same store pool despite inflationary pressures expenses in our same store portfolio this quarter increased only 1 2 year over year this minimal increase is a testament to our operating team s ability to efficiently operate our assets and the benefits of having a scaled platform like ours in order to deliver cost savings to our tenants i ll now turn the call over to robert robert milligan chief financial officer secretary treasurer thanks amanda our financial performance in the third quarter remained strong as highlighted by improved portfolio performance with same store noi growth of 2 5 normally the ffo per share held during the quarter at 0 44 an increase of 2 3 versus 2020 bringing our year to date earnings to 1 32 per share which is up three over 3 compared to 2020 our normalized fad was 78 million and year to date normalized fads up 4 from 2020 to 248 million our g a remained consistent at 10 8 million less than 10 of noi this includes approximately 0 5 million of costs related to our whistleblower investigation with costs for our new ceo chairman compensation being offset by the elimination of unvested shares related to our prior ceo as a result we were able to reconform our previous guidance for the full year tightening the range but leaving the midpoint intact from a balance sheet perspective we ended the quarter with 1 2 billion of liquidity and net debt to ebitda of 5 8 times including the impact of unsettled forward equity agreements totaling 218 million in october we refinanced our 1 3 billion unsecured credit facility resulting in a reduction in our borrowing cost and an additional four years of term including extension options in terms of acquisition activity we closed on four previously announced mob acquisitions in the quarter totaling 135 million and an anticipated in place year 1 yield of 5 7 these acquisitions increased densification in our key markets and brought our year to date investment activity to 188 million we have an additional 159 million of acquisitions under contract or exclusive letters of intent that we expect to close prior to year end including the 69 million of loan funding commitments to projects in houston s texas medical center of 54 million that was funded through third quarter 2021 investment activity is expected to total over 400 million from a development perspective in the third quarter we completed core and shell construction on time in our development project in dallas with cash rents expected to commence before the end of the year in addition we have a development pipeline of five projects in various stages in the pre leasing process totaling almost 400 million and over 850 000 square feet of gla highlighted by our strategic partnership with medistar corporation to codevelop the horizon tower on the texas a m innovation plaza in the texas medical center following quarter end we made a strategic investment in pivotal analytics an optumhealth partner and an innovative company that is applying the tremendous data and insights that can come from the billions of health insurance claims completed on an annual basis to the physical world with an ultimate goal of improving the decision making process for healthcare providers around strategic office locations the impact of referral patterns and also best efforts around service line implementations while relatively small from a monetary basis at 6 million this investment in their series a provides us with a preferred position to grow and utilize the tools being developed by this innovative company that way we can leverage in a way that we can leverage as we execute our strategic plan outside the specific numbers in the quarter we believe hta is very well positioned to accelerate our earnings as we head into 2022 this is in part related to several steps that we are intently focused on from a strategic perspective including investing in our talent and infrastructure as peter noted we will always operate with focus on efficiency however we believe that growing the overall capabilities of our team will provide tremendous returns and drive growth within our portfolio and on an external basis this includes a focus on training and alignment but also an investment in headcount to add additional leasing investment professionals and market research also adding additional infrastructure that can help us streamline our operations to add efficiency second we re focused on markets and data analytics to drive performance we already have great teams on the ground but are supplementing that with a greater focus on analytics to drive the depth and intelligence that s needed to really outperform in ways that improve our capital allocation decision making improving leasing performance and adding value for our customers our investment in pivotal is just one effort that we have undertaken to better position our teams third by aligning capital sources with the reality of the mob marketplace simply put the public markets do not always value the stable growth of mobs to remain competitive we must diversify our capital sources in ways that enable us to execute on the unique opportunities that we see as the leader in this space from a practical perspective this should drive upside growth in the following ways first through occupancy upside our occupancy was 88 as of september 30 we believe a realistic run rate occupancy for our portfolio is closer to the 92 to 93 range which is consistent with the broader mob market and which we have achieved prior to covid achieving this occupancy gain would result in almost one million square feet of absorption and could result in 16 million to 20 million in incremental annual noi we believe this to be achievable given that some of our highest growth markets currently contain meaningful amounts of occupancy upside including houston and dallas and charlotte and phoenix these four markets each with strong underlying operating fundamentals account for nearly 900 000 square feet or 1 3 of the 2 7 million square feet of leasable space as of september 30 second area is by driving development we believe that the development will come in multiple ways first with the traditional health system rfp where we will compete to win pre leased projects however these are extremely competitive driving the pricing down the real opportunity is using our market intelligence from both tenant and local market relationships and our balance sheet flexibility to proactively identify key areas of growth for healthcare providers and creatively structure medical office opportunities for which providers will compete third area is by pursuing joint ventures private market interest in medical office has never been higher as seen across other reit sectors partnering with private capital joint venture partners is an attractive path for growth allowing established public companies to leverage our operating platform and expertise while benefiting from access to currently lower cost private capital in a space that has seen several regional operators raise 1 billion funds we believe we are uniquely positioned as a best in class operator where many can and should want to partner over the long term fourth area is through asset sales in addition to the jvs we ll be utilizing this competitive market to sell assets that no longer fit our strategic plans these are great assets just happen to be located on markets or assets for which we believe we maximize value assets that we can sell at great pricing and redeploy into other opportunities for the benefit of shareholders in short hta has a number of opportunities on which to execute to drive performance in the short to medium term with that i will now turn it over to peter to wrap it up peter foss interim president chief executive officer director thanks robert and thanks amanda before i open up for questions i just want to make one more comment first i just want to say thanks to all the hta folks for welcoming brad and i into a pretty difficult situation when we weren t expecting and they weren t expecting but you folks have done a wonderful job kept the focus the results speak for themselves i d also like to thank brad you couldn t have a better partner than brad he s kept focus on his side of it let me focus on the operations with robert and amanda and a great team so i say thanks to all of you for letting us continue in such a nice fluid manner with that we ll open up the call for questions thank you questions and answers operator our first question today comes from rich anderson of smbc rich anderson smbc analyst good morninng so the comment was made early that a permanent ceo is critical as you look around for strategic alternatives and i m trying to overlay that with the process i know you re not going to talk about it but that would imply that you re primarily looking at an entity level type of deal no ceo is going to come in if they re going to get bought by another reit and be gone 10 minutes later so i m curious if that s the right way to think about it as an entity level type of transaction primarily perhaps through private equity channels any kind of color you can give on that would be interesting brad blair chairman this is brad rich as we have announced our search committee engaged spencer stuart to assist with the reach or the search for a new ceo we continue to conduct that process in a robust way and we intend to do that with this prospect that we will identify the appropriate person to lead hta i believe that the characteristics of hta will give us the opportunity to interview a number of such people and we would not considered as we re addressing just a stand alone that we want to make sure the company has continued to advance itself and be prepared in whatever event might come out of our process rich anderson smbc analyst okay and if i could just ask a very quick follow up same store was 2 5 occupancy was down 150 basis points how would that possibly happen maybe that s for amanda amanda houghton employee value proposition of asset management yes rich our on a quarter sequential quarter over quarter basis we were up about 30 basis points quarter over quarter same store 40 on the total portfolio in the first quarter i think we had pretty low retention but we still are getting our existing portfolio the close to 90 that s occupied we have the existing rent bumps in it so while on a year over year basis we re down slightly with our existing escalators in place and the new leases that we re doing favorable leasing terms of those i think that s driving much of the revenue increase which results in noi growth brad blair chairman and rich also keep in mind last year is when we had a number of kind of early renewals as part of our strategy of really working with health systems to work through the covid process so i think in the prior year period we had a number of leasing concessions free rent that was the result of early renewals that drove revenue down so even though we had occupancy down on a year over year basis the total amount of cash pay revenue was not nearly as impacted as it was on an occupancy basis so that s really how you get to that math rich anderson smbc analyst okay thanks operator our next question today comes from nick joseph of citi nick joseph citi analyst just want to better understand what the strategic review process involves is the advisor actively soliciting bids and being proactive on outreach to potential bidders is there a data room set up just any more color on the mandate there peter foss interim president chief executive officer director well i appreciate you understand the question as we addressed in the board related matters in our prepared remarks we will have to limit our comments with respect to this process we ll continue to be guided by jpmorgan and advising us in this process and that s about all i can tell you about the process details nick joseph citi analyst yes i mean i guess a process is pretty broad right i mean is there i recognize on this call you re trying to stick to the current quarter results but is there going to be another opportunity to expand on what exactly that mandate is peter foss interim president chief executive officer director well the mandate is to review all alternative options and we have such a conclusion as to one or none we will certainly bring that to your attention but at this stage we can t comment any further about the details nick joseph citi analyst and then just maybe on the whistleblower news that you guys filed yesterday i mean are there any continued investigations or complaints outstanding or was that everything that was related to the whistleblower from three months ago peter foss interim president chief executive officer director the investigation of the facts has concluded and as we indicated in our press release the board will be reviewing circumstances that need to be improved and or addressed in the final conclusion process nick joseph citi analyst were there any other employees disciplined or terminated related to the whistleblower findings peter foss interim president chief executive officer director we re not at liberty to talk about those operator next question comes from juan sanabria of bmo capital markets juan sanabria bmo capital markets analyst just following up on rich s question on the ceo search is it the intention to have somebody in the seat before the strategic review process is complete in whatever form that takes peter foss interim president chief executive officer director we can t comment on any time lines on how and when that closes and gets completed but we will rely on the search committee and spencer stuart to give us the best outcome possible and i can t as i said comment on any time lines juan sanabria bmo capital markets analyst okay and can you comment if you ve received any unsolicited bids as of yet into the board for the company in one form or another peter foss interim president chief executive officer director once again we can t comment on that juan sanabria bmo capital markets analyst okay and maybe just one last follow up for me given the brevity of the answers just on joint ventures can you talk about that as the sourcing for attractive capital and how far along you may or may not be with partners on discussions and would that be focused on new assets for acquisitions where you come in as a minority partner perhaps or something where you contribute existing assets robert milligan chief financial officer secretary treasurer yes juan this is robert and we can probably comment a little bit more about this it is one of the options that i think the board is looking at and frankly that we ve been looking at for some time i think we look at it at the number of really high quality capital sources that are out there that really would like to get a foothold in the medical office space as a real opportunity to get private capital that comes in that definitely has kind of different timing and different return requirements than what the public markets do for us right now as something we can move forward with just over the past quarter you ve seen a couple of really smaller regional operators announced kind of billion dollar funds and the ability to move forward with it so i think as we look at it it s an opportunity both to potentially sell assets into a joint venture with a seed portfolio and take those proceeds and reinvest them or or do other things with them as well as the opportunity to grow on a go forward basis so i think from a timing perspective obviously the board is looking at kind of all sorts of options that we re preparing to go down that path and have a number of good conversations currently in the works and we re excited about what that opportunity could be for us juan sanabria bmo capital markets analyst thank you operator our next question is a follow up from rich anderson of smbc rich rich anderson smbc analyst just one question promise when you think about cap rates in the marketplace and let s say a one off deal is a five cap just to use a round number what is your experience on portfolio premiums and if you were to be a buyer or a seller what type of lower cap rate from a five would you be interested in making a deal peter foss interim president chief executive officer director well rich that s a very specific question you re asking there so we ll try to be a bit broader on that i think in the marketplace in the mob space you certainly have seen portfolio premium take place as we ve talked extensively as we re announcing our acquisitions we ve been very much a buyer of single assets that typically gives 25 to 50 basis points more cap rates at least in the current environment on top of which we typically get another call it 25 to 35 basis points of synergies from our property management platform so i think when we look at the current marketplace over the last six to nine months as you ve seen with some of our peers and some of the other transactions there are certainly a 25 to call it 50 basis points premium for portfolio assets sometimes even more than that if there s the ability for to acquire a platform to be able to partner with somebody and see that growth opportunity go forward from there rich anderson smbc analyst does that premium get bigger much bigger as the portfolio gets bigger or is 50 kind of the ceiling could it be much more than that if you re getting into a much larger type of transaction peter foss interim president chief executive officer director i think that s probably a question that we haven t seen a super large portfolio i mean i think the biggest one that we ve seen was certainly by our good friends out of milwaukee that they did up there and i think it s a very high quality transaction and i think you certainly saw a very competitive pricing around there relative to the individual assets i think it s a little bit hard to compare on it but high quality assets as you can see are very well valued so especially when you get a good operating partner that can help you grow in the space so and it s not just that i think we ve seen it like i said with the announcement of both acquisitions as well as announcement of joint ventures with really two other two to three other operators that we ve seen just this quarter alone in this space so i think it s hard to project exactly what it is but it s certainly in the 25 to 50 basis points for the deals we ve seen but truly large deals have been relatively in the space rich anderson smbc analyst thanks very much appreciate it operator we have no further questions in the queue so i ll hand back to the management for closing remarks peter foss interim president chief executive officer director great well i think we just want to thank everybody for joining us on the call today and we look forward to having additional conversations next week as part of the virtual nareit session and appreciate all your interest in hta in the mob space robert milligan chief financial officer secretary treasurer thanks very much for your time peter foss interim president chief executive officer director thank you operator duration 35 minutes call participants david gershenson chief accounting officer brad blair chairman peter foss interim president chief executive officer

looking statements in the future with that please turn to slide 4 and let me hand the call over to jeff jeffrey w martin chairman and chief executive officer thank you nelly several years ago we revised our business strategy to narrow the focus of the company to invest in an energy infrastructure in markets where we expect high growth today there is a growing recognition about why these types of investments are increasingly important whether it s the current dislocation in european energy markets or high prices for lng in asia or even challenging weather events here at home that call for greater resiliency new investments in energy infrastructure are certainly needed bipartisan support in washington for the pending infrastructure bill provides further validation of this trend in addition to help meet the needs of the market at sempra we certainly believe energy infrastructure right here in north america is a key driver of job creation economic growth and competitiveness across the economy moreover maintaining a modern flexible and secure network of electric transmission and distribution lines natural gas pipelines and storage facilities is essential to delivering affordable and increasingly clean energy to u s businesses and consumers while promoting growth across all sectors of our economy against that backdrop we ll provide a business update today on the key activities in our california and texas utilities also justin bird our new ceo of sempra infrastructure will provide an update on how he s organized that business to capture exciting new growth opportunities this will be followed by a summary of our financial performance as an overview for the quarter our strategic focus on investing in energy infrastructure across each of our three growth platforms together with a commitment to operational excellence continue to drive strong financial performance as you know we have a long track record of continuing to raise our guidance and then working hard to meet or exceed that guidance this is a result of our high performing culture and continuous focus on improving the quality of our operations as a result of these efforts we expect to be at the upper end of our full year 2021 adjusted eps guidance range and we re reaffirming our full year 2022 eps guidance range now please turn to the next slide where justin and i will provide business updates let me start with our california utilities in august sdg e filed an off cycle application with the cpuc to update its cost of capital effective january 1 2022 this application would increase sdg e s equity ratio from 52 to 54 roe from 10 20 to 10 55 while also lowering cost of debt from from 4 59 to 3 84 the application if accepted by the cpuc would supersede the automatic cost of capital adjustment mechanism in terms of timing sdg e has requested a decision in the first half of 2022 also at socalgas we recently announced agreements expected to resolve substantially all material civil litigation against socalgas and sempra related to the 2015 aliso canyon natural gas storage facility leak with net after tax cash flows for socalgas expected to ultimately be up to 895 million after taking into consideration collection of existing insurance receivables and other adjustments these agreements are important milestones that will help the community and our company work toward putting this difficult chapter behind us in addition last month socalgas issued an important technical analysis underscoring the essential role of clean fuel networks that leverage existing gas infrastructure to help california achieve its net zero goals and more importantly to do so more affordably and more efficiently than other alternatives moving now to texas oncor announced its updated 2022 to 2026 capital plan of approximately 15 billion it s important to note that this plan is a 2 8 billion increase over its 2021 to 2025 capital plan that was presented at the 2021 investor day in june at sempra infrastructure we recently finalized a series of transactions including the sale of a non controlling interest to kkr completing the exchange offer and subsequent cash tender offer to purchase the publicly owned ienova shares and delisting ienova shares from the mexican stock exchange additionally i d like to note related to the formation of sempra infrastructure we ve updated our gaap guidance range for 2021 to include items expected to be reflected in our fourth quarter results you can find a gaap reconciliation in the appendix to the slide decks please turn to the next slide before i hand the call over to justin i want to make one follow on point about oncor we ve talked a lot in the past about being in the most attractive energy markets in north america and texas is certainly an example oncor today operates in one of the fastest growing markets in the country with some forecasts estimating that the texas population will nearly double by 2050 with strong macro fundamentals across its service territory oncor just announced a record high five year capital plan of 15 billion this capital plan is primarily earmarked to meet load growth with two thirds of the plan dedicated to expansions of the company s transmission and distribution network oncor s robust projected capital plan and rate base figures are expected to support economic development across its service territory increases in generation interconnection strong premise growth and critical new investments in grid modernization and resiliency and finally oncor now expects to grow its rate base to nearly 28 billion by 2026 which reflects a compound annual growth rate of about 8 over the five year period the growth the company is experiencing is just remarkable please turn to the next slide where i ll pass the call over to justin to review the latest updates at sempra infrastructure justin bird chief executive officer thanks jeff i m excited to present the newly formed sempra infrastructure platform we expect the formation of sempra infrastructure along with the financial strength of kkr to give us added scale to execute on a wide range of energy infrastructure opportunities across sempra infrastructure s three business lines since closing this transaction a month ago we re already seeing the benefits of combining the two organizations through financial synergies and commercial optimization for example we ve been able to restack our capital structure to create meaningful cost savings to capture new development opportunities we ve organized into three business lines lng and net zero solutions energy networks and clean power we expect this structure will enhance growth and quality execution this also strategically positions us to benefit from north america s continued trend toward the clean energy transition by optimizing the natural partnership between natural gas and renewables to help meet decarbonization goals here in north america and abroad energy infrastructure as jeff described at the top of today s call is the focus of our development program now please turn to the next slide where i ll briefly discuss how we re advancing growth in each of our business lines first at lng and net zero solutions the lng market has recovered quite dramatically as evidenced by the spot market with record high prices being seen in europe and asia and a recent uptick in long term contracting activity around the world with that constructive backdrop our lng development portfolio is expected to benefit from the strategic advantage of being situated on both the pacific and gulf coast with direct access to both asian and european markets as a reminder eca lng phase 1 was the only lng export project in the world to take a final investment decision last year which reinforces the competitive advantage of brownfield sites that can dispatch into the atlantic and pacific basins now looking forward we remain focused on the construction of eca lng phase 1 working with our partners to optimize cameron lng s current operations as well as the development of the cameron lng expansion and finally working on an exciting new pacific opportunity in topolobampo mexico called vista pacifico lng at eca lng phase 1 engineering equipment fabrication and site preparation are well underway the project is on time and on budget and we continue to expect first lng production by the end of 2024 at cameron lng the current facility is running well and hit record production levels during the month of october together with our partners we are developing a projected 7 million tonnes per annum expansion project benefiting from 1 million tonnes per annum of debottlenecking trains 1 3 with innovations in train design coupled with the high performance of trains one through three we expect this to be a very competitive capital efficient expansion in terms of next steps we plan to move to feed early next year to file an amendment with ferc to build train 4 with electric drives in order to reduce scope 1 emissions and to work closely with our partners as we advance toward fid lastly vista pacifico lng is a new development project located adjacent to topolobampo refined products terminal this new project is expected to be a mid scale facility connected to two existing pipelines one of them being the high pressure pipeline system we own in sonora the project would source lower cost natural gas from the permian basin for export to high demand asian markets at our energy networks and clean power businesses i d like to highlight two important projects the expansion of the gro pipeline and the expansion of our esj wind farm the gro expansion is a pipeline project in development that is expected to increase gas delivery capacity to the baja peninsula and play a critical role in supplying gas to the eca lng phase 1 project we continue to advance a series of our cross border renewable projects that are expected to dispatch directly into california specifically the esj expansion leverages the existing power transmission capacity that we own on the u s and mexico border we re the only company that owns cross border transmission lines that can connect into the california electric grid and that allow us to have a competitive advantage in helping the state meet its growing need for new renewable energy resources i m excited about the team we ve put together and about the business we re building it s a unique opportunity we re well situated to compete and we certainly expect to play a crucial role in investing in energy infrastructure right here in north america that supports the global energy transition please turn to the next slide where i ll pass the call to trevor to review our financial results trevor mihalik executive vice president and chief financial officer thanks justin earlier this morning we reported third quarter 2021 gaap losses of 648 million or 2 03 per share this compares to third quarter 2020 gaap earnings of 351 million or 1 21 per share on an adjusted basis third quarter 2021 earnings were 545 million or 1 70 per share this compares to our third quarter 2020 adjusted earnings of 432 million or 1 49 per share please turn to the next slide the variance in the third quarter 2021 adjusted earnings compared to the same period last year was affected by the following key items 35 million of higher earnings at sempra mexico due to higher ownership of ienova 35 million of higher cpuc base operating margin net of operating expenses at sdg e and socalgas 29 million of lower losses at parent and other primarily due to lower preferred dividends and 29 million related to the energy efficiency program refund in the third quarter of 2020 at sdg e please turn to the next slide we are pleased with our operational and financial performance this quarter and are focused on continuing to execute through the remainder of the year we also think our strong year to date performance sets us up well to have a great year in 2022 with that this concludes our prepared remarks we ll now stop and take your questions questions and answers operator thank you we ll take our first question from jeremy tonet with j p morgan jeremy tonet j p morgan analyst hi good morning jeffrey w martin chairman and chief executive officer good morning jeremy jeremy tonet j p morgan analyst i just want to touch on the lng market a bit here interesting to hear about the new prospects in mexico that you re talking about but just curious i guess for your thoughts on the market right now we ve seen some others kind of signed some contracts close to 20 years pretty recently here and so it seems like the market could be improving and i understand that there is two types of markets the spot obviously being very strong right now but you guys are looking at the long term contracts and there s some different dynamics that go on there just wondering if you could help us think through how the market looks at this point for the longer term contracts yeah i appreciate having the opportunity to answer that question i ll pass it to justin here momentarily but i would just start by saying in the lng trade the spot market is roughly 30 of the overall market we think the market backdrop is quite constructive we ve been fairly bullish on lng as many of you know for quite a long period of time and i would say that we re quite optimistic based upon the level and nature of our current conversations with counterparties but let me just pass it to justin maybe you can give an overview of what you re seeing in the market please justin justin bird chief executive officer thanks jeff and hi jeremy yeah i think we ve seen a dramatic improvement in the market both on the spot market and i think importantly you re starting to see some of these long term contracts come back also importantly we re seeing higher forward curves over the next few years for deliveries into asia and europe and i d say the final thing that we re seeing that i think is important is you re seeing china s reentry into the long term market we are seeing a real uptick in our discussions both in asia and europe and frankly as well as south america so i think we re going to see some exciting things coming out of our lng portfolio and we should benefit from this constructive market backdrop again we think we have a competitive advantage the ability to dispatch directly into europe and asia and again over the long term it s nice to see that we still see demand for lng growing mid to high single digits which supports our long term very bullish view on lng development jeremy tonet j p morgan analyst got it that s very helpful there thanks and maybe pivoting toward california here and thinking about the california investment opportunities and some of the reliability considerations that remain in focus are there any near term opportunities you see for san diego gas and electric at this stage and just you see some others in the state moving forward in different initiatives what do you think are next steps for you guys there jeffrey w martin chairman and chief executive officer yeah i ll give you a couple of thoughts we re actually quite constructive on california couple of things i d mention as you may have seen the decision yesterday where the puc approved to increasing the capacity utilization at aliso canyon i think they increased it from roughly 34 bcf to 41 bcf and i would tell you we are certainly committed to supporting a much cleaner economy in california but the expectations today jeremy is that traditionally california uses roughly 39 to 41 of natural gas for its electricity production in the winter time because of low hydro levels i think there s much more focus now and that being closer to 45 we could see record utilization of natural gas here in california in the winter i think the puc decision kind of reflects that more broadly i think both socalgas and sdg e have made a commitment to be a leader in the clean energy transition and this is going to inform not only our current investments but how we re stacking capital investments going to the grc next year and kevin maybe you can talk about some of the things that you re seeing around battery storage and other things that could be near term opportunities for sdg e kevin sagara group president thanks for that jeff thanks jeremy yes we are seeing a lot of opportunities at both utilities jeff mentioned at the gas company obviously a lot of clean fuels opportunities around rng and hydrogen but you specifically asked about sdg e so at sdg e we re seeing a big push in the state given what we ve seen in the last couple of tight summers around more storage capacity more generation capacity i think sdg e will have some filings in the next few weeks around more utility owned battery storage i think you will also see a lot more activity in the coming months and years around electric vehicles too california has made a lot of bold commitments to move much more strongly toward electric vehicles and i think you ll see a lot of grid enhancements and grid modifications in that area but i d also remind you that climate resilience is a big thing here and so there continues to be a lot of wildfire mitigation opportunities to invest capital as well jeremy tonet j p morgan analyst got it that s helpful i ll leave it there thanks jeffrey w martin chairman and chief executive officer thanks jeremy operator we ll take our next question from shar pourreza with guggenheim partners constantine lednev guggenheim partners analyst good morning team it s actually constantine here for shar thanks for taking our question jeffrey w martin chairman and chief executive officer it s ok constantine lednev guggenheim partners analyst just following up a bit on the lng market question as you re putting out a more discrete sip project pipeline are there the economics for the projects within that pipeline still kind of in the same low teens irr range that you ve targeted before for some of the discrete projects and how do those differ between the three categories that you outlined jeffrey w martin chairman and chief executive officer so i think you re talking about the return expectations across all three platforms constantine lednev guggenheim partners analyst yes jeffrey w martin chairman and chief executive officer what i would probably say is in this midstream space we target mid double digit levered type of returns we think those are consistent across all those interestingly on the clean power side you may recall that we ve seen returns come in here in the united states that s one of the reasons we exited that business two or three years ago in mexico because of our border position and the access we have to two very important transmission lines that bring power into the united states we think we have a real competitive advantage in that region so we expect relatively higher returns and which you might find in renewables here in the united states so i would stick to say in overall justin s portfolio is going to manage toward mid double digit equity returns one other thing i ll mention too to the broader lng story justin and i got back from a recent trip to europe where we visited warsaw and dusseldorf and berlin and brussels and other places there is a tremendous amount of recognition in europe about the role for natural gas and specifically lng and there s certainly a new risk premium being assigned to pipeline gas there s even discussions at the highest level of the eu about creating a strategic natural gas reserve we ve got a team on the ground next week in asia so i think going back to the original point with jeremy there s a tremendous amount of conversations today and i think this continues to reinforce our bullish case for lng constantine lednev guggenheim partners analyst excellent that s great color and i guess also shifting to one of the updates in regulated capex i mean we re obviously seeing a healthy oncor update and do you anticipate a similar kind of entry year cadence of an update for california and maybe to be a little bit more specific as you re thinking about the opportunities that you outlined is there any anticipations that are going to realign the focus with policy both state and federal in the next iteration of the filings in grc i suppose jeffrey w martin chairman and chief executive officer yeah let me start a little bit more broadly i think there has been a lot of interest as people have engaged with us over the last couple of months about having better visibility into sempra s long term growth rate you ve heard us talk about our track record in the past of growing this business whether it s a 10 year period or a 20 year period and an eps growth rate of around 7 or 8 i must tell you we feel fairly confident in our ability to produce similar growth in the future over a seven to 10 year period of time and part of that is bolstered by this continued point that we make about the quality of the markets we re participating in right so you ve got the number one market in america is california and the number two market is texas and i think allen just has a remarkable story in texas which keeps getting better and to your point we re going to have an opportunity to restack our capital program here in california as part of our grc filing next year and i think you should expect to see us to make filing requests around many of the things that allen s doing which is around resiliency modernization of the grid and making sure we re making those investments today that ensure that our infrastructure is future ready for what we need in the future such as hydrogen and other things on the system so we have a fairly clear pathway to grow the business in california very similar to texas and i think one of the things you re seeing on today s call is a pretty bullish case by justin about what we can do in the sempra infrastructure business as well constantine lednev guggenheim partners analyst i think that s an abundance of clarity thanks jeff jeffrey w martin chairman and chief executive officer thanks constantine operator we ll take our next question from durgesh chopra with evercore isi durgesh chopra evercore isi analyst good morning team jeffrey w martin chairman and chief executive officer good morning durgesh chopra evercore isi analyst hey good morning thank you for taking my question hey just i wanted to go back to the analyst day and you d specifically disclosed roughly 2 billion to 3 billion in additional capex right at the utilities so with this update what portion of that capex you ve locked in or have included in the plan jeffrey w martin chairman and chief executive officer yeah so i think there were a couple of things also make sure i don t misunderstand your question the difference between the five year strip from oncor that we presented in june which went through 2025 as compared to the new five year strip which goes through 2026 is a difference of 2 8 billion we also talked about at analyst day the intra period change in 2021 and 2022 from the prior year s period so i think that you ve seen two things take place year over year you ve seen the 2021 and 2022 capex for our utilities increase but since june of this year you ve seen allen s numbers increase by 2 8 billion so hopefully that s helpful durgesh chopra evercore isi analyst yeah absolutely but just in terms of like the oncor capex itself i think the number out there was like 775 million to 1 3 billion jeffrey w martin chairman and chief executive officer yeah let me address that and hopefully this will be helpful so a couple of points the five year strip going back to june has increased about 2 8 billion for allen s organization and allen had an incremental bucket separate from that of 775 million to 1 275 billion and that incremental bucket has been unchanged and maybe allen it would be helpful if this is the right time to maybe do things for our two things for our listening audience allen maybe talk a little bit about what s in your 15 billion capex plan and separately what s not in the plan related to future rulemaking and related to your incremental bucket which i think is the nature of the question allen nye chief executive and director sure jeff yeah thanks so i think you described it very well i mean what we ve done today is announced another 1 billion of oncor capex over five years or 2 8 billion since the investor day like jeff said that is really backed up by what jeff mentioned in his opening remarks just tremendous growth that we can talk about across our system in a minute but that 15 billion over five years is our new plan to jeff s point a couple of years ago we introduced this idea that we had this other bucket this incremental bucket of potential capex and to jeff s point that incremental bucket which we i think announced at 725 million to 1 275 billion remains there and available and so how does that work well what we do every year when we sit down with our board and come up with what is now the 15 billion plan there ll be some projects that come out of that incremental bucket and go into that 15 billion plan however at the same time we re also looking out further on the horizon and seeing things that we think could be included in that second bucket which is the incremental bucket so that is separate and a part as jeff said we have announced a five year a 15 billion plan that s where we are today we in addition have another bucket which remains around i mean these are estimates but 725 million to 1 275 billion that is available and in that incremental bucket in case we get to this in a minute are also things another thing that we ve added to that bucket is potential capex related to legislative activities in texas and those fall in several categories one is this possibility that we can participate a little bit in the storage market in texas there s 100 megawatts available for the entire state so we think there is an opportunity there about 20 million for rfps and we re hopeful that that will grow over time the second bill sb 1281 which related to ccns and an economic benefit to have specifically related to those ccns we think there s about probably 50 million a year in those incremental transmission projects on the emergency generation side i know there s been a lot of interest in that we re working through acquiring some capital leases on the emergency generation side right now we re planning on having about 10 megawatts under contract by january 1 the capex impact of what we do on emergency gen like several of these categories will depend on how much we ultimately end up leasing but right now we re seeing kind of 5 megawatt emergency gen 2 megawatts to 5 megawatts around 2 million and bigger 30 megawatt on the back of trailers around 10 million so we ll make an appropriate and reasonable decision for our customers in the ercot market on how much of that we will acquire and that will determine the ultimate capex impacts of emergency gen then on similar that same bill also provide us the opportunity to acquire long lead time equipment that we might need for service restoration we think we re probably around what i would call 10 million for general kind of plant for 2022 with an additional potential 100 on top of that for the remainder of the five year plan 100 million worth of equipment but again that ultimate number is going to depend 10 million on general equipment is one thing but if we get into stack comps and sbcs and some of the larger equipment that equipment goes from it can be anywhere from 50 million to 70 million per site and so we re still looking at all these legislative opportunities that s kind of just a general approach at what we re thinking right now on each of those and as i said these dollars associated with potential capex facilities associated with the legislation coming out of storm yuri are right now in our incremental bucket but as we refine them they will ultimately be moved at some point could be moved at some point into our five year plan jeff is that what you re asking for jeffrey w martin chairman and chief executive officer it is and i will tell you the reason there is so much enthusiasm from our team is we ve seen a 2 8 billion restacking of that capital plan up to 15 billion since june it s had no impact on the incremental bucket which is still there as allen described and it hasn t picked up yet some of the forward looking opportunities around will making in legislation so i think it s a very important story and the last thing allen you might speak to is the expected impact on rates allen nye chief executive and director you bet jeff so here s how the rate impact works of the 15 billion over five years that we re talking about today about two thirds of that is growth related so new customers more or less or expansion of customers of the increase that we re talking about today the 1 billion increase about 80 of that increase is directly related to growth and i should mention also 97 of that total amount of the 15 billion over five years is tracker eligible so as we make these investments keep in mind that we are presently the low cost investor owned utility in the state we have the lowest rates of all the investor owned utilities we believe that because of the substantial growth we re seeing on our system even after 15 billion over five years we will remain the low cost provider or at least close to the low cost provider on the right side of that chart of the rates for all the investor owned utilities generally i think we re probably thinking rates could increase somewhat similar to inflation but again we re the low cost provider now and we believe we ll be the low cost provider at the end of five years and 15 billion thanks jeffrey w martin chairman and chief executive officer thanks a lot allen durgesh chopra evercore isi analyst thank you both appreciate you breaking that down for us thank you jeffrey w martin chairman and chief executive officer thank you operator we ll take our next question from stephen byrd with morgan stanley stephen byrd morgan stanley analyst hi good morning jeffrey w martin chairman and chief executive officer hi stephen good morning stephen byrd morgan stanley analyst hi thanks so much for taking my questions i wanted to talk about federal legislation and in particular green hydrogen though there are other elements here that could benefit sempra i mean you ll have been innovators in a number of areas that could get support at the federal level and i was just curious at a high level i know the exact composition of the bill could change and obviously we re not even sure it s going to pass at all but to the extent that we did see kind of the framework that s been laid out what are the areas that you re most excited about in terms of what that support might mean in terms of accelerating your plans or changing your plans jeffrey w martin chairman and chief executive officer yeah i appreciate to have the opportunity to answer that question i think back in 2018 you may remember stephen that there was a lot of discussion around being in regulated businesses and unregulated businesses and i think we took the opportunity to kind of redefine an investment class that said at the end of the day these are all energy infrastructure investments and how you make money may be different in the regulated framework versus outside of the regulated framework and we really went to ground this idea of being ahead of others in defining in the markets where energy infrastructure would grow the most and i think in my opening remarks today i tried to really emphasize the point that energy infrastructure is quite hot in europe and asia and the united states and sempra is really well positioned and the infrastructure bill that you re referring to is certainly strong confirmation by us of the importance of this to the united states and there is really a tailwind for sempra around this clean energy transition so four topics i think come out of today s bill could pass as early as today out of the house one of which is retracting the private activity bonds these are ones that allow you to finance carbon sequestration and carbon storage devices we think that s important for the sector the iea says there will not be a net zero 2050 without carbon sequestration and that s one of the reasons that justin s business is focusing on this opportunity second to your very point green hydrogen is a big part of our country s future we ve made a decision to participate in all the appropriate trade associations we ve got something like 10 to 12 different r d projects in hydrogen today but specifically in the legislation the bill contemplates four regional hydrogen hubs in the country we think this will be important as you think about distribution centers and one thing that people sometimes miss stephen is the number one manufacturing facility in the united states by a wide margin is the la basin and the number one industrial segment for the united states is the gulf region between texas and louisiana so both of these are areas that geographically we have a vested interest in and i think we ve got a leadership interest in so i think hydrogen in both of those markets will be important two other quick points from today s bill one is the focus on wildfire management we talk about stephen a lot in california it s obviously a western region issue it s an issue today in europe and australia and ukraine in different parts of the world but the bill does contemplate support for vegetation management and improving resiliency which is a very important topic here in california and lastly there is a lot of focus in the bill on electric vehicles trevor and i participated in the strategy session with allen s board last week in texas the electric vehicle market in texas is enormous today there is about 30 000 vehicles on oncor s system in comparison we re one twentieth the size of oncor system here at sdg e and they ve got 70 000 vehicles on our system so i think electric vehicles will be very very important and the bill is very specific about funding opportunities all across the country to promote electric vehicles so those are the four we re probably following the most closely but we do share your optimism around green hydrogen stephen byrd morgan stanley analyst well that s a really comprehensive answer thank you very much helpful to kind of understand the areas you re focused on and shifting gears just back to lng you raised a lot of good points earlier about the strength of this market the excitement around this market and you guys are well positioned does that sort of level of excitement globally provide digital opportunities to either monetize some of your assets or to find just very low cost of capital ways to pursue additional growth like the additional opportunity in mexico you mentioned in other words could this be both a way to monetize as well as sort of use other people s money to help achieve better growth and better returns overall jeffrey w martin chairman and chief executive officer yeah one of the things i would start with saying is the priority of our capital program is our us utilities and what we want to do is be able to grow our utilities at a rate faster than our peers and do that without coming back to the capital markets to issue sempra equity and that s one of the reasons that the kkr transaction was so important it gave us a chance to crystallize and highlight value in that business and recycle capital back into reducing parent debt and meeting the capital needs like allen described today but i would tell you i don t think we re finished right that business now has been valued at roughly an enterprise value of 25 billion so we think about going forward we think there will be strategic opportunities to bring that business to the market those are conversations we would obviously have with kkr and to your point if we have the chance to further diversify the capital structure at higher valuations that s something you should look for us to do and we will be looking under faisel and justin s leadership at bringing in project equity on some of these projects to reduce the call of capital from sempra infrastructure but right now they are very very focused on growth and there s a lot of enthusiasm about what they think they can accomplish stephen byrd morgan stanley analyst that s great thank you very much that s all i had jeffrey w martin chairman and chief executive officer thank you for being on the call operator we ll take our next question from michael lapides with goldman sachs jeffrey w martin chairman and chief executive officer good morning michael michael lapides goldman sachs analyst good morning jeff thanks for taking my questions one short term one one long term one the short term one is can you remind us what s in guidance what s assumed in your 2022 guidance in your kind of growth trajectory for what happens in the california cost of capital docket and the mechanism that s question a question b longer term on the potential new mexico lng project can you talk about what kind of pipeline development is needed to get the gas from the permian to the site thanks guys jeffrey w martin chairman and chief executive officer thank you i ll pass the pipeline question in a second to justin it s a really positive story there actually but i would mention obviously many of you on the call have been following the cost of capital developments both for sdg e pg e and edison i will remind you that the socalgas mechanism did not trigger we re going to follow this closely i think the key gating item that everyone in the state is following is the forthcoming scoping memo that we expect from the commission but in terms of forward guidance what we ve indicated in the past michael was that whether we get the automatic triggering mechanism or whether our applications approved is contemplated within our guidance for next year and because of some other steps that the business has taken to mitigate costs and become more efficient is probably in the range of 0 05 to 0 10 either way but well within our guidance range and we would not expect to update guidance independent of that outcome and then justin i think a lot of times particularly in domestic lng development there s always issues related to pipeline development i think it would be helpful to help our listening audience better understand what s unique about the pipeline system that supports vista pacifica justin bird chief executive officer yeah thank you thanks for the question michael yeah vista pacifico would effectively source gas from the permian from the us basin and deliver it in the form of lng to asia there are two existing pipelines that basically converge very close to the site so there would be a very small spur type pipeline that we would build that we connect vista pacifico to existing pipelines both of which are under utilized on a transmission capacity basis so i think very little pipeline construction associated with this this is part of the strategic location of the project is its proximity to pipelines and the fact that two of those pipelines are very under utilized michael lapides goldman sachs analyst got it and just one quick follow up are you the only lng or potential lng project competing to utilize those pipes justin bird chief executive officer sorry michael can you repeat that question jeffrey w martin chairman and chief executive officer what he s asking is is your project the only one that s competing relative to those pipelines justin bird chief executive officer oh i think there is another existing development project that is north that is trying to get some capacity from one of those pipelines jeffrey w martin chairman and chief executive officer which we own justin bird chief executive officer which we own we own the pipeline yeah michael lapides goldman sachs analyst got it thanks guys jeffrey w martin chairman and chief executive officer thanks michael operator we ll take our next question from ryan levine with citi ryan levine citi analyst good morning jeffrey w martin chairman and chief executive officer good morning ryan ryan levine citi analyst hey jeff given the political uncertainty related to the cfe contracts in mexico are there any proactive steps the sip or broader sempra organization is considering to mitigate the counterparty risks or other broader opportunities to capitalize on the growth in mexico and then related does sempra have any differentiated impact relative to its sip partners in any policy change in mexico in conjunction with kkr agreement jeffrey w martin chairman and chief executive officer yeah i would start with your second question which is kkr has their own infrastructure presence in mexico both on the refined product side of the value chain as well as with renewables they are certainly collaborating with us constructively with cfe so that s been helpful i can make a couple of comments too ryan that because of our headquarters being here in san diego you ll recall that we ve been investing pretty consistently down in mexico for close to 25 years and what excites us back then still excites us today as you ve got about 130 million consumers it s one of the fastest growing consumer markets in the western hemisphere and most importantly it s the largest energy export partner for the united states at about 7 to 8 bcf per day i think even though we ve got kind of leading scale and expertise at sempra infrastructure we re still very selective about the projects we expect to invest in and even the vista pacifico project that justin was describing those capacity releases on some of those pipelines that would be needed would come from the government and this is really a government sponsored project and one that they ve been quite public about supporting from a permit and pipeline capacity standpoint but to your issue i think it s quite topical that there are reforms being proposed in electricity market i think you ll expect to see the lower house vote on that in the fourth quarter but it would not clear the legislature until probably april of next year and we handicap that as a low probability and what s interesting about this is those reforms largely target to the point you made ryan generation assets that are connected to the cfe system and today we have a relatively small footprint in generation across all of sempra because we re a t d business i think the electric investments in mexico account for roughly 1 of our consolidated earnings and more importantly the vast majority of all those projects something like 80 are on the border with california are not connected to cfe and dispatched directly into the cal iso but i would leave you with one thought which is probably the most important we made the decision several years ago that what we really want to do is help president lopez obrador be successful so the majority of our conversations are focused on ways that we can partner with his cabinet to make pemex be successful and make cfe be successful so when you see us announce projects like vista pacifico it s because those will be done largely in tandem with the objectives of the government that s one of the reasons we still feel good about those types of projects in mexico ryan levine citi analyst appreciate the color thank you jeffrey w martin chairman and chief executive officer thank you ryan operator we ll take our next question from paul zimbardo with bank of america jeffrey w martin chairman and chief executive officer good morning paul paul zimbardo bank of america analyst hi good morning team a question if you could discuss at a high level just how you re seeing some of the latest cost estimates change for the brownfield and greenfield development projects however you want to frame it whether its percentage changes or just how to think about the latest commodity backdrop jeffrey w martin chairman and chief executive officer so i think there is two parts to that question number one is this issue of how much inflation are we seeing in terms of how we source our soft and hard costs at any of our projects including our utilities and we ve got obviously some built in mechanisms that help us with that on the utility side in justin s business you recall that we re very reliant on epc wrap contracts so the procurement and exposure to costs we shift that risk to the construction contractor and that s why it s important that they have strong credit counterparties but in terms of brownfield versus greenfield i think the way allen answered at a very general level is to say brownfield projects always have a cost advantage and greenfield projects can be also quite viable typically they need to be done at scale and port arthur would be an example of that but coming back to our projects think about this for us to have the opportunity to turnkey 6 to 7 bcf i mean 6 to 7 mtpa at cameron expansion our view internally is it could be one of the lowest cost projects for new capacity in the world so our likelihood going forward there we account as being relatively high and that s why we ve got 100 of mous in place to get to the next step and move to heads agreement from the spas there and then at vista pacifico this the type of project very similar to eca phase 1 our expectation is it will be oversubscribed it is a greenfield project but the geographic location to be able to have direct pipeline access from two different pipelines to waha and to be able to directly into the pacific will be a tremendous and competitive advantage when we market that project paul zimbardo bank of america analyst okay now that s great and then shifting back to oncor thank you for that super detailed breakdown given the robust opportunity set should we think about october 2022 board meeting as the next opportunity for refresh or should we think more of the 2021 pattern where those updates sprinkle throughout the year jeffrey w martin chairman and chief executive officer it s such a great question and i hate to foreshadow that we re going to be sprinkling things throughout the year but i ll give allen great credit it wasn t that they had an ongoing process just to update their plan they were looking at issues in the market around inflation and how they saw supply chain issues in advance so the real genesis of allen updating capex guidance was he came back to the board so that they can make forward purchases that allow them to keep their 2021 and 2022 capital plans in place so what they were doing is they were reaching forward to source what they needed to execute those capital plans so i think you would expect his team to do something very similar as they are watching the marketplace if there s opportunities to adjust it they will and i think he made a great case for it we didn t cannibalize that incremental bucket list that s been replenished and as we look going forward i think that they will continue to look for opportunities to take price risk away from their capital program and ensure that they can deliver the plan they have on the street today paul zimbardo bank of america analyst again great to hear thank you all jeffrey w martin chairman and chief executive officer yeah thank you for joining us operator we ll take our next question from craig shere with tuohy brothers jeffrey w martin chairman and chief executive officer hello craig craig shere tuohy brothers analyst hi good morning in your time so do you see the potential for topolobampo jumping ahead of port arthur in the new project cue and did i hear correctly that the focus will be on securing equity from partners outside of sip where needed if external equity is required for construction of three simultaneous accretive lng projects eca phase 1 cameron phase 2 and of course something else jeffrey w martin chairman and chief executive officer yeah a couple of things here is the topolobampo project will be very similar in scale to eca phase 1 kind of in that 3 to 4 million tonne per annum size it definitely can jump ahead of port arthur so that s the answer to your first question we certainly are quite bullish both on cameron expansion which is 6 to 7 mtpa as well as the vista pacifico project which is closer to 4 million tonnes per annum in terms of equity we re very comfortable with the level we re at today with kkr certainly if we saw opportunities to diversify the capital structure at sempra infrastructure at points in the future at higher valuations we would evaluate that against the opportunity to bring in equity down at the project level but definitely there s an interest to attract equity participation at the project level given the size and scale of our expectations around lng craig shere tuohy brothers analyst that s very helpful and the last question maybe justin if you want to opine but we ve kind of noticed that equity cargo capacity that can be delivered years in advance of new train construction appears to be a major selling point for new long term contracting like the latest venture global announcement included some short term supply off their calcasieu pass how do you see this market dynamic playing out with respect to sip s portfolio jeffrey w martin chairman and chief executive officer yeah so it s a great point craig and i think you even saw cheniere s deal today had a lead in to the bigger capacity coming at the long term so i would say i wish i had capacity i could sell right now to bridge some of the construction on these other projects because i do think it is a competitive advantage the market is very hot right now and people are looking for volumes in the next few years and then looking for potential excess volumes that could be available via the partners out of cameron or when eca phase 1 comes online looking for some additional volumes as production actually starts and we see what production looks like so yes i think you raise a great point having volumes to bridge into these long term contracts i would say is a competitive advantage and it s something that we re focused on and looking for opportunities to find those types of bridging arrangements craig shere tuohy brothers analyst great thank you very much operator thank you that we will conclude our question

cybersecurity experts say microsoft s recent disclosure that alleged russian hackers successfully attacked several it service providers this year is a sign that many u s it companies have underinvested in security measures needed to protect themselves and their customers from intrusions but a u s based association of it professionals says the industry s efforts to combat foreign hacking attacks are hampered by their customers not practicing good cyber habits and by the federal government not doing enough to punish and deter the hackers in an october 24 blog post microsoft said a russian nation state hacking group that it calls nobelium spent three months attacking companies that resell customize and manage microsoft cloud services and other digital technologies for public and private customers microsoft said it informed 609 of those companies known as managed service providers or msps that they had been attacked 22 868 times by nobelium from july 1 to october 19 this year well known techniques as of its october 24 blog post microsoft said it determined that as many as 14 of the resellers and service providers had been compromised in the nobelium attacks which it said involved the use of well known techniques like password spray and phishing to steal legitimate credentials and gain privileged access nobelium is the same group that microsoft said was responsible for last year s cyberattack on u s software company solarwinds that attack involved inserting malicious code into solarwinds it performance monitoring system orion and gave the hackers access to the networks of thousands of u s public and private organizations that use orion to manage their it resources the white house said in april that it believed the perpetrators of the solarwinds hack were part of the russian foreign intelligence service or svr in an october 29 statement published by russian network rbc tv russia s foreign ministry dismissed as groundless microsoft s accusation that svr was behind the recent cyberattacks on it companies it also said microsoft should have shared data on the attacks with the russian government s national coordination center for computer incidents to aid a professional and effective dialogue to identify those involved voa asked microsoft whether the company had communicated with moscow regarding the latest hacking incidents but microsoft declined to comment it also has not disclosed the names or locations of any of the targeted or compromised it companies charles weaver chief executive of the u s based international association of cloud and managed service providers also known as mspalliance told voa that he had not heard of any of his organization s members being affected by the latest nobelium attacks mspalliance describes itself as the world s largest industry group for people who manage hardware software and cloud computing services for customers it says it has more than 30 000 members worldwide about two thirds of them based in north america insufficient attention the apparently successful cyberattacks on microsoft linked it companies are a sign that u s msps are not putting enough priority on cybersecurity said jake williams a chief technology officer at u s cybersecurity company breachquest and a former u s national security agency elite hacking team member the profit margins for msps are often razor thin and in the majority of cases they compete purely on cost williams told voa in an interview any work they do that doesn t directly translate to additional revenue is generally not happening one cybersecurity practice that more msps should adopt is the sharing of information with u s authorities about hacking incidents said james curtis a cybersecurity program director at webster university in missouri in a conversation with voa s russian service curtis a retired u s air force cyber officer and a former it industry executive said msps do not like to admit they have been hacked they don t want to share that their users information has been stolen because it may hurt their bottom line and may hurt their stock prices and so they try to handle that internally he said the msp community is not perfect weaver said our members face a lot of cyberattacks and their job is to protect their customers against these things for 21 years mspalliance has strived to promote best practices for our global community and we will continue to incrementally improve as fast and as often as we can but weaver said criticism of msps for not devoting enough attention to cybersecurity is misplaced customer practices msps have been urging their customers to make easy and inexpensive fixes such as adopting multifactor authentication to back up their data to the cloud weaver said but i personally have witnessed a lot of nonconformity amongst the customers they have to be the ones that ultimately pay for and allow msps to deploy those fixes the biden administration also has used a variety of tools this year to try to protect u s targets from russian and other foreign hackers in may president joe biden issued an executive order for u s authorities to tighten cybersecurity contractual requirements for it companies that work with the federal government the order said the companies should be required to share more information with federal agencies about cyber incidents impacting the it services provided to those agencies in an earlier action in april the biden administration sanctioned six russian technology companies for providing support to what it called malicious cyber activities of russia s intelligence services senior u s officials also have used diplomacy to try to expand international participation in a counter ransomware initiative cri a u s national security council statement issued wednesday said deputy national security adviser anne neuberger briefed representatives of 35 countries tuesday on the outcome of last month s first cri meeting of experts from law enforcement cybersecurity financial regulators and foreign affairs ministries chris morgan an intelligence analyst at britain based cybersecurity company digital shadows told voa the stronger cybersecurity practices mandated by the u s government for federal contractors will not necessarily be voluntarily adopted by it companies working in the private sector one such mandated practice is for federal contractors to adopt a zero trust security model in which users who log in to a network are not automatically trusted to do whatever they like within that network but must instead undergo continual authentication larger government role implementing zero trust is a real change in the way that your network is managed and comes with significant costs i think that s the reason why a lot of companies are quite hesitant to do so morgan said i think a lot of people would like the u s government to take a more active role in combating cybercrime weaver of mspalliance said applying federal cybersecurity regulations to the entire private sector is not a good idea because different industries such as banking health care and energy have different it needs he also said the u s government could effectively curb ransomware attacks by doing more to hold the perpetrators accountable cyberattacks are a big business yet the hackers are in countries beyond the reach of our law enforcement weaver said so you have a business model that has no disincentive to stop and all we have are the it guardians against those attacks i just don t think that putting regulations on the guardians is going to solve this

chief financial officer matt garth following doug and matt s prepared remarks we ll open it up to questions i d like to remind you that beginning on page 15 of our 2020 10 k we list the various risk factors and conditions that may affect our future results and i ll also point out the safe harbor disclaimer on this slide statements related to future performance by members of our team are subject to these limitations cautionary remarks and conditions now i ll turn the call over to doug doug douglas t dietrich chairman and chief executive officer thanks erik good morning everyone appreciate you joining today s call i ll go through our third quarter results at a high level including our sales performance and how we manage through a variety of challenging dynamics i ll then take some time to describe the progress we re making with our growth initiatives and our team s solid execution on several fronts i ll then turn it over to matt to discuss our financial results in more detail and expectations for the fourth quarter and then we ll open the call to questions let me start with a recap of the quarter first and foremost market demand has remained robust across all of our product lines and geographies we delivered strong results marked by another record quarter of earnings per share of 1 30 performance was achieved while managing through a challenging operating landscape with supply chain and inflationary pressures across our businesses sales for the quarter were 473 million or 17 higher on an organic basis and up 22 including sales from the recent normerica acquisition we saw sales increases in every segment and across every geography for more perspective on our organic growth the projects we ve initiated and i ve discussed with you over the past year contributed approximately 5 to our organic growth in the quarter said another way about 5 of our growth was delivered from new projects and technologies initiated over the past year 12 from market growth and 5 from the acquisition of normerica strength of our operating capabilities is reflected in how we successfully managed through the external conditions we faced this quarter which enabled us to generate 63 million of operating income a 22 increase over last year performance was achieved within the context of a myriad of external issues including rising costs truck rail and shipping logistics challenges difficulties finding talented people to support expanding production significant energy cost increases that became more pronounced during the quarter and continued challenges presented from the covid pandemic despite these issues we kept our inventory and supply positions for key raw materials and commodities in good shape we acted quickly to solidify our pricing leadership across our product portfolio and to address the inflationary cost pressures that accelerated over the past few months and we tightly controlled expenses and continued to drive productivity improvements not to be forgotten we navigated everything while also seamlessly integrating normerica into our company cash flow remains strong and through the first nine months of the year cash from operations is up 10 compared to 2020 we completed our share repurchase authorization last week we initiated a new one year 75 million program strong cash flow and solid balance sheet gives us the flexibility to continue to allocate capital to shareholders while also investing in attractive organic and inorganic growth opportunities overall we had a very strong quarter in terms of financial and operational performance needless to say there was a high level of activity this quarter and our execution speaks to the capabilities of our team who did a great job operating the company safely and efficiently while remaining focused on delivering for our customers now let me take you through some of the year to date sales highlights outline the contribution from our recent growth projects and describe the initiatives that will further advance our sales trajectory we ve discussed with you the initiatives we ve executed over the last year which have been key contributors to our growth in 2021 we ve also advanced several new projects this quarter that will support further sales growth going forward very encouraged with our continued progress on our growth strategy which is focused on geographic expansion new product development and acquisitions demand trends are favorable across our markets but the sales growth demonstrated in our businesses has been further bolstered by our new projects aimed toward higher growth markets and also from investments we ve made to strengthen our portfolio of value added products let me provide some perspective on what we ve realized through the third quarter from these projects and then detail our new initiatives new technologies and recent acquisitions that will accelerate growth i ll start with our household and personal care and specialty product line where our broad portfolio of consumer oriented businesses continues to perform very well resulting in organic sales growth of 13 year to date and 20 including the recent addition of normerica this growth is a result of our leading positions in structurally growing and stable markets but it s been enhanced through our investments in new products capacity expansions and by extending the geographical reach of each of these businesses our global pet care business is an example of this with its portfolio of premium products new online sales channels and broad global presence which has led to above market growth rates we re also realizing significant sales increases in other consumer specialty applications such as edible oil purification and personal care these are businesses where we ve made targeted investments to enhance our technology portfolio and expand our manufacturing capabilities to reach a broader customer base in europe and asia our global metalcasting business remains on its consistent growth track with sales up 30 year to date driven by strong demand from both north america and asia foundries serving a diverse customer base in automotive heavy truck and agriculture markets specifically penetration of our blended products continues to expand in asia as sales increased 30 compared to last year with 29 growth in china alone while much of our growth is driven by our penetration in china we continue to demonstrate our value proposition in other countries with attractive long term growth fundamentals in india which is the second largest gray and ductile iron casting market globally sales of our blended products are up 50 over 2020 our pcc business has been delivering a strong performance this year sales were up 17 year to date as uncoated freesheet paper demand continues to improve in all regions we ve also benefited from the ramp up of 200 000 tons of new capacity that we ve brought online over the past year which includes a 150 000 ton facility in china and another 50 000 ton satellite in india production at our 40 000 ton expansion for a packaging application in europe was also just commissioned in the third quarter for perspective sales realized from these latest satellites were responsible for 5 of the 17 pcc growth so far this year our fourth quarter pcc volumes are currently projected to be above where they were in 2019 more than absorbing the volume loss from our four paper machine shutdowns that occurred since then moving forward we have several other new satellite projects under construction that set this business up for continued sales growth next year in addition to the capacity i just mentioned another 40 000 ton satellite in india will start up this quarter and we ve begun building another 50 000 ton satellite in china which should be operational in the first half of next year we ve also just reached an agreement and expect to sign a contract over the next couple of weeks with a new customer in india for another 22 000 ton satellite it will be our ninth satellite in india after entering the market with our pcc technology 10 years ago in total with the satellites just commissioned and ramping up combined with these three new satellites we see the 5 growth rate from new satellites continuing through next year pipeline of new satellite projects remains robust we re expanding our addressable market opportunities with new products and technologies for the packaging market which i ll describe in a moment i ll finish up the year to date growth highlights with our refractory segment it s been a very impressive year for this segment with growth of 22 marked by steel utilization rates noticeably improving over last year growth also reflects this team s success in capturing new business over the past six months we ve secured seven contracts worth 100 million over the next five years two of which were signed during the third quarter we ve been able to secure these new contracts in the electric arc furnace market through the deployment of our new portfolio of differentiated refractory products and high performance laser measurement solutions which reduced costs and improved furnace safety for our customers i ve discussed how we re investing in several new technologies and i want to share with you how they re beginning to pay off specifically a few areas where we ve broadened our product offering to enter adjacent growing markets i ll highlight two significant areas first our paper pcc business has been developing new technologies processes and products to accelerate our growth beyond high value filler for uncoated freesheet paper and into the adjacent packaging market we ve made significant progress over the past two years deploying pcc into white top linerboard more recently we ve been developing new products for other packaging applications including ground calcium carbonate for white carton board and alternate mineral products for brown packaging these are attractive and growing packaging markets and we re developing a more comprehensive product portfolio to reach this broader customer base currently we re working to finalize a long term contract with a premier white carton board customer in china that would represent a significant step for us into this adjacent market we also recently concluded customer trials with our alternative mineral products for brown packaging here in the us with an expanding product portfolio and a pipeline of potential customers we believe the packaging market represents a real avenue for new long term growth excuse me a second another project in our technology pipeline that we re very encouraged with is fluoro sorb which addresses pfas contamination in groundwater in last call i shared with you details about our first major commercialization for a large scale project at a north american department of defense location this project went well and its success has helped to advance our other opportunities in fact we re currently working to secure several other large projects in the drinking water and soil stabilization markets as this sector continues to develop and regulatory bodies focus on implementing changes we re well positioned to capture new opportunities with our patented technology to finish up the discussion on our growth for the future i ll take you through how we ve strengthened our business through recent acquisitions first we completed the normerica acquisition during the quarter and the integration is progressing well the team has been in place working on a variety of activities with our new colleagues to integrate all facets of the business and deploy our culture of safety and operational excellence everyone has done a tremendous job making this a seamless transition we re still in the early stages but the knowledge we ve gained over the past three months has only further validated our thesis when we acquired normerica we ve identified significant opportunities in the north america cat litter market for our broader portfolio of private label products and we see a clear pathway to drive higher growth rates and profits in our pet care business in addition yesterday we acquired the specialty pcc assets from mississippi lime company this bolt on transaction helps expand our manufacturing reach into the midwest united states and gives us a strategic logistics footprint at a key point along the mississippi river the strategy is to leverage our latest technologies such as rheology modifiers for sealant applications throughout our specialty pcc plant system in the us let me leave you with a few takeaways we continue to build mti into a stronger company on all fronts and take actions to balance our portfolio to generate higher more sustainable growth sales mix has evolved over the past few years with 30 of our revenue now coming from stable and growing consumer oriented markets projects i described to you demonstrate how we re leveraging our newest technologies to drive growth in our current markets and enter attractive adjacent markets we also underscore how we continue to drive penetration of our core product lines in growing geographies our recent acquisitions further supplement this momentum and all taken together we have meaningfully shifted our sales trajectory going forward specifically for next year we see our sales growth moving north of 10 and this sales trajectory along with our strong operating capabilities provides a powerful combination for significant long term value generation with that let s turn it over to matt to go through our quarter performance in more detail matt matthew e garth senior vice president finance and treasury and chief financial officer thanks doug i ll review our third quarter results the performance of our segments as well as our outlook for the fourth quarter and now let s review the third quarter results sales in the third quarter were 22 higher than the prior year and 4 higher sequentially organic growth for the company was 17 versus the prior year and the acquisition of normerica contributed the remainder of the growth in the quarter operating income excluding special items was 63 2 million up 23 versus the prior year and was relatively flat versus the second quarter operating margin was 13 4 it s worth noting that excluding normerica operating margin was 13 8 for the quarter as we have stated previously the normerica acquisition will become income accretive beginning in the fourth quarter as integration activities progress the year over year operating income bridge on the top right of this slide shows volume and mix contributed 14 9 million driven by our strategic growth initiatives and the broad based volume growth we ve seen across our end markets you can also see the significant inflationary cost we experienced 18 4 million in the third quarter alone driven by energy freight and raw materials such as lime and packaging to give you some perspective we saw energy pricing go up by anywhere from 50 to 400 depending on the location and power source with the most dramatic increases in the uk and europe we offset 10 7 million of these inflationary costs with continued price increases including contractual pass through mechanisms in paper pcc and negotiated price actions in the rest of the business the sequential bridge on the bottom right shows how inflation accelerated from the second quarter to the third quarter by 10 million more than half the total year over year impact however this bridge also shows how quickly we acted to implement pricing offsetting nearly 70 of the sequential increase in fact we ve implemented a variety of pricing mechanisms in several of our businesses to recoup the higher costs that we had to absorb in the third quarter due to the rapid nature of the increases particularly on energy the price adjustments we are making in the fourth quarter will help us to fully catch up on the cost we have absorbed by the first quarter of 2022 meanwhile we continue to control overhead expenses with sg a as a percent of sales at 10 6 150 basis points below the prior year and 70 basis points lower sequentially earnings per share excluding special items was 1 30 the second consecutive record quarter for the company and represented 41 growth versus the prior year and now let s review the segments in more detail starting with performance materials third quarter sales for performance materials were 250 4 million 23 higher than the prior year and 5 higher sequentially the acquisition of normerica contributed 10 growth versus the prior year and organic sales contributed an additional 13 household personal care and specialty products sales were 30 above the prior year driven by normerica and continued strong demand for consumer oriented products sales were 19 higher sequentially primarily driven by the acquisition metalcasting sales were 10 higher than the prior year driven by stronger demand globally and continued penetration of green sand bond technologies in asia the impact of lower automotive production has been limited on our sales as foundry customer demand has remained strong across a broad set of other industrial markets sales were 9 lower sequentially primarily due to typical seasonal foundry maintenance outages environmental products sales grew 32 versus the prior year on improved demand for environmental lining systems remediation and wastewater treatment building materials sales grew 18 versus the prior year and 3 sequentially on higher levels of project activity operating income for the segment was 32 6 million and operating margin was 13 of sales margin was temporarily impacted by unfavorable product mix the timing of pricing actions relative to cost increases as well as the incremental sales from normerica operating margin excluding normerica was 13 9 we are in the early stages of the integration process with normerica and i m pleased to report that the back office and financial process integration is progressing well now looking to the fourth quarter we see continued strong demand for household and personal care and we expect metalcasting volumes to improve sequentially as foundry demand remained strong in both north america and asia i d like to remind you that we typically experience higher mining and energy costs in the colder months and this could have a temporary impact on our margins in addition acceleration of input costs that we saw in the third quarter is resulting in a lack of inflation versus pricing that we expect to continue in the fourth quarter as i mentioned we have pricing actions in place to catch up on these increases in the first quarter of 2022 overall we expect operating income for this segment to be slightly lower sequentially as higher operating costs will temporarily offset continued strength across our end markets also some uncertainty with respect to power outages in china which could also temporarily impact our volumes in the fourth quarter and now let s move to specialty minerals specialty minerals sales were 146 9 million in the third quarter 17 higher than the prior year and 3 higher sequentially spcc sales grew 17 versus the prior year and 3 sequentially on recovering paper pcc demand the continued ramp up of three new satellite plants and higher spcc demand from automotive construction and consumer end markets process minerals sales grew 18 versus the prior year and 2 sequentially on continued strength in residential construction and consumer end markets process minerals sales as i just spoke about did grow 18 and segment operating income was 18 4 million and operating margin was 12 5 of sales ordering was temporarily impacted by the timing of contractual and negotiated price increases relative to cost increases this segment has seen the most acute impact from energy and raw material cost increases with inflationary cost increases of 9 million partially offset by 5 million pricing in the third quarter alone we have implemented price adjustments to cover these cost increases and we should be caught up in the first quarter and as we have demonstrated we will continue to adjust pricing as necessary to keep pace with additional cost increases now moving to the fourth quarter we expect modestly higher pcc volume sequentially as the ramp up of our new satellite in india will be partially offset by the paper machine shutdown in jackson alabama we see continued strength in specialty pcc and processed minerals in what is typically a seasonally weaker period for our residential construction end markets in addition we will have a timing lag as our price adjustments catch up to the cost increases we have absorbed we see margins rebounding to more normal levels as pricing actions take hold and overall for the segment we expect fourth quarter operating income to be similar to the third quarter and now let s turn to the review of the refractory segment refractory segment sales were 75 9 million in the third quarter 28 higher than the prior year and 2 higher sequentially as demand remained strong for refractory and metallurgical products we also had modestly higher laser measurement equipment sales in the quarter however we continue to experience delays in being able to perform on site installations and maintenance in this product line segment operating income was 13 2 million a quarterly record and 81 higher than the prior year and 13 higher sequentially operating margin was strong at 17 4 of sales and was also a record performance looking to the fourth quarter we expect another strong performance from this segment however we expect slightly lower sales and operating income to be down approximately 2 million now let s take a look at our cash flow and liquidity highlights cash flow from operations was 163 1 million year to date compared to 148 4 million in the prior year up 10 capital expenditures were 63 million year to date versus 45 8 million in the prior year as we continue to invest in high return projects the company used a portion of free cash flow to repurchase 63 million of shares year to date and the share repurchase authorization from the prior year was completed in october the board of directors authorized a new 75 million one year share repurchase program on october 20 2021 as of the end of the third quarter total liquidity was over 500 million and our net leverage ratio was 2 2 times ebitda our balance sheet is in a very strong position which provides us with the flexibility we need to continue to invest in high value high return growth opportunities we expect strong cash flow generation to continue in the fourth quarter with free cash flow in the 150 million range for the full year now let me summarize our outlook for the fourth quarter overall we see robust end market demand across our segments with typical construction end market seasonality we expect demand for our growing portfolio of consumer oriented products to remain strong inflationary cost pressures have persisted into the fourth quarter and we have pricing actions in place to mitigate these increases in the quarter and fully catch up by the first quarter of 2022 while it s still early in the integration process for normerica it s progressing well and we will begin to realize accretion from this acquisition in the fourth quarter and overall for the company we expect another strong performance with operating income around 60 million as we have demonstrated throughout the year we have navigated uncertainty and a number of obstacles to deliver our strong financial performance and we expect to continue to execute well as we close out 2021 we have solid growth momentum across our segments and with the growth initiatives outlined earlier in the call we are set up well for a strong 2022 with that let s turn to q a questions and answers operator thank you our first question from silke kueck with jpmorgan silke kueck jpmorgan analyst good morning how are you douglas t dietrich chairman and chief executive officer good silke how are you silke kueck jpmorgan analyst good a couple of questions my first question is i was wondering if you can talk about what your offshore onshore split sort of offshore and domestic splitters in paper pcc at the end of the year and how many tons you think you would sell this year in total versus next year given the progression of the start up that s my first question matthew e garth senior vice president finance and treasury and chief financial officer so your offshore onshore volumes silke kueck jpmorgan analyst i was wondering what your split is like right like in tonnage terms like how much you sell onshore offshore by the end of the year and what are the total tons that you think you ll sell this year and how many tons you think you ll sell next year matthew e garth senior vice president finance and treasury and chief financial officer so the split if we look on a in the quarter silke it was about 30 and when you say onshore you re talking about north america silke kueck jpmorgan analyst yeah matthew e garth senior vice president finance and treasury and chief financial officer so the rest would have been international or offshore when you look at it on a year to date basis it would be the same as doug said we re growing volumes and that contributed to the 5 growth that you saw in paper pcc and that s coming from mostly international so that mix is going to grow more internationally as we move forward silke kueck jpmorgan analyst okay matthew e garth senior vice president finance and treasury and chief financial officer does that answer silke kueck jpmorgan analyst it does typically like you have tons in pcc are like somewhere like the roughly like 3 million tons or so and i was like wondering what you re like targeting for like next year matthew e garth senior vice president finance and treasury and chief financial officer so as you saw i mean you can see the volumes here in q3 were about 700 000 tons with that ramp up that s taking place and as we ve told you before we ll be closer to the 3 million ton mark here for the full year and then i don t know if you want to talk d j any further about anything that s taking place into 2022 but doug outlined for you that you re going to see another 5 in paper pcc into next year d j monagle group president specialty minerals and refractories silke it s d j and so just to augment that doug had mentioned the two satellites that are just coming online so those are all but one in europe will continue to grow that s in the packaging sector and then another one in india that will continue to ramp up china will continue to ramp up over time and then that capacity that s coming online is another 50 000 tons in china and then doug mentioned we ve got very strong level of confidence that we ll also be growing india further with another 20 000 some tons so majority of that will be growing offshore and then we did we have mentioned that there is a restart that will be happening in the us at domtar which will be changing to paper excellence over time but that restart is in the neighborhood of 30 000 tons so still majority is going to be going offshore i would tell you also that as i look at the business development pipeline that is ahead of us i would say 70 of those opportunities are offshore opportunities so that s the split that we re seeing silke kueck jpmorgan analyst okay that s helpful thank you and then you mentioned that you ve signed several contracts on the refractory side and i was wondering whether you could also quantify that what do you think the contribution from those will be for the next year or maybe it has to be looked at over like a longer period of time i was just wondering whether you can quantify that in any way and the second question on the refractories business is i was wondering whether you are affected in any way purchasing a dead burned magnesia like it s a little hard to tell what the supply demand issues are and i was just like wondering how you re situated douglas t dietrich chairman and chief executive officer sure let me start and then i ll hand it over to brett to give you more just to give you more detail on the contracts so the contracts that we ve signed as i mentioned are about 100 million over the next five years and they re pretty equally spaced i think some of them will start to accrue to us early in the year so if you can think about it silke this is kind of a 20 million per year over the next five year kind of space the business is about 300 million right now so it s a significant kind of built in growth right there the contracts are in more toward the electric arc furnace and they ve been really promoting our new technologies and so before i answer the mgo question maybe brett can do it let me pass it over and i ll give you a little bit more detail on these contracts and kind of how we ve approached them with these new technologies brett brett argirakis senior vice president and managing director minteq international inc and mti global supply chain yeah thanks thanks silke the refractory business we continue to transform this business into a safer more high tech company we ve focused our efforts in developing the automated refractory and wire injection equipment to be safer and move people away from really high temperature heat as doug mentioned we did sign seven contracts this year over 100 million over the next five years the new equipment that we utilize has our laser technology tied to it so we re able to measure the electric furnaces or steel ladles the lining thickness it feeds the information to our robotic scantrol equipment and then it applies our refractory products to the appropriate areas the application the key to this is being able to do it remotely keeping the operators out of harm s way away from very high temperatures then in addition the r d team has done a great job in expanding our product portfolio so we re now able to apply product in all areas of the furnace rather than specific areas prior to the new developments and then really lastly is the continuation of our stmo service group our customers really have a lot of confidence in these guys and they re able to support their refractory programs and maintain our equipment as these programs continue to develop from an mgo standpoint we are in a pretty good position we ve prepared ourselves we buy mgo from both china and turkey so we ve positioned ourselves well and really preparing ahead of schedule for the china olympics so we re in pretty good shape there douglas t dietrich chairman and chief executive officer does that help silke silke kueck jpmorgan analyst yeah douglas t dietrich chairman and chief executive officer so we re in good spot from our inventory positions and i take that from certainly from the refractories business in how we ve diversified our supply base made sure that those inventories are in good shape to support the customers but i d say that also across the company in other businesses silke kueck jpmorgan analyst lastly i was wondering if you can talk about where like where the pricing benefits were flowing for like i know there s like 5 million specialty minerals but i think overall you got like 11 million like where does the rest of the pricing come in douglas t dietrich chairman and chief executive officer it s across the business i d say let me give you a quick example of the dynamics that s going on this year a typical year our specialty minerals business the two pieces the paper pcc and kind of the performance process minerals piece on the paper pcc side scheduled price increases right so every six months once a year prices move up and those are contractual and that continues and we have those protections in those contracts so that will be taken care of on its normal timing on the process minerals side you see once a year setting the pricing up i will tell you this year we ve changed our prices four times we re on our fifth increase we are using different mechanisms to make sure that we re covered so it s been a very dynamic pricing year and i think you re probably hearing about that a lot out there in the market so the majority of the inflation that we talked about was coming into this business a lot of that in the third quarter was energy acted very quickly to get our pricing and mechanisms in place to have all of that covered there is about a month lag between some of that absorption and the pricing change just because it takes some time to move some things through and that s why fully through the fourth quarter and into the it will take a month into the first quarter we have that covered however we expect that pricing or costs are going to continue to change and so we ll continue to make those adjustments as necessary to make sure that we keep ourselves covered so i d say the majority of that pricing to your question is going into the smi business that s not to say that we have another 50 of it or 40 of it is probably in the process minerals are in the performance materials segment sorry about that silke kueck jpmorgan analyst okay that s helpful thank you very much i ll get back into queue operator thank you we ll take our next question from daniel moore with cjs securities please go ahead daniel moore cjs securities analyst thank you good morning thanks for taking my questions doug you got my ears burning in those prepared remarks you said next year sales trajectory north of goes north of 10 and i was typing really fast so is that across the board and walk us through that may be by segment product end market kind of where you see the biggest drivers there douglas t dietrich chairman and chief executive officer yes that s a number that we re looking for mti in total i think we ll give you more details on how that breaks down by segment as we go forward dan but at a high level what s behind that is a couple of things and i think in the beginning of my comments i tried to break out for you the organic growth that s occurring today in this quarter 5 so we grew organically 17 this quarter but if you take away the market aspects right that was 12 of our growth 5 came alone from the organic projects right so 5 new satellites new technologies the market positioning and the growth in those geographies moving into these adjacencies the growth of our consumer oriented products which is i think it grew 13 the consumer growth was 13 year over year so you have a 30 of the company growing at that kind of 11 12 13 range you ve got the new satellites in the paper pcc business growing at 5 so all told of the ins and outs we grew just in the third quarter organically without market 5 you then take the normerica acquisition which will be another 5 and that s as the market planes over next year let s say it just stayed flat we think that 10 is delivered both organically and inorganically next year and honestly i think we can add to that with some projects that we might pull in between now and the next six months right so we ve got a level of confidence that says we can deliver that next year and then further out in my remarks we re trying to show you the things that we re investing in how we re positioning ourselves even as we plane over from normerica next third quarter the projects that we have in hand and the momentum we have in our businesses we think we can keep that going now i ve always said this business can grow at mid single digits if not higher supplemented by acquisitions and i think next year you re going to see that these just come out daniel moore cjs securities analyst all right very helpful normerica i guess it should turn accretive by q4 when is that accretive to operating income margins or neutral when do we kind of see that flipping given potential synergies douglas t dietrich chairman and chief executive officer so i will tell you that normerica right now is not accretive we showed you that chart in performance materials as it sits today and not accretive to those performance materials margins that was part of where we saw value in the business being able to operate it differently capture synergies through that business and its combination and the vertical integration with our mines and so it will take a little bit of time i think we said last quarter we ll probably by the second third quarter of next year we feel we ll have that fully integrated and then we feel those margins will be up there at that average if not maybe higher in total for the company so it will be accretive but it s not currently and we need to make sure we move through methodically move through and continue with the integration and capture those savings that we saw when we went into it that s what i mentioned i think it s not only our thesis when we bought it is intact but also that will come from leveraging that position that we have in the packaged cat litter business and we see those sales opportunities out there so we re working on making sure we get the operation straight safe integrate employees bring them into our culture and then we think we ve got a really nice platform to grow from so we ll get there dan it s not going to be in the next quarter or two though daniel moore cjs securities analyst yeah that s perfect shifting gears obviously you ve done a really much better and remarkable job in terms of pricing in a very dynamic environment that said if we just focus on sort of logistics transportation input costs what s the cadence been over the past few months of direction of that inflation supply chain challenges and logistics challenges is it starting to plateau or ease a bit in certain areas what can you say about that will we need to continue to play catch up is the question matthew e garth senior vice president finance and treasury and chief financial officer yeah and dan when you take a look as we move from the second quarter to the third quarter right what we showed you on a quarter over quarter base was about 10 million and inflationary factors moving higher the biggest component of that delta change was the change in energy so you had that rapidity of move take place logistics raw materials we ve seen a steady uptrend in and what we talked about was the fact that that was going to continue into the fourth quarter and so you re now looking at a fourth quarter that for me a cost inflation perspective looks a lot like your third quarter that being said the pricing component we are narrowing on and the mechanisms that we have in place we re catching up on so that we have by the first quarter as doug said we re moving to be net neutral against those inflationary costs so you are seeing that take place raw materials have been about two thirds of what we re going to see this year in terms of the higher costs energy is going to make up the largest component of the rest so call it 60 raw materials 30 energy and 10 logistics with that logistics condition improving slightly some of those raw material components improving slightly but continuing like i said to have a fourth quarter that looks just on an inflationary cost year over year a lot like your third quarter daniel moore cjs securities analyst really helps matt metalcasting you continue to grow despite the well documented auto and chip shortages supply chain shortages looking out to next year is that the expectation even if sar kind of stays down do you see that opportunity to continue to grow at the levels that you described douglas t dietrich chairman and chief executive officer yeah we do we see i ll pass to jon to give you more color but the foundry markets that we serve are not just automotive focused and i think you re seeing that and so i think there probably has been there has been some impact from auto on those foundry customers and that s been far outpaced by the growth both geographically where we re positioning ourselves and in the other markets that those foundry serve agriculture outside of automotive heavy equipment so those have done very well and i think we re going to continue to see that penetration rate and especially as i tried to mention today we re starting to see smaller markets that we have been seeding and developing like india smaller markets for us a very large market opportunity start to grow and those growth rates are starting to get to the point where they re making a difference and we think that s going to further supplement the growth so going into next year jon you want to talk a little bit about what we re seeing and what we re hearing in the marketplace around the foundry jonathan j hastings group president performance materials certainly hi dan couple of things to point out first of all some of the companies that we serve the foundries who supply the auto industry are relaying to us that the automakers are sending them signals that starting q1 and q2 they re going to be producing in excess of what they had produced in 2019 so very strong positive outlook starting in q1 of next year as doug has said we re pretty well diversified we re positioned extremely well across the globe we participate in the markets that have really good strong casting growth rates think about north america china india our penetration strategy continues to work extremely well we re working with customers who are demanding qualities that are equivalent to western technologies especially in india and china and as a result they re looking for high value blended products and so that s one of the key initiatives and key drivers of our growth doug mentioned that we are positioning ourselves we took advantage of the covid downturn and also some of the outages with chips and labor shortages that have occurred but we re positioning ourselves with our new customers so we re growing our share and our positions in each of these regions we re introducing the technologies the high value technologies we re supplying those new customers and we re positioning ourselves so that when the markets are fully functioning we re going to be very well positioned for future growth and we ll see that in 2022 daniel moore cjs securities analyst super lastly real quick on the capital allocation side the new share repurchase authorization given it s got kind of one year on it is the expectation that you would execute the full amount in that timeframe and secondly does that have any implications for the m a pipeline or simply that your balance sheet and free cash flow give you the flexibility to kind of pursue both avenues thanks again douglas t dietrich chairman and chief executive officer i think you hit it right on the head there dan i think yes we fully intend to execute within the timeline as we did this past one but i also think yes that it speaks to the flexibility the strong cash flow generation and the expectations that s going to continue the balance sheet and being able to both the options of being able to both return to shareholders and pursue bolt on acquisitions we also have a leverage position that if something other or larger we think we can handle that as well so i think it speaks both that the flexibility that we have with our cash flow and balance sheet to be able to do both matthew e garth senior vice president finance and treasury and chief financial officer and as we look out dan just to add one component to that just remember we did have about 100 million that we took on our revolver for the acquisition of normerica began paying that down in the fourth quarter and should have that over the next 12 months taken care of daniel moore cjs securities analyst very good appreciate the color douglas t dietrich chairman and chief executive officer thanks dan operator thank you we ll hear next from david silver with cl king david silver cl king analyst yeah hi good morning douglas t dietrich chairman and chief executive officer good morning david silver cl king analyst yes and a lot of good questions before that that puts me in a bind just kidding but i would like to ask maybe a bigger picture question about kind of your the energy cost environment that you re operating in i mean there was just some good commentary on the foundry side but what i m thinking with paper and steel i mean those are both very energy intensive industries that you re serving and the price of crude oil is certainly rising but the regional price for let s say natural gas has escalated pretty sharply and there s been headlines about some production cutbacks here and there so i was just wondering if maybe we could just hone in on your pcc business and maybe you re the steel making side of things i mean what is from your perspective what is the risk that may be elevated energy costs or some difficulty in availability may be in china or elsewhere energy availability kind of will negatively impact your operating plans over the next couple of quarters thank you douglas t dietrich chairman and chief executive officer so david i think over the next couple of quarters the risks are in that inflationary environment so and then i ll try to address the longer term i guess question you re asking in terms of the energy intensity of these things which i also think will be dealt with an inflationary environment that s a different set of challenges countries and industries will have over the long term but in the short term and how we re looking at it we have absolutely seen a rapidly changing energy market i think you re probably hearing that around we re starting in the third quarter different by geography in north america and in the west coast it s been a little bit more electricity driven in terms of cost increases some natural gas given the changes of pricing in the united states i d say in europe much more acute in terms of natural gas pricing matt gave you a number that said we saw in some areas in europe a 400 increase of instantaneously through the third quarter we re having to deal with volatility like that and staying on top of it and making sure that we have our energy it s not about necessarily in our regions the availability of the amount it s what it s the changing rapidly changing pricing to get quoted in china a little bit different we re starting to see curtailments we saw some of them in the third quarter we weren t impacted significantly matt mentioned that is an uncertainty going into the fourth quarter that we could see further curtailments but we have seen some easing of coal prices in china and electricity has been a little bit more stable so i think we ve put all of that into what we re giving you in our forecast in the fourth quarter we ve got our pricing mechanisms and our inventories in a position in good position so we are covered in the short term and we have mechanisms in place that is as those energy cost change over the next year we ll be in a position to make sure that we were on top of that longer term though energy is going to be an issue and i don t know if we want to get into this call in terms of our conversion from fossil fuels to more greener sources but that will be something as a company we re dealing with that as we move to greener energy sources we are sourcing 40 of our electricity from green sources out in our wyoming facilities and we just changed to that so we are taking steps as a company to convert our business from coal to natural gas to cleaner sources to electricity and that electricity we re purchasing from greener sources already today you can see what we ve been doing over the past year in our sustainability report but hopefully that answers some of what the company is doing over the longer term and how we re dealing with it in the short term david silver cl king analyst yeah very helpful i d like to ask one more question maybe to go back to the m a and balance sheet question so you have concluded a couple of transactions in just the past few months including i think your largest acquisition since amcol in terms of the purchase price and i was just wondering if you could maybe comment on a couple of aspects i mean first regarding the m a funnel or project pipeline doug how would you characterize following these two deals i mean how would you characterize your project pipeline or potential target pipeline right now let s say relative to a year or two ago and then secondly maybe matt if you could just remind me but you have shown interest in projects of various sizes including some larger ones is there a way for us to think how high the company might go let s say above today s i think it s 2 1 times net debt to trailing 12 month ebitda i mean how high might the company be willing to go for the right acquisition and how important is maintaining your current credit ratings in the event that an unusually attractive but larger target was to present itself thank you douglas t dietrich chairman and chief executive officer okay let me start with the first one david in terms of the pipeline i guess i could answer it quickly that it s two projects smaller than it was couple of months ago but we have a good pipeline of projects that sit along those growth strategies that we have to support our businesses globally and as you ve seen move we have some opportunities to grow our consumer oriented product lines so though we ve executed on two of those that were in our pipeline just recently i do think that there is other opportunities that have moved in and things become more actionable so we ve maintained a similar sized pipeline and the things that we re attracted to if they became actionable than we were earlier in the year a year ago so about the same that said in that pipeline there are things that are smaller and we ve always said in the tens of millions of dollars of revenue type numbers and there are some that are bigger in the hundreds of millions of dollars of revenue type pipeline how far would we go to get some of the bigger ones i think i ve always answered the question that says it really depends on that target and it really depends on as we ve looked at it over time what we d be willing to do what we feel we can do with it and so if we feel from a risk standpoint and an understanding and fit with the culture of the company that the technologies that we have and the markets and how comfortable we are we see some things that fit very well with our company and there and if we know what we can get from a synergy standpoint we always look at things going in and on a post synergy basis and we look at that and make sure that they are going to be accretive to the value of the company after we know what we re going to do with it we take a lot of time to think about that how high does that take us well in amcol that took us up to about 4 4 times i m sorry to say this i m not going to say there s any limitation but that s at the higher end of the range right i don t think the things that we have in our pipeline requires to go there but if we find the right thing and we feel comfortable with it we re willing to make sure that we pay the right amount for it matthew e garth senior vice president finance and treasury and chief financial officer yes and david just to you heard doug talk about how and it was demonstrated i think in these last two acquisitions how we re managing the small and medium type bolt on acquisitions managing that with cash on hand using the revolver paying that down quickly based on the strong free cash flow that we have and that we will continue to generate and that is the flexibility that we talk about and have demonstrated over the past couple of years so that s the way we think about that transformationally doug just gave you some space there our conversations with credit rating agencies is very robust i think we have a very good metric result in terms of our rating and when you read their reports they reflect that they also reflect that there is optionality in our portfolio and that s why they rate us like i do rate us like they do so there would be some of that deal structure built into their current rating douglas t dietrich chairman and chief executive officer i d just say david that we re disciplined with that capital i think there s not a lot that you see sometimes they re not public but i d say we will walk away from there is more that we ve walked away from because we re just not willing to pay when we don t see the value in it so we keep to our knitting we make sure we look at things very robustly and we re really disciplined about how we re going to put that capital out to acquisitions david silver cl king analyst thanks very much appreciate it operator thank you we ll take our next question from marisa hernandez with sidoti company marisa hernandez sidoti company analyst thank you and good morning everybody douglas t dietrich chairman and chief executive officer hi marisa marisa hernandez sidoti company analyst so question on your commentary about implementing price increases during the fourth quarter that would allow you to catch up with some cost inflation by the end of the year what does that mean exactly how do you think about it in terms of percentage margin where would you like to be at perhaps relative to prior quarters or at the beginning of 2021 douglas t dietrich chairman and chief executive officer i want to make sure i understand the question in terms of the margin we re targeting let me see if i can answer it and you tell me if this is addressing it the right way so we will absorb costs there are many instances where we will absorb costs and then there is a timing aspect to some of our business in terms of contractually when we get to pass that through so there is some lag but when costs are going up there is a lag putting the pricing up but then as cost retreat there s a lag between where we take that price down that s largely in our paper and there s some other contract businesses we have there is also a practical speed at which you can put prices up for your customers and so we will absorb costs and the communication the changes the announcements and we ve been very quick to make those changes in the instance of our specialty minerals business where prices especially in the third quarter and energy went up very quickly there is maybe a month lag in terms of our ability to push that price change those prices and move that through and so therefore i ll give you an example november 1 so the third quarter costs were absorbed and november 1 prices changed that will be the end of january before that tranche has been absorbed now we ll continue to make those changes so it s a dynamic type environment but that s why we said we ve got it in place to be able to capture those increases that said that brings our margins as matt mentioned in that business going back to that historical kind of average of where they ve been so we look at that again with higher cost and higher pricing you also have to recover your margins in that pricing and so we target that as well so it s both on an absolute basis marisa and on a margin basis to make sure we re protecting that but there s a timing aspect to that change matthew e garth senior vice president finance and treasury and chief financial officer and just one clarification there what we said not by the end of the year but in the first quarter of 2022 is when we re going to see us catch up with the costs that we ve absorbed so far this year in 21 marisa hernandez sidoti company analyst okay thank you got it okay so you talk also about cost inflation persisting into the fourth quarter curious as to what the pace has been lately have you seen any slowdown or pick up of inflation in generally speaking and specifically in some pockets matthew e garth senior vice president finance and treasury and chief financial officer so when we came into the second quarter what we told you was that we had inflationary factors that we re in about that 7 million range that accelerated to about 18 million on a year over year basis in the third quarter and what i said previously was that you re looking at a fourth quarter that on a year over year basis is going to be in that 17 million to 18 million looks a lot like what we had seen in the third quarter the buckets of inflation started out in the second and third quarter really starting with energy that s now moved into raw materials logistics has been a steady march as we ve gone through that inflationary period and that is so you re bucket of raw materials on a full year basis has grown and that s what i said before it was about 60 of what we re anticipating for inflationary factors for the full year that being said what we also showed you was that pricing was also accelerating and for the fourth quarter you re going to see that gap narrow significantly again on that 17 million 18 million we have pricing in place that s going to bring us closer to fully capturing that and so when you look now into the first quarter that s why we have a viewpoint that we can catch up on what we ve absorbed so far this year marisa hernandez sidoti company analyst that s very helpful thank you and finally on the sales growth for 2022 north of about 10 does that require additional acquisitions in 2022 or not necessarily douglas t dietrich chairman and chief executive officer no not necessarily so we think that that s with current acquisitions from the back half of this year plus our growth rates in the projects that we have in hand that we re executing on as they ramp up in the new technologies that s how that number is derived marisa hernandez sidoti company analyst thank you very much operator thank you we ll now take our final question from mike harrison with seaport research partners mike harrison seaport research partners analyst hi good morning i was wondering if you could give some details around the specialty pcc assets what kind of revenue or ebitda contribution would you expect to see and i guess maybe give a little bit more detail on what made those assets attractive to minerals technologies douglas t dietrich chairman and chief executive officer let me start and then i ll pass through to d j but look this is a small bolt on acquisition it s we re not highlighting it because it s significant in terms of our system of our platform of specialty pcc production here in the united states it helps us from a logistics standpoint and at the moment relatively underutilized assets that we re going to upgrade to put in some technology so we re not necessarily disclosing the revenue size of it and what we paid for it but it will it s a small bolt on acquisition i don t know d j you want to give us a little more kind of what we re going to do with it d j monagle group president specialty minerals and refractories sure mike so a good way of thinking about it is as if it s a pcc plant that we ve been deploying so that s a good way of just thinking about the level of revenue contribution that it would do in the neighborhood of 10 million what we re excited about the most is is that capacity that it gives us and to what doug was referring to that allows us to work with our team that s in adams massachusetts with this asset now in missouri we can introduce the new products we can seek some growth that we think we ve got a unique access to versus the previous owner and then we also feel that we can it gives us great flexibility to work with product mix and really better serve the market so we re very excited about that opportunity it s a nice augmentation to what we ve built in adams massachusetts and it complements our position in both the construction and transportation markets that s probably 75 or so of where those current tons go and then a little bit of it goes into the publication grade so there s a little bit of paper business that s in there and some business that goes into inks but we re excited mostly about the overlap in construction and transportation douglas t dietrich chairman and chief executive officer so mike a small bolt on again not trying to oversell the small base of revenue today around 10 million it s what we re going to do with it going forward given its capacity we re going to put in new technology debottlenecking and then really leverage it in conjunction with our adams facility and we think from a future growth standpoint it could be bigger than that so more to come as we this is yesterday so more to come as we integrate it i want to welcome our new employees and we ll keep you up to date on how we develop it over the next year mike harrison seaport research partners analyst understood appreciate the color there and then i wanted to ask about the packaging opportunity you talked about that as being kind of a key technology for your pcc business maybe just take a step back and help us understand how pcc that goes into packaging applications is different from pcc used as a filler in uncoated freesheet and maybe help us understand i guess for a similar sized mill is it the same amount of pcc in terms of volume per amount of paper and what do the margins look like compared to a traditional pcc application douglas t dietrich chairman and chief executive officer yeah let me start and then d j can fill it in so it s not all pcc there is pcc in packaging pcc is using white top linerboard as we mentioned some of our current packaging applications there is pcc used as a high end coating and some packaging applications but these are different mineral types i mentioned ground calcium carbonate and other mineral types that are going to white and brown box the reason we highlight that today is we ve been working on this for a while and we ve had some really good results and some pretty far long discussions in those packaging markets that put ourselves and our technologies we like the base paper market but this puts us into other markets that our technology applies to that are growing and in the geographies where we currently sit so d j are there more technical aspect of how we view those pigments and packaging d j monagle group president specialty minerals and refractories sure so mike let s start with the stuff that we re doing today and then i ll walk you through that kind of a sequence chronologically of how you ll be seeing these technologies get exposed doug mentioned this white top liner think of that as pizza box and there is new higher end stuff that s coming out that you ll see a fully printed amazon box for instance the value equation for pcc there is that we provide a better coverage and a better sheet so we re enabling this upgrade of that capability and upgrade of that product performance and the margins and things that you should see from there are typical with what you see with our current pcc plant doug talked about our penetration in white board basically and this carton board that we ve got so what you will recognize that in the marketplace on high end stuff which is where our pcc goes that s the high end would be stuff that you buy a bottle of liquor in or you get a case of golf balls well you go lower in that and you ve got things like ice cream board and those sort of things and what we ve introduced and what we re commercializing and working on these contracts on in china is a gcc now what we ve done here is combined our capabilities that we have at adams and lucerne valley where we re very familiar with the mineral gcc combine that with some new processing technology and our operational excellence and satellite model and so we ll be introducing satellite models in china that s that is what we re doing there and much like the pcc business these are discrete investments that will yield an appropriate return then the last thing that doug had referred to is really toward the brown box this is our first machine trial we re very excited about it it is not a carbonate based technology it s an alternate mineral and first trials were good we will probably have a better feeling for how quickly we can commercialize that in the first half of next year it will take this first trial we re analyzing the data for it it was successful enough that we already have a second trial lined up we ll get the full data and economic impact understood in that first quarter of next year and we ll be able to give you some more insight on that but really pleased with how that paper group has pursued this strategic objective mike harrison seaport research partners analyst okay and you mentioned this is another mineral not a carbonate based product is it bentonite based douglas t dietrich chairman and chief executive officer mike at this time we re not for competitive reasons we re not giving some details on that and there are actually the one that i or two technologies in this space one that deals with recycling of minerals and then one that is the one that was just trialed is what i was specifically referring to so we re holding back on that for some intellectual property advantages that we feel we have mike harrison seaport research partners analyst all right fair enough appreciate the color there thanks douglas t dietrich chairman and chief executive officer thanks mike operator thank you and that does conclude today s question and answer session i d like to turn the conference back over to management for any additional or closing

call the third quarter was an exceptional quarter for diamondback we were able to generate a record amount of free cash flow as we continued to demonstrate why we are an operational leader in the permian basin although we are seeing pricing pressure in many areas of our business particularly with consumables and labor we have been able to offset these inflationary items through efficiency gains both in design and execution on the drilling side we ve decreased the number of days it takes to drill from spud to total depth by nearly 30 this year alone and we re now drilling 2 mile laterals in roughly 10 days in the midland basin on the completion side of the business we ve seen a step change in efficiency as we ve transitioned the majority of our completion crews to simul frac operations and are now completing wells in the midland basin nearly 70 faster than when we were utilizing the traditional zipper frac design these gains drove a significant beat on capital expenditures this quarter and are the primary driver of our second consecutive decrease in capex for the year the efficiencies gained this year will be permanent and while inflation may impact services prices next year diamondback will be more insulated than our peers given our control over the variable costs of well design days to total depth on the drilling side and lateral feet completed per day on the completion side of the business as a result of these efficiency gains as well as timing associated with some of our ancillary capital spend we have lowered our 2021 capital guidance for a second time and now expect to spend approximately 1 5 billion this year a decrease of 10 when compared to our initial capex guidance range we published in april this includes approximately 435 million to 475 million of estimated capital spend in the fourth quarter moving to 2022 we are committed to holding our permian oil production flat next year we expect to be able to maintain this level of production by spending similar capital on an annualized basis to our fourth quarter guidance this soft guidance accounts for both the efficiencies we ve gained this year as well as the potential for service cost inflation in 2022 should activity levels increase in the permian basin and oil prices stay strong the reason we are committed to keeping oil volumes flat in 2022 is that we believe our capital discipline coupled with our plan to return 50 of anticipated free cash flow to shareholders is the best near term path to equity value creation diamondback is moving from a consumer of capital to a net distributor of capital which will benefit long term return on capital employed and value creation in order to initiate a moderate growth plan we would need to see material changes to global oil and gas fundamentals along with shareholder support for such growth and we do not see either of those things today until such time we will continue to run our business for free cash flow generation focusing internally and ensuring we maintain our best in class cost structure in the face of inflationary pressure this will position us for success regardless of where we are in the cycle at current commodity prices this plan translates to significant free cash flow generation next year in our investor deck we have a slide that shows illustrative 2022 free cash flow at various commodity prices at today s strip 2022 free cash flow is well north of 3 billion we plan to distribute 50 of this free cash flow using a combination of our sustainable and growing base dividend share repurchases and variable dividends we will use repurchases and variable dividends interchangeably depending on which presents the best return to our stockholders at that time as a reminder we plan to opportunistically repurchase shares of our common stock when we expect the return on that repurchase to be well in excess of our cost of capital at mid cycle commodity prices which was clearly the case in mid september when our board approved a 2 billion share repurchase program after that announcement we repurchased over 268 000 shares at an average share price of 82 for a total cost of 22 million in the third quarter if we do not repurchase enough shares in the quarter to equal at least 50 of free cash flow for that particular quarter then we will make our investors whole by distributing the rest of that free cash flow via a variable dividend this strategy gives us the ability to be flexible and opportunistic when distributing capital above and beyond our base dividend but importantly at least 50 of free cash flow will be returned we do not set our budget drill wells or underwrite acquisitions based on a strip oil pricing when current strip pricing is significantly above the last five year average therefore we will underwrite repurchasing shares which we see as an acquisition under the same assumptions our base dividend continues to be our primary method of returning capital to our shareholders we have grown our base dividend at a quarterly compounded growth rate of roughly 10 since initiation in 2019 this quarter we raised our dividend by 11 to 0 50 a share or 2 a share on an annualized basis due to our low cost of supply our dividend is currently protected down to 35 a barrel as we have said before increases to our base dividend would occur simultaneously with absolute debt reduction and this year was a great example of that year to date we have used our 1 65 billion of internally generated free cash flow as well as proceeds from divestitures to reduce our gross debt by 1 3 billion and increase our dividend three times our balance sheet continues to strengthen and we expect to end 2021 at just over a turn of leverage yesterday we fully redeemed our 650 million of senior notes due in 2023 as a result we no longer have any callable debt and our next material maturity is late 2024 because of this we re now in a position to accelerate our returns program to the fourth quarter of 2021 this is a direct result of the combination of everything i ve mentioned today one strong operational performance two a supportive macro backdrop and three increasing financial stream yet none of this will be possible without safe and efficient field operations we continue to build on our safety track record and did not have a recordable employee safety incident this quarter we ve also decreased our flared volumes on our legacy properties and continue to work with third parties to build out additional infrastructure to reduce flared volumes on our recently acquired assets in addition we expect to continue our reduced continue to reduce our flared volumes as we move into 2022 in conjunction with the completion of our bakken divestiture yet we re striving to be better and we recently announced our commitment to end routine flaring by 2025 further reducing our emissions and moving us toward our commitment of reducing scope one ghg intensity by at least 50 and our methane intensity by at least 70 by 2024 the third quarter was a record quarter for diamondback we are proud to produce one of the cleanest and most cost effective barrels in the industry and are thankful to operate in a pro energy environment in the state of texas our products fuel our local communities our state our country and the world we continue to innovate justifying our environmental license to operate in the communities where we and our families live work and play we will continue to operate reliably and safely and are uniquely positioned to take advantage of the current macro environment by exercising capital discipline keeping oil volumes flat and generating significant returns to our shareholders with these comments complete operator please open the line for questions questions and answers operator our first question comes from the line of arun jayaram from jpmorgan your line is now open arun jayaram jpmorgan analyst can you hear me now travis d stice chief executive officer and director yes got you there arun arun jayaram jpmorgan analyst sorry about that travis or kaes i wanted to get your preliminary thoughts on the 2022 outlook in the deck you highlighted an operating cash flow outlook of 4 8 billion at 70 and i think 5 3 plus billion at 80 you mentioned 3 billion to 3 5 billion of free cash flow under that range of oil price this year you re doing 270 gross drills so i guess my question is what type of activity do you expect in 2022 that underpins that 1 8 billion budget and i guess would be interested to know what kind of cash tax rate you re assuming in that free cash flow guidance travis d stice chief executive officer and director yes thanks arun good questions from an activity perspective not a lot is going to change it s still going to be 75 or 80 of our wells turned in line in the midland basin still at this kind of 65 to 75 wells a quarter run rate a big difference in 22 versus 2021 is that remember we re running a lot of rigs into the downturn in 2020 and decided to keep those rigs running to build ducs we drew down about 50 of those ducs in 2021 and now are at a steady state duc level so got a 50 duc headwind in 2022 versus 2021 and a little more infrastructure and midstream spend on the sale of robertson ranches that we acquired from qep and guidon as we get into full field development there cash taxes if the world stays where it is today oil price wise we will have some cash taxes in 2022 kind of in the low nine figures 100 ish million to 200 million depending where we are which is a good problem to have hopefully the commodity prices stay where they are arun jayaram jpmorgan analyst great and just my follow up i wanted to see kaes maybe for you if you could provide a little bit more detail around the drilling efficiency gains that you re seeing i think you highlighted on slide 11 10 days now for 2 mile lateral in the midland basin and then on the and also maybe describe what you re doing on the completion side and perhaps just the mix of simul frac in 2022 kaes van t hof chief financial officer and executive vice president of business development yes so i ll start with simul frac we picked up our first simul frac crews in the second half of 2020 and have been running those ever since they ve been extremely efficient probably saves us about 25 or 30 a foot but more importantly in areas where you have offset production you can get in complete those wells and get out and therefore limit your water out effect in large fields which has been successful for us so essentially probably 90 of our wells next year will be done with the simul frac crew we ve been running three simul frac crews this year plus a fourth spot crew here and there and i anticipate that kind of pace to be similar in 2022 and then on the drilling side it s been pretty incredible putting the qep drilling organization together with the diamondback drilling organization and finding best practices and this is the first and we kind of talked about this last quarter and the quarter before that but now we ve fully converted all of our midland basin rigs to the clear fluid drilling system that we re utilizing and you can see an average of 10 days spud to td has been a pretty large step change and as travis said in his comments we all use the same fixed costs in our wells but days to td and amount of lateral feet completed per day are variable costs that we think we certainly differentiate ourselves with so that s been the driver of capex reductions this year in an inflationary environment which we re seeing given oil prices and activity levels that inflation is mitigated by controlling the variable costs which our operations organization has been able to do travis d stice chief executive officer and director and arun just to add to that point when you look ahead in the future it s always hard to see a step change in performance like we have seen this year particularly on the drilling side but just like i ve said before that diamondback has been an operational leader and i expect us to maintain that position even going into the next several years arun jayaram jpmorgan analyst great thanks a lot travis d stice chief executive officer and director thank you arun operator our next question comes from the line of neil mehta from goldman sachs your line is now open neil singhvi mehta goldman sachs group analyst good morning team travis you made a comment on the last call that you thought this was more of a seller s market than a buyer s market can you provide an update on your latest thoughts around m a and if you still feel that s the appropriate strategy and that prioritizing buying back your stock or returning capital makes sense relative to m a travis d stice chief executive officer and director yes the best way i can think about m a right now is in share repurchases i think and i made some comments there about trying we don t underwrite m a or share repurchases at these high commodity prices and look right now it s not something that i m spending any of my time on m a i spend most of my time on it seems like regulatory and policy related efforts and not the m a but yes i ve said the comment in the past it s probably still true today that it still feels at least on these smaller deals like a seller s market but that s typically what you see when commodity prices run like they ve done this year neil singhvi mehta goldman sachs group analyst and then just to continue to flesh out the cost point there s a lot of talk about service cost inflation as we move into 22 and potentially some tightness in the pressure pumping market can you talk about how you re managing some of those inflation risks and confidence interval around being able to execute on the capital budget that you start to pencil out here kaes van t hof chief financial officer and executive vice president of business development yes i mean listen the benefit we have we talked about the efficiency gains but this year has kind of been the year of raw materials going up on well costs steel diesel sand but it s logical that the service piece given labor tightness starts to get a little traction now it s really going to be dependent upon where the rig count goes we only added eight rigs in the permian in october if we add 100 rigs then it s going to be a lot tighter next year from here but if we kind of find a steady state then it s going to be tougher to for the service guys to push price but either way with these simul frac crews running we have three crews running we have no intention of dropping any of those that kind of consistency for our business partners allows them to boost their margin profile and know that they have consistent work with diamondback neil singhvi mehta goldman sachs group analyst thank you travis d stice chief executive officer and director thank you neil operator our next question comes from the line of doug leggate from bank of america your line is now open douglas george blyth leggate bank of america analyst thanks good morning everyone thanks for taking my question guys i wonder if i could ask i guess it s kind of a housekeeping question on cost guidance it looks to us that based on the guidance you ve given for the fourth quarter the bakken or the williston looks like it had on a number of levels higher cash cost dd a and so on would that be the right interpretation in which case could you give us some idea of how you expect maybe just qualitatively the run rate to look in 2022 are we looking at a step down because the williston is now no longer part of the portfolio kaes van t hof chief financial officer and executive vice president of business development yes good question doug i mean primarily loe probably comes down a couple of times from where it s been the last couple of quarters with the bakken contributing so i think generally moving toward the low 4s and 4 a boe on the loe side we did keep the bakken for a little longer than we like but and that kind of impacted the transition employees on the g a side so g a probably comes down 0 05 or so and then gathering transportation certainly higher costs in the bakken so you probably see a step change down or step down in g t p t closer to that kind of 1 25 to 1 50 range on a go forward basis so it is an asset that we when we bought it when we bought qep we put it up for sale right away unfortunately the regulatory environment took a little longer to get it closed but generally i think we re happy with the deal always happy with the deal and our cost structure comes down a little bit in q4 and into 2022 douglas george blyth leggate bank of america analyst okay so i guess what i m really getting at it looks like a bit of an inflation offset on the operating cost side rather than on the capital side i just wanted to make sure i was interpreting that correctly so it sounds like i m on the right track there kaes van t hof chief financial officer and executive vice president of business development yes douglas george blyth leggate bank of america analyst okay guys i hate to beat up on the cash distribution policy as my second question but i just want to get a little bit of clarification here so let s assume that the current strip you re running at probably a 4 billion free cash number next year so half of that goes back to shareholders and half of that goes to the balance sheet so that s pretty much what you re seeing currently right kaes van t hof chief financial officer and executive vice president of business development yes at least half of that goes back to shareholders douglas george blyth leggate bank of america analyst okay so when you when we think about the sort of rate the run rate if you like for buybacks the number could be pretty punchy and i just wanted to get a handle as to how you guys are thinking about that because on our numbers you could be buying back a substantial amount of your stock and i m trying to think do we run that 2 billion buyback over what period that s really what i m trying to get at because it sounds like it will get reloaded at some point kaes van t hof chief financial officer and executive vice president of business development yes i mean i think the key doug is that the buyback is going to be opportunistic not programmatic and as travis said in his prepared remarks you think about the buyback in terms of what is our nav at mid cycle oil prices now we can have a long debate about where mid cycle oil prices are going but one quarter in we re not willing to underwrite mid cycle oil prices higher than we ve seen in the last five years so i think the key is that the buybacks out there as a weapon for us at our disposal but overall 50 of the cash flow is free cash flow is getting returned and if we don t get through the buybacks in a quarter there are lots of ups and downs in this industry if we don t get through the buyback in one particular quarter we re going to make our shareholders whole with a variable dividend the quarter following douglas george blyth leggate bank of america analyst yes well just as a footnote 70 oil it seems to us you got a long way to go before the stock is fairly valued so i just want to understand how aggressive we should be on the buyback assumption kaes van t hof chief financial officer and executive vice president of business development yes and that s a good problem to have that s a good problem to have and considering where we were this summer when we had low 70s oil and the stock was 30 40 below where it is i think we re in a great position right now and i think there are opportunities on the buyback side and we look forward to not being blacked out in a day or two and getting back after it travis d stice chief executive officer and director yes doug just to add to that it s hard to think back just 12 months ago oil price was half of what it is today and so we know that we re in a volatile industry and we think being cautious and also providing our shareholders the maximum flexibility is still the prudent way to run the business and i hope the answers to the capital allocation question you just asked demonstrate that we re trying to be prudent in generating maximum shareholder returns kaes van t hof chief financial officer and executive vice president of business development all right thanks travis operator our next question comes from the line of derrick whitfield from stifel your line is now open derrick lee whitfield stifel analyst all right good morning all congrats on your quarter end update travis d stice chief executive officer and director thank you derrick derrick lee whitfield stifel analyst perhaps for you travis or kaes early 2022 indications from industry like yourself seem to suggest the sector is broadly remaining capital discipline in light of this discipline and the recovery in demand the environment to us continues to look very constructive for the commodity in the sector as valuations certainly remain attractive relative to the market what are the one to two potential developments for the sector that give you concern and could change the outlook to a less favorable one travis d stice chief executive officer and director well there s one thing that i think we have to watch very carefully and that s the discipline that the public companies demonstrate in their earnings call now and again in february because it s really if a company comes out there and starts growing even though i ve been very demonstrative that the world doesn t need that growth right now but if a company comes out and starts growing and gets recognized in the stock market for that growth then that s going to change the calculus for our board and how we allocate capital toward growth again i think if you look at the macro conditions post pandemic we need 100 million barrels a day of demand reestablished we re probably getting close there more importantly we need to see the surplus capacity whatever that number is in the opec countries being absorbed in the world s energy equation and then thirdly you need to see kind of the 5 year average of global inventories return and it s unlikely you ll see all three of those triangulate precisely but i think you need to look at the price of oil when those indicators are all pointed at each other and if the price of oil is 70 or 80 a barrel then those things are pointed to each other that probably means we re in good shape in terms of supply and demand if on the other hand oil price is significantly higher when those indicators are pointing at each other then that s probably your first sign that the world is calling for more oil but even having said that our board is dedicated to making sure we re allocating capital that s going to generate the greatest return to our stockholders and as i ve said in my prepared remarks we ve rapidly transitioned from a company that consumes capital for growth to now one that is distributing capital and we re looking at holding production flat and we re looking at growing per share measures while continuing to strengthen our balance sheet and we think that s a prudent way to run our business derrick lee whitfield stifel analyst great and as my follow up perhaps digging into your operational efficiencies and really following up on arun s earlier question on simul frac ops do you have a sense i m sure you do but what percent of your wells today are seeing 2 well versus 4 well simul frac and are there practical limitations that would limit 4 well implementation program line kaes van t hof chief financial officer and executive vice president of business development no i mean almost i d say 100 of our midland basin pads are four wells or more and the benefit of simul frac you got to have an even number of wells given that you re running two basically two crews at the same time so it s been less apparent in the delaware actually delaware we re probably 50 2 well or 4 well plus and 80 2 well plus and the midland that s almost 100 4 well plus derrick lee whitfield stifel analyst great update and thanks again for your time kaes van t hof chief financial officer and executive vice president of business development thank you derrick travis d stice chief executive officer and director thanks derrick operator our next question comes from the line of david deckelbaum from cowen company your line is now open david adam deckelbaum cowen and company analyst morning travis and kaes thanks for the time this morning kaes van t hof chief financial officer and executive vice president of business development good morning david david adam deckelbaum cowen and company analyst just wanted to be a little bit more explicit around the well cost inflation i just wanted to confirm you all reached record points in the third quarter at 500 a foot in the midland and 700 in the delaware are you all modeling that now as sort of the trough period for costs is that already baked in at a higher level in the fourth quarter guide kaes van t hof chief financial officer and executive vice president of business development yes i mean look we had a really good quarter in the third quarter efficiency wise no major issues on drilling completion went off without a hedge not a lot of weather so we certainly don t model for the best case scenario but this is probably the base that we re going to build off of in terms of inflation going into 22 we went into 2021 guiding to kind of 7 to 10 well cost inflation been able to kind of go the other way but like travis said earlier in the call we don t model in efficiency enhancements throughout the year in our budget but certainly the organization on the offside is motivated to continue to push the limits but this feels like a pretty solid quarter in terms of costs that will be tough to replicate in this kind of inflationary environment david adam deckelbaum cowen and company analyst i appreciate that and just for my follow up travis perhaps for you or and kaes can chime in as well but the you referenced looking at per share metrics with the buyback before you talked about looking at using a buyback on your expected return exceeds your cost of capital are you also looking at what your effective production growth per share looks like when you re considering buying back shares versus perhaps growing in the event that you see some of those early indicators coming back with the world calling for more oil travis d stice chief executive officer and director yes that s a good point part of the buyback work that we did when we announced it was we looked at how much capital does it take to grow the business 5 a year for the next five years or grow the business 10 a year for the next five years versus shrink the business by 5 or 10 a year in terms of share count over the next five years and the law of large numbers catches up to you on the growth side but on the buyback side of the shrink side it starts to get easier to grow per share metrics year two and 3 and obviously it s stock price dependent but that was a lot of the work that we did do our shareholders own more reserves per share production per share a longer inventory life per share with the buyback versus trying to just plow it all into the ground and oversupply a market that s already pretty fragile david adam deckelbaum cowen and company analyst yeah got it thank you guys travis d stice chief executive officer and director thank you david operator our next question comes from the line of scott hanold from rbc capital markets your line is now open scott michael hanold rbc capital analyst thanks good morning if i could return back to the shareholder return plan and i think you all said you re going to at least give 50 back to investors and could you just sort of give some color around that does that mean if they re not debt takeout opportunities you d potentially look at say increasing the buyback or dividend above sort of that 50 threshold and also on if you can give some color on the fixed dividend where could that go where you all get to a point where it just doesn t feel comfortable because of the sustainability at more of a mid cycle price kaes van t hof chief financial officer and executive vice president of business development yes scott conversations with large shareholders have basically said we want to make sure this dividend is well protected below 40 we our dividend breakeven for 22 is kind of in the 35 oil range and we re buying puts at 50 oil so i think we re still very well protected i think the dividend is going to continue to grow the board talks about it every quarter we ve hit this 10 cagr since introduction in 2018 that s probably a lofty goal to continue for multiple years but certainly something we re talking about continuing the dividend growth on a steady basis aggressively and i think as long as that breakeven stays in the mid to high 30s we feel pretty good about it scott michael hanold rbc capital analyst okay and could you comment on sort of the view on taking out debt and if you would focus a little bit more on variable dividends or buybacks if there s not debt to take out kaes van t hof chief financial officer and executive vice president of business development yes that s right sorry about that we still want to take down gross debt we have a maturity in 2024 we also want to keep a larger cash balance than we ve run in the past just for inflation but yes we re kind of saying hey listen at least 50 of the free cash flow has got to go back to the shareholders and if we don t have anything else to do with it then i think it s logical that more will go back so i d like to have cash to take up the 24 and be in a position to not have any material maturities until 2029 but like we ve done over the last five or six quarters that s not going to be mutually exclusive from our shareholders getting more money back scott michael hanold rbc capital analyst okay and then as you look into 2022 how do you think and i know you all are talking about flat oil production into next year if you were to just outperform operationally would you guys i guess reduce your well completions say in the back half of the year to kind of maintain flat production or should we assume that you ll have that 65 70 well program next year and if there is operational performance maybe you do a little bit better than maintenance flat production kaes van t hof chief financial officer and executive vice president of business development well i think generally right we got to outperform guidance on oil production which we ve done this year but what we said all year is that if we are doing better than we thought we re going to cut capital and that s what we ve done in 2021 and i think that s essentially the goal for 2022 even in the face of some inflationary pressures scott michael hanold rbc capital analyst got it appreciate it kaes van t hof chief financial officer and executive vice president of business development thank you scott operator our next question comes from the line of paul cheng from scotiabank your line is now open paul cheng scotiabank global banking analyst thank you good morning travis i want to go back into the cash return i think it made a lot of sense with the volatility in the market that you put 50 of the excess cash flow into the bond sheet but is there a number at some point your net debt will be at a point that you may be able to raise the cash return from 50 to 75 or higher is that some number that in mind that you guys are thinking or that s not really it s just that you will go with and saying that ok if i don t have any additional use because i no longer have any debt to wipe away then i would just increasing that percentage kaes van t hof chief financial officer and executive vice president of business development yes paul that s a great question i think what we re focused on is committing to the at least 50 right now i think as this industry evolves and you see companies make these types of commitments you don t want to walk them back right so the there will be quarters where we distribute more cash than 50 but also i don t want that to become a baseline for the next couple of decades i think we re focused on 50 right now and some quarters will do better and some quarters will hit at that 50 but the 50 is the guarantee paul cheng scotiabank global banking analyst okay and the second question is related to your midstream operation rattler with the dividend yield over 8 much higher than the fang yourself one will argue that your cost of capital is actually very high over there so it doesn t seems like that s really a good reason to have that as an independent trade we have seen a lot of consolidation in the midstream business one of your peers there midstream asset just recently announced to merge with a project company and actually going to reduce their ownership so that they can deconsolidate so just curious that i mean how are you looking at that business and whether that you may want to do some alternative initiatives relate to the structure on that kaes van t hof chief financial officer and executive vice president of business development yes good question we ve seen a couple of routes right we ve seen some parent companies buy in their subsidiaries and some sell it down i think for us it s more strategic to us to keep it to keep that cost structure and we can address it more on the rattler call but i think if you look under the hood we ve been really trying to highlight the rattler story we signed a new jv earlier this year or this month that s going to be highly successful for us with a lot of diamondback exposure we got the water assets drop down about to close in another month so certainly the strategy at the subsidiary hasn t changed and the importance of it to us hasn t changed so i certainly don t think we d go down the sell route but we look at cost of capital we look at multiples and we ve got if the stock is not working we got to think about what to do but right now it seems like it s rattler s had a good year it doesn t have the commodity exposure that diamondback and by viper has so it s probably underperformed a little bit but it s still generating a lot of free cash to its unitholders of which diamondback s the largest paul cheng scotiabank global banking analyst yes i mean the only thing i would say is that diamondback has a great story and is probably one of the most attractive e p names out there and i think it will help that to even further simplify the corporate structure so that when the investors are looking at you they don t have to look at so many different corporate structures just my almost kaes van t hof chief financial officer and executive vice president of business development yes we ve heard that before paul and we recognize it fortunately the mother ship has gotten very large and so there s less leakage to the subsidiaries but both have been important to us over the last half decade paul cheng scotiabank global banking analyst thank you kaes van t hof chief financial officer and executive vice president of business development thanks paul operator our next question comes from the line of leo mariani from keybanc your line is now open leo paul mariani keybanc capital analyst hi guys just wanted to touch base a little bit on third quarter projection looks like it kind of outperformed here and just wanted to get a little bit of color behind that in terms of being a little bit ahead of the guidance so was this pretty much just better well performance you did mention kind of a pretty clean operational quarter with no weather issues kaes van t hof chief financial officer and executive vice president of business development yes we had a good quarter i think we re very focused on hitting our numbers and the benefit of slowing down and not trying to grow as fast as possible is that the operations organization has gotten better you can see it on the well cost side it s also happening on the production side so a good quarter all around i think we feel really confident in the forward outlook and continuing to hit our numbers here leo paul mariani keybanc capital analyst okay and then just in terms of 22 capex i understand it s a loose guide that you folks targeted here if i take the kind of fourth quarter capex range and annualize it kind of gives me 1 74 billion to 1 9 billion so pretty wide there at the end of the day just wanted to get a sense what you guys think perhaps the outcome can be on the inflation side there and i know it s still a moving target here and we won t 100 know how this plays out but any just early indications of what the inflation can be and is that kind of what would target the top end of the 1 9 billion just trying to get a sense of what s baked in there kaes van t hof chief financial officer and executive vice president of business development yes i mean i think i d say that 2022 is not going to be won on november 2 2021 so not we re one of the few companies talking about 2022 we ll see what happens over the next couple of weeks but probably have about 10 inflation built into there with a little bit more infrastructure and midstream spend that we didn t need to go through this year but generally i think we can narrow that guidance as we get into 2022 and have more evidence i think the comment earlier if the retail goes up 100 rigs from here it s a different story than if the rig count keeps creeping up five to 10 rigs a month leo paul mariani keybanc capital analyst okay thanks guys kaes van t hof chief financial officer and executive vice president of business development thank you travis d stice chief executive officer and director thanks leo operator our next question comes from the line of charles meade from johnson rice your line is now open charles arthur meade johnson rice and company analyst travis i want to thank you for your prepared comments you really addressed a lot of the natural questions on why you ve adopted the stance you have for 22 but just one question for me and it s around the buyback when we look at the you guys announced it on the 15th and if you look at we look at the average price you bought back in the and the chart of your share price it looks like you guys got after it for a few days and then wrapped it up probably in about a week and i m curious is the right inference to make is that low 80s is where you guys where the scale tips to buybacks as far as the preferred way to return i guess increase returns to shareholders or alternatively is it that kaes you mentioned a blackout earlier and obviously that makes sense is that a function of your legal team putting you on blackout a few days before the end of the quarter kaes van t hof chief financial officer and executive vice president of business development yes i mean it s just purely we get blacked out right we get blacked out 10 days before the quarter ends and we re blacked out until a couple of days after earnings so we ll reassess where we are in a couple of days and be back after it charles arthur meade johnson rice and company analyst perfect that s helpful thanks guys kaes van t hof chief financial officer and executive vice president of business development thanks charles operator our next question comes from the line of harry mateer from barclays your line is now open harry mead mateer barclays bank analyst hi good morning guys so i want to dig in maybe a little bit more on the debt piece of it you guys talked around it but as you noted nothing callable at this point given what you ve taken out so far this year next maturity in 2024 i guess first question is how do you navigate that because are you thinking about tenders make wholes that gets expensive but then at the same time sitting with a bunch of cash in the balance sheet waiting for the maturity at the end of 24 might not be viewed as attractive either so how are you thinking about approaching that in the next couple of years kaes van t hof chief financial officer and executive vice president of business development yes i mean i think we re just going to keep following the prices of the bonds and try to get below the make whole if we can if not the make whole is not too restrictive on something like our 24 as you get into late 22 but certainly not looking to take out anything past 2029 harry mead mateer barclays bank analyst got it okay and then on the cash balance what you mentioned you want to run with more of a buffer than you had in the past what is that number for you kaes van t hof chief financial officer and executive vice president of business development i like 500 million as a minimum we ve kind of said that over the last couple of quarters and i think that s a good starting point for us harry mead mateer barclays bank analyst okay great thanks very much travis d stice chief executive officer and director thank you kaes van t hof chief financial officer and executive vice president of business development thanks harry operator our next question comes from the line of paul sankey from sankey research your line is now open paul benedict sankey sankey research analyst guys there s a report in the wall street journal this morning that the epa is going to massively increase methane emission limits can you just talk a little bit about what that means for you and for the industry and then i had a question from a major investor who asked me have i heard from diamondback that multiyear flat volumes are now embraced by you and not just for 2022 is that what i m hearing travis d stice chief executive officer and director yes the methane rules i think we still have to see how the final document gets written diamondback continues as i ve stated in my prepared remarks to focus on methane intensity we re going to reduce that by 70 from 2019 levels by 2024 so it depends on where the threshold is but i ve been very pleased with the progress we ve made already on reducing methane intensity and in fact we ve got 20 plus million allocated next year to continue those efforts to reduce methane intensity and if we do things right hopefully we ll be below the threshold by which that methane intensity applies kaes van t hof chief financial officer and executive vice president of business development and then paul on multiyear plans we ve always issued multiyear plans at diamondback we didn t buy into a multiyear growth plan in 2016 and we re not going to commit to multiple years at flat today now certainly 2022 and 2021 will both be relatively flat production we think it s worked and capital discipline has worked for this industry i think this industry has tried a market share war with opec before and it didn t work out so why don t we let opec bring back their spare capacity and us stay flat and we ll see what the future holds in 2023 and beyond but right now we re committed to 2022 flat capital discipline is real over at diamondback and as travis mentioned we re going to become a net returner of capital rather than consumer of capital travis d stice chief executive officer and director and look opec is going to do what opec is going to do i ve said we ve transitioned and that diamondback transitioned very rapidly from consuming capital returning capital and focused on the increase or the growth that we re seeing in per share metrics and i ve outlined kind of the macro elements by which the world will be calling on more growth and i think every quarter that we go through diamondback its board is demonstrating our commitment to maximizing shareholder returns and we re doing that right now by generating all this free cash flow this wave of free cash flow that s coming to us and our commitment to return at least 50 of that back to the shareholders paul benedict sankey sankey research analyst understood guys thanks travis d stice chief executive officer and director thanks paul operator i m showing no further questions at this time i would now like to turn the conference back to ceo travis stice you may proceed travis d stice chief executive officer and director thank you again to everyone for participating in today

chief executive officer joel hunter executive vice president and chief financial officer tracy robinson president canadian natural gas pipelines and coastal gaslink stan chapman president u s and mexico natural gas pipelines bevin wirzba executive vice president strategy and corporate development and president of our liquids pipelines business corey hessen president power and storage and glenn menuz vice president and controller francois and joel will begin today with some opening comments on our financial results and certain other company developments a copy of the slide presentation that

after this call before we begin i d like to remind you that our remarks today will include forward looking statements that are subject to important risks and uncertainties for more information on these risks and uncertainties please see the reports filed by tc energy with canadian securities regulators and with the u s securities and exchange commission finally during this presentation we may refer to measures such as comparable earnings comparable earnings per common share comparable ebitda and comparable funds generated from operations these and certain other comparable measures are considered to be non gaap measures as a result they may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other entities these measures are used to provide you with additional information on tc energy s operating performance liquidity and our ability to generate funds to finance our operations with that i ll turn the call over to francois francois lionel poirier chief executive officer president director thank you david and good morning everyone thank you for joining us today i m told this is the busiest reporting day of the year so we really appreciate you joining us on this very busy day as outlined in our third quarter report our diversified portfolio of north american energy infrastructure assets continues to perform very well society s unwavering demand for our services and the relentless focus our people place on operational excellence are reflected in our strong financial performance through the first nine months of the year comparable earnings per share of 3 21 exceeded last year s results by 5 while comparable funds generated from operations totaled 5 3 billion this is a very good outcome especially considering the significant decline in the value of the u s dollar relative to the canadian dollar which had a negative impact on our canadian dollar reported ebitda given the strong year to date performance we now expect 2021 comparable earnings per share to be modestly higher than last year s record results we continue to advance our secured program which now totals 22 billion this includes the usd800 million wr project announced earlier today which will improve reliability and expand the anr system this project is similar in scope to the vr project we discussed in the second quarter at wr we ll upgrade compressor stations to dual drive electric horsepower reducing our ghg emissions while ensuring natural gas backup in case of a power disruption so manageable in corridor projects like these are the building blocks in the modernization and decarbonization of north america s energy infrastructure system while maintaining reliability and we expect to realize numerous similar opportunities in the future also of note as part of its life extension program bruce power recently launched an upgrade initiative focusing on asset optimization innovation and leveraging new technology they call this project 2030 and it has a goal of achieving a site peak output of 7 000 megawatts by the end of the decade effectively adding the equivalent of a ninth unit at the bruce station now this is in addition to the major component replacement program we ve been investing in and talking about on units three through 8 we continue to advance 22 billion of secured projects including 4 billion we ve already added to date in 2021 when you factor in the continuation of columbia s modernization program as we call mod 3 and the bruce power unit three mcr which is expected to be sanctioned before the end of the year as well as the project 2030 upgrade initiative we plan to sanction 7 billion of high quality growth opportunities by the end of this year completing these projects on time and on budget will generate a weighted average after tax irr on these new investments the full 7 billion of sanctioned projects of 8 3 which is toward the upper end of our targeted range of 7 to 9 for projects that we sanction annually our secured capital program continues to be underpinned by cost of service regulation and long term contracts giving us visibility to the earnings and cash flow these projects will generate and are consistent with our long held risk preferences now looking to next year and beyond we expect many similar high quality opportunities to come to fruition as we continue to reliably deliver the energy people need while decarbonizing our asset footprint this includes the ongoing expansion modernization and maintenance of our regulated natural gas pipeline network the refurbishment of another four bruce power reactors and plans to use renewable energy to electrify a portion of our pipeline network and you ll hear more detail on that later on the rfi process we began in the second quarter for over 1 000 megawatts of renewable capacity to electrify our own load has had an overwhelmingly positive response negotiations have begun and we anticipate completing the process in the first quarter of 2022 beyond that we re also progressing initiatives including the ontario pumped hydro project the canyon creek pumped hydro project in alberta carbon transportation and sequestration in partnership with pembina and clean energy projects with irving oil and also large scale hydrogen production hubs with nikola motors as a result we expect to sanction more than 5 billion of new projects annually over the next several years and we hope to exceed that with risk adjusted returns consistent with historical levels our team s origination capabilities were demonstrated quite visibly during 2021 and the opportunity set that lies ahead is vast now in order to judiciously fund this attractive suite of growth opportunities maintain a strong financial position and enhance our conservative utility like payout ratios we have modified our near term dividend growth outlook we now expect to increase our common share dividend at an average annual rate of 3 to 5 while our previous outlook remains affordable and supported by the strong performance of our business we believe this modest change is prudent given the generational opportunity for growth we have before us it will allow us to fund a larger portion of our future capital programs through internally generated cash flow moderate our leverage and continue to deliver superior total long term shareholder returns as you know we are committed to delivering these returns while growing our business sustainably that s why i m proud that last week we released our 2021 report on sustainability our esg data sheet and our ghg emissions reduction plan these reports outline the next step in our sustainability journey with detail on our 10 sustainability commitments that come with 32 specific measurable targets we ve set to support them this includes targets to lower our emissions intensity by 30 by 30 by 2030 and position the company to achieve net zero emissions from our operations by 2050 we also advanced our commitments in the areas of innovation diversity indigenous reconciliation and safety which for us includes mental and psychological health i m confident that our talented team has the technical capabilities the innovative mindset and the commitment required to advance our work in these areas and i encourage you to read these documents which can be found at tcenergy com to learn how we are holding ourselves accountable to protect the planet empower people and create shared prosperity in summary we are committed we are committed to our vision of being the premier energy infrastructure company in north america not just now but in the future as i ve said on numerous occasions we will achieve that by prospering irrespective of the pace or direction of energy transition our business decisions continue to support our goals to reliably meet society s energy needs while decarbonizing our assets looking forward our 22 billion secured capital program which we expect to grow to 25 billion by year s end is poised to grow substantially over the years and as always we will fund our capital programs prudently to maintain our solid financial position ultimately our goal is to continue to grow earnings cash flow and dividends per share and build on our long track record of delivering superior total shareholder returns now i ll turn it over to joel for some comments on our third quarter results joel e hunter executive vice president chief financial officer thanks francois and good morning everyone as outlined in our results issued earlier today net income attributable to common shares was 779 million or 0 80 per share in the third quarter compared to 904 million or 0 96 per share for the same period in 2020 third quarter results include an after tax expense of 55 million related to transition payments associated with the onetime voluntary retirement program offered to eligible employees earlier this year and 11 million after tax charge associated with keystone xl preservation and other costs the corresponding period in 2020 also included certain specific items as outlined on the slide and discussed further in our third quarter 2021 report these specific items as well as unrealized gains and losses from changes in risk management activities are excluded from comparable earnings comparable earnings for the third quarter were 972 million or 0 99 per common share compared to 893 million or 0 95 per common share in 2020 year to date comparable earnings per common share are up 5 supported by the strong underlying performance of our business turning to our business segment results on slide 11 in the third quarter comparable ebitda from our five operating segments of 2 2 billion was similar to 2020 despite strong currency translation headwinds detailed variance explanations in each business unit can be found in our third quarter 2021 report but i will comment on a few principal changes year over year canadian gas pipelines comparable ebitda of 631 million was 35 million lower than third quarter 2020 mainly due to decreased flow through depreciation following the full depreciation of one section of the canadian mainline as well as lower pull through financial charges partially offset by higher incentive earnings the cessation of depreciation does not impact net income which increased by 12 million for the canadian mainline u s gas pipelines comparable ebitda increased by usd59 million to usd706 million compared to the third quarter 2020 primarily due to an increase in earnings from columbia gas following its application for higher transportation rates effective february 1 2021 and the resulting settlement that was filed with the ferc on october 29 we anticipate ferc approval of the settlement during q1 2022 liquids pipelines comparable ebitda declined by 28 million to 387 million in the third quarter due to reduced contributions from liquids marketing activities primarily due to lower margins power and storage comparable ebitda in the third quarter fell by 19 million primarily due to lower earnings at bruce power due to greater planned outage days and higher operating expenses partially offset by higher realized power prices for all our businesses with u s dollar denominated income including u s and mexico gas pipelines and parts of liquids pipelines ebitda was translated into canadian dollars using an average exchange rate of 1 26 in third quarter 2021 compared to 1 33 for the same period in 2020 while overall u s dollar denominated comparable ebitda increased by usd53 million the year over year weakening of the currency was a considerable drag on comparative 2021 canadian dollar reported ebitda that said the corresponding impact on comparable earnings was not significant as our u s dollar denominated revenue streams are in part naturally hedged with the residual exposure actively managed on a rolling 2 year forward basis now turning to slide 12 i ll speak to a few of the primary variances below ebitda depreciation and amortization was 63 million lower compared to third quarter 2020 primarily due to one section of the canadian mainline being fully depreciated interest expense included in comparable earnings was 37 million higher year over year largely due to the cessation of capitalized interest for the keystone xl pipeline project comparable interest income and other rose 59 million in the third quarter mainly due to realized gains in 2021 compared to realized losses in 2020 on derivatives used to manage our net exposure to foreign exchange rate movements on u s dollar denominated income income tax expense included in comparable earnings for the third quarter was similar to 2020 excluding canadian rate regulated pipelines where income taxes are a flow through item and thus quite variable along with equity afudc income in u s gas pipelines we continue to expect our 2021 full year normalized tax rate to be in the mid to high teens comparable net income attributable to noncontrolling interest decreased by 61 million relative to the same period last year primarily as a result of the tc pipelines lp buy in completed earlier this year now turning to slide 13 during the third quarter comparable funds generated from operations totaled 1 6 billion and we invested 1 7 billion in our capital program in october we issued a combined usd2 25 billion of senior unsecured notes comprised of usd1 25 billion of 3 year fixed rate notes at 1 and usd one billion of 10 year fixed rate notes at 2 5 now turning to slide 14 this graphic illustrates our forecasted sources and uses of funds for 2021 through 2023 starting in the left column our total requirements over the three years are projected to be approximately 30 billion reflecting dividends and other of 11 billion capital expenditures including maintenance capital of 16 5 billion 2 billion attributed to the tc pipelines acquisition completed in march and the series 13 preferred share redemption of 500 million in may the second column highlights expected internally generated cash flow of 21 billion 2 billion of common shares issued pursuant to the tc pipelines buy in approximately cad three billion equivalent of senior unsecured notes issued in october 1 5 billion of medium term notes issued in june and the 500 million junior subordinated notes offering completed in march that leaves a residual need of approximately 2 billion depicted in the far right column that we expect to fund through a combination of incremental debt commercial paper and keystone xl project recoveries the program excludes normal course refinancing of scheduled debt maturities and is consistent with maintaining our strong financial position now turning to slide 15 in closing our strong operational financial results continue to reflect our resilient low risk business strategy and demonstrate the criticality of our extensive asset footprint along with our robust growing capital program our enduring business model financial strength organizational capabilities and unparalleled network of assets position us to capitalize on a vast opportunity set which will allow us to serve today s needs as well as the evolving energy mix of the future looking forward as francois mentioned in order to fund our sizable capital programs during this period of growth maintain our strong financial position and enhance our already conservative utility like dividend payout ratios we have modified our near term dividend growth outlook we now expect to increase our common share dividend at an average annual rate of 3 to 5 which will allow us to fund a larger portion of our future capital programs through internally generated cash flow moderate our leverage and continue to deliver superior long term total shareholder returns that s the end of my prepared remarks i will now turn the call back over to david for the q a david moneta vice president of investor relations financial communications great thanks joel with that i ll turn it back to the conference coordinator questions and answers operator thank you our first question comes from ben pham of bmo please go ahead our next question comes from robert kwan of rbc capital markets please go ahead robert kwan rbc capital markets analyst great good morning if i can just start on the dividend rate change and recognizing look you ve got to start somewhere but on an absolute basis it s not really that much dollars saved to fund things so as you just think about the stepped up plan can you just confirm that discrete equity has or drip atm has no role in that but as you step it up what is the role of asset monetizations as well just to take advantage of private market valuation out there joel e hunter executive vice president chief financial officer hi robert it s joel here so first to answer your question with respect to the need for equity or atm we d say there is no need given our 22 billion capital program along with us announcing today we ve sanctioned 7 billion of projects this year so far this year and we expect to do at least 5 billion annually in the coming years so we see no need for common equity if there are opportunities in excess of this we would consider equity however we have to we look at everything through a per share lens so it d have to be accretive to shareholders and add long term value francois lionel poirier chief executive officer president director i think to add to that robert your question with respect to monetizing assets as an alternative we look at all sources of equity capital whether they are internal or external and they have to compete with one another and to the extent we can monetize a mature asset and rotate capital into growth it s something you ve seen us do in the past through funding the columbia growth program and something we would absolutely consider and be prepared to do in the future robert kwan rbc capital markets analyst so just to clarify because joel your answer sounded like it was maybe just a little bit more of an absolute test of accretion but francois are you trying to say though that you ve got these different options and they re all going to get weighed against each other and the best option is how you re going to proceed francois lionel poirier chief executive officer president director yes i think the way you characterized it robert is exactly that we re going to weigh all of our options and that s how we re going to make the choice as to how we fund our program going forward i think where joel was going with this is we always retain the option to issue equity but it s we guard share count jealously and to the extent we have an internal option to rotate capital i think that will always be our preferred course of action robert kwan rbc capital markets analyst perfect and then just you had the vr project last quarter you got the wr project this quarter they re just a little under usd one billion you ve got lots of other systems that are full with compressor stations can you just talk about the total potential opportunity and look you ve had kind of one each quarter here what type of pace can we expect to see additional announcements francois lionel poirier chief executive officer president director that s a great question robert i ll give that a start and then i ll ask stan to provide some proof points and add some color as we talked about and published our ghg reduction plan last week we identified five levers for us to achieve our objectives and one of them was modernizing our existing infrastructure and assets and i think the wr project and the vr project which if memory serves me are about 1 5 billion of sanctioned projects are really good examples of that and i think we ll see more of those going forward so over to you stan for additional color stanley graham chapman executive vice president and president of u s mexico natural gas pipelines thanks francois robert and team i would start by saying this given the size and breadth of our assets in the u s i ve said before that any given year my expectation is we should be originating about 1 billion of growth capital and i expect that to continue for the next several years one way we re going to look at doing that is by continuing to electrify our compression fleet give you some data points today about 5 of our compression fleet is electric driven all things equal that probably drives down or reduces our co2 emissions by about 500 000 tons here s the opportunity set going forward though about 24 of our compressor fleet today is what we call older slow speed units these units could be up to 70 years old so as we continue to mine for other like for like compression reliability projects like we ve done with our elwood project with content access vr and wr we re going to look to replace this older inefficient gas compression with newer compression that may well be electric driven or this dual drive technology the main driver for all this from a strategy standpoint may very well be linked to the retirement of coal fired generation across our footprint and just to give you a data point as we sit here today there are 16 coal plants that generate about 15 gigawatts of capacity that are scheduled for retirement between now and 2030 and these coal plants sit within 15 miles of the anr or the columbia system so that s exactly what we ve seen happen with respect to our wr project that we announced today across the midwest we ve recently seen about 1 800 megawatts of coal fired generation fee retired a majority of that is going to be replaced with renewables but a portion of that is going to be firmed up with new gas fired load and that s what wr project does it expands our system to the tune of about 157 000 dekatherms and gives us the ability to replace these older inefficient units with newer electric drives that not only drive down our emissions and expand our capacity for our customers but allow us to do it in conjunction with corey s team who ultimately will be the provider of this green power going forward so again when you look at the opportunity set i can t tell you specifically how much of that 1 billion a year that we re going to originate in any given year is going to be electric driven but i would say that we re in a bit of a target rich environment right now robert kwan rbc capital markets analyst that s great thank you very much operator our next question comes from ben pham of bmo please go ahead ben pham bmo analyst hi thanks good morning i wanted to also check you ve tempted your dividend growth guidance to a new range but are you reaffirming that 5 to 7 growth in ebitda or cash flow or more of a longer term business growth rate francois lionel poirier chief executive officer president director thanks for that question ben i think directionally that s absolutely accurate what we said in our prepared remarks is that the 5 to 7 dividend growth is affordable and that we considered moderating the dividend growth for really two reasons one is to retain more cash flow to invest in our growth programs and the second is to over time grow into a slightly lower leverage targets so by definition that what s implicit in that is that earnings and cash flow are expected to grow at a rate that is above our targeted dividend growth rate of 3 to 5 ben pham bmo analyst okay that s what i thought i just wanted to clarify that is there any you ve been pretty consistent with some of your payout ratio targets even cash flow between that 60 to 40 i mean is there any change in that or maybe more post an update at investor day francois lionel poirier chief executive officer president director i think we see value in having utility like payout ratios both on an earnings and cash flow basis and again given the fact that we see growth opportunity being very robust going forward revolving around energy transition and lowering our emissions we thought it was prudent for us to be retaining more cash flow and by virtue of continuing to grow earnings and cash flow at a rate on a long term basis above that 3 to 5 range we expect to see our payout ratios lower over time as well from the level the targeted levels that you ve mentioned ben ben pham bmo analyst okay great thank you francois lionel poirier chief executive officer president director thanks ben operator our next question comes from jeremy tonet of jpmorgan please go ahead jeremy tonet jpmorgan analyst hi good morning just want to pick up with kind of some prior elements of the last question there and just as far as analyst day is concerned should we be thinking about any other type of new messaging or major developments as far as how you think about tc energy going forward with the strategy we have new management team in the seat here just wondering if there s anything that you can share with us francois lionel poirier chief executive officer president director jeremy i think what you ll see from us is the same consistency that we ve exhibited over the last couple of decades which is we view our value proposition is to provide stable and steady dividend growth underpinned by growth in cash flow and earnings to maintain a strong balance sheet and industry best payout ratios and to continue with a set of very disciplined and conservative risk preferences what you ll hear from us on investor day is more detail on the opportunity set that we see going forward again energy transition provides a fast opportunity for tc energy to prosper the opportunity to reduce our emissions will create opportunities for us to invest capital as well and when you combine that with the underlying growth in our existing businesses as stan talked about for example in our u s gas business and i ll ask corey to provide a little bit more detail on where we are with our rfi here program in here just a minute in terms of electrifying our own consumption what you re going to hear from us is more detail around the robustness of that growth program going forward and corey if i could ask you to provide that a bit more update on that one corey hessen senior vice president and president of power storage thank you francois jeremy glad to have you calling in today i appreciate you taking the time as i ve mentioned in previous calls we are systematically going through a process to electrify our liquids assets in the u s and we ve reached a stage now where we have we are having exclusive negotiations for as promised a 1 000 megawatts of renewable generation and we expect in q1 to be able to announce our selections and our choices and then the schedule in the of each one of those projects and how they re going to serve our load more specifically jeremy tonet jpmorgan analyst got it that makes sense i didn t think tc energy would be changing a ton but just wanted to check separately just want to kind of build off of i guess the nikola announcement that you had made during the quarter here and wanted to get any more color you re willing to share with regards to i guess the pace of opportunity as it relates to hydrogen going forward and do you see these type of opportunities as far as more repurposing existing assets or building new logistics just any color you could share there would be helpful francois lionel poirier chief executive officer president director i ll start and i ll ask corey to provide a little bit more detail using nikola as an example one of the things we ve learned jeremy over the course of the last year is how critical our assets and infrastructure is to moving forward with energy transition with respect to hydrogen it s about generating producing storing and transporting a gaseous molecule which is exactly what we do every day primarily through natural gas transportation in our company so our skill sets and our asset base really lend themselves very well to those kinds of opportunities and you re going to see more of these type of joint development agreements that we have with nikola other counterparties going forward but with respect to nikola perhaps corey if you could sort of frame up the size of the opportunity for jeremy corey hessen senior vice president and president of power storage yes that would be great i think the way to think about it is that nikola provides us a unique opportunity to bring our core skill sets our core capabilities to a team as we investigate how hydrogen can be part of the new energy economy and so specifically we think about it from a power and storage point of view that it matches our view of participating in agenda load match view a normal 150 ton per day hub requires about a gigawatt of power and so we foresee that our we can participate by building and operating renewable energy assets which include storage wind and solar to power those electrolyzers and then be able to systematically evaluate our existing infrastructure such that we can participate in the transmission side of those hydrogen molecules from point to service the load but once again i d like to reinforce that the most important part of this is a we can bring our capabilities to a wider team and learn together and b we can leverage our existing asset base to participate with our partners in this opportunity jeremy tonet jpmorgan analyst got it that s very helpful thank you operator our next question comes from robert catellier of cibc capital markets please go ahead robert catellier cibc capital markets analyst thank you i d like to go back to the dividend growth announcement for a minute i think you characterized it in the statements as a near term change to the dividend growth outlook and i wonder if there s a specific metric such as leverage that you d need to see at a certain level or is it really under a constant evaluation and it sounds like comments given this morning is it s really a long term reduction in the leverage in the payout ratio as opposed to really a near term change in the growth rate francois lionel poirier chief executive officer president director thanks for that robert i ll get started and i ll ask joel to provide additional comments certainly we see ourselves growing cash flow and earnings at a rate that s above the 3 to 5 dividend rate this is something we re going to constantly evaluate over time it s a dynamic evaluation process within the company we see simply put tremendous opportunity for us to allocate capital above our free cash flow even through energy transition and emissions reductions over the next several years and want to make sure that we re balancing appropriately providing income growth to our shareholders but also maintaining a very strong balance sheet because we think there will be situations where we can be opportunistic and capture opportunities that others don t to the extent we have a strong balance sheet and continue to maintain dry powder so the idea here is to grow into stronger metrics and joel i ll throw to you for additional comments joel e hunter executive vice president chief financial officer thanks francois and thanks robert for the question as francois mentioned we will grow over time into these stronger metrics and particularly when you look at our leverage over time we want to get that down i like to see us more in that 4 75 debt to ebitda range over time i think it s important for us as francois said to just have that additional capacity that dry powder if you will further bolsters our balance sheet so i think it s really important for us to be focused on that but again it will take time it will depend really on the cadence of spend as to how long it will take to get there i would note robert though like if you think about the last two years our debt to ebitda we ended the year at 4 9 we were very happy with that so it s not like this is that far out of reach but it will take some time but that s kind of a stated target that we have is around that 4 75 area of debt to ebitda robert catellier cibc capital markets analyst that s helpful color and then my next question is on bruce power and the uprate there can you maybe provide a little bit more detail and sort of contrast it to what s going on with the mcr program and is the higher capacity going to be achieved through operational means or is there some capex and spend development that you could speak to thank you robert it s corey the way i would think about it is the number one the uprate is a three phase project that s going to take the remainder of the decade bruce power refers to it as project 2030 phase one is under construction right now and we just approved phase two which is approximately 300 million of capital the execution is all on what we would refer to as the cold side of the plant meaning there s no risk to nuclear operations so it s primarily through improvements in the nonnuclear side of the facility each phase will have been funded and approved in a phase by phase process and we expect that by 2030 the goal of 7 000 megawatts can be attained based on year to date progress of meeting their goals and objectives for cost and schedule for phase one operator our next question comes from linda ezergailis of td securities please go ahead linda ezergailis td securities analyst thank you i don t want to spend too much time belaboring your deliberations on the dividend but it is of high interest so i m just wondering how much of a factor if any where your conversations with the debt rating agencies in considering and converging upon an appropriate dividend growth rate and maybe also were there any other factors that were potentially secondary but a consideration as well for example any sort of pending tax changes in any of your jurisdictions or anything like that joel e hunter executive vice president chief financial officer thanks linda it s joel here first i would say that there was no discussions with the rating agencies there s no pressure on our metrics this was a decision that we ve made on our own that we found it was prudent to retain more cash flow to redeploy into our business so i just want to emphasize there s no ratings pressure whatsoever here but we did mention to the rating agencies we do have a regular update call with them but again this is no pressure from them whatsoever as it relates to tax changes i mean it s early days in that linda i mean there s a lot of moving parts here whether they look at tax changes in the u s canada so what came come out of the oecd we ll have to wait until the final legislation actually comes through before we can actually make any kind of determination if there s any impact at all on our tax position so again very early days on that and we don t want to speculate but that did not factor into our decision here on the 3 to 5 dividend nor did the rating agencies have any pressure from them whatsoever linda ezergailis td securities analyst okay appreciate that context and maybe moving on to the outlook for inflation and a lot of moving parts there as well but i m wondering if you can just remind us what the update is on what percentage of your earnings or ebitda might have protections in place and when we think of the net tailwind versus headwinds we might see next year and beyond if you can provide any context for us that would be very helpful francois lionel poirier chief executive officer president director thanks linda it s francois i ll take that 1 as you re very well aware we have very little exposure to commodity price risk or volumetric risk and in terms of the rates established in our various jurisdictions we have a settlement in canada gas and our mainline for five and six years respectively we charge negotiated rates predominantly on our systems in the u s on the natural gas side in our liquids business as well so our exposure in terms of revenues to interest rate risk is very low the vast majority of our capital is under fixed rate from a borrowing standpoint and so where we see some inflation pressures is on our projects and on the cost of our projects going forward it s something that we manage either through cost sharing mechanisms with our customers to the extent that those are available but it s something we see and take a very close eye on in terms of managing our operating and capital costs going forward so not really any pressures in terms of allowed rates of return in terms of revenues going forward from inflation but again on our o m and our project it s something that we watch very carefully but we don t see that as inflation as being really a significant impact on our earnings and cash flow volatility going forward linda ezergailis td securities analyst thank you francois lionel poirier chief executive officer president director thanks linda operator our next question comes from rob hope of scotiabank please go ahead rob hope scotiabank analyst good morning everyone just the first question on the coastal gaslink can you update us on the path forward and how you re thinking about capital at risk regarding the kind of slip in schedule there as well as the higher capital cost tracy a robinson executive vice president president of canadian natural gas pipelines president coastal gas link yes happy to do that listen we continue on coastal gaslink to work very closely with our customer lng canada as we advance toward completion as we work through this project we are working very closely with them to ensure that the pipeline comes in in a time line that s consistent with their needs on the facility and so we are 100 aligned with lng canada and the importance both of the project and the need to continue to move this forward we re committed of course to doing that we re more than halfway there we ve passed our 50 completion and we ve more than i think 5 000 people out there working right now and achieving new milestones every day so we think this project s on track it s going to come in in a time line that works for our customers and we re committed to making sure that that happens rob hope scotiabank analyst so there s no contemplation of any positives like was previously discussed tracy a robinson executive vice president president of canadian natural gas pipelines president coastal gas link we have right now all the authorities that we need to proceed and we are in 100 alignment with lng canada the importance that construction is not disrupted so we re out there doing it and we don t expect a disruption in construction rob hope scotiabank analyst all right good to hear and then shifting over to alberta the alberta carbon grid tc has got we ll call it high pressure pipelines from the large emitter sources to the potential disposition for carbon areas there so when you re taking a look at your capital plan and taking a look at how the potential ccus opportunity comes along how are you thinking about your assets and the path forward for this project bevin mark wirzba executive vice president of strategy corporate development and president of liquids pipelines thanks rob it s bevin here we ve the one great aspect of this opportunity is that it is an industry solution with both our partner pembina and ourselves as well as potentially other parties in the western canadian sedimentary basin leveraging our long life assets relooking at repurposing our assets to provide a more competitive solution for the industry is what we re focused on but it s early days rob we re this is a multiyear effort we re getting feedback from industry and not only the energy industry but other point source folks as well that have emissions to deal with and looking at a solution set that could really be competitive for a broader industry approach rob hope scotiabank analyst thank you francois lionel poirier chief executive officer president director thanks rob operator our next question comes from andrew kuske of credit suisse please go ahead andrew kuske credit suisse analyst thank you good morning maybe just on the growth opportunity that lies ahead if you could delineate a little bit of it what s in corridor growth and potentially having higher returns versus maybe more competitive opportunities that you really foresee francois lionel poirier chief executive officer president director i ll i m happy to start and then i ll ask stan and tracy to provide some proof points i would say going forward andrew that our opportunity set is going to be much more driven by in corridor growth than not simply put we find the risks in managing external processes permitting and the like to be much more manageable in corridor we have very strong relationships we re a trusted operator our employees work and live in the communities in which we operate we have a strong safety record and we have strong commercial relationships with organizations in those areas and with policymakers so from our perspective going forward from us you can see much more what i call using a baseball analogy singles and doubles than swinging for the fences and we re very happy to be able to backfill the 8 billion we lost earlier this year with the permit revocation we ve done our job this year we ve sanctioned 7 billion including projects that will be sanctioned before the end of the year we sanctioned 7 billion of projects with an unlevered irr of 8 3 that to me is strong execution on our part and that s being done with smaller in corridor projects and projects related to energy transition and reducing our own emissions so that s going to be the trend going forward and i see the execution risk and the permitting risk around our capital projects going forward reducing because we re going to take that approach so perhaps we ll start with stan and then tracy stanley graham chapman executive vice president and president of u s mexico natural gas pipelines andrew this is stan maybe i ll see if i can paint a little picture for you for my view of growth within the u s natural gas business and i guess i would start by saying the best type of growth we can achieve is one that doesn t require any capital spending and given the current regulatory environment that we re in where the time and complexity around building new projects is increasing we truly believe that the value of pipe in the ground is going to continue to grow over time and therefore our margins on every dekatherm of capacity we sell are going to increase so whether we re focusing on cost reductions generating new capacity of sales or even taking advantage of artificial intelligence and machine learning like we ve recently done with our autonomous pipeline project we think that we re going to be able to grow our margins going forward second thing i would point out too is our modernization program as part of our of rate case that we recently settled and filed with at ferc the columbia rate case settlement does include a continuation of columbia gas modernization program which we refer to as mod 3 it s a 1 2 billion investment over four years and as with our prior proposals every bit of capital that we put in service at the end of october of a given year starts to earn recovery effective april the following year so there s a relatively short period of dead capital if you will and i should note that if you re trying to trace back to our capital table that we included in our q3 disclosures the 1 2 billion modernization program is not included in that just yet but we will update the capital table when the settlement is approved expect it around q1 2022 but third and perhaps really to your question and with respect to new projects again given the depth and breadth of our system my expectation is we originate about 1 billion of projects each year and these will be largely in corridor compression related expansions that are permittable and constructible and we ll continue to have this five to seven times ebitda multiple build if you will i should point out that not only are we originating about 1 billion of new projects a year we re also putting into service about 1 billion of growth projects per year this year we re going to put in about 900 million of capital into service next year we re on track to do about the same just under 1 billion so again while it s difficult for me to give you a specific breakout of where the growth is going to come from we re going to look for continued organic growth among the utilities and we ve had some success in that particularly on the east coast of the u s the electrification opportunities like vr and wr we ve already talked about opportunities with respect to core times again i think are bound lng growth that second or third wave is going to come particularly as we see these 50 type lng prices in asia and record lng send outs to places like china and also i wouldn t discount an element of producer push for example we re seeing increased capacity increased production out of the bakken higher gas to oil ratios pressure on reducing flaring all that s going to require additional pipeline capacity and again we re uniquely situated to do that i think with our bison pipeline all of that i would characterize as traditional growth and on top of that there s all of the transitional opportunities that we have around renewable natural gas carbon capture hydrogen and the like so with that i ll pause and maybe turn it over to tracy tracy a robinson executive vice president president of canadian natural gas pipelines president coastal gas link thanks stan andrew thanks for the question in canada as you know we re in the middle of what is a fairly large expansion program particularly on the ngtl system it is positioning the ngtl system within that montney area to ensure that the basin and the gas that s up there which is some of the most competitive north america has access to a system and we re increasing the access that gas into market by through this program more than 30 so we ll see that program come to an end in 2024 beyond that we see about 1 billion 1 5 billion of organic like investments as we continue to make sure that the system is positioned properly in the basin to help it succeed and as we look at opportunities to optimize our system we re looking at opportunities to decarbonize as we see the carbon price starting to increase opportunities to electrify and as we look forward leverage our assets as we look at all of the activity around energy transition so this is a tremendous resource base we have right now we re starting to see the benefits of the expansion that we ve done already if you look at some pretty strong financial results you re going to see that continue and i think as we look forward we re going to leverage all of that to make sure that the basin is positioned to succeed to drive more gas down our kind of strategic asset on the mainline into eastern canada the midwest on our u s pipes and we ll participate fully in the growth that we re all seeing in gas andrew kuske credit suisse analyst i appreciate the three s company approach on the answering of the question it s very helpful but maybe my second question if i can is really related maybe brings it back to the baseball analogy francois the singles and doubles and just all the capital comments that stan and tracy made do you see yourselves in a position where you ve got effectively the singles and doubles that are all in corridor that allow you to in a certain sense run up the score and really put a lot of capital to work in a short period of time to accelerate an energy transition and just greater offerings to your customers and really benefit the overall growth story for tc itself francois lionel poirier chief executive officer president director very much so andrew i think you characterized it well and if you look at the 7 billion of projects that we have sanctioned or expect to sanction for the rest of the year the majority of those projects have a component of emissions reduction or energy transition or emission less energy built into it so from our perspective as we look at our responsibility and the commitments we ve made around reducing our emissions as we look at the direction policy is taking as we look at talking to our customer base about what their objectives are more and more of our capital going forward is going to be associated with either reducing our emissions reducing their emissions or moving us along energy transition and as you quite rightly pointed out a larger number of smaller projects brings less permitting risk for us less execution risk for us and in many instances where we are the incumbent we are able to attract above average returns for that capital so all told i think as you pointed out very well i think it bodes very well for us going forward in terms of our ability to achieve our targeted 7 to 9 unlevered after tax irr on newly sanctioned projects every year and as i mentioned in my prepared remarks we re at the upper end of that for the 7 billion we plan on having sanctioned in 2021 andrew kuske credit suisse analyst thank you very much francois lionel poirier chief executive officer president director thank you andrew operator our next question comes from michael lapides of goldman sachs please go ahead michael lapides goldman sachs analyst hi guys thank you for taking my question i m looking at your sources and uses on your sources and uses of funds for the next couple of years one of the items that stood out a little bit was the expected source of funds from recovery of keystone xl costs can you just remind us a what s the dollar amount that s assumed in that bar b what s the process for getting recovery of those funds and kind of the time line for it and c what s the backfill strategy in case pushed out or delayed or does it get recovered thanks guys francois lionel poirier chief executive officer president director so we ll start with bevin with respect to the recovery and then the backfill will go to joel bevin mark wirzba executive vice president of strategy corporate development and president of liquids pipelines yes thank you michael as you highlighted we had great support from our customers to help advance the keystone xl by supporting us with some of the capital to move that project forward post the revocation of the permit we ve since moved to commercial conversations with our customers that did support us and we ve made great progress on that front and we hope to resolve any outstanding balances by the first quarter of next year with respect to the totals those are fully disclosed in previous disclosure upwards of 800 million but over to you joel joel e hunter executive vice president chief financial officer yes bevin thanks for that and thanks michael for the question and to the extent that we couldn t recover that the backfill would be simply through additional debt we have capacity to do that because it is in a large amount michael it s anywhere from 500 million to 800 million as bevin mentioned francois lionel poirier chief executive officer president director and then maybe perhaps i ll add a little bit to that the base case outcome is that we will be recovering that capital from our shippers these are all strong creditworthy parties simply put what we are working toward as an alternative is a bit of a win win situation where we can create commercial opportunities that deliver even more value than their recoverable capital through commercial solutions that they need and that benefit us as well so i view the risk of not being able to recover that capital in our capital stack to be de minimis to negligible we are simply working on trying to find commercial solutions that actually increase the value of those recoveries michael lapides goldman sachs analyst got it thank you guys i appreciate the detailed answers francois lionel poirier chief executive officer president director thanks michael operator our next question comes from praneeth satish of wells fargo please go ahead praneeth satish wells fargo analyst thanks good morning i m wondering if you could comment on the proposal here in the u s to impose a minimum 15 tax on corporations if this went forward would this have any impact on your cash taxes on the u s side of the business or do you have any nols or credits to help offset this joel e hunter executive vice president chief financial officer thanks praneeth it s joel here yes so if we went to a 15 tax or minimum tax again as i mentioned earlier it s still very early days to determine what s the final impact we have to look at the legislation that ultimately will come through we d have to look at what s the transition period we have to look at if there s any grandfathering etc so if there was a 15 tax probably not a big impact to us given that especially on a cash tax perspective because we do have some nols that we can use so again it s for us to a kind of speculate it s just too early just given there are a lot of moving parts but certainly we re not seeing we re not really concerned that if we see depending on what the legislation ultimately is whether it s in the u s mexico canada oecd as i mentioned earlier we have to determine what the ultimate impact is for our cash versus current taxes praneeth satish wells fargo analyst got it and i just wanted to go back to the irr comment so i know companywide the project backlog like you ve mentioned is going to generate an 8 irr but is it the case that the gas projects have higher returns in kind of the five to seven times ebitda range and then the energy transition projects have a lower irr and i guess the reason i ask is that over time i d imagine that the energy transition projects become a bigger and bigger piece of the backlog so do you see risk there to the 7 to 9 target over time francois lionel poirier chief executive officer president director we don t see any risk to the falling outside of that band over time as we re looking at opportunities through electrification as we re looking at the opportunities with the carbon grid with nikola and other hydrogen opportunities and even in renewables on a weighted average basis we re very confident that we re going to be able to fall within that 7 to 9 range what you ve seen from us over the course of the last couple of years with the predominance of our capital being spent in canada gas where the prescribed rates of return based on 10 1 return on equity on deemed equity of 40 that falls beneath our range at roughly 6 25 with incentives but nonetheless we ve been still able on a weighted average basis to fall within that 7 to 9 range so energy transition investments include bruce power include the uprate and both the mcr and the uprate fall above the 7 to 9 range so you should not presume that energy transition investments by default generate and attract lower returns we re very disciplined about how we allocate capital that 7 to 9 range is an extremely important part of our capital allocation decisions and based on the forward pipeline of projects that we re developing we don t expect to see us falling below that range anytime in the near future praneeth satish wells fargo analyst perfect thank you joel e hunter executive vice president chief financial officer thanks praneeth operator our next question comes from matt taylor of tudor pickering holt co please go ahead matt taylor tudor pickering holt analyst hi thanks for taking my question only one for me as lng producers are looking to offer net zero carbon cargoes are you guys seeing any opportunities to partner there to reduce emissions of where that gas is being transported from and if there s any conversations there about preference for some of these lng producers on where they source their gas from by basin or customers that might give you guys a competitive advantage stanley graham chapman executive vice president and president of u s mexico natural gas pipelines hey matt this is stan maybe i ll take the last part of your question first with respect to is there a preference in lng customers to source green gas if you will and the answer is no we really haven t seen that a matter of fact it s been a bit of a mixed bag among producers whether or not they re interested in putting forth a product such as that overall no i think our part of the value chain is to build out the capacity to feed the lng terminals and we re quite comfortable doing that going forward again particularly in light of the unprecedented demand that we re seeing for lng right now and this winter where cargoes have traded for over 55 at the past couple of weeks record deliveries to china last month and the like so i think we generally like where we are in the value chain all things francois lionel poirier chief executive officer president director stan if you could maybe on the topic of rng provide some additional color on some of the initiatives that you ve got going stanley graham chapman executive vice president and president of u s mexico natural gas pipelines yes i could appreciate that francois i think i mentioned to you earlier that we are on track to double the amount of rng that we re taking into our system this year and we re probably going to exceed that by 50 and perhaps get up to about 20 to 30 bcf of rng into the system by the end of 2022 so what we re trying to do is work with some of the larger landfill providers for example look at where their landfills are relative to our pipeline infrastructure studying the value chain to determine the value propositions along the digester component the conditioning component the transportation component and also we have a kind of a unique ability to interact at the intersection of molecules and electrons to an extent in the context of corey s team could come in and provide a role in this as well and it could be as simple as buying the gas buying the renewable gas from the renewable producer or perhaps entering into an asset management agreement as well so lot of exciting step i think yet to come on the renewable gas front and we re really bullish on that opportunity matt taylor tudor pickering holt analyst okay thanks for taking my question francois lionel poirier chief executive officer president director okay thanks matt operator our next question comes from patrick kenny of national bank financial please go ahead patrick kenny national bank financial analyst thank you good morning everybody just a follow up on coastal gaslink and more on the cost side just want to make sure i ve got this right in the sense that the worst case financial exposure for yourselves and your lp partners at this point assuming no incremental project financing for whatever reason would be that 3 3 billion with your net exposure just being north of 1 billion yes that would also assume that your lp partners don t have any recourse on you guys as project manager so i m not sure how much you can share at this point with respect to a firming up that incremental project financing or b any legal protection you might have as project manager from the other lp partners potentially making a claim as well tracy a robinson executive vice president president of canadian natural gas pipelines president coastal gas link patrick i m going to let joel address the temporary financing components that you mentioned but first let me address just a few important points as you know this project is critical to both to the industry to the country to lng canada us and we re working very closely with lng canada as we advance toward completion we can t of course discuss the details of any discussions on cost and schedule and the issues between us because they re confidential but what i can say is that we re very hopeful that ultimately we re going to reach an agreement between us on those issues and that of course will lead to the resolution of some of the temporary financing as well we are continuing to work on the pipe more than 50 done lots of people out in the field progressing that very aligned with lng canada and the importance of ensuring that that s not disrupted and with that note i will pass it over to joel joel e hunter executive vice president chief financial officer thanks tracy so yes patrick you saw us disclose that there is a commitment up to 3 3 billion that would be temporary if necessary for us to lend into the project i think it s important to note though if that were required that we would earn a return on that investment if you will that would be temporary we fully expect that over time that cgl will be able to increase its project credit facility and the likelihood of this up to 3 3 billion would be required but if so again would be viewed as temporary and we d earn a return on it patrick kenny national bank financial analyst okay great that s very helpful and then maybe as a follow up as you think about say the pumped hydro opportunity obviously a very different project in the context of design and construction challenges but still quite similar as it relates to capital intensity and long lead execution risk so just curious how this cgl experience might be influencing your strategy around mitigating and diversifying the risk during the build out just in order to maximize your risk adjusted returns corey hessen senior vice president and president of power storage patrick it s corey thanks for the question i think that your question really amplifies what it means to be a part of tc energy and the fact that we have a diversified business and we every day create opportunities to have learnings from other parts of our business and so what we would learn and apply and what we have learned and applied to this process is number 1 understanding how our partners want to operate and because on the meaford project the ontario pumped storage project we will have partners that include local constituents it will include the saugeen ojibway nation and it will include potentially other investors and so we will definitely be thinking about how we include them early on in the process to make sure we re aligned on our contracting strategy and execution strategy and secondarily we are very focused on making sure that we have the right contracting strategy with our actual construction partners our oem partners and our supply chain so that as we move along in this process we all are very clear on the roles and responsibilities and i think i would just sort of close with the fact that the pumped hydro project is also an excellent opportunity for us to leverage what we have in a partnership with bruce power in all of their excellent work that they have done and to be able to help and guide us through this process as well just because of both we both serve the same jurisdiction the same customers the same province and so that s really a competitive advantage for us for this particular project patrick kenny national bank financial analyst great i appreciate the color i ll leave it there operator ladies and gentlemen this concludes the question and answer session if there are any further questions please contact investor relations at tc energy i will now turn the call over to francois poirier please go ahead francois lionel poirier chief executive officer president director thank you very much in closing our disciplined approach as always emphasizes financial strength and adherence to our conservative risk preferences that s a critical part of our value proposition secondly as you ve seen with our results year to date and the upward revision in our outlook our high quality long life assets continue to produce strong operating and financial results and thirdly as we think about our strong performance this year in terms of sanctioning 7 billion of projects with an 8 3 after tax unlevered irr and we think about our growth prospects going forward energy transition will provide vast opportunities for tc energy to prosper as i said in our strategy to prosper irrespective of the pace or direction of energy transition thank you very much for your time today operator duration 71 minutes call

sameer and good morning to everyone for joining our call today first i would like to start the call by thanking our outstanding employees who continue to manage through this unprecedented environment to deliver the highest level of service to our customers we continue to prioritize health and safety of our customers and team members by implementing best practices and updating our covid protocols based on regional recommendations and our best judgment in the third quarter we had hoped to welcome back customers to our auction theaters however given the surge in the delta variant we delayed our plans we are excited to announce that the first event where customers are coming back en masse will be our flagship orlando event in february of 2022 this will be an amazing way to welcome customers back we are all very excited for orlando our omni channel platform is delivering strong outcomes for our customers with bids per lot in used equipment pricing remaining very strong year on year comparisons of our financial metrics masked the underlying strength of our business as the quarterly cadence of 2020 was abnormally impacted by higher covid related disruptions most notably in the third quarter we believe the best view to the business trajectory is a two year stack view versus the pre pandemic 2019 despite ongoing supply chain headwinds we have grown our gtv and non gaap adjusted operating income 17 and 48 respectively compared to the pre pandemic baseline of q3 2019 this is a strong outcome given the environment we are in we see the unprecedented environment of tight equipment supply caused by low inventory levels exacerbated by supply chain issues hampering oems production as a point in time event and consider it outside of our control by focusing on building developing and growing the facets of our business that we can control we will be in a strong position to disproportionately capitalize on improvements in the broader environment i will cover how we are doing this with new products new satellite yard locations and a more robust sales coverage model here shortly we are also spending our time focused on strategic m a giving us step changes in the execution of our strategy at our investor day last december we laid out our vision for transforming from an auctioneer to a global trusted marketplace for insight services and transaction solutions we highlighted how our inventory management system will serve as a gateway to that marketplace and will help us unlock not only 300 billion in annual gtv but also provide us an entry into other services ours or those of key partners that we can monetize around the used equipment market since that day we have been busy putting pieces of that strategy in place whether organically building capabilities through a test and learn approach or m a as is the case with rouse euro auctions and our recently announced acquisition of smartequip to that end we identified facilitating parts and service transactions on behalf of our dealer and oem partners as an integral part of our marketplace vision and our acquisition of smartequip provides the foundation of that capability smartequip has spent 20 years building critical connections between equipment owners and dealer and oem partners to make the parts buying experience seamless on this slide we captured all the ways in which this acquisition strengthens each of our strategic pillars smartequip is a saas based business that is the industry standard for complete equipment parts electronic procurement catalog and commerce technology in the industrial segment worldwide it offers a single platform for end to end parts procurement on behalf of our dealer and oem partners and supports over 1 billion of transaction volumes annually in the intermediate future we are planning on running it as a stand alone business however over time we will use smartequip technology and supplier relationships to power a parts and service offering in our marketplace enabling our dealer and oem partners to connect quickly and efficiently with our equipment owners we officially launched ritchie list last month which is our north american listing service we see this as an on ramp into the ritchie bros ecosystem that will accelerate ims adoption and our marketplace vision ritchie list will help customers sell equipment on their own and give them the ability to leverage all of ritchie bros tools and services they need to be successful such as used equipment valuations and market trends purchasesafe inspections and so forth at the end of the day we know many customers want to sell equipment themselves and ritchie list allows them a way to engage in our ecosystem and provide us avenues on monetization that we previously didn t have ritchie list allows for customers to workflow equipment into one of our channels if they end up choosing not to sell it themselves we are also offering customers functionality to promote their listings and unlike other services in the industry with paid advertisement obligations we are simplifying the engagement by offering unlimited listing for only 99 a month moving to our inventory management system or ims what we view as the gateway into the marketplace we continue to make strong progress with 141 growth sequentially compared to last quarter and the cumulative number of organizations that are activated we are slowly migrating our transactional workflow into ims providing for a better customer experience we are very pleased and excited about the journey we are on both with our customers and our partners we also continue to scale our satellite yard strategy with the opening of eight new locations in the quarter on this slide you can see phase one and phase two phase one are the sites located internationally that we use to test our growth hypothesis in 2020 and phase two is everything we have done this year to begin to scale we are very encouraged by the results from the sites we opened in the last 12 months and see satellite yards as a key component of our organic growth plan we also spent 2021 testing and learning from our new sales coverage model in texas throughout the year we learned a lot iterated quickly and i am happy to report that we now have implemented a new structure that is delivering strong results our new sales coverage model will enable more touch points with customers and allow a higher level of engagement with a wider array of new customers while still supporting our existing customers although we are seeing very encouraging results on our kpis around sales attainment average contract size and forward sales pipeline we are most excited by the engagement we are seeing with new customers that haven t previously participated in the ritchie bros ecosystem with the first touch coming through our inside territory managers everything we are doing here is about making it easier for our customers to interact with us the new sales coverage model is also a key element of ritchie bros organic growth it is a journey for us and one we will continue to hone as we scale it beyond texas after sharon discusses our financials i will talk about how we are executing against our strategic pillars and outlook and then we will move to q a and now over to sharon sharon driscoll chief financial officer thank you ann and good morning to everyone on the call as ann noted the year on year comparisons this quarter masked the underlying strength of our business given the impact covid had on our 2020 financial results as a backdrop the company posted a 22 increase in gtv in the third quarter of 2020 as covid restrictions began to ease and with that as context our current quarter gtv decreased 4 with puts and takes across auction shift headwinds the negative used equipment mix slightly offset by fx tailwinds we see this level of gtv as a strong result given two factors first the difficult comparison from last year as just described and second the extremely tight supply market due to global supply chain challenges impacting all new equipment manufacturing sectors as ann noted in her remarks using a two year stack as a more indicative measure this is a 17 increase in gtv compared to third quarter of 2019 total reported revenue declined 1 compared to last year with total service revenue declining 4 much like gtv our revenue is cycling over difficult comparisons from 2020 and compared to 2019 total service revenue has now increased 19 giving us confidence that we are executing against our evergreen model despite being in this difficult supply environment our other service revenue saw relative strengths with the contribution from rouse of 6 6 million in the third quarter and a 55 increase in the revenue at ritchie bros financial services to 11 3 million recall that we have highlighted the investments we ve been making at rbfs and we are now beginning to see these returns this quarter we updated our non gaap measures and i encourage everyone to look at the reconciliation tables we updated these measures at this time as we have entered a period of significant acquisition activity and have now aligned our presentation to be more comparable with peer companies and allow us to better highlight the underlying business trends our non gaap adjusted operating income declined 11 compared to the third quarter 2020 however it is up 47 compared to third quarter 2019 i would note that compared to 2019 the growth in non gaap adjusted operating income has far exceeded the pace of growth in our service revenue which is in line with what we communicated when we rolled out our new evergreen model last year although auction and marketplace service revenue declined 6 a m service revenue as a percentage of total gtv came in at a robust 14 for the quarter inventory sales tend to be lumpy and they increased 6 driven by strength in our international region and our government sector marginally offset by some weakness in the u s and canada inventory returns came in at 10 8 which is down compared to 2020 resulting primarily from the mix impact of our amended government contracts overall we are pleased with our revenue rate performance as both profit on inventory sales and service revenues improved versus the prior year cost of services plus sg a was down approximately 5 compared to last year and excluding share based payments from both periods this measure was down approximately 3 we broadly see this as a good result and in line with the decline of service revenue of 4 particularly in a smaller volume quarter while we don t break out fx impacts by line item it is important to note that we are naturally hedged given our geographically distributed operational structure for both revenue and costs and overall fx had a neutral impact on the bottom line in the quarter cost of services declined 16 despite operating with a higher number of sales days easing covid protocols and fx pressure ann mentioned that we are welcoming back customers starting with orlando and expect our cost of services to increase to reflect that in coming quarters although the key message here is that even with these add backs we do expect a permanent level of cost savings going forward i would highlight that cost of services plus sg a is up only approximately 9 since the third quarter of 2019 which is helping the growth in non gaap adjusted operating income in the same timeframe this is a good result given that we continue to make investments to drive revenue growth most notably the addition of the rouse services team and continued investments in ritchie bros financial services and other organic growth efforts some of which ann has just covered i would like to note that we expect our core sg a run rate excluding share based payments as well as any impact of the smartequip acquisition to be up mid single digits compared to the fourth quarter of last year our cash flow remains very robust with trailing 12 month operating free cash flow of 253 million which is 115 of our non gaap adjusted net income at the end of the quarter our balance sheet and liquidity remain in a very strong position providing an excellent foundation to support our growth initiatives and with that let me pass it back over to ann ann fandozzi chief executive officer thanks sharon i am very pleased with the quarter as we made excellent progress in accelerating our strategy of becoming the trusted global marketplace for insight services and transaction solutions for commercial assets on this slide you can see we ve been busy working on many initiatives the biggest of which i covered in my discussion earlier now turning to current trends and outlook there is no change in our view here we still see the environment as dynamic as supply chain labor shortages and logistics issues continue to not only plague our industry but more pervasively across the broader economy specifically we continue to see equipment tightness here in the fourth quarter let me reiterate that we see the current environment as a point in time we know for certain that while inventory sits out there it continues to age and will ultimately require a disposition solution most exciting is that we are using this time to structurally evolve this business for the longer term to deliver on our strategy and our marketplace vision with that operator please open the line for questions questions and answers operator your first question comes from craig kennison with r w baird please go ahead craig kennison r w baird analyst hey good morning and thank you for taking my questions congratulations on all the strategic progress in the quarter as well i was hoping you would help us understand the revenue model for ritchie list and smartequip ann fandozzi chief executive officer yes hi craig ann here thank you very much the supply environment is challenging but we are very very proud of the progress that we re making so let me start with smartequip cover ritchie list a little bit and then turn that over to matt our chief marketing officer so smartequip really the way to think about it is for the we ll call it short to midterm it will be a completely stand alone entity as we build out our marketplace functionality and just as a reminder here s what smartequip does they spent 20 years developing an architecture that seamlessly plugs into dealers and oems parts offerings to make it really easy for end consumers to look up a part they need via catalog order it seamlessly transact that easily across dealers and oems just an incredible platform that team has built they ll continue to run that business that business monetizes primarily on a saas basis we love that team they re staying alex the founder fern the ceo bryan the chair they re staying and driving that team forward we re excited as we evolve our marketplace we will then use that architecture that they ve laid think of those types to be able to offer that same conversion to ritchie bros and buyers and i m going to steal a line from our chief strategy officer kevin geisner the ultimate vision is that do you want fries with that so you have an auction that takes place a buyer wins an excavator at checkout imagine where today when they checkout just kind of paying for the transaction that they won it then says listen we ve inspected that piece of equipment and we believe it requires these parts and a service contract on behalf of the dealer in their area so whatever the brand is and where the dealer is and that pipe has already been created by smartequip such that the customer can just click to add that to the shopping cart ideally add that even to their financing preferred method and kind of check out seamlessly that s the vision we are think of that as kind of an intermediate term for the short run we don t have that capability built yet that s what we re building in the marketplace so but that s where we re headed with smartequip and then on ritchie list and i m about to turn it over to matt the vision is customers continue overwhelmingly you guys know the 300 billion marketplace the biggest chunk is just customers selling their own equipment they re going to continue to do that we wanted to offer a listing service that they can do that with us as well but ultimately really be the gateway into the ims the inventory management system such that they can then partake of any other services ours or third parties that exist all the way through kind of waterfalling if they re not successful in selling a piece of equipment waterfalling it through the various channels within ritchie bros but let me pause and turn it over to matt this was his brainchild all along and i m thrilled that we could put it in place this quickly matt ackley chief marketing officer yeah sure so as with any listing service right there are core revenue streams which tend to be of the advertising nature so sellers pay a fee a monthly fee for unlimited listings or they can purchase an add on on one off basis additionally there are advertising mechanisms to be able to promote your listing as well as straight banner advertising but we don t really look at that as the core eventually the core revenue stream here as ann pointed out the second order is the ability to sell services into these transactions whether that be inspections shipping financing these are core services we offer with our core offering and now we can unbundle them and offer them as part of these private transactions so that s an additional revenue stream and then as ann pointed out there are these what we like to call network effects to the ecosystem the stickiness we obtained with the ims and with the listings sellers have an easy option to flow that inventory down to our marketplaces where we make our traditional commissions so that s the way we think about the revenue streams associated with ritchie list craig kennison r w baird analyst that s so helpful operator your next question comes from cherilyn radbourne with td securities please go ahead cherilyn radbourne td securities analyst thanks very much and good morning so ann in terms of new equipment supply and the knock on impact on used equipment supply can you just update us on your current thinking on the duration of the supply chain issues that are constraining new equipment production ann fandozzi chief executive officer yes hello cherilyn we view the world you guys have now gotten to know me it s been i can t even believe it since we started this journey together knocking on the door of two years here we view the world as in our control out of our control when i normally say those words the out of our control is the smaller part the in our control is the larger part and as you saw with the initiative that s clearly the case with our workload but in terms of the backdrop it is unquestionably having a very significant impact and i ll just bring you guys through kind of the journey we ve been through you are monitoring it as close as we are so you understand when all of this kind of call it hit we started feeling it at the end of 2020 all the talk from the oems was about we should be caught up in the first half of 2021 and candidly we built our plans accordingly and then the chip shortages were exacerbated and now they re shipping well i mean this situation unquestionably is getting worse not better oems came forward and said ok first half is not going to happen it s most likely going to be the second half and now as we re very closely watching announcements of the oems they re clearly saying it s not going to be this year it s going to be next year where things actually get better and what we re seeing in the fourth quarter is that the tightening is actually getting worse not better as expected we re very buoyed by knowing look the equipment continues to age right this isn t the case that if you don t buy a coffee a cup of coffee today you re going to buy two cups of coffee tomorrow you don t buy a cup of coffee today you never catch that revenue up that s not the case in our industry right that equipment continues to sit out there it continues to age it will ultimately need to transact and we are obviously a transaction engine we will benefit the question is when and as we look at q4 and with the announcements that are getting made unquestionably it will take longer and q4 for sure not getting better but going the other way cherilyn radbourne td securities analyst okay i appreciate those comments and then for sharon on the new non gaap earnings metrics can you speak to the justification for adding back share based payments to calculate earnings is that not a cost of doing business sharon driscoll chief financial officer yes cherilyn thanks yeah so we certainly looked at what other peer companies were doing in this space and again the goal was to be as helpful to the users of the statements as possible the gaap measures are always there so in our core reporting the share based comp is included in that i think what we are recognizing and you would have seen it with the rouse acquisition and will see it with smartequip as well as you bring on new acquisitions the cost related to those which sometimes include a portion of the proceeds going into share based compensation just unfortunately continue to dilute your performance and so we made the decision that we would be consistent with how other peer companies were reporting this and our analysis indicated that this was the common approach so that was how we landed there and clearly we understand that certain analysts and certain investors will look through that as they had done with our previous adjustments but our goal is to give the best visibility possible to the underlying operating health of the organization cherilyn radbourne td securities analyst and if i could just ask a quick follow up how should we think about the share based payments add back and how to model that in q4 and going forward obviously it s going to increase sharon driscoll chief financial officer yeah so i think we will continue to give disclosure certainly past trends would be indicative and it really is going to be newer acquisitions that cause that to ramp up i don t know what additional guidance that we can provide other than a commitment for continued transparency on that line ann fandozzi chief executive officer yeah and if i can just add sharon answered it very well understand we take actions as a management team to ensure the health and wellness of this business so for example when we acquired rouse we asked for a meaningful portion of their proceeds to be rolled into ritchie bros stock both as a retention and candidly as a combined bet on the come of being aligned with our shareholders and what we re acquiring this company to do and build together that s the same mo we took with smartequip to sharon s point and future acquisitions so what we didn t want is those decisions that are kind of for the long run benefit of the business but have a short term accounting implication to map the underlying health of the business that s the intent there is no other intent behind it cherilyn radbourne td securities analyst okay i will pass it over thanks operator your next question comes from lawrence de maria with william blair company please go ahead lawrence de maria william blair company analyst thanks good morning as far as the ims obviously you gave some numbers around the growth sequentially can you talk about the engagement in terms of transaction volume in logistics and services revenue that these engaged organizations are using and the type of customers you re signing up in other words is it dealers or is it end users such as fleets thank you ann fandozzi chief executive officer hi larry ann fandozzi here again i ll take that question so i obviously the trajectory of the ims penetration has been really exemplary i m going to say we re very excited about it again we had a point of view right our point of view was you make it easy for customers you provide them data and analytics and they re going to want to participate and obviously the indications we re having still early are that in fact that is very very positive the page we showed is really our focus so our focus right now is think about kind of the network effect and how that starts going it starts with a number of organizations for us right just can we get people in can we get them perusing around the data and analytics can we get them excited the next phase will be all about when that steady state so before i talk about the next phase that has been almost entirely focused on kind of regional customers if you will not large strategic accounts and dealers and big entities again the reason we did that is we didn t want any false sense of security with just big numbers right so if we turned our attention to people with a lot of assets and then they loaded those assets in but in large part they transact them themselves we already get a whole bunch of those anyway it would give us this kind of feel good about ims but at the end won t really met the huge lever that we think this will be for our business so right now we re focused on organizations a lot of those are regional dealers as well are coming in rental folks are coming in but we re really counting kind of by the numbers and kari taylor s organization as a chief revenue officer has really been focusing on making sure that that happens the next phase once we feel like ok we have a robust steady state process ok our culture is test and learn so we ve been testing we ve been learning once we feel like that s robust we ll turn our attention to ok now that they re interacting with it how are they doing with loading assets right and what does that flywheel starting to look like got it let s test and learn is it happening naturally do we need to do something to make that happen and then kind of the next cascade will be ok now they re loading assets what services are they are partaking of transaction services yes but also this is where over time the monetization of data other connection points like with getting financing inspection all of the others and those are third parties we are very very excited to again via smartequip as an example facilitate parts and service transactions on behalf of dealers and oem partners so not even our own we ll be monitoring those as well and then ultimately that will translate to our revenue growth so i said a lot it s a journey we re excited but we also want to methodically build this out not give ourselves a false sense of security get the flywheel really turning on the organizational side once we feel good about that focus on assets feel good about that focus on services our own and third parties and then the revenue will be the outcome that is how we are looking at it and how we re measuring it lawrence de maria william blair company analyst okay that was a lot but it was a good answer thank you and then secondly if i could to follow up the new adjustments implies that acquisitions are not one offs right because we re bouncing some of that back so should we expect this pace to keep up and what does the pipeline look like for m a or is this a heavy year and back to focusing on the core thanks ann fandozzi chief executive officer yes i ll start and then i ll turn it over to sharon so when we laid out our vision it was really the what so we laid out a very very clear vision of transforming to this trusted global marketplace for insight services and transaction solutions and then we put the pillars underneath it as you ve seen from us now we re very consistent it s about the experience of our buyers and sellers it s about our employees it s about the modern architecture it s about the ims and it s about growth in our core business and that s the what and i think what you heard from sharon and i m going to turn it over to her was we would stay very open to the how and the how will come in the form of organic initiatives like the go to market model in texas like the yards like the ritchie list these kinds of things that we re doing on our own but if we find opportunities to step change either the impact of these things as in the case of the euro acquisition or the time to market of these things as in the case of the rouse acquisition or smartequip we would take an l a lens that s how we look at the world so we have a robust pipeline of organic initiatives we have a robust pipeline of m a but we look at it through the lens of does it give us a step change to getting to the vision sharon anything to add sharon driscoll chief financial officer yes i would also add we ve already announced significant acquisition activity and just thinking of euro auction this metric will now also include the acquisition integration related costs associated with that which we do expect to run over a longer period of time so i think the decision time line was both not only what we had announced and how to get better visibility for the underlying health of the organization going forward but also anticipating that as the team further develops their strategy of how to bring our strategic pillars and strategic initiatives to life this metric would also enable additional either acquisitions partnerships as ann said or accommodate additional organic growth i think it s a good model to go forward based on where we are at the moment and what we see lawrence de maria william blair company analyst so they back our the cost so the integration is on okay thank you operator your next question comes from michael feniger with bank of america michael feniger bank of america analyst yeah thanks for taking my question i m curious ann what you re hearing on the ground with customers given the rise in oil price and this potential infrastructure bill on one hand it s probably good for demand for used equipment as the customers can t get their hands on new equipment like you said with production issues in supply yet on the other hand i think historically rising oil infrastructure probably could keep cosigners kind of holding on to their fleet maybe less dispersals i m just curious if you see this dynamic as a net net like a drag into q4 and early q1 or is it actually infrastructure bill is this actually going to reunite gtv growth going forward ann fandozzi chief executive officer yes michael so yes we re hearing everything you re hearing and we re watching it very very carefully i think the way we are looking at it is short term is something very different than possibly mid and long term so let me just take kind of the two bookends so on the short term really the single biggest macro factor is the supply chain right it is the single biggest it is so overwhelmingly and again it s not we wish it was just chip shortage it s chip shortage it s shipping it s ports getting back i mean it s just everything everything everything under the sun and so regardless of that push and pull exactly as you described it which is beautifully described right oil prices are up people need their equipment but wait a minute the demand for used equipment is up the prices that would naturally be a balancing act your the backdrop of the environment is overwhelmingly causing a drought in equipment supply and again as we look at kind of that q4 as we re living it now and looking out at the very short term that is not getting better that is getting worse again out of our control we re using the time to drive our initiatives but for sure then if you look at the book end the other way long term right sooner or later supply chain has to catch up sooner or later these woes will be behind us that s for sure we know that sooner or later as this equipment sits out there and this is the nuance here it will age and have to transact and we re going to be here for that so we largely see kind of the infrastructure plans as being kind of a net positive for us but again that s really if you think of the long run in intermediate it s anybody s guess where that tipping point comes michael feniger bank of america analyst makes sense and just the time line of for the cfo succession plan i m just curious what we can kind of expect there given you guys have m a integration i think you re trying to close your auction i imagine later this year early 2022 is this search more external are we looking for someone more on the equipment side of the industry or maybe more a tech type background given what you guys are kind of building with the platform ann fandozzi chief executive officer yes so well the first headline is this is why sharon disclosed her plan so early to give us plenty of time to find the right person so first of all for those of you we re not on video we re not in person sharon turned 60 but she looks decades younger amen and but it s starting to make plans with her family as she should but given everything on our plate michael she has given us a gift of saying look i m not running anywhere i m not going anywhere i just want to make sure you guys know two years from now i no longer want to be here in heart yes but in body no and so we ve kicked off the search it s early days i would say we are looking for the best athlete we have laid out the strategy it is an external search because we are this transformation to a marketplace the organic growth we re driving it s a complex business and it s big and it s getting more complex and it s getting bigger and so to that end we ve kicked off a search we feel no gun to the head there s no fire drill here we will take the time it takes to find the right person even when we find the right person sharon has of course graciously agreed to then do the right things with transition but then also support all of the integration and all of the pieces we have on our plate so the intention is for her to add value for that entire time period and never leave us high and dry so i feel no pressure here at all i feel very confident with where we re going and i feel like we will have the time to find the perfect person for us for the future operator your next question comes from bryan fast with raymond james please go ahead bryan fast raymond james analyst thanks and good morning just one question for myself but just looking if you could elaborate on what gave you confidence to expand the satellite yard model and maybe what costs are associated with bringing these online ann fandozzi chief executive officer yes so let me start and then i m going to turn it over to jim kessler our president and chief operating officer we are a test and learn culture so we had a point of view and that point of view said what sellers want they re clearly asking for the most money in their pocket that is what they want right when they come to ritchie bros they say here you go for a piece of equipment we want the most money in our pocket we had a point of view that said if we put yards closer to those sellers we will both make it easier to do business with us but really drive the transportation cost down that was the hypothesis then we set up a whole set of kpis around it to test and learn and then gain confidence so let me pause there and then turn it over to jim on what all of that was jim kessler chief operating officer yes perfect thanks ann and similar to what we talked about last quarter in the satellite yards in the pilot that we have seen new customers from a seller standpoint greater than our existing yards and then also the flow through that we can see for the satellite yards and kind of think about five acres of land very few people less than five not a lot of investment that s needed besides setting up systems and some very basic stuff so very high flow through so when you look at gtv per square foot dramatically better than our larger yards that we have so those two metrics were the main ones that we looked at that we wanted to continue our pilot which what we re continuing was really our original thesis to get up to the number of yards that we thought were good enough to really find the answer to this question so it s still early days especially here in the us our european business has a little bit more time behind it where we re seeing some very exciting numbers but very early here in the us to come up with an answer but we re right at the point where we consider we have a full pilot in place right now to be able to answer all these questions but early indications we re very excited about bryan fast raymond james analyst okay that s it from me thanks operator your next question comes from sabahat khan with rbc capital markets please go ahead sabahat khan rbc capital markets analyst great thanks and good morning just following up on the comments around the satellite sites i guess with the addition of those are you considering any site closures of maybe legacy sites over the next few years or is that still under consideration ann fandozzi chief executive officer yes let me make that jim kessler chief operating officer and the one go ahead ann no go ahead ann ann fandozzi chief executive officer no i was about to just start and then turn it over to jim so just as a reminder that our point of view on these satellite yards is a very very different view of our larger yards so kind of again historically when we were live auctioneers and then i m turning it over to jim right it was more about the auditorium and about sale day and about that kind of point of view obviously we ve been transitioning our business to a different model where it s obviously all of the transactions are online because of covid but what we want is kind of that blend of allowing customers the ability to obviously give us care custody and control of their equipment they no longer want it they don t need it we take it we market it we split it up we inspect we do all of that stuff but we really see kind of a hybrid model going forward and kind of a use of those legacy sites and the new satellite yards is kind of i m going to steal jim s words and i m going to turn it over to him as kind of a hub and spoke approach of how we re going to go to market but with that jim sorry i interrupted back over to you jim kessler chief operating officer perfect i was just going to add just i m sure like a lot of companies we have a robust process of how do we evaluate sites and where do we need new sites is there a site that we should be thinking about that we need to move on from so we have a robust process that we go through quarterly between the sales team the operational team to make that evaluation and right now we are very happy with all of our open sites and we have decided as part of the satellite test to reopen one of the yards that we closed in raleigh and that s part of our satellite yard but we have a process that we look at and making sure the profitability and the returns that we expect to get from our network but we have a process and that includes is there a new state where we should have a hub and create a spoke model is that a new country international but that s something that we kind of do quarterly sabahat khan rbc capital markets analyst okay great and then just a second one on there s a lot of discussion earlier on the ims and you provided some good color on the different phases that you re thinking about as that ramps up i guess do you have some time lines or even internally how you re thinking about how long it might take for each phase to kind of build up is this sort of number of unit customers just trying to get an idea of how we should think about that platform sort of fully ramping up over the next few years ann fandozzi chief executive officer yes we haven t it s a great question we haven t communicated a time line so to speak but the way to think about it is it is a multiyear journey by the time we get there and so i would kind of look at the history and even the page that we showed we have a point of view whether it s ims or listings or anything else we start with or even satellite yards to go to market model we have a point of view we form a strong thesis around it and we developed the kpis before we ever hit the go switch we then say ok what are the leading indicators and test and learn some things are much quicker if you take a look at the satellite yard page and what jim s organization is doing there we started getting a lot of confidence quickly on the kpis the efficiency of those sites the new sellers that it was attracting new buyers and it gave us enough learnings quickly that we could start filling things out but as jim said it s still a test but filling things out more around the globe look at the other side of it where we had the texas initiative with a go to market model we laid that out at the same time and it s taken us longer to learn and of course because it s a complex business and skill sets capabilities all of those kinds of things and now we re here we re scaling it that s the way to think about ims so the time line is driven less there is a time line to kind of the us building out the modern architecture and the technology to really allow it to fulfill its full ambition that comes every quarter we have more functionality but these you don t move to a modern architecture overnight it takes time fully but really the way to think about the gating factor is when we feel confident in the learnings and in the test to then move into the next one we do it on a quarterly basis we have a huge sense of urgency i m not holding back information literally when we feel like the organizational lift is on a good flywheel we ll move our sights to the assets and then when we feel like the assets are in a good place we ll move our sights to the service adoption and the kind of the conversion and share of wallet so it s less about an external time line and more about when we feel like we ve learned and we can scale that s where we re going to go sabahat khan rbc capital markets analyst great thanks very much for the color operator your next question comes from cherilyn radbourne with td securities please go ahead cherilyn radbourne td securities analyst thanks just a follow up on m a which you seem to be clearly signaling there will be more of can you tell us what your strategic priorities are in that regard and what you think your capacity is given the leverage that will result following euro auctions and smartequip ann fandozzi chief executive officer yes so let me start and then i ll leave the how and pass the what over to sharon cherilyn we don t we are hopefully the signal you guys are getting from us is that we re as it was december 7 2020 we are open to any and all what solutions to fulfill the how vision so our vision is clear it is this marketplace the pillars underneath are crystal clear about first and foremost making ourselves become easier to do business with and add value to our customers employees i just keep beating the drum because this is it right there s no other the architecture of the ims and then the growth pillars when we say we have a robust m a pipeline it s just like a robust test and learn pipeline we have for organic please don t mistake it both are robust so literally the kpis around when and if we do m a when and if we invest in something organically when and if we partner with someone it s all about the kpis of speed efficiency and kind of driving this vision forward so that is how we evaluate everything that we re looking at but again the prioritization is around getting to that marketplace and then fulfilling the vision of each of those five pillars that is it that is our focus sharon do you want to add anything on the how sharon driscoll chief financial officer sure so i think cherilyn the way to think about how we ve gone how we release the information around our intention to finance euro auction that plan really still holds and those leverage models that we indicated at the time we announced euro did actually anticipate enough room for some additional acquisitions and did because we were fairly far along in our thinking of smartequip we have made sure that in our discussions with our banks as well as the credit rating agencies that our intentions on that acquisition and potential acquisitions going forward were already incorporated into our leverage thinking so certainly once we put the bonds in place for euro once the euro transaction completes we will be reprioritizing some debt repayment strategies to be able to get that debt level back down to a more comfortable leverage range and but in that modeling we have already anticipated not large scale acquisitions but certainly some smaller potential house we ve been incorporating that into our thinking i think for the right acquisition we may be open to some as we talked about with rouse not just debt funding but some additional equity to be able to secure management teams to be able to kind of secure the operational models going forward so those kind of equity plays are always in our thinking as pertaining to best outcome in terms of how the companies integrate with us and so that s kind of our thinking today we re very conservative in our views and so with our projections i think what we ve already relayed to the street in terms of the leverage model on closure of euro the view on that has not changed and we will embark on some debt repayment strategies again to be able to keep what we see as our current rating structures with the agencies keep them in line cherilyn radbourne td securities analyst so can you just remind us what sort of leverage target you have before you would sort of embark on using the balance sheet more aggressively sharon driscoll chief financial officer well we called out that we would at closure of euro be just i think just under the four times level again each acquisition that we are considering has its own different parameters and we re currently kind of bb rated with our current bond those are the types of things that we will keep in mind and each acquisition we will look at and consider how that fits into those principles cherilyn radbourne td securities analyst that s it from me thanks operator that is all the time we have for questions today please proceed ms fandozzi ann fandozzi chief executive officer thank you so much i m just going to take a little minute less than a minute to really thank everyone on this call i m going to start with actually thanking our team members many of whom listening thanking our partners and thanking all of you for taking the time again as we take a look at the future hopefully you guys picked up the message that we are very excited we re bullish about where we re headed but the reality of the marketplace we find ourselves in and what we are facing in q4 is real it s a point in time but it is real and something that we are dealing with as is the rest of the marketplace but with that thank you again for joining us and hopefully everybody has a wonderful and safe weekend bye bye operator duration 58 minutes call participants sameer rathod

operator greetings welcome to the cellectis q3 2021 earnings call at this time all participants are in a listen only mode a question and answer session will follow the formal presentation please note this conference is being recorded i will now turn the conference over to your host eric dutang chief financial officer thank you you may begin 10 stocks we like better than cellectis when our award winning analyst team has a stock tip it can pay to listen after all the newsletter they have run for over a decade motley fool stock advisor has tripled the market they just revealed what they believe are the ten best stocks for investors to buy right now and cellectis wasn t one of them that s right they think these 10 stocks are even better buys see the 10 stocks stock advisor returns as of october 20 2021 eric dutang chief financial office thank you and welcome everyone to cellectis third quarter 2021 corporate update and financial results conference call joining me on the call today with prepared remarks is dr andre choulika our chief executive officer and dr carrie brownstein our chief medical officer yesterday evening cellectis filed its interim report and press release reporting our financial results products third quarter and nine month period ending september 30th 2021 these people and press release are available on our website at cellectis com as a reminder we will make forward looking statements regarding cellectis financial outlook in addition to its manufacturing regulatory and product development these statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ from those forecasted a description of these risk can be found in our most recent form 20 f filed with the sec for the year ending on december 31st 2020 and subsequent filings cellectis makes with the sec from time to time i would like now hand the call over to andre andre choulika chief executive officer thank you eric and good morning and thank you everyone for joining us today over the course of the third quarter and the last 9 months of 2021 cellectis has achieved a series of key milestones and we are incredibly grateful and proud of all the hard work achieved by our team our partners and our stakeholders 2021 has been a productive year thus far for cellectis we have made significant progress on all fronts that we re thrilled to share with you over the next half hour notably yesterday cellectis announced that the release of two abstracts accepted for presentation at the 63rd american society of hematology annual meeting cellectis will present additional preliminary clinical data from its balli 01 trial of ucar t22 in patients with relapsed or refractory b cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia and presentation of our first preclinical data of talglobin 01 for the treatment of sickle cell disease additionally with regard to our preclinical ucar t pipeline focusing on solid tumors we have made notable progress with ucart metal our allogeneic car t cell product candidate targeting expressing solid tumors we are excited to share that the first preclinical data demonstrating in vitro and in vivo antitumor activity will be presented at the society for immunotherapy of cancer annual meeting later this month in 2018 cellectis made transformative decision to internalize the manufacturing of its therapeutic products this decision revealed the crucial competitive advantage in today s world this investment in our gmp many factoring facility provide cellectis with independence and control over its gene and cell therapy processes from buffers to dna messenger rna vectors and of course our cell therapies such as our ucar ts we create and own our processes our development and our production in the cell and gene therapy space whoever owns the process owns the product due to the success of completion of both of our gmp manufacturing facilities we can move swiftly into an innovative id at the r d stage to clinical trials with potentials to produce commercial level supplies in the future we are proud to be one of the only companies of our size that are capable of moving into innovative new ids from r d to clinical trial to manufacturing and delivery directly to the patient all in house we believe that bringing manufacturing in house could contribute to eliminating some of the barriers competitor are facing our goal this to provide consistency and safety in our production ensure lead time are met and adaptability as each disease target by our advanced therapies may require cutting edge innovation at the level of our manufacturing capabilities we need to fully master the process importantly having our manufacturing in house means that we can rapidly version promising therapeutic candidates as we monitor clinical responses leading to the best possible product at registrational filing our parent gmp manufacturing facility is now fully operational for the production of starting material on the other side of the plant our rally gmp manufacturing facility qualification of the facility equipment and systems was completed successfully in q3 qualification of the second ucart production suite equipment remains on track to enable start of engineering runs of this third ucart product in early 2022 now i would like to turn the call over to dr carrie brownstein our chief medical officer to give an update of our three sponsored clinical trials and preclinical product pipeline carrie please go ahead carrie brownstein chief medical officer thank you andre cellectis continues to progress our phase one clinical trials evaluating our three proprietary allogeneic car t cell therapies in hematologic malignancies balli 01 evaluating ucart 22 in patients with relapsed or refractory b cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia ameli 01 evaluating ucart 123 in patients with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia and melani 01 evaluating ucart cs1 in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma as andre mentioned 2021 has been a busy and productive year for cellectis with our proprietary clinical and preclinical program making substantial progress and we are excited to share additional preliminary clinical data from our balli 01 trial at the american society of hematology 63rd annual meeting next month the abstract includes updated preliminary results from the phase 1 open label dose escalation balli 01 study in patients with relapsed refractory ball from the first cohort of patients who received ucart 22 after fludarabine cyclophosphamide and alemtuzumab lymphodepletion the addition of alemtuzumab to fc was well tolerated deep in host t cell depletion and promoted car t cell expansion and persistence the data presented support the safety and activity of ucart 22 after fda lymphodepletion and patients with relapsed refractory ball and the additional data will be presented at the congress enrollment in the study is ongoing additionally preclinical data from the talglobin 01 an autologous gene therapy product candidate designed to repair the mutated beta globin gene and subsequently restore production of hemoglobin a in patients with sickle cell disease was awarded a poster presentation at ash the data that will be presented are the first demonstration that talen based engineering could be used to correct the mutation in the beta globin gene of homozygous sickle cell anemia patients derived hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells the data showed high level of hemoglobin a expression reversion of phenotype the capacity of talglobin 01 edited cells to engraft in vivo and a low level of off target cleavage collectively the data demonstrate high efficiency and safety of talen treatment in hspcs and positioned it as the best in class gene editing technology for gene therapy product development we are also pleased to share that our partner allogene will present data from our licensed allogeneic car t programs at ash data from both the phase 1 alpha ii study evaluating allo 501a and patients with relapsed refractory non hodgkin s lymphoma and the phase i universal study evaluating allo 715 in patients with relapsed refractory multiple myeloma will be shared in oral presentations allogene will also present a poster on data from their phase 1 alpha study evaluating allo 501 in patients with relapsed refractory non hodgkin s lymphoma during the second quarter of 2021 we presented preliminary translational data from the first group of patients enrolled in the melani 01 trial of ucart cs1 at the virtual 24th annual meeting of the american society of gene and cell therapy the early preliminary data presented validate cs1 as a target for allogeneic car t cells in multiple myeloma ucart cs1 expansion and persistence was observed and correlated with changes and relevant serum cytokines and anti myeloma activity cellectis is advancing one of the most robust allogeneic car t pipelines and we anticipate filing two additional new drug applications for two novel ucar t product candidates in 2022 ucart 20x22 and ucart meso ucart 20x22 is the first allogeneic dual car t cell product candidate which is being developed for patients with b cell non hodgkin s lymphoma ucart meso is an allogeneic car t cell product candidate targeting mesothelin a tumor associated antigen that is highly consistently expressed in mesothelioma and pancreatic cancer and is also over expressed in a subset of other solid tumors in addition to expressing meso car ucart meso also leverages talen gene editing to overcome immune suppression mediated by tgf beta ucart meso is being developed for patients with mesotheline expressing solid tumors cellectis will present initial preclinical data that support antitumor activity of ucart meso in a poster presentation at the society for immunotherapy of cancer s 36th annual meeting in washington dc and virtually on november 10th to 14th 2021 with that i d like to hand the call back over to eric dutang cellectis chief financial officer for an overview of our financials for the quarter eric please go ahead eric dutang chief financial office thank you i will provide a brief overview of our financials for the third quarter and first 9 months of 2021 i would like to highlight that the cash equivalents current financial assets and restricted cash position of cellectis excluding calyxt as of september 30th 2021 was 201 million compared to 244 million as of december 31st 2020 this difference mainly reflects 92 million of net cash flows used in operating investing and lease financing activities which were partially offset by 45 million of net equity proceeds raised from the company s atm program in april 2021 and 10 million proceeds from the stock option exercise this cash position is expected to be sufficient to fund cellectis stand alone operations into early 2023 the consolidated cash equivalents current financial assets and restricted cash position of cellectis including credit was 216 million as of september 30 202 1 compared to 274 million as of december 31st 2020 the net cash flows used in operating capital expenditure and these financing activities were 92 million at cellectis and 15 million at calyxt in the first 9 months of 2021 the net loss attributable to shareholders of cellectis excluding calyxt was 75 million in first 9 months of 2021 compared to 21 million in 2020 this 54 million decrease in the net loss between 2021 and 2020 was primarily driven by a decrease in revenues and other income of 30 million and an increase in r d expenses of 32 million which was partially offset by an increase in net financial gains by 8 million the consolidated net loss attributable to shareholders of cellectis including calyxt what 89 million or 2 per share in the first 9 months of 2021 compared to 42 million or 0 98 per share in 2020 the consolidated adjusted net loss attributable to shareholders of cellectis excluding non cash stock based compensation expenses was 80 million or 1 09 per share in the first 9 months of 2021 compared to 30 million or 0 72 per share in 2020 we are laser focused to spend our cash on developing our deep product candidates in the clinic and operating our state of the art manufacturing facilities in paris in new island on the other hand our focus on maintaining an efficient corporate infrastructure should enable more limited growth in g a with that i would like to hand the call back over to andre for concluding remarks andre please go ahead andre choulika chief executive officer thank you eric our allogeneic car t platform position us at the forefront of developing navarro car t therapeutics that usher in the next generation of cancer therapies we continue to leverage our expertise in gene editing and clinical development to transform the lives of patients with cancer and rare genetic diseases and we look forward to continuing this effort in q4 2021 into 2022 and beyond at cellectis we continue to leverage our groundbreaking gene editing platform to develop novel proprietary medicines to transform the lives of patients with serious diseases our current proprietary clinical stage programs are focused on patients with advanced hematological malignancies and we continue to expect our robust pipeline into the clinic to tackle additional oncology settings including solid tumors and to address the unmet medical needs of patients with severe genetic disease with that i would like to open the call for question and answers questions and answers operator thank you at this time we ll be conducting a question and answer session our first question comes from the line of with citigroup please proceed with your question unidentified participant yeah hi andrew and thank you very much for taking the question i had a question on ucart 22 on the ash data could you provide a bit more detail with respect to the types of data that we ll see in the presentation and what is your internal bar that would qualify as industry successful datasets andre choulika chief executive officer thank you so much for this question i think the most appropriate person to answer the question is probably carrie carrie would like to take this question carrie brownstein chief medical officer sure absolutely hi miguel nice to hear from you so what we re planning on showing is the first handful of patients that were treated with fludarabine cyclophosphamide and alemtuzumab the lymphodepletion regimen so in the abstract is the first group that we had ready to prepare for the abstract but we will have additional data at the meeting and just know we re as you know we re still in the dose escalation phase of the study so we re not quite where we need to be from what we consider a bar for an approval so to speak and as you know we are in a very relapsed refractory group of patients we will have patients who have previous cd 19 directed therapy so for acute leukemia i m not expecting as we move through our clinical development plan for our first shot on goal so to speak with this product i would not expect the bar to be tremendously high unidentified participant got it okay thanks and then i just had a question on the ucart meso for the data to be presented at 50 to the extent that you can comment can you give us a preview of that dataset and what are the key features of that preclinical data sets that are supporting the clinical development andre choulika chief executive officer carrie do you want to also describe meso well as you want okay carrie brownstein chief medical officer so andre i think we are in a better position to do that yeah thanks andre choulika chief executive officer yes so like meso has been developed it s i think it s like the first off the shelf car t out there like all the complication that you ve seen in other types of sourcing for allogeneic car t targeting meso and one of the features is extremely interesting that would be showed at ash on this is like the knock out of the tgf beta receptor on the cell tgf beta receptor is always is the potential down regulator for a t cells in the tumor microenvironment and one of the big challenges cellectis is tackling through all the car t we are developing for solid tumors is trying to tackle the tumor in like microenvironment the tme such as tap for example that is something that is supposed to blow the like an article but definitely tap is the product that will poke holes into the solid tumor protection and meso is essentially a car that s not going to be shut down by the negative feedback loop that you have with tj beta 2 that is present in the macro environment and this is part of data that we have we show also that this type of car will probably work in combo and that would probably give a very interesting feature not only for mesothelioma but potentially for a lot of different types of cancers the fda view was selected also with all the attributes that this car has which is like a cd it s the same platform as all the other car we developed which is the cd 52 knockout so it will work on that alemtuzumab and tcr alpha plus it s a triple knock out i think it s the first of its kind triple knock out car t we re currently preparing this car to go into clinic and i think the data are compelling and definitely encourages us in vitro as well as in vivo frequent data gives like the compelling results for the tackling series of solid tumors unidentified participant thank you operator thank you our next question comes from the line of gena wang with barclays please proceed with your question gena wang barclays cfa manager director thank you for taking my questions i have a few regarding a modern big picture question so the first one maybe for andre wondering the your partner allogene had the clinical hold and i think that the earnings call they comment they did not disclose too much but they comment there is some concern about translocation so just wondering how is the read through to your programs and then also regarding your drug product how much do you test regarding each step with the chromosome translocation events and how do you detect that and then my second question is regarding the allogeneic car t approach in general we did see several companies and also your partner allogene will share some data on consolidation approach and we did see improved the complete response rate and we don t know about the durability any thoughts from this approach like apply to your programs andre choulika chief executive officer well thank you gena so much for the questions first of all i think i m going to let the allogene management team comment on the clinical hold because i think it s like we re definitely very supportive very confident on the handling of the situation by the allogene team that s making fantastic work on their side we re extremely excited by the data they re showing on ucar t 19 or allo 501a actually and i think this is definitely transformative the data on the allergenic car special with the consolidation i will come back to this but to speak about the impact on cellectis there is like of course we re monitoring the situation very closely we re helping as much as we can do whatever we can we will definitely help to go through this period and we have like a strong confidence in the product and the outcome and we believe that this is like this trial is going to resume and definitely nevertheless chromosomal aberrations are quite frequent among human population and would it be certain chromosomes have more aberration because there are subject to dna recombination due to the state where they are so like a lot of our immune cells b and t cells undergo again dna recombination at a certain stage and sometimes these dna recombinations can lead to some normal changes in there however a few things that should be said first the prologue does not endanger like there is like series of patients that have been those are the same platform so we re confident on cellectis global platform in our not only gene editing but also the global platform where we develop our genic car t to be very stable the second thing is that adult t cells there is no cell line of adult t cells in general and then finally the cancer is like an allogeneic cell term cancerous this is all the beauty about an allogeneic approach you don t catch cancer especially t cell cancer from like an allogeneic donor this is not going to happen actually never happened in history and it s something that could be quite fair so we re quite confident with this and we believe that the platform on the contrary will come stronger from the space and also with a lot of confidence about what do we have so we have no concerns today on the potential risk on what cellectis and our partners are doing and we believe that this is like an intermediate phase in there on the contrary we re very focused and very positive on the outcome of the data that not only our partners are having but also cellectis producing and these all are ideas and products and targets that cellectis has been accepting and i think for the size of the company and joining so many lifesaving products is something that s definitely transformative and will remain with the same type of technologies that we have now on the consolidation study is something i ve been always a very strong advocate but i think it could be interesting to have carrie s view because i ve been speaking about like the consolidation studies since years and we discussed this together gena but carrie have like a fresher eye than myself and a more medical doctor eye so carrie if you want to say a few words about this carrie brownstein chief medical officer sure hi gena nice to here from you as well so i m really excited about the presentation that includes all of the consolidation treatment i think i ve been saying this since i joined cellectis now a year and a half ago i mean it s one of the main beauties and key points that i think is going to make allogeneic car t cell therapies successful is the fact that you can give additional doses and that s one of the huge drawbacks of the autologous setting we all know that these additional treatments whether we re using chemotherapy whether using anabolic therapies whether using small molecules whatever it is in the history of treating any of these diseases has to do with being able to get the cancer cells to a state that not only you don t see that anymore but that you can t measure them anymore and the deeper the remission that you couldn t bring a patient to the longer their duration as well as the longer their survival and potential for cure so giving additional treatment is always the right way to go when you can and therefore it really exciting to finally being able to see larger dataset for the patients who receive more than one therapy in the allogeneic setting and showing that it s able to really make a difference in treatment for these patients gena wang barclays cfa manager director thank you very much operator thank you our next question comes from the line of michael schmidt with guggenheim please proceed with your question kelsey goodwin guggenheim senior associate hey this is kelsey on for michael thanks for taking our questions i have two quick ones first could you just provide some color on where you re at with the other ongoing car t programs so ucart 123 and cs1 and then with respect to the talglobin program could you just remind us kind of the key areas of differentiation versus existing competitors in the field and how you kind of think about that thanks so much andre choulika chief executive officer carrie do you want to give an update on 123 and cs1 i can give an update talglobin carrie brownstein chief medical officer yes sure that s perfect sorry i was on mute for a second yeah so for ucart 123 for relapsed refractory aml and for the i ll start with that one first so that study as we ve said has been moving through dose escalation i think as you know aml is a tough space with patients who are quite sick and tend to be a little more fragile than you would see with acute lymphoblastic leukemia or with lymphoma so it is taking a bit longer but we re moving through dose escalations and we re hoping to have additional data at some point next year to share with everyone as far as the myeloma study for ucart cs1 that too as you know we had been on clinical hold we reopened after changing the protocol adding some additional safety pieces for guidance for treatment of adverse events as well as some other rules that the fda was requiring to ensure safety as we move forward so we ve been moving through dose escalation and that too has been moving along nicely there s a lot of interest from all of our investigators and again this is another program that we hope to be able to show additional data later next year as you know earlier this year we did present the original translational data from that first data set before the hold which did show some interesting translational data that included the expansion of the cells it showed all the cytokines that we expect to see and we did see some response so we re super excited about this program continuing to move forward and are looking forward to share data when the time is right andre choulika chief executive officer thank you carrie on the talglobin side the big differentiation that we have is most of the current trials that you see for tackling beta globin or beta thalassemia or sickle cell disease is based on the knock out of one repressor to reactivate different type of hemoglobin which is people hemoglobin so you keep the model the sickle hemoglobin in the cells you destroy another gene so there is one gene that is disrupted with the mutation in there sickling the cells you destroy another gene that is a repressor and finally reactivate a gene that is not supposed to be expressed that can restore kind of the phenotype which works actually which is like the results that have been produced so far what people imagine that could be the gene editing if there is a point mutation that induces sickling in the hemoglobin gene people imagine figure out that editing the mutation would be fixing back the mutation which is not happening in most of these trials so the approach cellectis is taking is repairing the mutation in the hemoglobin b gene and fixing this mutation and restoring the adult hemoglobin in the cells without leaving any scars or new scars in the dna so you put back the gene to the sequence it was supposed to be this is an approach we re not of course there is competition in this field but we believe that cellectis approach with the technologies we re developing such a talen and the approach we have with our electric portion technology which is the gene engine and the sizable technology brings it to a very high level of repaired adult hemoglobin so like cells that are totally fixed with a very reduced side effects around and a very high on target with very accurate repair of this hemoglobin at the end so that s what differentiates us from most of the approach that you see currently in the clinic and we believe that this is what patients want their hemoglobin to be fixed kelsey goodwin guggenheim senior associate great okay thank you so much thank you our next question comes from the line of kelly shi with jefferies please proceed with your question dave windley jefferies llc senior equity research analyst hi hi this is dave on for kelly thank you for taking the question just a quick question on is it possible that other things like cd 52 lymphodepletion regimen could be the reason for this expected outcome and another question is the for ash data can you provide some detail whether it will include patient who had prior cd 19 car t treatment andre choulika chief executive officer thank you well thank you very much for the question well you mean like just to ask precision like you mean that like the cd 52 monoclonal antibody could induce inversion or like a chromosomal aberration somewhere dave windley jefferies llc senior equity research analyst yeah andre choulika chief executive officer that was the question well personally i might not have all the information about this but it seems to me complex especially for a non internalizing antibody such as like alemtuzumab or like bi generic of alemtuzumab to induce such type of course migration that are quite classical in general it s not something that has not been observed and is observed quite often in a lot of patient but potentially the global population it s not that is not susceptible to chromosomal changes in there so it s extreme it s part of whole but extremely unlikely on the mechanistic side excuse me like the second part of the question i just stepped out dave windley jefferies llc senior equity research analyst the second part of the question is if you can provide any color on ash update do you have will you have any data on patient with prior cd 19 car t treatment carrie brownstein chief medical officer i can answer that so sure i mean to make the long story short ash abstract will include the next group of patients treated on the study all of your prior therapies whether it was cd 19 or otherwise will be included in their past medical history past prior treatment dataset so that data will be included but i m not going to speak to today what proportion of those patients we do allow patients in the trial who have had prior cd 19 directed therapy and i think we have already disclosed in terms of our study design for the expansion we re going to focus on those group of patients but for the dose escalation we re not limiting to only those types of patients dave windley jefferies llc senior equity research analyst okay better thank you carrie brownstein chief medical officer sure operator thank you our next question comes from the line of hartaj singh with oppenheimer co please proceed with your question hartaj singh oppenheimer stock analyst great thank you and thanks for the update i just got a couple of quick questions one is a follow up on the cd 19 project some of those patients that are on cd 19 directed therapies also have an antigen loss i don t know if that is all of the patients that relapse of cd 19 directed therapies it s about the subset and if it is a subset could that be a biomarker for example in those expansion for an accelerated sort of like approval assuming you see good responses so that s number one and the number two in terms of your solid tumors with mesothelioma it s really interesting we are looking forward to this data among the first and i believe that s solid tumors with that preclinically allogeneic car t but andre you ve spoken of this earlier but can you talk specifically how a clinical development plan in phase one and phase two can work i mean the pd 1 and pd l initial pd 1 are approved in three to four years as immunotherapy in various cancers solid tumor seem to be you can move faster any thoughts there just in terms of what a development program could look like assuming you see success early on with the product thank you andre choulika chief executive officer thanks hartaj for the great questions and i m going to split it to two like so the first part of the question your question maybe carrie can answer this because she knows a lot of it the second part of the question she can also answer it carrie brownstein chief medical officer yeah andre choulika chief executive officer i guess she can answer all the questions carrie brownstein chief medical officer yeah sure or maybe i won t answer but i will give you some idea andre choulika chief executive officer so go ahead please carrie carrie brownstein chief medical officer yes sure so the first part of the question but cd 19 so i think that s a good point but no not everyone who relapses and or doesn t respond to a cd 19 directed therapy has the antigen loss i think the numbers if i m not mistaken at somewhere between 20 and 30 that said i wouldn t necessarily call that a biomarker but i ll get to that in a second so there s not a tremendous amount of data in leukemia obviously after the cd 19 directed therapy and when we have the blinatumomab data and there is some of the ucart 19 data from survey but there is no it s not as vast of a dataset as you would as we ve seen for lymphoma so it s hard to compare what we know from one data to another but that said in terms of the development plan and we ve been very open about this from the get go my plan for this program is to try to get it into patients as quickly as possible and have the therapy that can go to a bla and as you know that is exactly the group of patients that while it s a super small niche indication it is a place where the bar would be extremely low for the amount of data as well as the was the response rate to see something and so absolutely that is a group of patients that we re focused on it s in our clinical trial design for our expansion to focus on that group because we know that group really needs therapy and needs it quickly and could help us bring a product to market quick that said the reason it s such an interesting piece is that it gives depending on how good the data is so even if it works in patients who have failed and maybe they have cd 19 loss it also may show dramatic activity even in patients who haven t failed so it gives us an opportunity to kind of move into multiple in the treatment paradigm for these patients and i think it s super important so yes and it s yes and yes but also no if that make sense hartaj singh oppenheimer stock analyst yeah thanks and just on the solid tumor question just broadly what are your thoughts once you get into the clinic any potential for accelerated approval in this if you had user filling overexpressing cancers carrie brownstein chief medical officer yeah i mean i think that the mesothelin program is really interesting and exciting i do think however it really will be the first program targeting user filling from an allogeneic setting and while yes can we have a chance for an accelerated approval it s all going to depend on the data we see and until we get into the clinic and see what we see it s going to be hard to make that calculation but obviously in my plans and when i look into how do we do clinical development i m always looking for multiple different avenues to take so we can have staggered approaches and whether there is an accelerated approval path for a specific like mesothelioma for example highly specific cancer where there is clear consistent overexpression where you would likely see your proof of concept and where there isn t a ton of options i would be looking for one option to go quickly and fast and that could be one i would also be looking for broader ways of getting larger indications and a bigger market share and things like that so all of that will be looked into and we would be putting together a comprehensive program so we can find ways of doing that quickly and efficiently hartaj singh oppenheimer stock analyst great andre choulika chief executive officer hartaj what is interesting is that like the monoclonal antibody like pd 1 enters or pdl 1 blockers enter into the solid tumors so they can get into there the problem is that immune cells are protected by the cancer accentuated thermal blast in 70 of solid tumors they do not respond because of the difficulty of the immune system to access the tumor itself that can continue to grow protected by the car so the concept of blowing up the car with the fat car can be transformative in doing these types of combos and approach to this is i think which carrie is describing is a very wise type of approach that can definitely expand a potential that today we cannot really have a graph on it it could be transformative hartaj singh oppenheimer stock analyst great thank you andre thank you brownstein andre choulika chief executive officer thanks carrie brownstein chief medical officer thank you operator thank you our next question comes from the line of jack allen with baird please proceed with your question jack allen baird senior research analyst thank you guys so much for taking the questions i just had one brief one and i know we re going to avoid commenting on allogene s specific instances here but i was wondering if you could provide any update with regard to ongoing regulatory interactions you have with the fda and have regulators had any request for additional product specifications or anything about nature as we move past this hold with allogene thank you so much for taking the question andre choulika chief executive officer hi jack like thank you so much for the question it s a hard question to answer fully for the simple reason it s a lot of these interactions we have on a regular basis with the fda are confidential and under i don t want to share particularly because it s also a competitive advantage that cellectis has on its side but so far we haven t seen any significant change into this i guess that things are going to so these exchanges are very fluid today and it doesn t change anything so i think that it s important to monitor the situation on daily basis but cellectis is so far on a very good track with our own trials excuse me but like it s difficult to share more than this jack allen baird senior research analyst i totally understand thank you so much andre choulika chief executive officer sure operator thank you our next question comes from the line of raju prasad with william blair please proceed with your question raju prasad william blair research associate thanks for taking the question in the ash abstract for balli it s said that the three patients in the fca dl 2 discontinue i m just wondering why and as we think about the 20x22 next gene candidate can you maybe put that in the context of ucart 22 development thanks carrie brownstein chief medical officer sure yeah andre i can take this one so our abstract concludes the first three patients we will have the other additional patients in the abstract presentation at the meeting and all of that data will be in there so i don t want to get into reasons for discontinuation and all that because it will be in the data set and i don t think i can share that due to embargo rules because that s part of the dataset again just suffice it to say that we re still in dose escalation and we haven t reached our recommended phase two dose yet so there ll be different reasons for why patients came up in study and as far as 20x22 i mean i think the big differences and why this is important as you well know the ucart 22 which was one of our first programs has their rqre cd20 on it so it would be potentially be activated and killed with rituximab on board and as you know in lymphoma we can t really use got as well since most patients will have rituximab on board and rituximab has been shown to be floating around in patient bodies for up to 6 months or longer and therefore it would potentially diminish the activity of our cells so we wouldn t want to do that for lymphoma so we re positioning ucart 22 for aml for leukemia because of that and rituximab is rarely used in aml but 20x22 which not only is fantastic because it has the dual car and really has an opportunity to really differentiate itself from what s out there but therefore would not cause an issue with rituximab operator thank you our next question comes from the line of david dai with snbc please proceed with your question david dai snbc vice president senior vbotech analyst hey thank you so much for taking my questions i have 2 questions first i just wanted to get some clarification on the ucart 22 ash abstract data where you said one patient had blast reduction consistent with cri could you provide some additional color on this reduction is that a confirmed our cri and then second question is you were also presenting really encouraging preclinical data for talglobin at ash and your approach is a very differentiating from competitors but could you comment on how frequently do data compare to the competitor programs from crispr and blues and also is the inds still on track for next year carrie brownstein chief medical officer so i can start with the first part of the question about ucart 22 and now i m trying to remember exactly what the question was there were just so many questions so the question is the reduction consistent with cri so confirm cri david dai snbc vice president senior vbotech analyst yeah well so the thing is with leukemia it all depends on it s not the same as there is no such thing as confirmed or not confirmed in terms of the response criteria so it s sort of depends on which response criteria being used whether you can count it as an actual cri or not so you ll see in the data set when we present the data what the patient had and what their blast reduction was it was quite impressive i will say but however depending on which response criteria you use in leukemia and there s a few so the one is the nccn which is what we were using there is also the modified chesting which is what we ve used for inotuzumab and then just each one of them has different depending on how long you can measure them for but unfortunately unlike with other with for example we re not checking that leukemia in the bone marrow every day so it s really hard to know exactly whether or not it needs certain criteria so that s why we were kind of careful engaging with our answer there but i think it s extremely interestng and then it s extremely encouraging data at a very lower dose level in our first group of patients treated with sda which is pretty amazing in my opinion and then i don t know andre if you want to speak to talglobin andre choulika chief executive officer yes the talglobin is currently being manufactured but once we finish manufacturing we have to go through all the requirements with the gmp material to start preparing the ind package and this is something that will start probably next year once the product will be released and it is all done internally so it s something that s quite exciting and i m not giving any guidance for the ind filing today but it is definitely a problem that will go into clinic operator thank you our next question comes from the line of nick abbott with wells fargo please proceed with your question nick abbott wells fargo analyst vice president biotech equity research thank you first question just going back to the ash abstract in what data will be presented so have you cleared 2 5 mil per kg dose if not when do you think you ll do that and is the next step 5 million per mill per kilo and i have a follow on thanks carrie brownstein chief medical officer sure i mean again i really given the embargo rules for ash i don t want to get into exactly what we re going to be presenting in which cohorts which data sets unless it was already in the abstract that has been released but as you pointed out the dose level two is the 1 million and the two is the 2 5 and the next stage would be 5 nick abbott wells fargo analyst vice president biotech equity research yes thanks and then just on the lymph count profile there are no range bars on the data that s in the abstract but it shows only a 50 reduction 9 days after infusion of the car bottoms out of 11 is that the profile you want i would have expected alc to bottomed out really before infusion or at the time of infusion carrie brownstein chief medical officer i have to pull up exactly what you re looking at because maybe it s not accurate the way it s being interpreted but what i can tell you is the patients all went to zero with the lymphodepletion and the alemtuzumab so you may be looking at the other line which is the ucart expansion i think nick abbott wells fargo analyst vice president biotech equity research i m looking at the blue line that s lymphocyte counts so carrie brownstein chief medical officer i have to fill it up i know in one of the patients the data was shown yeah i have to look at it i don t have it open in front of me but what i do know is that we can get back to you in email to explain it but what i can tell you is it depends on where it was being measured from so in some cases we re measuring the actual ucart cells in the absolute lymphocyte counts that could be what you re looking at but i ll look at it and we can send you an email with the clarification nick abbott wells fargo analyst vice president biotech equity research thanks and then maybe last one obviously it is a very heavily pretreated population as you ve said andre choulika chief executive officer yeah nick abbott wells fargo analyst vice president biotech equity research i think median is five and the abstract versus 3 at ash last year so as you think about expansion is this the kind of population five median price with car t failure and if so is that a population you think you can successfully complete the trial i mean we already have a patient here who has apparently no benefit from the car t but it still has no lymphocyte because they had the alemtuzumab and lymphodepletion so it s that patients obviously is in a very challenging place carrie brownstein chief medical officer yeah that s a really good question i think the answer though is yes i mean i think it s in our if you go to clinical trial gov it has the information on our expansion cohort i believe but i think that this goes to what i said before it s really important to have a comprehensive multiple shot on goal plan for development of any product then i think particularly given our size and wanting to be able to bring a product to bla and approval this is definitely something that we can do and i think that while in leukemia even which you ve had multiple therapies it is a disease that typically is of younger healthier people so it s not like acute myeloid leukemia where most people the vast majority of patients are over 65 or even over 75 for that matter and are super frail had multiple therapies that their organs don t work well generally speaking leukemia patients are younger it s the most common cancer in children it is the most common cancer for young adults and we re going to be as one of our arms so to speak of development for this program is to really focus on these patients who were otherwise in super good shape maybe they ve had multiple therapies but they re in super good shape and can keep taking more and bring them to hopefully to a cure somewhere where they can continue to have a long life and i think it s super important so i think in aml in particular it s a little bit of a different story than when you re talking about myeloid leukemia or some of these other diseases that you see in older people so i think in our expansion and where we would want to potentially have a fast to market strategy would be in these younger cd 19 directed failures so it still need the therapy and are still otherwise with the exception of their leukemia really well and to need to be treated and need something they can make them move forward and potentially have a life so that said though there are it s a small niche indication and therefore other strategies and other development plans are in place for us in terms of where else we can go and how we go about doing that so we can bring it to a larger group and to your point potentially not necessarily people who failed five therapies and failed car t already that will ulter obviously yeah thanks nick abbott wells fargo analyst vice president biotech equity research thank you very much operator thank you our final question comes from the line of ingrid gafanhao with kempen please proceed with your question ingrid gafanhao kempen equity research analyst hi team thank you for taking my questions i ll keep it a bit brief then just checking i just wanted to check with you once again what are your plans calyxt and your shareholdership i think you mentioned you are planning to maintain it but would you be keen to monetize this let s say in the short to mid term andre choulika chief executive officer hi ingrid excuse me like the i missed the beginning of your question actually was not super clear it s about what ingrid gafanhao kempen equity research analyst yeah sure i just wanted to check with you what is your current thinking on calyxt and your shareholdership andre choulika chief executive officer yeah actually currently we think kelly just announced leadership change with the arrival of michael carr and also the change in strategy that has been introduced not only by the new leadership but also by the board of directors under the chairmanship of eva bay and we believe that this change is about to transform the company in a very meaningful manner and as cellectis has a significant stake into account calyxt i think that we are positive on the fact that this is going to bring a lot of value and you see that since then it has been quite well received by the market as i said like cellectis is definitely have a invested interest in the success of calyxt and waiting up to this and it s something that we believe is going to be very valuable in the future for us as shareholders of calyxt so we have to wait up to the time the change in strategy is implemented and we believe that the current company have all the pieces to be extremely successful in the implementation of this new strategy very rapidly and very swiftly which we should be to our advantage nick abbott wells fargo analyst vice president biotech equity research right andre thank you that s clear and if i may i have just one more question for eric just looking ahead into next year considering that you re planning to move some programs ind forward are you providing any guidance on your cash run eric dutang chief financial office we don t provide any guidance on our cash run what we say the cash runway is in 2023 on cellectis and we don t disclose milestone payments we have a partnership with where we can get up to from 10 million from 19 programs and also the partnership with the allogene where we can get up to 3 billion on 15 target andre choulika chief executive officer and also with iovance and with series of milestone to be paid but currently the cash run into 2023 is unchanged ingrid gafanhao kempen equity research analyst alright thank you very much andre choulika chief executive officer thank you operator thank you ladies and gentlemen we have reached the end of the question and answer session i will now turn the call over to andre choulika for closing remarks andre choulika chief executive officer well thank you very much everyone for this q a we re extremely excited to have all these questions and excited of our trials and our partners trials there is a lot of things ongoing at cellectis i think that cellectis have seriously leaped in point a turning point for the company was internalizing mold of manufacturing and what comes next in the coming months and years is the transformative cellectis that is becoming a true like modified biopharmaceutical company making things from a to z and like one stop shop with gene edited car t and oncology gene therapy and of course with the powerful strategy in the clinic as we ve been sharing with carrie and i think that this is going to change so please watch closely and come to our meetings and posters at ash we re waiting for you operator thank you andre choulika chief executive officer thank you very much operator duration 61 minutes call participants eric

like to turn the call over to bill boor president and chief executive officer bill william c boor president and chief executive officer thank you mark welcome and thank you for joining us today to review our results for the second quarter of fiscal year 2022 we re very happy to report another record quarter for revenue and earnings revenue increased 39 year over year and diluted eps was up nearly 150 we also achieved a record housing gross margin of 24 1 this was partly due to average selling price continuing its upward trajectory with a 13 sequential increase and partly due to the temporary low we saw in lumber and osb pricing that flowed through our cost of goods sales goods sold during the quarter demand for our products remained strong and our backlogs continue to grow excluding commodore backlogs were 828 million and the acquisition added another 279 million putting the total at 1 1 billion this represents about 40 to 42 weeks of production new home supply has lagged for many years leading to a large housing deficit particularly for lower cost homes demographics and low interest rates continue to underpin the strong demand we are experiencing and as the cost for supply and labor inputs increase the efficiency advantages of factory built housing relative to site built are increasing as well this all results in a very positive and growing opportunity for our industry by any measure we re seeing continued strong demand and can sell every house we can make regarding production it won t surprise anyone on the call that supply issues have not let up and they are affecting nearly every material we use to build homes not much i can add to the information we re all hearing about availability of imports as well as domestically produced supplies we have no ability to predict how long but expect the situation will persist for some time our teams continue to do a great job managing through it and working to minimize the significant impact this has had on production labor difficulties also continue to negatively impact production however because of the holistic approach we ve been taking to address the root causes with fundamental and lasting solutions we re beginning to see signs of improvement in staffing and retention we ve implemented increased wages and benefits but equally as important we are investing in recruiting onboarding and training processes the labor issues faced by nearly all manufacturers are complex and we re building systems and approaches that we believe will provide advantages long term that kind of fundamental systemic work is how we re building our team skills in addition to this intense focus on labor solutions our plant teams are continuing to simplify product offerings in order to increase volume for our customers strategically we ve pushed forward by taking action across the spectrum of our investment priorities our recent investment in fort worth is a great example of improving process flow to enable increased production that investment is well on its way to improving throughput by approximately 20 we re working to identify and pursue any opportunities to make similar investments across our network of plants with regard to our previously announced glendale project we have incurred permitting delays that have moved our start up production to the second quarter of calendar year 2022 the good news is that we ve now received the necessary permits and are executing on the build out this project will both nearly double our park model production in arizona and free up a production line for incremental hud capacity at our goodyear plant on the acquisition front we closed on the commodore transaction during the quarter a little ahead of the planned third quarter timeline after just a month and a half since the closing integration is going well and we could not be happier about joining forces with the people at commodore beyond the geographic expansion and 25 increase in capacity this deal brings i remain as excited as ever about the manufacturing technologies and the best practices we ll be applying across the combined company the challenges that have limited production have hidden the fact that our plants are improving their efficiencies for example our hours per floor produced have improved this year as our plants demonstrate their ability to drive through this period of under staffing and intermittent high absenteeism as we solve these issues and our suppliers become more reliable we re poised to see a new level of plant throughput so strategically we ve not paused and we re looking forward to playing an increasing role in addressing the affordable housing issues that are facing prospective homebuyers today we have our new cfo allison aden with us on the call she has been here for just a couple of months now and we re very happy to have her on board with that i ll turn it over to alison to discuss the quarterly results in more detail allison k aden executive vice president chief financial officer treasurer thank you bill we re pleased to report that cavco achieved record breaking net revenue results for the second fiscal quarter of 2022 net revenues for the period were 359 5 million 39 4 higher than the 258 million posted for the same quarter last year and up 8 8 sequentially over the first quarter of fiscal 2022 within the factory built housing segment net revenue increased 42 to 342 million compared to 241 million in the prior year quarter this increase was primarily due to a 35 3 uplift in average revenue per home sold driven by product pricing increases to pass through rising material costs as well as product mix shift to more multi section homes in q2 of fiscal 2022 units sold also increased 5 from the same period a year ago included in the q2 revenue results was one week of activity for commodore homes of 4 4 million increases in home production levels continue to be somewhat muted as we face hiring challenges unpredictable factory employee absenteeism and supply chain disruption factory utilization for q2 2022 was consistent with the q1 2022 utilization rate of 75 but was higher than the q2 2021 utilization rate of 70 financial services segment net revenue increased 2 6 to 17 5 million from 17 million primarily due to higher home loan sales volume servicing income and insurance policies in force compared to the prior year in addition to year over year increases in revenue for the quarter we also expanded our profit margin percentage q2 2022 consolidated gross profit as a percentage of net revenue was 25 up from 20 8 in the same period last year a 420 basis point improvement the increase is mainly the result of the factory built housing segment increasing to 24 1 in q2 2022 versus 19 2 in q2 2021 most factories have been implementing product price increases at a rate greater than input cost increase resulting in higher total gross margin dollars per home while also expanding the gross margin percentage although lumber and other lumber related product market prices have declined those benefits now being realized in cost of sales these decreases have been mostly offset by other product price increases on many other input costs the gross margin from commodore was not accretive in the period as inventory was written up to the fair value through the application of purchase accounting as required by gaap resulting in no margin on the associated sales we expect the remaining inventory at fair value to sell through toward the later half of the third quarter gross margin as a percentage of revenue in financial services increased to 43 7 in q2 2022 from 43 4 in q2 2021 and fewer weather related events in the current period partially offset by unrealized losses on marketable equity securities compared to unrealized gain in the prior year period selling general and administrative expenses in the second quarter of fiscal 2022 were 45 4 million or 12 6 of net revenue compared to 35 5 million or 13 7 of net revenue during the same quarter last year the increase is due to commodore acquisition deal costs plus higher incentive and commission wages on higher earnings and were partially offset by the additional d o insurance premium amortization of 2 1 million in the prior year quarter other income this quarter was 4 7 million compared to 1 7 million in the prior year period this increase was primarily driven by a one time 3 3 million gain on the consolidation of a non marketable equity investment that was increased from a 50 ownership level up to a 70 ownership level pre tax profit was up 150 2 this quarter and 49 million from 19 6 million from the prior year the effective income tax rate was 23 1 for the second fiscal quarter compared to 23 2 in the same period last year new this quarter is a line item for net income that is attributable to the remaining 30 non controlling interest in a non marketable equity investment that we do not own after deducting from that component net income attributable to cavco shareholders was up 150 to 37 6 million compared to net income of 15 million in the same quarter of the prior year net income per diluted share this quarter was 4 06 versus 1 62 in last year s second quarter now i ll turn it over to paul to discuss the balance sheet paul bigbee chief accounting officer thanks allison so comparing the october 2 2021 balance sheet to april 3 2021 the cash balance was 224 3 million down 98 million from 322 3 million six months earlier the decrease is primarily due to the acquisition of commodore homes repurchases of common stock and higher inventory purchases these uses of cash were partially offset by net income excluding the impact of non cash items changes in working capital primarily related to higher accrued expenses and other current liability balances and the sale of consumer loans greater than the loan originations and then in general across the board we had increases in accounts receivable commercial loans receivable inventories property plant and equipment goodwill and intangibles accounts payable and accrued liabilities due to the acquisitions during the period consumer loans receivable decrease related to principal collections on loans held for investment that were previously securitized pre paid and other assets were lower as the other assets recorded for delinquent loans sold to ginnie mae have decreased due to lower forbearance rates while we are not obligated to repurchase these loans accounting guidelines requires us to record an asset and liability for the potential of a repurchase at reporting period accrued expenses and other current liability balances increased in addition to acquisition balances as a result of higher wage accruals from the deferral of payroll tax payments under the cares act and higher volume rebate accruals and customer deposits received as a result of the greater order rates redeemable and non controlling interest is a new line item that represents the value of the non controlling shareholders interest due to the consolidation of a non marketable equity investment previously discussed lastly stockholders equity was approximately 733 1 million as of october 2 up 49 5 million from 683 6 million as of april 3 2021 and with that bill this completes the financial report william c boor president and chief executive officer thank you paul victor let s turn it over for questions questions and answers operator our first question will come from the line of daniel moore from cjs securities you may begin daniel moore cjs securities analyst thank you bill allison and paul good morning or good afternoon depending on where you are and thanks for taking the questions let me start with gross margin obviously very strong in the quarter even given the raw material and other supply chain headwinds just talk about sustainability of that level as we look out into q3 and q4 do you expect any pullback or is that 25 type level sustainable for the next few quarters anyway william c boor president and chief executive officer i ll take a quick stab and others here may want to add to what i ll say we did kind of catch the temporary drop in lumber and osb during the quarter so while prices increased and i think with long backlogs there s every reason to expect that prices will hold the cost of goods sold had a temporary dip in lumber and osb so we re already seeing that come up so the cost side is really the wildcard that we can t predict very well maybe it will turn again in our favor but that s the thing that i think you really have to look at in the coming quarters and if you re going to try to predict what the gross margins will be anything you guys have anything to add to that it s a little bit hard to predict though and i think we ve explained in the past how the costs have about a 30 to 60 day lag in hitting our cost of goods sold so if you follow those key commodity inputs you can kind of get a sense for where their impact will lay in the p l paul bigbee chief accounting officer were in our p l in the first two in really august and september fully daniel moore cjs securities analyst helpful okay understood and then what are your expectations for production levels as we look out to q3 and into q4 given typical seasonality in some of the northern geographies as well as lingering supply chain challenges william c boor president and chief executive officer yeah i mean that second part is kind of the key i think we are getting showing a little bit of progress on stabilizing and growing our workforce we ve been understaffed for quite a while but you hit on the key which is supplies are the question mark and we don t really don t think we re any different from anyone else and saying we don t see that just suddenly clearing up so that s really a governor on how high we ll be able to go with production seasonality i think with the backlogs we re seeing we have at the moment it shouldn t be a big impact to what we produce daniel moore cjs securities analyst even in the northeast midwest those locales you ll still kind of produce straight through if you have enough raw materials william c boor president and chief executive officer i think generally i mean we ll see some impact but in the scheme of our total company production it shouldn t be a huge factor daniel moore cjs securities analyst perfect and then i really appreciate the comments regarding improvements in throughput hours per floor and i know this question is a little theoretical but if supply chain were not an issue how many more homes either in numbers or percentages do you think you could produce across the portfolio including commodore william c boor president and chief executive officer yeah we feel really good about what the plants have demonstrated during a number of quarters now where they ve really been short handed both general staffing number of folks on the payroll as well as absenteeism which is hard to predict and we made a comment last quarter i ll kind of reinforce that we re looking back in a lot of our internal comparisons to two years ago because it was pre covid and more of a stable grounding point for some analysis and this quarter we made a few more floors in the quarter production wise than we did in the similar quarter two years ago and we did that with over 10 less production hours so that it gives us some optimism as we continue to get on top of labor that we should be able to really kind of blow past pre covid levels of production i m not giving you the number you d like to have because i don t know if i ll predict it but we re looking to try to hold those efficiency gains as we staff up and we should be able to get we are existing on a plant by plant basis same plant basis we should be able to exceed where we were before covid and you ll remember too that even if you go back to 2019 we were in a pretty strong demand market so we were generally making everything we could make daniel moore cjs securities analyst understood i appreciate that and then given the initiatives some of the expansions etc do you have a target of how fast you can grow capacity again excluding supply chain challenges but how fast do you think annualized you should be able to sort of grow that capacity with operating efficiencies greenfields etc thanks again william c boor president and chief executive officer yes now i appreciate the question i apologize that we don t really have a target because of the supply i mean we re so focused on kind of optimizing what we re doing from a well managing the supply constraint and at the same time getting everything we can control internally focused on being ready to make as much as possible as supply limitations ease up but with that i got to just be honest with you and say it s inside the company with that supply dynamic it s very hard for us to say hypothetically what s our target over the next several quarters for production it s just a real challenge every day so it s just kind of a peek inside our mindset right now but we do think we re doing all the things that are positioning us to not miss a beat as much as supply will allow us we ll be maximizing production daniel moore cjs securities analyst i will jump back in queue with a couple of follow ups thank you william c boor president and chief executive officer thanks dan operator and our next question will come from the line of greg palm from craig hallum you may begin greg palm craig hallum capital analyst yeah thanks congrats on the really good results here william c boor president and chief executive officer thanks greg greg palm craig hallum capital analyst so maybe just starting on demand environment just kind of curious if you could walk us through what you re seeing by channel and do you think that you re starting to see some more material i guess share gains versus site built whether that s would be consumers that are now sort of culminated into your space versus traditional home william c boor president and chief executive officer yeah demand channel by channel i couldn t even differentiate it because it s strong across the board we can t make enough frankly we can t keep many of our customers happy right now they d all like to add more homes so they re are all very strong and then the second regarding the second part of your question greg palm craig hallum capital analyst yeah i just i m just kind of curious if you re seeing more share gains from the site built william c boor president and chief executive officer yeah i think you can look at i mean you can look at how the manufactured housing industry shipments have compared to new home sales and they kind of bottomed out and i think i m right about this they kind of bottomed out during the pandemic at around 10 and now we re up kind of in the mid teens and probably that s a statement that of the challenges that the site builders are having so we ve seen and over quarter to quarter the share increased pretty dramatically and that s due to a lot of things we do believe that there is that interface we talked about a lot between what manufactured housing does as far as price points and what site builders do this point i tried to make in my prepared remarks about as supply as input costs including labor go up it s a challenge for us but we re more efficient with those inputs and so they re moving farther and farther away from being able to supply kind of the upper end of what we traditionally do so i really do think that we re capturing some of that space that they just can t hit at this point and people are buying manufactured housing more and more so i think we re taking some share in that regard the flip side is if you flip over to the the folks that are just trying to get into a house at the lower end of what we do that s where the story is kind of tough because with price increases like they ve been a lot of people are getting priced out at that lower end but yeah i do think that it s clearly the manufactured housing and we are taking some share away from site built right now and the other thing i always recount greg is that and i know this probably doesn t need to be said but i always feel i need to say it when you look at our industry shipments it has for a while represented what we can make not what demand is so if our industry could make more we d be even a higher share of new homes at this point greg palm craig hallum capital analyst yeah it s a good point as well looking at backlog if my math is right so excluding commodore you re up a little bit sequentially but a lot less so than your other publicly traded peers so curious if you re being more selective in terms of order intake based on capacity levels or if there s anything else to call out there william c boor president and chief executive officer yeah i do think ours has been strong kind of a really good question because i know people are trying to think is there some differentiation across the industry about order pace what i ll try to explain here is that our during backlogs the orders we count in backlog compared to our total orders has some judgment in it and we want to manage our backlog to be as conservative as we think is reasonable meaning as we all know we re out many months in lead time and so when we get orders that are for really far out in some cases on a plant by plant basis we ll make the decision to they re good orders but we ll make the decision not to include them in our backlog as we look at it internally and as we reported to you all and long winded way of saying that during this quarter we actually took a considerable number of orders and said hey let s they re so far out let s take them out of our backlog number for now doesn t mean they re not good orders doesn t mean we won t make them but it s a bit of conservatism in case the market does change on us so it s kind of a little bit apologetically we report this backlog and yet there is some other than judgment in it and this quarter we made a correction that makes it look like it grew a little bit less than if we hadn t made that correction so i hope that s hope that explains that a bit and you might have some follow up questions on that for us greg palm craig hallum capital analyst yeah i definitely do that s interesting do you care to quantify exactly how much that amount might be william c boor president and chief executive officer i m looking because i don t have the number at the top of my head yeah i don t think we have a quantification for you right now it was a meaningful amount that we took out and it s not real helpful but my guess is that i would say that i think you should my answer would be that our backlogs on a if we hadn t made that correction were very much in line with the industry greg palm craig hallum capital analyst and do you not view those i mean it sounds like those are real orders but what s the hesitancy of not putting them in the backlog i m just a little bit confused why you won t include them if you do in fact think they re real orders william c boor president and chief executive officer yeah i understand well they re real orders we plan to make them it s a assessment we make to make sure that what we re looking at in the backlog is i guess a quality backlog that it really wouldn t change if the industry did see a little bit of a pullback so we all know that orders can vanish and we re not expecting that we re not predicting a pullback in the industry but we re constantly evaluating the backlog to make sure that what we re looking at we feel like is a really conservative high quality backlog greg palm craig hallum capital analyst okay that that makes sense if i could just spend a couple of minutes on commodore i think there were some commentary on purchase accounting and the gross margin impact in the current quarter can you quantify what that was to the consolidated and what kind of impact you expect in the current quarter as well allison k aden executive vice president chief financial officer treasurer yeah i mean basically given the timing of the closing date we had five business days of commodore operations which was about 4 4 million in revenue which we had mentioned during an acquisition like this you basically are required to apply purchase accounting and as you know write up the inventory to the fair value which negated the any profitability in this particular quarter but we do expect to sell through the inventory that we purchased kind of midway through this quarter to through the third quarter so we d start seeing their margins uplift to levels that we had shared with you historically greg palm craig hallum capital analyst okay and it sounded like there was also some one time acquisition related costs that my guess was included in opex can you quantify how much that was assuming it was sort of one time in nature and i guess trying to figure out if there is any lingering items we need to think about in the current quarter as well allison k aden executive vice president chief financial officer treasurer you re right absolutely in sg a there would have been 2 1 million worth of deal costs associated with commodore which is essentially the large body of the cost associated with the deal greg palm craig hallum capital analyst great okay all right i ll leave it there and thanks for the help operator and our next question will come from the line of jay mccanless from wedbush you may begin jay mccanless wedbush securities analyst thanks good afternoon everyone so i got three questions for you the first one in the original commodore announcement cavco indicated that commodore delivered 3 700 homes in the 12 months ended march 31 i guess did commodore have the same jump in the backlog post the initial covid surge like cavco and sky did and if so what is commodore s quarterly run rate on home sales now assuming that they re having to work through a larger backlog and production headwinds like legacy cavco william c boor president and chief executive officer yeah we looked at the quarter increase and it was very consistent with other increases ours and others so their backlog growth is very much in line with other numbers you guys are looking at and from a run rate perspective they are basically pretty close to where they were pre covid the 3 700 they re a little bit off the 3 700 because of some staffing challenges right now but they re very much in line with where they were pre covid on their run rate jay mccanless wedbush securities analyst okay do you since they are in the northeast is there any seasonality we need to think about and how that 3 700 or below 3 700 falls out during the calendar year william c boor president and chief executive officer yeah i think i had mentioned earlier that for ours i think when you spread it over our entire company it s not that significant but yeah there are plants that are in the northeast will have some seasonality they do have the big backlogs right now so they ll be running they can to try to work those backlogs down but sure a little bit of production seasonality there jay mccanless wedbush securities analyst okay and then in terms of the commodore average price i think it was roughly 70 000 based on that same release is that still the case or have they had a large step up in price from when the press release came out william c boor president and chief executive officer yeah they ve been increasing i mean their current prices are a bit higher than that their average selling price both from increases that they ve made in line with the rest of the industry and also not to belabor the point but we ve mentioned a few times in previous discussions that they pursue a different pricing policy and so they protected price in the backlog more than us and others in the industry and so they are also getting an average selling price lift from working off that price protected backlog jay mccanless wedbush securities analyst so where are they sitting in 75 000 80 000 on average now or where are they shaking out william c boor president and chief executive officer yeah they re in the upper 70 000s jay mccanless wedbush securities analyst okay and then i guess just on the mix for cavco this quarter you said there were more multi section homes in there but is that price that we saw this quarter is that a good number to use for the next couple of quarters based on what s sitting in backlog allison k aden executive vice president chief financial officer treasurer so as we think about the price and the effect of price increases and the effect of the mix predominantly the increase in price the increase in asp was due to pricing with some uplift coming from mix they re probably more minor as we look forward our factories they continue to review pricing but i think that we were successful in the second quarter of really having all the factories now put in place increases to cover material cost uplift so i would currently without any large changes to material costs that need to be passed through we consider those somewhat consistent going into the third quarter but may be some drift upward from any shifts to more multi section homes jay mccanless wedbush securities analyst okay okay that s great thanks for taking my questions william c boor president and chief executive officer thank you operator our next question will be from daniel moore from cjs securities you may begin daniel moore cjs securities analyst thanks again maybe one macro and one micro the macro earlier this week we heard one of your competitors talk about the duration of land home mh loans materially improving going from the kind of low 20s toward the more on par with stick built in the kind of 30 year range as well as new lenders coming into the mh financing arena are those trends consistent with what you re seeing and just how significant is that from your perspective william c boor president and chief executive officer yeah absolutely consistent we read the comments as well and we d just kind of echo them extending the duration or the term on both land home and chattel lending is a big deal for affordability and it really kind of helps us set the price increases and modest but kind of threaten rate increases so our we re seeing exactly the same thing and i think it s solid lending we re still seeing appropriate underwriting standards i don t have any concerns in that regard but these extensions really make a difference for people that generally buy on a monthly basis daniel moore cjs securities analyst got it and you ve talked about this in the past and a little bit earlier but if you could elaborate on the opportunity to streamline products across facilities to share manufacturing techniques between cavco and commodore and i don t know if there s an ability to quantify the potential uplift or benefit but maybe any more detail on that as we look out over the next year or two would be helpful william c boor president and chief executive officer yeah on product simplification when demand s like this and when our customers really are more they re more interested in getting the incremental homes than they are in customization and specialized product we re deep into really focusing on product simplification in some cases with long backlogs you ve already got a lot of orders that kind of broaden your product mix that you ve got to work through so that the benefits kind of come over time but we re very focused on product simplification it s a big deal for getting more throughput so we ll see gains continue from that perspective and it plays a part in dan in what i talked about earlier as far as getting more homes per employee hour produced some of that is very much attributable to product simplification so we re getting those gains again on the commodore it s just the idea flow had started already we ve gotten together we had companywide general managers meeting a few weeks ago that just really created a lot of excitement and optimism for me and the information flow of best practices in both directions was meaningful and just thinking about the things that commodore bring to us we ve talked in the past i think it was when we announced the acquisition we talked about some of the really good work they do around manufacturing technologies on the floor that increase cycle times and reduce labor intensity they re not easy gains there are things you have to really lay the groundwork for i ve said before they re very dependent on having really solid engineering systems because that s the backbone that allows you to do some of what they re doing but we re going to be able to reapply that stuff across our previous 19 plants and there s things like cnc routers and cnc cutting machines to make that process more efficient they do some great work with laser projection that reduces errors when you have to make cuts for example or when fastening floorboards for example and there is a really if they don t sound significant they really are and commodore has been all over that kind of stuff so we only have them for a little over a month right now but i think the attitudes and openness on both sides are encouraging and i really think that we re going to be able to add value in both directions pretty significantly over time daniel moore cjs securities analyst great and then i ll take a crack but earlier this week you filed a motion to dismiss the secs most recent action any comments there or thoughts around timing of when this might be kind of fully finally put to rest william c boor president and chief executive officer you ll take a crack and i thought we might actually get through a call without that i was surprised daniel moore cjs securities analyst i saved it till the end william c boor president and chief executive officer yeah pretty serious subject obviously and yeah i think when we got to when we talked to folks about the sec complaint being filed in an odd way i would kind of express that hey it s a step toward resolution and i continue to feel that way but what we filed earlier this week was really a very legally focused motion to dismiss and what i mean by that is we re not in litigation where we re arguing what the sec proposed in their complaint as far as the facts of what happened but we believe that there are some legal issues with their complaint and so our first step is what we filed this week to just challenge that and have a motion to dismiss so it s another step in the process we hope that that would be a successful step but we re ready to go to litigation if that s where we end up and we feel pretty confident in our position once that happens if it does so it still continues to be very difficult to project when it ll be resolved but i think we can all tell that we re getting closer and closer to that date daniel moore cjs securities analyst all right thanks bill and allison welcome and look forward to speaking with you at our conference coming up shortly and i appreciate the color again william c boor president and chief executive officer thanks dan allison k aden executive vice president chief financial officer treasurer thank you very much operator thank you and i m not showing any further questions in the queue at this moment william c boor president and chief executive

our website additionally some of our comments will include forward looking statements please keep in mind that our actual results could differ materially from those projected in any of our forward looking statements in the near term we re looking forward to participating in the virtual barclays global automotive conference on november 17th and speaking with many of you there our agenda for today we ll start with ceo brian kesseler giving an overview of the third quarter and our coo kevin baird will provide more details on our performance at the segment level our cfo matti masanovich will discuss our balance sheet progress and provide an updated outlook for 2021 brian will then wrap up our prepared comments before we move into the question and answer session with that introduction i ll turn it over to brian brian kesseler chief executive officer thanks linae good morning everyone and welcome please turn to page 4 for a review of the key themes from our third quarter as we re all aware the operating conditions in the end to end supply chain environment are unprecedented from semiconductor shortages affecting our oe customer bill rates the freight and labor availability to escalating raw material and component costs we are managing through a unique operating landscape and are planning for more of the same through the end of 2021 and into 2022 more specifically in the very near term we are planning for q4 global light vehicle production to be about the same as q3 with that as a backdrop it s important to note that our global scale and market mix and structural cost improvement actions helped us mitigate the impact of the challenging operating environment on a year over year basis our volume and mix was down only 5 compared to a 20 decline in global light vehicle unit production on a constant currency basis our light vehicle value add revenues outperformed global light vehicle production and our position in various commercial truck off highway and industrial end markets and the aftermarket help support our revenue performance material cost recovery actions with our customer base are on track and contributed to revenues in the quarter but with no margin importantly our accelerate structural cost actions more than neutralized the effects of unanticipated manufacturing inefficiencies related to the light vehicle semiconductor shortages during the quarter planning ahead we have initiated new structural cost actions that will add to the 35 million benefit from the accelerate program that are expected to carry over in 2022 we are well positioned to benefit from the eventual recovery of light vehicle production volumes lastly our core growth drivers continue to build momentum motor parts and the commercial truck off highway and industrial space delivered revenue growth year over year our performance solutions segment is launching 34 bev and hybrid programs expected to yield annualized revenues of 200 million kevin will add more color on the launches later in the call but in addition our advanced suspension technologies or ast business within performance solutions were supply advanced passive and semi active suspension for light vehicle and specialty markets received very positive reviews in the automotive press for our innovative suspension technologies equips on new bevs from rivian and geely turning to page 5 let s take a look at an overview of our third quarter results revenue was 4 3 billion up 2 year over year driven by our diversified end market mix and includes 1 billion of pass through substrate sales as a reminder substrate sales are only in our clean air segment and are passed through to the customer at cost plus the small handling fee excluding substrates our value add revenue was 3 3 billion down 2 year over year excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rates as i highlighted on the previous page this compares favorably to the industry light vehicle production decline of 20 and includes material cost recovery of 110 million the scale and diversification in our regions and markets served are evident in the charts on the right in the third quarter just over 50 of our business was generated from aftermarket and commercial truck off highway and industrial applications adding the light vehicle portion of our performance solutions business which is agnostic to the vehicles powertrain 65 of our value add revenue is unrelated to oe light vehicle ice technologies we expect this mix to expand to 80 plus by the end of the decade adjusted ebitda was 279 million and adjusted ebitda margin was 8 5 despite the volatile production environment we maintained strong liquidity and our third quarter net leverage ratio improved 1 1 times since the end of 2020 on page 6 we show our enterprise performance on the left side of the slide light vehicle production declines due to the semiconductor and supply chain shortages negatively impacted our volume we estimate the value add revenue impact of the semiconductor shutdowns during the quarter was approximately 400 million and our most important geographies experienced the largest adjustment in a normal operating environment we would have expected to produce a low 20s incremental ebitda margin on that revenue contribution also our third quarter value add revenues included 110 million of material cost recovery via price in the quarter although no margin dollars came with that contribution on the right side of the page adjusted ebitda was 279 million at a value add margin rate of 8 5 down 330 basis points with almost half of the year over year margin rate decline due to temporary cost actions put in place last year that were not expected to repeat this quarter material cost recovery lag also represented a significant margin headwind compared to q3 2020 we remain on our plan to recover the higher commodity costs but there is a lag in each of our business segments our recovery arrangements vary based on region and customer which creates timing differences on a comparative basis in the box on the right you can see our accelerate restructuring savings more than offset manufacturing inefficiencies associated with the supply chain shortages which resulted in positive other operating performance of 60 basis points versus the prior year overall solid performance by the operating teams in the quarter we value their resilience and fortitude in a difficult operating environment i ll now turn it over to kevin for a review of the segment performance kevin kevin baird chief operating officer thanks brian let s turn to our motor parts business performance on page 8 aftermarket revenue was 769 million up 4 year over year on a constant currency basis on continued strong demand and relative to the second quarter it is in line with normal seasonality we saw revenue growth in all three regions including americas emea and asia pacific in spite of the lengthening supply chain lead times that are having an effect on our component and finished goods availability adjusted ebitda for the quarter was 115 million delivering a 15 ebitda margin compared to the prior year margin was impacted by non recurring temporary cost actions taken in the third quarter of 2020 as well as higher commodity price recoveries in the quarter that dilute margins before i discuss the oe segments you will hear some common themes across all three including the impact of non recurring temporary cost actions on margins in the state of our net material cost recovery as brian mentioned earlier our commodity recovery agreements differ by product region and customer steel is our most important raw material input and it s used by all three oe segments also clean air and powertrain have differing commodity exposures which i ll touch on shortly in addition the late notice on oe customer production schedule changes trapped inventory of approximately 250 million as of quarter end let s turn to our performance solutions segment on page 9 third quarter revenue was 686 million down slightly year over year in constant currency light vehicle applications representing approximately two thirds of the business were down 10 excluding currency outperforming industry production by 10 percentage points commercial truck off highway and other applications were up 58 year over year and made up almost 20 of revenues adjusted ebitda was 38 million in the third quarter for a margin of 5 5 year over year earnings comparisons were impacted by the flow through of lower volumes the impact from temporary cost actions taken in the prior year and net material price inflation due to the recovery lag earlier brian mentioned the positive market reviews on our advanced suspension technology on the rivian electric pickup truck program in addition to our ast product line we also supply that program with nvh and system protection products as a reminder the five product lines in this segment are agnostic to the powertrain technology in the vehicle in the third quarter we continued to win new business and are making inroads with china domestic oe manufacturers and their ev platforms earlier this week we announced our cvsae electronic suspension technology will make its china debut on the new premium electric brand zeekr from geely lastly approximately 80 of our alternative propulsion launches in 2021 are battery electric vehicles on page 10 we show clean air s results clean air value add revenues were 897 million and fell 8 year over year excluding foreign currency effects light vehicle value add revenues declined 22 year over year however commercial truck off highway and industrial value add revenues increased 48 year over year clean air s china commercial truck revenues as well as north america s and europe s off highway revenues expanded nicely year over year driving the bulk of the segments ctohi growth commercial truck off highway and industrial comprised 27 of the segment s value add revenues in the third quarter compared to 19 for all of 2020 adjusted ebitda was 137 million value add adjusted ebitda margin was 15 3 compared to 15 6 in the prior year period strong manufacturing performance and effective material cost management helped offset most of the negative impact from weaker volume and the non recurrence of benefits from temporary cost actions realized in q3 of 2020 in addition to base steel clean air uses large amounts of stainless steel in its operations page 11 has a summary of powertrain in constant currency revenues were about flat versus the year ago period ctohi and oe service revenues both expanded more than 20 year over year which helped offset a 13 decrease in light vehicle revenues powertrain experienced broad strength in its ctohi and oe service in europe and benefited from the strong year over year volume in the north america on road commercial truck market adjusted ebitda was 74 million and adjusted ebitda margin was 7 9 the year over year margin decline was attributable to material cost inflation due to recovery lag and non recurring temporary cost actions in the year ago period steel is powertrains most important raw material input but the business consume several other metals including significant amounts of aluminum and copper accelerate restructuring savings more than offset inefficiencies related to the semiconductor volume losses i ll now turn the call to matti to discuss our balance sheet and guidance matti masanovich chief financial officer thanks kevin i ll begin my comments on page 13 as of september 30th our net leverage ratio was 3 2 times which represented a 1 1 times improvement from our year end ratio with net debt approximately even with year end our free cash flow performance year to date has been neutral as a reminder the normal seasonality of our cash flow is weighted toward the fourth quarter the leverage improvement is driven by higher ltm adjusted ebitda we are staying focused on cash conversion while managing a volatile customer order schedule in this challenging supply chain environment our focus includes net working capital efficiency and reducing capital intensity our mid term net leverage target range is 1 5 to 2 times we ended the quarter with strong liquidity of 2 1 billion with our revolver undrawn and no significant near term debt maturities as we have in the past we plan to stay opportunistic regarding our future refinancing needs page 14 shows our updated 2021 guidance we have revised our fiscal year 2021 value added revenue guidance to a range of 13 55 billion to 13 65 billion which compares to our prior range of 13 8 billion 14 1 billion the change largely stems from lower global light vehicle production relative to our last update our guidance assumes q4 global light vehicle production volumes of approximately 16 5 million units flat with the third quarter which is more conservative than ihs s most recent q4 update actual customer production schedules have deviated from their releases over the past several months and this has continued into the fourth quarter our guidance incorporates the sequential market volume decline in our key off road markets and a sequential volume decline in our aftermarket business consistent with normal seasonality we expect our material cost recovery via price to continue to build but will be dilutive to our margin rate comparisons we have reduced our 2021 adjusted ebitda range from 1 25 billion to 1 28 billion from a range of 1 36 billion to 1 44 billion the primary driver of the change is a lower global light vehicle production due to the semiconductor shortages the ebitda decline associated with the loss revenues is slightly higher than normal because of the sudden nature of the shutdowns since mid year in some cases we have received little notice from the customers that production was being canceled creating inefficiencies and trapped costs we continue to recover the higher material costs but there is a lag and commodity inflation remains elevated we believe that the lag for material cost inflation will continue into the first half of 2022 as our commodity recoveries timing gets caught up and assuming year over year inflation growth rates begin to stabilize for the full year 2021 we continue to expect year over year savings of 110 million from our accelerate cost reduction program we expect our net debt to improve to approximately 4 3 billion at year end seasonally q4 is our largest free cash flow quarter relative to our expectations our inventory levels remained elevated in the third quarter due to the sudden and sharp light vehicle production reductions at several of our customers as kevin mentioned we estimate the trapped inventory approximately 250 million in the third quarter we are working diligently to reduce the inventory and expect to partially unwind and contribute to our free cash flow generation in the fourth quarter we have reduced our estimate for full year capex spend by 50 million due to the softer operating environment and our cash taxes are estimated to be approximately 140 million 10 million lower than prior expectation the work our team has done since the beginning of 2020 in lowering our capital intensity and our focus on free cash flow conversion has us in a strong liquidity position with significant cushion on covenants the management team remains focused on improving our balance sheet i ll now turn the call back to brian for concluding remarks brian kesseler chief executive officer thanks matti turning to page 15 i ll close with a summary of our major priorities to increase shareholder value first we have taken significant structural cost out of the business and we re not stopping with the accelerate program we have identified and initiated new projects that we expect will contribute meaningfully in 2022 on top of the 35 million of carryover savings from accelerate i want to emphasize that this continued focus positions the company to materially improve its margin rate performance once supply chain constraints are relieved and production volumes begin returning closer to 2019 levels second we have lowered the capital intensity of the business to enhance our free cash flow conversion we remain disciplined with our capital spending levels and intend to continue to enhance our working capital returns in the mid to long term we target a free cash flow to ebitda ratio in the neighborhood of 25 to 30 we re investing in our businesses that have above average growth characteristics and returns on capital we believe the investments being made today in key businesses with our motor parts and performance solutions segments will enhance the company s organic growth over the long term further we have significant opportunities to grow our ctohi revenue base over the next several years as new regulations in our key geographies increase quote and content opportunities on a go forward basis we believe the 65 of our revenue base not associated with light vehicle ic applications can outgrow the market and drive above market value add revenue growth for the entire enterprise as the company transitions to a predominantly non light vehicle ic revenue mix by the end of the decade on behalf of the leadership team we would like to thank the more than 73 000 technical team members around the world for their commitment and focus in these extraordinary times and for taking care of each other and working to keep our facilities operating safely we re proud of the high level of service they deliver to our customers as they continue to improve our operating performance thank you for taking the time to join us today operator we ll now answer any questions questions and answers operator we will now begin the question and answer session the first question comes from colin langan with wells fargo please go ahead colin langan wells fargo analyst great thanks for taking my questions just one i mean can we just broadly go through the puts and takes as we go into 2022 is there how much additional of the restructuring plan is left or are you kind of complete at this point commodities do you actually get some tailwind from recovery from this year if they stay at these levels or you still have some headwinds to go and then what kind of you had some pretty rough decrementals on the guidance cut based on relative to value added sales does that quickly reverse should we see very high incrementals on the recovery brian kesseler chief executive officer yes colin this is brian let me take the restructuring as we kind of alluded to in our comments we reaffirm the carryover impact of the accelerate program of about 35 million in the 2022 and we ve initiated and started execution on some further structural cost improvements that we believe will drive meaningful benefit into 2022 we ll highlight the details on that more in our q4 earnings call as we look forward into 2022 from a material cost perspective we re seeing the impact on our revenue with the recovery of the price we re on track with those recoveries kind of where we expect to be that obviously are those revenue dollars are empty calories they don t they only recover costs there s no margin in there and we would expect our lag to increase a little bit in this quarter from where we re at 110 million going up some as we get into the new year as commodities stabilize the lag works the other way the price stays and depending on the contract with the customers where we re negotiated we would see a tailwind of benefit as they stabilize and go down and so that s kind of that restructuring world and the tailwind world as you look at the decrementals it s actually if you just look on a volume perspective we re taking our volume down in ctohi and then seasonally on aftermarket those are a little bit of our higher margin product lines and so that s a little bit of an impact but again the aftermarket is a seasonal so it s that s kind of the usual decline q4 sequentially and ctohi is getting a little soft particularly in china as they re looking to kind of phase out their phase 5 they are very china s 5 and getting into their china 6 a little bit more so those are some of the contributors colin langan wells fargo analyst got it can you just remind us of the net impact on sort of your income from commodities i mean what it was in the quarter year to date matti masanovich chief financial officer if you re looking at every quarter we sized it at about 43 million it s on the enterprise slide that s the net impact of commodities on us and then on a full year basis will carry over about 60 million that would be recovered into 2022 so it s about 70 basis points impact to a full year margin colin langan wells fargo analyst all right thanks for taking my questions brian kesseler chief executive officer thanks colin operator our next question comes from bret jordan with jefferies please go ahead bret jordan jefferies analyst hey good morning guys brian kesseler chief executive officer good morning bret bret jordan jefferies analyst on the aftermarket side of the business could you talk about sort of on an apples to apples volume comparison i mean i guess there was some market share shift this year in the chassis category but ex that could you talk about what you saw in growth and aftermarket demand brian kesseler chief executive officer yes volume was about even maybe a bit up year over year just like everybody else especially as we re talking to our aftermarket customers the lengthening of the supply chain coming out of southeast asia and china put some availability constraint on us but team is holding up pretty well as we re talking to our customers we re probably performing better from a fill so there s still some availability gaps that as that supply chain starts to loosen up and we also have now 30 days ago 60 days ago put in the necessary orders to fill that longer cycle time from order to delivery so it seems holding up pretty well the fundamentals on the aftermarket still remain strong u s car sales are record prices can t get new cars so people pay more attention to the repairs and the vehicle miles traveled has returned into the pre pandemic level so we like where we re positioned matti masanovich chief financial officer on a year to date basis bret the motor parts space is up considerably so bret jordan jefferies analyst yes and i guess on the fill rate topic i mean could you sort of give us a feeling for what your fill rates look like maybe versus that third quarter of 2019 sort of on a ex pandemic basis how does the supply chain look brian kesseler chief executive officer it s actually up from q3 because we have supply chain had troubles back then last year is still not where we want it from an availability bret jordan jefferies analyst you re saying 19 not 20 if we looked at fill rates yes brian kesseler chief executive officer oh yes 19 is probably down 10 points bret jordan jefferies analyst okay and i guess on aftermarket pricing are you have you gotten i think you d commented in the prior question about timing of price increases but have you largely passed through what you re seeing on supply chain and materials costs in the aftermarket or does that lag brian kesseler chief executive officer we have bit of a lag with q3 we re caught up right now for q4 paying real close attention to what s going on with the commodities as we re sitting here in this quarter but the team s done a nice job of getting those pass through so bit of a benefit and then as this thing stable stabilizes a little bit that lag will work its way out for the year bret jordan jefferies analyst okay great thank you operator with no more questions this concludes our question and answer session i would like to turn the conference back over to brian for any closing remarks brian kesseler chief executive officer great thank you thank you again for your interest and your questions we just want to wrap up our call with a few comments our disciplined execution and turbulent operating environments has really yield a solid performance by the team since the beginning of the pandemic we remain committed delivering consistent results and creating shareholder value both in the near and the long term the improvements in our structural costs have firmly positioned us to materially benefit from the eventual return of light vehicle production volumes to pre pandemic levels in the near to mid term the targeted investments in our growth engines are beginning to yield both top and bottom line benefits and have set a solid foundation for our portfolio evolution through the end of the decade we look forward to stabilizing operating environment that allows us to accelerate our progress thanks again for your time and attention and we ll look to speak with you soon operator duration

gas company are dave bauer president and chief executive officer karen camiolo treasurer and principal financial officer and justin loweth president of seneca resources at the end of the prepared remarks we will open the discussion to questions the fourth quarter fiscal 2021 earnings release and november investor presentation have been posted on our investor relations website we may refer to these materials during today s call we d like to remind you that today s teleconference will contain forward looking statements while national fuel s expectations beliefs and projections are made in good faith and are believed to have a reasonable basis actual results may differ materially these statements speak only as of the date on which they are made and you may refer to last evening s earnings release for a listing of certain specific risk factors with that i ll turn it over to dave bauer david p bauer president and chief executive officer thanks brandon good morning everyone national fuel had a great fourth quarter with operating results of 0 95 per share up 138 over last year the value of our integrated model and the underlying strength of our business were both clearly evident with each of our reporting segments contributing to the increase the improvement in commodity prices the ongoing benefits of our appalachian acquisition and the continued investment in the expansion of our interstate pipeline system drove the increase and will remain as tailwinds into fiscal 22 the fourth quarter capped an outstanding year for the company one in which the underlying fundamentals of our business continued to strengthen against the backdrop of capital discipline by producers and strong domestic and global demand for natural gas the long term outlook for pricing has improved substantially to levels where we expect to generate increasing amounts of free cash flow from our upstream and gathering businesses on the pipeline side of the business our recent empire north and fm100 projects are two of the largest interstate pipeline expansions in the company s history combined these projects represent incremental pipeline revenues of more than 75 million and provide much needed capacity out of the basin and lastly at the utility we continue to see customer and demand growth which supports the need for further investment in our distribution system to that end in august the new york commission approved an extension of our system modernization tracker which will allow us to add the cost of new replacement projects to that mechanism through march 2023 this is a great program that enhances the safety and reliability of our system and reduces emissions construction of the fm100 expansion and modernization project is nearly complete earlier this week we made a filing with ferc which would allow us to place this project fully in service on december 1 this is an important project for us in addition to growing our regulated pipeline earnings and cash flows fm100 when combined with transco s leidy south expansion project create the path to attractive markets in the mid atlantic for production from each of seneca s major development areas this path gives seneca considerable flexibility in its development plans and supports growth in both seneca s production and our gathering systems throughput without a doubt this project is a perfect example of the inherent benefits of our integrated approach to development the project team has done a terrific job leading an aggressive in service timeline amid the global pandemic and supply chain disruptions total project costs are expected to come in nearly 15 under budget getting the project built on time and under budget is truly a fantastic outcome and i d like to give a big thank you to the project team including our construction contractors for a job well done those of you who have followed us for a while know that safety is a top priority at national fuel we strive to have a strong safety culture where everyone in the organization from me at the top to our newest employee sees the value of a safe work environment i m happy to say that in fiscal 21 our systemwide dark injury rate was the lowest it s been since we ve been keeping track this is a great accomplishment and i d like to congratulate the team on our continued improvement as we look to the future it s clear that natural gas will play an important role in meeting the world s energy needs as is evident from recent events in europe and asia global demand for natural gas is growing and we see continued growth here in western new york and northwest pennsylvania where natural gas resilience reliability and affordability compared with other alternatives make it the energy of choice for both space heating needs and commercial and industrial processes but as the world decarbonizes we too much lower the carbon footprint of both our customers and our own operations by doing so will require us to embrace low carbon fuels like renewable natural gas and hydrogen and new solutions like hybrid heating at the same time through our conservation incentive programs we have to encourage our customers to use less and lastly we have to improve the emissions profile of our own operations to that end in december coincident with the publication of our 2020 corporate responsibility report we announced aggressive emissions reduction targets in particular we committed to reduce methane intensity at our major operating segments by 30 to 50 from 2020 levels by 2030 in addition we pledged to reduce absolute greenhouse gas emissions by 25 again by 2030 importantly unlike the aspirational goals that have become commonplace these targets while challenging are based on tangible projects that use today s technology this is an important step for the company one that demonstrates our commitment to sustainably operating our assets for the long term before closing i want to spend a minute on our expectations for free cash flow as you can see from page 7 of our current ir deck at 4 50 natural gas prices we project free cash flow of approximately 320 million in fiscal 22 looking beyond 2022 i expect that to trend even higher as capital moderates and ffo continues to grow across the system our first priority for that free cash flow will be our dividend which we paid for the last 119 years and grown for the last 51 after paying the dividend we ll still have considerable free cash and i see three options for redeploying that capital first is reducing leverage on the balance sheet with the goal of gaining an upgrade from the rating agencies while our credit metrics will likely improve with the recent rise in pricing we need to be able to sustain those metrics through the cycles and to do so we ll probably require a reduction in our absolute debt levels we see the ability to start that deleveraging over the next few quarters ideally we d also use that capital to fund growth projects we continue to pursue expansions of our pipeline system and while projects of the size of fm100 aren t likely in the near future i do see the opportunity for us to build more modestly sized projects in addition should seneca secure additional firm transportation or long term firm sales it certainly has the acreage to continue to grow production m a is also a possibility if the right assets come on the market we d certainly take a look at them and lastly should those growth opportunities not materialize we d look to return capital to shareholders in closing national fuel had a great quarter and a great fiscal year our integrated model continues to deliver considerable benefits that are clearly evident in our financial and operating results looking forward we expect to transition to a period of substantial free cash flow which will give us significant financial flexibility and our focus on ongoing emissions reductions will improve the sustainability of our operations and position us well for the future with that i ll turn the call over to justin justin i loweth president of seneca resources company llc thanks dave and good morning everyone the fourth quarter concluded a great year for seneca resources production came in at 79 6 bcfe nearly a 20 increase from the prior year s fourth quarter this increase was driven by strong operational performance from our two rig development program as well as an additional month of production from our appalachian acquisition that closed in july 2020 for the full year production increased 36 which along with significant realized synergies from our acquisition helped to drive a 7 reduction in cash operating unit costs we ve also updated our reserve estimates with proved reserves increasing nearly 400 bcfe to 3 9 tcfe up 11 from last year we remain conservative in our approach to reserve bookings with 84 of our reserves being proved developed before diving into some operational and marketing updates i wanted to hit on the growing benefits of last year s appalachian acquisition the growth in production and related drop in unit costs help to expand operating margins and deliver significant accretion to seneca s earnings and cash flows additionally as we talked about in the past given the depressed natural gas price environment at the time of the acquisition we ascribe no value in our long term upside since closing the acquisition last july our team has continue to evaluate the undeveloped potential from a geologic operational and midstream synergy perspective this highly economic inventory has been more fully incorporated into our development plans both this year and into the future resulting in a shift of more drilling activity to tioga county in fiscal 22 we expect to bring online thee pads in tioga with two targeting the utica and the other in the marcellus incorporating more of this inventory into our program enhances capital efficiency further improving consolidated upstream and gathering returns our ability to ship activity across our three major operating areas is supported by our diverse marketing portfolio including the incremental 330 000 per day of new leidy south capacity expected to come online in december as we ve discussed previously leidy south will provide an outlook to valuable mid atlantic markets for each of our three major operating areas giving us additional flexibility to optimize our development activity and maximize returns as dave mentioned the project is on track and we should be able to start using this capacity next month with more clarity on the leidy south in service date we ve been very active on the marketing front since last quarter we ve converted a significant portion of our existing leidy south firm sales from a transco zone 6 index sale to a nymex based sale providing basis certainty on those volumes overall at this point we have hedges and fixed price firm sales in place for about three quarters of our expected fiscal 22 natural gas production we have another 17 with basis protection that is not hedged which leaves less than 10 of expected production exposed to in basin pricing this is a great spot to be in and allows us to be opportunistic in our marketing and hedging activities over the remainder of the year shifting gears our operating and spending plans for the year remain largely unchanged as we talked about previously our plan to ramp up production over the course of the year to fill our new leidy south capacity is right on track i expect q1 production to be sequentially flat and we are timing several pads to come online during the quarter in conjunction with the new leidy south capacity from there production should ramp up in q2 and q3 then level out around 1 bcf a day net toward the end of the fiscal year capital is the opposite with the extensive completion activity driving capital higher in q1 and q2 then decreasing over the second half of the year also on capital there has been a lot of industry discussion around cost inflation and service availability on the latter point we think we re well positioned to avoid meaningful impacts we ve been in regular communication with our key vendors and do not expect service availability will pose any issues however we do see some modest headwinds on the cost front as is the case with most industries labor challenges supply chain issues and increased fuel costs are impacting our service providers cost of certain materials such as tubulars are up as well all that being said we expect these increases to be largely offset by continued operational efficiencies in aggregate drill and complete drill and complete costs are likely going to rise a few percent but this is all accounted for in our capital guidance range which remains unchanged from last quarter in california our team has done a great job managing through the last 18 months and we are forecasting relatively flat oil production from fiscal 22 to fiscal 20 excuse me for fiscal 21 to fiscal 22 this is a result of long term planning for permits for our drilling program and a more active workover program in the second half of fiscal 21 that will carry into fiscal 22 while we are facing some modest cost headwinds largely from increasing steam fuel costs those are more than offset by rising oil prices and we expect to generate significant free cash flow this year also our new solar facility at south midway is substantially complete and should go in service very soon and we are moving full speed ahead with our next solar facility at south lost hills which is expected to go in service late next year honestly i want to provide an update on seneca s sustainability efforts as i mentioned last quarter we are undertaking a comprehensive study of emissions generated by various types of completion equipment we have completed all testing and are working with our completion service providers as well as air hygiene and west virginia university to evaluate the data and develop a comprehensive report this is a landmark study that will provide truly comparative data across a wide array of completions equipment including e frac technology most importantly with this data we will be able to make more informed decisions and selecting completions equipment that aligns with our sustainability values as well as our cost and performance requirements we also announced our plans to seek a responsible natural gas certification for 100 of our appalachian production through ekahau origin this iso based framework evaluates our operations under a rigorous set of esg performance criteria with independent verification the third party verification is ongoing and we expect to conclude the process in the next couple of months additionally we are working with project canary toward the responsibly sourced gas designation for approximately 300 million a day of our production utilizing their trust well process as part of our relationship with project canary we are also installing continuous emissions monitoring devices on three of our well pads we expect we expect these installations to be completed by the end of the year in addition since june of this year we have committed to the use of compressed air or electric power pneumatics on every new seneca development pad and we are retrofitting existing natural gas pneumatics on return trip pads to also run on compressed air this will continue to reduce our already low methane emissions intensity as we strive to meet our long term emissions reduction goals all of these initiatives are key steps that demonstrate our commitment to sustainability and we will remain focused on furthering and building upon these efforts throughout the coming years in closing seneca s business is fundamentally sound with a great outlook the added scale and synergies from our 2020 acquisition and recent growth have reduced operating costs and strengthened our margins our larger scale and increased inventory has given us the opportunity to further optimize our development program leading to improved capital efficiency and driving earnings and cash flows higher we also operate in one of the lowest emissions intensity basins in the world and work hard to be on the leading edge of the industry sustainability initiatives this dual focus on enhancing free cash flow while reducing our environmental footprint positions us well for ongoing success and with that i ll turn it over to karen karen m camiolo treasurer and principal financial officer thanks justin and good morning everyone national fuel closed out its fiscal year on a strong note with earnings coming in at 0 95 per share for the full year after adjusting for several items impacting comparability operating results were 4 29 per share this is well above the high end of our guidance range and was driven by several factors first the significant improvement in natural gas and crude oil prices during the quarter drove higher after hedging price realizations second operating cost came in below expectations as we continue to find ways to optimize our cost structure across all of our businesses lastly we completed some tax planning around intangible drilling costs this resulted in an adjustment to a state tax valuation allowance reducing our effective tax rate turning to fiscal 22 we now expect earnings to be in the range of 5 05 to 5 45 per share an increase of 0 65 per share or 14 at the midpoint from our preliminary guidance a few items are driving this change first we ve increased our commodity price assumptions we re now forecasting nymex natural gas prices of 5 50 per mmbtu for the first half of our fiscal year and 3 75 from april through september we ve also increased our nymex crude oil price assumption to 75 per barrel while we re well hedged for the year approximately 25 of forecasted production remains unhedged for reference a 0 25 change in our natural gas price assumption is now expected to impact earnings by 0 12 per share given the cadence of our production profile roughly two thirds of this price impact would occur in the second half of the year on the oil side our sensitivities remain unchanged with a 5 change oil impacting earnings by 0 03 per share the second major driver is a modest increase in seneca s loe we ve increased our range of 0 01 now projecting 0 83 to 0 86 per mcfe for the year this is entirely driven by streaming operations in california the higher price of natural gas will lead to higher steam fuel costs however this increase will be more than offset by the forecasted increase in oil revenues the last major driver is the impact of the system modernization tracker extension in our new york utility we expect us to increase margin at the utility by approximately 4 million for the year one other major item of note related to a recent preceding in our pennsylvania utility jurisdiction while this doesn t impact earnings or cash flow it will have an impact on the utility s ebitda it s a bit complex so i ll hit the high point due to the over funded status of our pennsylvania jurisdictions post employment benefit plans we made a regulatory filing to stop recovering these costs from our customers each year using money previously set aside in the trust we also agreed to pass back a regulatory liability through one time and ongoing bill credits material impact to our ongoing earnings or cash flows the point of note here is that the annual collection of opeb funding costs is reflected as margin in the utility s financial statements while the vast majority of the opeb expense is related to non service costs which sit below operating income by reducing our opeb collections from approximately 10 million to zero we expect to see an equivalent reduction in utility ebitda this doesn t fundamentally change the business in any way but we wanted to point out the negative impact to ebitda despite no change to our expected earnings or cash flows switching over to capital fiscal 21 came in at 770 million for the year which was toward the lower end of our guidance range this was primarily driven by costs coming in below expectations in our midstream businesses including the fm100 project dave mentioned earlier for fiscal 22 our guidance was 640 million to 760 million remains unchanged bringing this altogether our balance sheet is in a great position and our free cash flow outlook is strong in fiscal 21 funds from operations exceeded cash capital expenditures by approximately 120 million for the year adding to that the proceeds from the sale of our timber assets which closed in december we generated free cash flow in excess of our 165 million dividend payment for the year as we look to fiscal 22 we would expect our funds from operations to exceed capital spending by 300 million to 350 million at this level our free cash flow we are projecting more than 150 million of excess cash after funding our dividend for the year this provides additional cash flow that can be directed toward the debt reduction efforts dave referenced to earlier while our free cash flow is in line with previous expectations i did want to spend a minute talking about one item on the balance sheet given the recent run up in prices we recorded 600 million mark to market liability associated with our hedge portfolio well this is a rather large liability our investment grade balance sheet minimize collateral requirements such that we were limited to approximately 90 million posted with counterparties at the end of september today the collateral amount has been further reduced now sitting closer to 25 million as we progressed through the winter most of those hedges driving the current liability will settle and as a result we expect to have minimal if any collateral requirements in conclusion and echoing dave s earlier comments we re in a great spot the outlook for the business is strong and our ability to generate significant and sustainable free cash flow positions us well to deliver shareholder value well into the future with that i ll ask the operator to open the line for questions questions and answers operator thank you your first question comes from the line of holly stewart from scotia howard weil please proceed with your questions holly stewart scotia howard weil analyst good morning gentlemen karen david p bauer president and chief executive officer hi holly good morning holly stewart scotia howard weil analyst maybe dave karen just to better understand the capital allocation you ve got a 3 yield and growing dividend the leverage is trending down your share count is already very low and you ve got growing free cash flow the part the big pipeline spend appears to be behind you at this point so you mentioned kind of further debt reduction and potentially a credit seeking a credit upgrade which we think is would be a great use of capital but any further comments on maybe those other opportunities between growth at seneca and m a and further returns to shareholders david p bauer president and chief executive officer yeah not really holly we re going to be in a position where we re going to have a lot of flexibility and we re going to look to use that flexibility in the best way possible so holly stewart scotia howard weil analyst again it is a high class problem but david p bauer president and chief executive officer yeah holly stewart scotia howard weil analyst all right well that s helpful maybe moving on justin i remember last quarter you mentioned accelerating some completions and he thought that capex would probably be at the high end of the range and it looks like it wasn t so any color on those completions that maybe were supposed to happen during the quarter or maybe were are happening here in the first quarter of the year just any kind of color on that 1q guide justin i loweth president of seneca resources company llc sure so you know we accomplished what we wanted to accomplish in q4 from the completions activity and we came in toward the middle of the range we ve put out just a little high in the middle there so was pretty happy with how that ended up i noted and then as we look to q1 and 2 absolutely what we should have a full time spot crew running pretty much flat out we do now we have had one since the beginning of the fiscal year and that activity should really continue through the rest of the winter and well into q2 so definitely expect capital to be if you just took our full year capital i mean expect that to be very much weighted toward q1 q2 to be higher and then trending down into to q3 q4 holly stewart scotia howard weil analyst okay that s helpful all right that s all i had thank you guys david p bauer president and chief executive officer you bet operator thank you the next question comes from the line of umang choudhary from goldman sachs your line is open umang choudhary goldman sachs analyst hi good morning and thank you for taking my questions david p bauer president and chief executive officer you bet good morning umang choudhary goldman sachs analyst good morning my first question was on cost inflation in your prepared remarks you mentioned seeing some inflationary pressures but and you actively looking to mitigate it can you talk about the steps we re taking to offset the cost increases and what do you think the net impact would be to your both operating costs as well as capital cost heading into next year justin i loweth president of seneca resources company llc sure happy to so there s two pieces to it right there is the how much we expect overall in terms of the increases and we ve we have a very robust procurement supply chain group who is in regular dialog and actively bids out all of our key services and so through that communication we have a view that probably overall service cost will see kind of trend into the maybe the upper single digits over the course of the year but when we look at some of the offsets to that and i ll hit in a second we think that our all in kind of d c capital might be up by a couple 3 maybe 4 when we think about overall net kind of cost structure and that is all accounted for in our capital guidance and just note again we did not change our capital guidance feel comfortable with it the main drivers of what s improving that some of it has to do with i spoke a little bit about integrating more of this tioga development opportunity into our plans we just drilled a pad we re in our planning we thought it would take us about 95 days and we completed all the wells on the pad and about 75 days it s pretty meaningful savings when we re doing that if you think about the spread cost per day then on the other side where we continue to drive benefits is around managing our water we recently acquired a water storage facility in tioga county strauss hogan lycoming which serves as a hub for our eda operations we already have extensive water infrastructure in our wda that allows us to have continued reduction in our water handling costs particularly as we re getting our water to our completion operations and so i d point to those just a couple of examples of we re continuing to see improved efficiencies on the drilling side we re continuing to find ways to reduce our overall cost on the completion side and that has that has a meaningful impact on largely muting the any sort of increases we see coming umang choudhary goldman sachs analyst got it that s helpful i guess on the next question i just wanted to get your updated on the natural gas macro you talked about seeing increases in demand and i was wondering if you can provide some more color in terms of if there are any opportunities to increase the capacity on the takeaway side on your pipes to kind of meet that incremental demand justin i loweth president of seneca resources company llc well i can hit a little just macro on gas and then we can dig in on the second one too if needed so specifically we see is a continued very strong backdrop seemingly producers continue to be toeing the line on maintaining kind of maintenance levels of capital and production obviously on the privates you re seeing a little bit of creep in that and we think there will be a little bit of growth obviously in gas whether it s associated or dry gas but the demand side is very robust we continue to see some improvements obviously lng as very much materialize this year and we see it continuing so our overall view is that we re constructive on where pricing is going from a macro perspective i feel very good about the levels where it is now and frankly are pleased to see the long term curve come up into the 3 to 3 10 range it s been a meaningful improvement and i think we see some continued potential for that to go up a bit higher one other note i ll just mention at to the extent you are curious about how seneca get more gas to market we re absolutely continuing to speak with pipeline companies around opportunities and definitely look to find opportunities to do that within the national fuel family so empire and supply and so we ll look to develop opportunities to do that there and then in addition given our size we can still augment our long term opportunity to grow by entering into long term firm sales so working with some of our marketing counterparties to effectively utilize capacity that they control through amas or otherwise it s been a very successful option for us in the past and something we continue to look out as we go forward it s really a combination on reaching the markets umang choudhary goldman sachs analyst that was helpful and if i may ask one more i was very clear at sustainability report and i believe there is a discussion about studying the feasibility of what hydrogen ccus and rng can you provide any color around these like what are the what are you looking from a regulatory perspective out of technical perspective to kind of further pursue these opportunities longer term david p bauer president and chief executive officer sure on the rng front the efforts are really threefold one is connecting rng producers to our system so that they can move the gas on our pipelines the second is utility incorporating rng into its supply portfolio and then the third i think we d be looking at there is making direct investments in rng and we ve got a team pursuing that but are somewhat early stages there on the other two on hydrogen i think that s a bit of a longer term play our focus on that is evaluating our system and its ability to blend hydrogen into the gas stream looking at its impact on end users equipment and looking at ways that hydrogen could be used in say in running our the engines in our compressor stations to reduce our stack emission so right now i d say it s a lot of r d a goal would be to have a real demonstration project say within the next 12 months or so but in terms of a long term application i think it will take some time and then on the ccus side it s basically a learning exercise right now right i mean you think of our business we are really good at building pipes to move gas co2 is another gas that we could transport and we ve got a lot of experience with reservoir engineering both on the production side and on the storage side and so looking at ways that we might either reuse our assets or find new assets for carbon sequestration is something that we re interested in pursuing and learning more about is that helpful umang choudhary goldman sachs analyst that s helpful thank you thank you for your answers david p bauer president and chief executive officer yeah you bet operator thank you the next question comes from the line of tim winter from gabelli funds your line is open tim winter gabelli funds analyst thank you and congrats on great results and the successful acquisition i have two questions for you the first one is given the recent political changes in new york do you expect any changes in the natural gas sentiment david p bauer president and chief executive officer yeah not in the near term what we re seeing at albany is pretty much business as usual as it was under tim winter gabelli funds analyst okay okay and then on that note and given what s going on with the near term outlook for gas any further or can you update us on your thinking regarding any asset monetizations or financial engineering or something that may optimize the current near term outlook for gas david p bauer president and chief executive officer yeah nothing in the near term tim to report i think our group of assets is working really well together and i don t i don t see any near term monetization efforts in terms of financial engineering as we talked earlier we re in a position where we re going to have a lot of free cash flow and have some growth opportunities would be returning capital to shareholders rather than raising it tim winter gabelli funds analyst okay great thank you david p bauer president and chief executive officer you bet operator thank you the next question comes from the line of trafford lamar from raymond james please proceed with your question trafford lamar raymond james analyst hey guys thanks for taking my call first question wanted to ask on the northern access pipeline i know that it has that could circuit litigation and it s one of two pipelines i believe on such radar i just wanted to get any color or additional commentary on the status of that project david p bauer president and chief executive officer yeah so we re still working through some federal authorizations right we re various permits and studies and the like that need to be updated which is going to take a bit of a time but from a practical standpoint our certificate for the project expires in february so we re going to have to file for an extension relatively soon and i guess we ll let you know more than but as i ve said in the past it s this isn t a project it s going to be built in 22 and is likely a longer term prospect for us trafford lamar raymond james analyst okay perfect and then my second question was on california producing about 6 800 boe a day generating meaningful free cash flow do you feel like you are getting full value for your california assets and have you all consider potentially a divestment of that asset justin i loweth president of seneca resources company llc well certainly i mean our business out there has done very well and very well for many years one thing i a footnote i looked at here analysis i looked at recently was just how much cash that business has generated over the last 10 years and looking back to 2010 to present we ve generated a 1 billion of ebitda less capex which is pretty pretty incredible and the business today it continues to do very well we re producing to about 7 000 barrels of oil equivalent per day we ll will generate free cash this year with the increasing prices our revenues are certainly headed in a really good direction cost structure is solid may go up a bit with higher steam fuel cost but overall we ll just continue to add to the margin so at this point it s hard to say what exactly it is within the context of our share price but certainly it adds to our earnings it adds to our cash flows and remains a business that we re able to operate pretty successfully trafford lamar raymond james analyst perfect thanks guys operator there are no further questions i will now turn the call

warning spoilers for the eternals movie will be found about halfway into this story we ll warn you again when you re about to hit them one of the big reasons marvel comics characters continue to resonate throughout the decades is their strong mythic underpinnings for instance thor and the asgardians are taken wholesale from norse legend ghost rider has his basis in spectral horsemen folklore gathered by the brothers grimm black panther takes cues from egyptian culture as well as 20th century afrofuturism and what is the hulk but a play on robert louis stevenson s 19th century classic strange case of dr jekyll and mr hyde but what of cosmic superhero team the eternals whose own feature film from marvel studios arrived in theaters this week as it happens one of creative powerhouse jack kirby s final major contributions to the expansive marvel universe was riding the wave of a new myth being perpetrated by a german author who began espousing his theories of mankind s evolution at just the right time those new myths would snowball over the ensuing decades into numerous popular sci fi franchises and a mini industry of pseudoscience books and documentaries chariots of the gods coincidentally arriving the same year as stanley kubrick s 2001 a space odyssey depicted a mysterious alien monolith influencing early cave dwelling hominoid monkey men author erich von d√§niken s 1968 book chariots of the gods the question mark was removed in some later editions sought to impart daring new revelations of how extraterrestrial life had a sphere of influence on man s development at crucial stages of civilization much of the book s hypothesis is based around the assumption that earlier eras of man did not possess the capacity to accomplish the wonders they did with alien intervention being the only probable explanation such achievements we were apparently too stupid to hack by ourselves include the construction of the great pyramids of giza which he suggests would have taken centuries to build with the technology egyptians had at the time that s right humans could never have thought of using slaves and ramps to haul big stone blocks without a few courteous e t s other miraculous structures that von d√§niken considers to be artifacts of evidence to support his theory include england s stonehenge the moai statues of easter island and the numerous nazca lines of peru the latter large glyphs visible only from the sky are in his eyes replicas of alien structures meant to be seen from space as a kind of cosmic help wanted sign to our previous alien masters another tact he takes is to reinterpret ancient paintings or passages of religious texts through the prism of depicting aliens even when far more grounded explanations already exist from learned archaeologists chariots of the gods sought to impart daring new revelations of how extraterrestrial life had a sphere of influence on man s development at crucial stages of civilization here is a prime example of von d√§niken s specious reasoning from the book which even includes the word eternal could it be that god was an extra terrestrial what do we mean when we say that heaven is in the clouds from jesus christ to elvis presley every culture tells us of high flying bird men who zoom around the world creating magnificent works of art and choosing willing followers to share in the eternal glory from beyond the stars can all these related phenomena merely be dismissed as coincidence who is erich von d√§niken really of course the fact that all of this is easily disproved nonsense did not stop chariots of the gods from becoming a runaway bestseller with it and von d√§niken s other texts on the subject having sold over 70 million copies to date this was aided somewhat by the popularity of the occult and paranormal within the counterculture at the time also evidenced by mystic tomes like carlos castaneda s the teachings of don juan but what sort of scientific credentials did von d√§niken amass to glean all these remarkable insights none actually loading play in reality erich von d√§niken was a swiss hotelier and con artist who had been imprisoned for embezzlement before publication of his first book and then once again with the added charges of fraud and forgery afterwards for falsifying bank records so he could take out huge loans and live like king gilgamesh when confronted about the many factual errors in his works the author would become irate and highly defensive as he does in the book s own introduction the fact is even some of the nuttiest theories in chariots of the gods are not even his with ideas borrowed from scientists like carl sagan and i s shklovskii as well as french author robert charroux additionally it s been alleged that some of the theories in the book may have been straight up plagiarized from a 1960 fantasy book called the morning of the magicians which itself was influenced by the cthulhu mythos of h p lovecraft in august of 1974 playboy contacted famed astronomer sagan before interviewing von d√§niken and he made his views of the chariots author quite plain the kindest thing i can say about von d√§niken is that he ignores the science of archeology every time he sees something he can t understand he attributes it to extraterrestrial intelligence and since he understands almost nothing he sees evidence of extraterrestrial intelligence all over the planet in 2003 von d√§niken opened a theme park in switzerland called mystery park that showcased different mysteries of the world over seven giant pavilions including nazca giza and stonehenge not surprisingly the park drew controversy for promoting ideas of ancient aliens and ultimately failed though a different company took over and began reopening it in the summers as jungfrau park who are the villains kro and arishem the judge from marvel s eternals 11 images the eternals connection it was obvious from the publication of artist and writer jack kirby s first issue of the eternals in july of 1976 that he had chariots of the gods on the brain ideas about the seeding of humanity by extraterrestrials play a central part in the story of the god like celestials creating eternals and their centuries long battle against the monstrous deviants all drawn in kirby s increasingly cubist style according to ronin ro s marvel history book tales to astonish marvel wanted to title the series return of the gods in the same font as von d√§niken s book luckily the legal department stepped in and eternals it was still the second issue does say right on the cover more fantastic than chariots of the gods only lasting for 19 issues and one annual kirby s run on the book focused on the title group of heroes who evolved at the same time as humans but were gifted with glorious powers by the celestials and were then subsequently worshipped as gods throughout the eons there is even a character who debuted in issue 13 named after the ancient sumerian epic poem gilgamesh about a posthumously deified mesopotamian king in the original text gilgamesh was part god part man who at one point rose up in the sky in a space chariot and described the earth in remarkably accurate detail at least according to von d√§niken here is a quote from kirby in the eternal utterings afterword to that inaugural issue which is full of references to the sunken city of lemuria incan symbology and ships of the gods despite the fact that i ve contrived my own version of those momentous confrontations of prehistory i take them from the de facto questions of today what did happen in those remote days of men s early struggle for civilized status what is the true meaning of the myths which shared a global similarity among diverse peoples did beings of an extra terrestrial nature touch down among us and influence our lives to this present day and then the all important question of the lot are these beings in some cosmic orbit which will lead them back to us someday did beings of an extra terrestrial nature touch down among us and influence our lives to this present day jack kirby warning here come those spoilers for the eternals movie director chlo√© zhao s new 200 million dollar film version of eternals is no different from its comic book source material in that the engine driving the narrative is ancient aliens theory in the movie the eternals team of varied superpowers consists of matter manipulating sersi gemma chan high flying laser eyed ikaris richard madden energy blasting kingo kumail nanjiani illusionist sprite lia mchugh technologist phastos brian tyree henry way fast makkari lauren ridloff mind controlling druig barry keoghan super strong gilgamesh don lee quick healer ajak salma hayek and deadly swordswoman thena angelina jolie they are named after many legends throughout history because they themselves inspired those tales midway through the film sersi learns that all the eternals are merely synthetic beings robots created by the celestials to advance humanity over millennia in order to feed the new celestial named tiamut that is growing from within the earth s core the deviants were also contrived by the celestials to kill off the dinosaurs so that the more intelligent man could emerge and dominate the planet the eternals main duty is to prevent the deviants from killing tiamut before he emerges from the earth which will result in killing all life on the planet so essentially our heroes are actually robots made to look like humans by giant interstellar beings who look like everest sized refrigerators with arms and are using earth as their personal incubator the eternals don t take kindly to this new intel having grown fond of humanity and all they ve accomplished including the felling of the titan thanos they set out to stop the emergence of tiamut despite obstacles from within their own ranks loading play interspersed amid the modern day story are glimpses of some of the team s handiwork throughout the centuries including the advancements of ancient babylon and the warring culture of the aztecs the character of phastos is particularly crucial as he frequently wants to accelerate humanity s development with building and agriculture as when he yearns to give the babylonians engine powered farming equipment but must settle for a simple plow it seems a light touch is preferable when giving humans new ideas or we ll all simply destroy each other which would defeat the purpose all this is very heady material for a blockbuster and whether its ensemble cast of immortal enhanced robots with superpowers can connect to a wide audience is yet to be seen the one thing we do know is eternals is nowhere near alone when it comes to incorporating ancient aliens stuff within a pop framework end of eternals movie spoilers other films more chariots stargate many movies have carried forth the ancient alien theme with the most prominent that comes to mind being roland emmerich s 1994 sci fi epic stargate it follows james spader as a modern day scientist named dr daniel jackson who through special stones is able to open a wormhole gateway to another planet called abydos similar in desert terrain and language to ancient egypt jackson learns that the alien god ra jaye davidson had used the stargate to travel to earth centuries ago to possess bodies and enslave humans in order to mine the mineral that powers his technology indiana jones and the kingdom of the crystal skull working under some level of protest alongside story crafter george lucas

believe any of this voodoo bullsh t blair palmer childs childs chariots of the gods man they practically own south america i mean they taught the incas everything they know a mini alien industry in 1970 von d√§niken s pontificating was taken to the next level of public awareness with the release of the incredibly popular documentary feature chariots of the gods produced in germany and inexplicably nominated for an academy award after becoming the ninth highest grossing film of 1970 the film is a fairly bland 90 minutes of stock footage covering various locales undermined by an even more boring narrator it was followed in 1972 by a shorter version edited for abc television titled in search of ancient astronauts and another doc in 1973 titled in search of ancient mysteries both narrated by twilight zone guru rod serling in ancient astronauts serling paints a picture of von d√§niken as adventurous investigator on horseback far different than what we actually know to be true erich von d√§niken a german professor possessed of the mind of a scientist and the imagination of a romantic wrote a book called chariots of the gods he stated that sometime in the distant past mankind was visited by intelligent beings from outer space what in olden times might have been heresy is today intriguing speculation von d√§niken travelled to all corners of the world gathering evidence in support of his theory or is it a theory judge for yourself in 1970 von d√§niken s pontificating was taken to the next level of public awareness with the release of the incredibly popular documentary feature chariots of the gods with that level of mythmaking it s hard to imagine how these baseless theories wouldn t capture the public imagination especially in an era where you couldn t simply click over to google and discover how silly they really are these tv specials eventually grew into the popular infotainment series in search of hosted by leonard nimoy which explored various facets of the paranormal and other mysterious phenomena that series was revived in 2002 and again in 2018 with host zachary quinto but the show s effect on pop culture has nothing on a more recent program when discussing history channel s long running series ancient aliens it s hard not to think of the hilarious scene in anchorman 2 when liam neeson leads a brigade of historical soldiers representing history channel including the ghost of stonewall jackson and a minotaur james marsden s tv reporter jack lime cries out the minotaur isn t even history he s mythology one could say the exact same thing about ancient alien theories that they are modern day myths being packaged as fact by infotainment vendors like a e s history channel which has run the reality program ancient aliens for 17 seasons with no sign of slowing the show s parade of questionable sources including human meme giorgio a tsoukalos of the world s most ridiculous hairdo has pervaded the popular imagination to such an extent that a 2018 study executed at chapman university indicates that 41 percent of american adults believe that extraterrestrials have meddled in humanity s formative past this is a sad development indicative of the nefarious strain of anti intellectualism that has reared an ever larger head in discourse as the age of social media misinformation dominates the landscape while marvel s eternals is pure entertainment and should not be lumped in with false idol educational shows like ancient aliens it will be interesting to see what kind of intelligent discourse it generates on the topic both in the middle school lunchroom and beyond for even more on the new marvel movie check out our eternals ending explained dig in on the eternals post credits scene and also contemplate the eternals mid credits scene with that crazy cameo
egle earnings call for the period ending september 30 2021 eagle bulk shipping egle q3 2021 earnings call 8 00 a m et contents prepared remarks questions and answers call participants prepared remarks operator greetings and welcome to the eagle bulk shipping third quarter 2021 result conference call i will now turn the call over to gary vogel chief executive officer and frank de costanzo chief financial officer of eagle bulk shipping mr vogel you may begin gary vogel chief executive officer thank you and good morning i d like to welcome everyone to eagle bulk s third quarter 2021 earnings

forward looking statements please refer to our filings with the securities and exchange commission for a more detailed discussion of the risks and uncertainties that may have a direct bearing on our operating results our performance and our financial condition our discussion today also includes certain non gaap financial measures including adjusted net income ebitda adjusted ebitda and tce 10 stocks we like better than eagle bulk shipping when our award winning analyst team has a stock tip it can pay to listen after all the newsletter they have run for over a decade motley fool stock advisor has tripled the market they just revealed what they believe are the ten best stocks for investors to buy right now and eagle bulk shipping wasn t one of them that s right they think these 10

exchange commission for more information concerning non gaap financial measures and reconciliation to the most comparable gaap financial measures please not turn to slide 6 drybulk freight rates continue to strengthen during the third quarter on the back of robust commodity demand which was further supported by the ongoing container spillover trade as well as elevated congestion due to the ongoing supply chain bottlenecks and covid related court restrictions around the world but in particular in and around china the baltic supramax index rose by almost 34 during the quarter to average approximately 34 000 representing a 13 year high given our active management approach to trading the fleet and our significant operating leverage we generated record earnings for the quarter with net income totaling 78 million or 6 12 per share not only does this represent the highest net income we have achieved in a single quarter it also eclipses the company s best ever annual result following our recent announcement on the institution of a cash dividend policy equal to a minimum of 30 of eagle s net income our board of directors declared a cash dividend based on the third quarter s result of 2 per share separately and as previously reported we executed on a comprehensive refinancing on october 1st which has allowed us to significantly simplify our capital structure lower our interest cost and extend our bank debt maturity to 2026 please turn to slide 7 our record financial results were driven by our ability to improve tce performance by 35 quarter on quarter resulting in a net tce achieved of 29 088 as we have discussed previously given the rapidly rising market environment we experienced through the third quarter there s an inherent lag effect between our tce performance and the bsi as the majority of our fleet is employed on voyages lasting anywhere from 30 to 60 days and sometimes longer looking ahead into q4 freight rates have come off with the bsi currently trading under 30 000 which is still very conducive to cash generation for eagle as of today we have fixed about 75 of our available days for the fourth quarter and a net tce of 32 400 per day bear in mind that our cash breakeven level through the first nine months of the year is at around 11 000 on this basis notwithstanding the recent pullback in rates we are on track for exceeding this quarter s performance in q4 please turn to slide 8 in terms of operating performance we produced a record 91 million of ebitda or 19 400 per ship per day for the three months ending september 30 this represents an increase of 45 compared to the prior quarter given the fixed cost nature of our business we maintained significant operating leverage with essentially all incremental net revenue generated flowing to the bottom line please turn to slide 9 asset prices have also continued to increase in recent months with values for 10 year old supramax up around 17 on the quarter and approximately 115 year to date it s interesting to note that this price strength has occurred on the back of a record number of transactions year to date almost 840 drybulk vessels have been bought and sold totaling 14 billion in volume please turn to slide 10 in terms of sale and purchase we took delivery of our final pending acquisition last week the m v valencia eagle we estimate that the nine vessels which we acquired between november of last year and may of this year have increased in value by over 80 million separately we sold and delivered the m v tern a 2003 built supramax and our oldest vessel in the fleet just ahead of her statutory drydock our fleet currently totals 53 ships averaging 9 years of age with 89 being fitted with exhaust gas cleaning systems or scrubbers as a result of the growth and renewal of the fleet our fuel efficiency has also increased significantly over the last five years as always we will continue to evaluate vessel s p and remaining deals and look to execute on an opportunistic basis with that i would like to turn the call over to frank who will review our financial performance frank de costanzo chief financial officer thank you gary please turn to slide 12 for a summary of our third quarter financial results the continued significant improvement in the charter rate environment drove our top line growth in q3 with revenue net of both voyage and charter hire expenses totaling 142 4 million and net income coming in at 78 3 million representing a more than eight fold increase as compared to the prior quarter earnings per share for the third quarter was 6 12 on a basic basis and 4 92 on a diluted basis please note the diluted share count now includes 2 9 million shares from the convertible bond adjusted net income which excludes noncash unrealized gains and derivatives of 6 3 million came in at 72 1 million for the third quarter or 5 63 per share on a basic basis as gary mentioned earlier adjusted ebitda came in at 91 million for the third quarter let s now turn to slide 13 for an overview of our balance sheet and liquidity total cash which includes 25 6 million of restricted cash was 125 6 million at the end of q3 representing an increase of 41 8 million as compared to the end of the second quarter and an increase of 36 8 million from year end the change in cash versus prior quarter in year end was driven by cash generated from our strong operating results offset in part by the 25 million rcf pay down vessel acquisitions and debt service i will cover the movements in greater detail on the cash walk slide total liquidity improved by 51 8 million from the prior quarter to 191 6 million total liquidity is comprised of total cash of 125 6 million and 66 million of undrawn revolving credit facilities total gross debt excluding debt issuance costs at the end of q3 was 472 8 million as previously reported we executed a new 400 million credit facility on october 1st replacing our norwegian bond ultraco bank credit facility in the holdco rcf the new facility includes a 300 million term loan and a 100 million revolver of which 50 million was drawn on closing however as reported yesterday we have now fully paid down the revolver and have 100 million of undrawn availability please now turn to slide 14 for an overview of our cash flow from operations for the third quarter net cash flows provided by operating activities was 90 3 million in q3 the chart highlights the timing driven variability that working capital introduces to cash from operations as depicted by the difference between the dark blue bars which are the reported cash from ops numbers and the light blue bars with strip out changes in operating assets and liabilities primarily working capital although as the chart demonstrates the volatility caused by working capital largely evens out over time the difference between the two bars in this quarter can be explained by a significant amount of cash collections in late september please turn to slide 15 for our q3 cash walk let s focus on the top chart which covers the cash movements in q3 the revenue and operating expenditure bars are a simple look at the operations with the net of these two bars coming in at 91 million the same as our adjusted ebitda moving to the right the 18 million for vessel s p bar represents the 26 9 million cost for the acquisition of two vessels in part offset by the proceeds of 9 2 million on the sale of one vessel you can also see that we pay 25 million on our rcf and 12 million in debt service in the quarter the bottom chart covers cash movements year to date please note in the appendix of this presentation we include information on the cash and debt movements for the october 1st global refinancing let s now review slide 16 for our cash breakeven per ship per day vessel expenses or opex was 5 401 per ship per day excluding one time nonrecurring expenses related to vessel acquisitions and sales the termination of our relationship with the crewing agency we are consuming additional lubes given vessels are steaming at faster speeds and the prices have increased on the back of the rising base oils in addition due to the covid 19 pandemic we continue to face higher operating expenses across several areas including lodging and transportation costs related to crew changes along with the costs related to the procurement of stores and spares finally we have increased our spending on spares to pre emptively limit off hire as much as possible in what is a very strong rate environment drydocking came in at 917 per ship per day in q3 560 higher than prior quarter as we completed two dry docks with an additional two in progress it is worth noting that there are significant challenges regarding covid protocols and quarantine requirements for ships going into facilities for drydocks and the installation of ballast water systems we do not see this abating in the near term and therefore will likely increase off hire times for these events for the foreseeable future cash g a came in at 1 527 per ship per day in q3 marginally lower as compared to q2 it is worth noting that our g a per ship calculation is based on our own vessels whereas we operate a larger fleet including our chartered in tonnage if we were to include the chartered in days in our calculation g a per ship per day would decrease to about 1 363 cash interest expense came in at 1 387 per ship per day in q3 which was marginally lower quarter over quarter driven by an increase in ownership days and a decrease in interest expense finally cash debt principal payments came in at 1 780 per ship per day in q3 this concludes my comments i will now turn the call back to gary gary vogel chief executive officer thank you frank please turn to slide 18 as indicated earlier on the call the bsi posted a significant increase during q3 to average approximately 34 000 during the quarter both the atlantic and pacific markets pushed up simultaneously which speaks to the broad demand backdrop in the atlantic rates increased by 51 to average 34 128 and in the pacific rates increased 24 to average 32 414 relative strengthening in the atlantic during the third quarter can be attributed to the factors we discussed on our last earnings call specifically increased grain exports out of east coast south america and a strong market which was driven by elevated minor bulk exports such as slag cement gypsum salt and steel products the container spillover trade continued to positively impact our markets more specifically intra pacific and backhaul rates with cargoes such as semi finished steel parcels fertilizer in bags bag cement dry chemicals in bags and lumber moving on small and mid sized conventional bulk carriers congestion remained elevated during the period with the number of ships at port reaching a new record of 36 as compared to around 30 pre covid congestion is primarily attributed to covid related restrictions and general supply chain issues and bottlenecks caused by increased trade flows and exacerbated by shortsighted labor issues as we look ahead into q4 we ve experienced an increase in market volatility with freight rates trading off at recent multi year highs we believe this downtrend is due to a number of reasons including an easing of congestion increased tonnage availability and a decrease of cargo flows the increase in tonnage availability appears to be primarily driven from chinese flagged vessels entering the international market many of these ships typically operate in the local cabotage trade which is dominated by china s large domestic seaborne coal trade between north and south china decrease in cargo flows within the pacific has come about from what appears to be a short term pause in chinese seaborne coal purchases as well as a seasonal decrease in nickel on our cargoes as the philippines has entered its rainy season looking ahead there s been no official announcement or indication that china will increase their coal imports in the short term however this recent decrease in chinese seaborne coal buying may end up being a short term strategic maneuver to help coal pricing year to date the bsi has averaged roughly 26 900 although we expect to see elevated volatility in the near term we remain constructive on freight rates given the positive underlying fundamentals please turn to slide 19 fuel prices continue their upward momentum as demand for oil products increased across the spectrum hsfo and vlsfo are now trading around 450 and 590 hours per ton respectively the fuel price spread between hsfo and vlsfo took a dip in q3 on the back of elevated relative demand for hsfo as aging power generation plants switch from consuming higher priced gas to cheaper residual oil however we ve recently seen a normalization in relative prices with spot fuel spreads now trading around 140 per ton a new high since the crude oil collapse in mid 2020 with eighty 89 of our fleet fitted with scrubbers the price differential between hsfo and vlsfo is an important value driver for our business at current fuel spread levels we generate around 1 700 per ship per day in incremental value across our fleet equating to about 32 million of value per annum please turn to slide 20 net fleet supply growth increased slightly in q3 a total of 100 drybulk new building vessels were delivered during the period down about 20 quarter on quarter and 5 year on year partially offsetting this a total of just nine vessels were scrapped during the same period more or less unchanged as compared to the prior quarter this low level of scrapping is not surprising given the strength in the underlying spot market in terms of forward supply growth the overall order book stands at just 6 5 and it s even lower for the supramax ultramax segment for 2021 drybulk net fleet growth is expected to come in at 3 5 this assumes scrapping of roughly 5 8 million deadweight tons down about 2 million deadweight tons from previous guidance and only about one third of last year s amount again this is primarily as a result of a stronger rate environment for 2022 drybulk net fleet growth is expected to be just 1 5 given the rapidly depleting order book and somewhat higher scrapping a total of 92 drybulk ships were ordered during q3 the same as the prior quarter and largely in line with the quarterly average over the last five years although we expect some level of ordering to continue we still believe it will be somewhat muted given new building price levels both on an absolute basis and on a relative basis to secondhand pricing the prolonged delivery time given the lack of yard slots and the ever increasing uncertainty around future carbon pricing and regulations regarding emissions please turn to slide 21 as we ve spoken about before and you can denote from this slide drybulk demand is inextricably linked to global gdp global growth expectations for 2021 were slightly lowered to 5 9 down 10 basis points since our last earnings call for 2022 the imf is estimating global gdp growth of 4 9 please turn to slide 22 drybulk demand growth has been revised downwards slightly since our last earnings call with 2021 growth now estimated at 4 1 this has been driven by downward revisions in iron ore and grains but offset in part by increases in coal and minor bulks such as steel cement scrap and nickel ore it s worth noting that minor bulks where eagle derives about two thirds of its demand from is expected to come in at 5 this year for 2022 demand is forecast at 1 8 for dry bulk overall and 2 4 for minor bulks it s important to look at this in concert with the expected low fleet growth numbers i mentioned a few moments ago notwithstanding near term volatility we re optimistic about the prospects for continued global growth which is being supported by massive amounts of stimulus this positive demand picture combined with our record low order book supports our constructive view on market developments looking ahead in closing we are energized about eagle s strong position following our multi year fleet renewal and growth initiative as well as our new comprehensive financing and on the back of these we re looking forward to continuing to execute for the benefit of our shareholders with that i d like now to turn the call over to the operator and answer any questions you may have operator questions answers operator with the prepared remarks completed we will now open the line for questions our first question comes from randy giveans with jefferies your line is open randy giveans jefferies analyst howdy gary frank and costa how s it going gary vogel chief executive officer good frank de costanzo chief financial officer good morning randy giveans jefferies analyst morning so yeah congrats obviously on the record quarter very strong rates there looking at your 4q 21 quarter to date rates 32 000 plus very strong again now looking at the bsi that s averaged closer to you know 38 plus thousand a day for the last six weeks one of your peers without scrubbers i think they ve booked around 65 at 37 000 a day so i know it s hard to beat a rising market right but was the rest of the underperformance due to lower hedges via your ffa book and i guess with that recent drop here in the last week in the ffas have you been more active trading those for 4q 21 and even 2022 gary vogel chief executive officer yeah so a bit to unpack there first of all i m not sure who you re referring to but i think it s important when you compare tces between companies you look at the fleet makeup and whether you re talking about a fleet of you know strictly supramax and ultramax or a blended fleet included in capes you know we definitely have a hedge position which we ve disclosed in our q our ffas and cargoes but you know which impacted us that s part of our risk management you know as we look forward and you ll see it in our q this quarter as well we ve felt a bit more of a hedge book going into next year using ffas as well you know having said that it s dynamic and we take advantage of the volatility around it so you know we think it s also important to look at the look at tce quarter on quarter and i think we re quite comfortable with our tce performance relative to our peers on a normalized basis as i said especially when you take up the fleet makeup but beyond that i can t speak unless i know specifically you know what you re speaking about you know who you re speaking about randy giveans jefferies analyst sure no problem and then i guess with that ffas it seems like there s been some extreme volatility here in recent weeks is that a lot of physical paper trading or just kind of you know financial trading around that to increase that volatility gary vogel chief executive officer well look i think the volatility there s always a question there was the tail wagging the dog or the other way around but i mean if you look at the physical market there s been extreme volatility on the physical market as well you know we take advantage of that and i mean it gives me an opportunity to talk about it you know you know we prefer to use derivatives to hedge our book and you know even after the quarter you know we sold the derivative contract as a hedge for next year the highest one we did was at 26 000 you know we bought that back this week we unwound the hedge if you will we call it dynamic hedging we unwound that hedge at 10 000 less and that benefit accrues to the benefit of our shareholders it doesn t mean that you know we want to unwind our whole hedge book but dynamically we can go in and out of that market always with having a physical ship as a hedge against it all with the view to creating value you know and adding to the tce for the fleet so we re building a hedge book as we go forward but it s not a straight line up because as i said we take advantage of the volatility in the market randy giveans jefferies analyst got it ok just a last question from me your debt now extremely low congrats on that recent refinancing and everything your shares have fallen from 55 to i guess under 40 no it looks like that we re back above that in an hour here but over the past month right trading well below nav so with your ample free cash in the coming months how will you decide on either further debt repayments share repurchases or maybe doing something with converts gary vogel chief executive officer yeah i think you re right you know we come in every day and look at what we can do and what the best use of capital is if we go back you know five weeks ago when we announced the board authorization for a share buyback we ve actually been in a blackout very the entire time you know up to earnings here randy giveans jefferies analyst yup gary vogel chief executive officer having said that just to be clear there s not a specific you know authorization to go buy a certain number of shares but clearly we re aware of where we re trading you know so it s a decision as we go forward you know the last focus has been to pay down the revolver you know to zero and obviously that s now done so you know looking at whether its share buyback or as you said possibly something on a convert or putting cash on the balance sheet or further debt repayment is something that you know we need to we will need to look at you know having said that i think you know i ll use the opportunity to say i think you know capital allocation is vitally important you know i think the real exciting thing here is what s behind it you know the business that supports it and you know whether we pay out 30 or even more or pay down 50 million or buy back shares you know it s that every dollar that we generate is for the benefit of our shareholders and the real story here in my mind if you ll allow me is that we generated 91 million of ebitda with 53 midsize ships you know randy giveans jefferies analyst right gary vogel chief executive officer and that s almost 30 000 tce with a fleet with no capes you know those are ships that cost twice as much as you know ships that really have averaged just 8 000 more than the midsized fleet this year and as we talk about volatility although we ve experienced significant volatility for our market on a relative basis you know it s significantly less so you know i think it speaks to the i think the segment that we re in within drybulk the midsize segment and the strength that that s leading and you know i ll leave it at that randy giveans jefferies analyst ok makes sense and good options to have here with the ample free cash so thanks again gary vogel chief executive officer thank you operator thank you our next question comes from magnus fyhr with h c wainwright your line is open magnus fyhr h c wainwright and company analyst hey good morning gary costa and frank just a question on like a follow up question on the capital allocation you didn t mention any vessel you know acquisitions you ve been very active in the last five years renewing the fleet what your view on buybacks versus buying ships i mean based on our estimates stock is now trading at a 30 discount to nav just curious you know if you have any desire to expand or looking at fleet acquisitions given where the stock is gary vogel chief executive officer yeah thanks magnus you know i think we re always looking at opportunities having said that asset values have moved up pretty significantly and as i said in the prepared remarks the nine ships that we acquired you know we they ve appreciated by over 80 million you know we feel we re in a fortunate position we ve been able to not only renew the fleet but grow it by about 20 so we don t feel pressure to participate in further you know growth at this point and clearly don t have a need to for further renewal you know having said that if there are opportunities where you know we can better accretive and or the long term period market which as of today it doesn t do but the long term ffa markets or period market justify you know being able to write down that asset significantly then we would be interested but as i said at the moment you know it s not a priority for us we just don t feel a need there so you know given the choice between the two at the moment we would think that a buyback of securities whether shares or convert is more attractive than assets you know all things being equal at the moment magnus fyhr h c wainwright and company analyst good good to hear the second question i have is related to the opex so a big jump there in the third quarter i guess you explained it with the buying inventory lubes and also covid related expenses what should we expect going forward as a normalized opex it s you know around 5 000 i mean i guess the first nine months was about 5 100 will it have a five in front of it or you still think you can be below 5 000 going forward on a normalized basis gary vogel chief executive officer i would say for the fourth quarter it s going to have a five in front of it you know i d love to underpromise and overdeliver but it s not just one thing here you know it s repatriation of the crews is costing more money everything we talked about and you know the more expense for routes is a good story right the ships are moving faster because the rates are in the 30s and you know so that s just really an effect of when you run an engine faster you need higher lubes in addition as i ve said the base oils are higher so pricing is up and that s true across you know the entire industry so for now i think it s going to have a five in front of it and obviously over time we expect things will normalize but you know it s an extraordinary environment you know globally that we re in and there are a lot of benefits for drybulk at the moment but you know opex is clearly one of the negatives magnus fyhr h c wainwright and company analyst right now just last question on chartering strategy the you know it s tough to beat the index in the rising market but the recent pullback created opportunities for your active chartering strategy you know maybe you can elaborate a little bit on that because i know in a falling market i think historically you ve done better gary vogel chief executive officer yeah absolutely look we think in a normal market i think our active management platform will show its true colors i mean the market s really gone vertical here and no question we had some ffa hedges in place to as the market you know rose to protect and we didn t expect the congestion factor if you will to really propel rates to where they went in the last months so you know those hedges you know had an impact but having said that volatility we welcome it and i talked about it on you know just a hedge and unwinding a hedge and the value we can create around that but it s also true around the ships that we charter in and the cargo so you know we welcome volatility it s a little extreme at the moment but it s something that we think we re able to create value for and you know obviously the proof will be in the pudding so i have to see how we you know how it develops over the next quarter or two magnus fyhr h c wainwright and company analyst great well that s it from me and congrats again on a great quarter gary vogel chief executive officer thanks very much operator our next question comes from omar nokta with clarkson securities your line is open omar nokta clarkson securities analyst hi guys thank you good morning gary vogel chief executive officer morning omar nokta clarkson securities analyst just maybe wanted to follow up on the discussion you know about capital deployment obviously you guys have had a pretty solid quarter and this upcoming one is looking good too and a pretty good dividend right off the bat here but how are you guys thinking strategically as we wind down this year and as we look ahead into 22 you know over the past year it s been pretty transformative you acquired ships obviously at well timed prices you ve refinanced debt stack and now you ve gotten to this point at the dividend how are you guys thinking about priorities now have you do you have a series of strategic priorities as you look into next year about what to do or is it now more about just hunkering down you have the 53 ships you ve got the dividend then it s just moving forward gary vogel chief executive officer yeah so i wouldn t say it s hunkering down but it s delivering for our shareholders and so if that means you know keeping you know staying at 53 ships or as i ve talked about in the past we re likely to sell our two older ships so you know and go forward with 51 you know owned ships and obviously charter in around that and deliver real value for our shareholders then that s an outcome we d be really happy with but having said that it s not to hunker down and say we re not looking for opportunities we just don t feel pressure that we need to do more in terms of you know growing or renewing the fleet so we feel we re in a pretty privileged position at the moment obviously this market has helped us you know to deliver you know both the you know the debt pay down and this dividend and we intend to take advantage of that and continue to maximize it as we go forward omar nokta clarkson securities analyst thanks gary and maybe just kind of switching toward you know capital repayment you know regarding the converts versus the shares is there something that stands out between both of those that would be more appealing buying the converts versus the shares any thoughts on that gary vogel chief executive officer yeah sure i mean you know one benefit of buying a convert is it doesn t take float out of the current market in terms of you know share liquidity and that s something that we re clearly cognizant of given the daily share volume you know having said that you know the convert is far less liquid and it s a lot easier to buy back shares in the open market so those are probably the two biggest things otherwise you know there s definitely you know a high correlation between the two obviously given the nature of the convert instrument and you know but as we go forward we re clearly going to look at the pros and cons of both of those and it s not necessarily a one or the other even omar nokta clarkson securities analyst got it ok thanks gary i ll turn it over gary vogel chief executive officer thank you operator thank you our next question comes from greg lewis with btig your line is open greg lewis btig analyst yeah hey thank you and good morning everybody gary vogel chief executive officer good morning greg lewis btig analyst gary you know it seems like capital allocation has been picked over pretty well i guess i would just ask you know you did highlight the two older vessels that you re thinking about potentially selling how should we think about the use of those proceeds gary vogel chief executive officer yeah i wouldn t see the use of those proceeds any differently than cash from operations frankly those ships are worth kind of mid upper teens i d say at the moment and you know they re unencumbered as well when we did the financing we purposely kept them out with a view that they ll likely be monetized before their next special survey drydock one is in mid 22 and one in very early 23 but at the end of the day you know cash is fungible and we don t see a difference there or a need to recirculate it into buying assets having said that you know just like cash from ops if we see an opportunity you know then we ll use it for that greg lewis btig analyst ok great and then just i did have a more of a big picture macro question as i m looking at slide 22 you know i guess the coal growth forecast for 22 is you know i guess it s between 1 and 2 are you seeing things in the market that potentially lead you to believe that that number could be higher or following kind of the rebound in 21 whether it s is the supply capabilities from the miners is just not there and the reason i ask is because as we think about you know coal prices which are firm as is other commodity prices on a relative basis coal still seems an attractive energy source relative to the other ones so i m just surprised that that number is not higher gary vogel chief executive officer yeah well if 2021 has taught us anything if that is is that you know trying to project you know demand especially coal demand where we ve seen the the changes in velocity this year are pretty extreme you know in terms of supply you know even with the you know growth this year the significant growth this year and next year the next year still is a number below where we were in 2019 pre covid on a global you know coal basis marginally below so in terms of supply i don t think that s the issue we re seeing significant change in those coal trade flows you know this year especially because of obviously the china australia issue around coal but you know there s still significant growth in intra asia coal from indonesia china and indonesia you know vietnam and india and those are trades that we re particularly in so i think from a midsize drybulk segment i think it s more positive in terms of volumes for next year but in terms of you know trying to you know project it exactly i think there is upside in that but you know i think there s also downside in it and that it s very hard seeing the you know fuel mix and price mix and what we ve seen this year greg lewis btig analyst understood hey thank you all very much gary vogel chief executive officer all right thank you operator thank you and our next question comes from j mintzmyer value investor s edge your line is open j mintzmyer value investor s edge analyst hi good morning everyone congrats on a fantastic quarter all around gary vogel chief executive officer thank you good morning j mintzmyer value investor s edge analyst great questions so far not a whole lot to add just want to do a little bit of housekeeping on the ffas just to clarify i think you said you re going to include those in the 10 q which should help a lot it looks like you added about 10 or 11 ships at a quarter about a thousand days quarter over quarter is that fair and is that kind of the rate you expect to do going forward always doing about 10 to 11 ships per quarter gary vogel chief executive officer yeah i don t have a specific number i mean we took a number delivery of a number of acquisition ships you know over the last few quarters and some were fully in the quarter some toward the end and we just took delivery of valencia eagle last week so that was the only ship that delivered you know post third quarter but you know we don t see significant you know we don t see any more there s no more ships that we ve acquired from an s p basis to add obviously the number of days that we from a chartering basis is slightly you know is excuse me the number of you know charter in ships has been fairly static lately but you know otherwise we don t expect things to change very much j mintzmyer value investor s edge analyst ok certainly makes sense and when you say 75 fixed at 32 400 getting to what randy was talking about are you already incorporating the ffa loss for q4 into that or do you need to add that additionally on top gary vogel chief executive officer so that s a pro rata basis you know the number of ships that we have fixed so you know if you think about it if you re you know 50 into the quarter then it would be you know 50 of the ffa days that we ve done plus all the physical you know fixing of ships and cargos and things like that j mintzmyer value investor s edge analyst got it so there s a little bit obviously a spot left and then there s going to be a little bit more drag from the final ffas and i m sure we ll see that obviously in the 10 q turning real quick to the convertibles i think everybody is pegged on this everyone sees that there s this enormous opportunity you know your nav is depends on what analyst and what data source but i mean 70 a share is a number that seems reasonable you re trading at a 45 discount you have a great balance sheet so not only is it priced at nav you re also looking at enterprise value the gross asset value massive discount right so the convertibles are out there but you don t have a call provision right so there s nothing you can do to force those in how would you go about mechanically if you were trying to do a repurchase via that route do you just have to reach out directly to the holders and work something out is there some sort of formal tender process you could do what would that potentially look like gary vogel chief executive officer yeah well we could buy them in the open market alternatively we could make a proposal to holders you know a more formal and you know certain amount type of proposal but we are able to buy five converts in the open market as well j mintzmyer value investor s edge analyst i look forward to seeing what you do there gary i know anytime you talk to me you know i want to talk about repurchases and you know with a 45 discount to nav it just it s screaming so i m really really happy to see the 50 million program and i look forward to next quarter s results gary vogel chief executive officer thanks j i appreciate it operator thank you our next question comes from liam burke with b riley your line is open liam burke b riley analyst thank you good morning gary good morning frank gary vogel chief executive officer hey liam liam burke b riley analyst gary could i go back to the macro you have a versatile fleet we see you carry major bulks as well as the minors how do you look at the volatility in the iron ore trade affecting the fleet and how you look at the business going forward gary vogel chief executive officer yeah i mean if there s one cargo that doesn t directly impact us of all you know the major bulks it s iron ore right it s a fairly small part it was about 10 of our cargo mix but frankly it s not from the major trades it s not brazil china it s not australia china so it s really not as significant for us having said that as iron ore prices come off then the ships the smaller cargoes and the trade that we tend to do become less attractive so you ll likely see as iron ore prices come off us doing less iron ore going forward but again it s a relatively small part of our cargo mix so you know directionally negative with lower pricing but not significant impact for us liam burke b riley analyst ok and then you talked about selling the older vessels how does adding new assets fit into the mix or are just asset values too high here gary vogel chief executive officer yeah i mean you know i touched upon it before you know they re quite high and we feel quite satisfied where we are you know having said that if the forward markets whether it s the derivative markets or the long term period markets are supportive to you know write down asset prices to levels we believe are you know attractive in terms of long term depreciation then we d be interested but just to go out and buy assets at this point you know we don t feel the pressure to do so and i don t think you ll see us doing that just in the immediate basis just where rates are relative to where asset prices are liam burke b riley analyst great thank you gary gary vogel chief executive officer all right thank you operator thank you and i m showing no further questions at this time i d like to turn the call back to gary vogel for any closing remarks gary vogel chief executive officer thanks operator we don t have anything further so i d like to thank everyone for their time today and wish everyone a good day operator duration 47 minutes call participants gary vogel chief executive officer frank de costanzo

president pedro castillo s government survived a confidence vote in the peruvian congress thursday after carrying out wholesale changes to his cabinet and making ever more direct appeals to peru s ruling elite and its right wing representatives the ascension of castillo a former rural teachers union leader to the presidency in july was hailed by the pseudo left as a major victory for the peruvian masses and even a revival of the so called pink tide the coming to power of left nationalist and populist bourgeois governments in a number of south american countries during the commodities boom of the early 2000s since taking office amid a torrent of populist demagogy castillo s government has lurched convulsively to the right just two days before the congressional vote of confidence castillo issued an executive order deploying peruvian army troops on the streets of the capital lima and in the neighboring port city of callao which together have 11 million inhabitants a third of peru s population while carried out under the pretext of assisting the peruvian police in combatting rising crime the military deployment came in the context of a rising tide of social protest and class struggle which has been driven by deepening poverty and social inequality under conditions of the uncontrolled spread of covid 19 with over 200 000 recorded covid deaths peru has the highest per capita fatality rate in the world there have also been a number of strikes by impoverished peasant communities against the seizure of land and destruction of the environment by major transnational mining companies after a road blockade forced the closure of the country s largest copper mine antamina co owned by glencore and bhp billiton and rattled financial markets the government sent a group of ministers to negotiate a truce based on promises of dialogue at another mining protest in ayacucho the peruvian national police was dispatched using rubber bullets tear gas and clubs to disperse community members meanwhile bus truck and other transport drivers have threatened a strike on november 8 against rising fuel prices in another bow to the peruvian right castillo sacked yet another of his cabinet members on the very eve of the confidence vote interior minister luis barranzuela whose removal was demanded by a number of right wing legislators as a condition for a vote in the government s favor was relieved of his post on the grounds of charges that he hosted a halloween party on october 31 after the government issued a directive telling the population not to hold such gatherings barranzuela claimed implausibly that he had convened an official meeting barranzuela was identified with per√∫ libre which nominated castillo for president even though he had joined it only in 2020 he had served as the attorney for vladimir cerr√≥n the leader of per√∫ libre and a former regional governor of jun√≠n who was sentenced to prison on corruption charges cerr√≥n and per√∫ libre combine populist demagogy and pseudo marxist rhetoric with regionalist politics and appeals to resentments toward the domination of lima its corruption is of a piece with all of the bourgeois parties in peru which has seen four of its living ex presidents sentenced to prison and a fifth commit suicide rather than surrender to the police on the morning of the congressional vote castillo swore in barranzuela s replacement avelino guill√©n a senior prosecutor with a 40 year career in the peruvian government he carried out the investigation and indictment of former peruvian dictator alberto fujimori for his role in the barrios altos and la cantuta massacres carried out by the colina military death squad in 1991 and 1992 fujimori is now serving a 25 year sentence in connection with these crimes while guill√©n s appointment was positively received by the bulk of the congress it won no support from the extreme right wing fuerza popular which is led by fujimori s daughter keiko fujimori who narrowly lost the presidential election to castillo this was only the latest in a long series of cabinet changes they began less than a month into castillo s presidency when his foreign minister hector bejar 85 was hounded from office by the right wing media which dredged up an incontrovertible statement he had made earlier that the military had carried out acts of terror against the civilian population under fujimori the peruvian navy denounced the statement as an affront and castillo s then prime minister guido bellido issued a statement praising the armed forces for the efforts they made in the fight against terrorism and for national pacification bellido was himself relieved of his position after making demagogic threats to nationalize the camisea gas company which is jointly owned by hunt oil in the us and argentina s pluspetrol castillo himself indulged in similar rhetoric however his finance minister pedro francke quickly clarified these statements declaring that they meant ensuring that the company operated in the service of peruvians and in no way does it mean taking state control over a private activity this echoed pledges made by castillo and francke during their trip to the united states in september when they assured private investors the us government the imf and the world bank of their commitment to defending the profit interests of transnational investors and peruvian capital taking bellido s place was mirtha vasquez a so called moderate leftist and attorney who had proved herself as a safe pair of hands taking the position of interim president of congress in the 2020 crisis sparked by the parliamentary coup that toppled president mart√≠n vizcarra other ministers sacked to appease the peruvian right included labor minister iber marav√≠ who was charged by the right wing press with association with the maoist guerrilla movement sendero luminoso a charge he denied and for which there exists no evidence among others removed was the minister of mining iv√°n merino who despite working to assure the mining corporations that they were in no danger of nationalizations was replaced by eduardo gonz√°lez a former general manager of a technology company one position where there was no change is that of chairman of the central reserve bank of peru castillo has kept in place the right wing economist julio velarde who has held the position since 2006 a champion of transnational and peruvian capitalist interests upon being sworn in for a new term on tuesday velarde warned that peru s mining protests were affecting the perception of the country in terms of future investments and echoed calls by the mining companies for the government to re establish order the right wing trajectory of the castillo government has split per√∫ libre in the confidence vote the government won 68 votes four more than the necessary majority of 64 against 56 against the congressional delegation of per√∫ libre split down the middle with 19 voting in favor of the government and 16 voting against among those voting against was ex chief minister guido bellido who stated that castillo was not a socialist or on the left but just a basic trade unionist the pseudo left including jacobin magazine which is affiliated with the democratic socialists of america dsa have assiduously promoted illusions in castillo and the prospect of a bourgeois government headed by a union leader carrying out a socialist transformation of peru this reactionary perspective serves to subordinate the peruvian working class to the capitalist state and pave the way to bloody defeats castillo s calling the army into the streets of lima follows only by weeks the invocation of a state of exception and the deployment of the military across ecuador also in the name of fighting crime that the supposedly left union leader and the right wing banker and ex coca cola executive ecuadorian president guillermo lasso arrive at the same decision to call out the troops is a measure of the disintegration of any basis for democratic forms of rule in a latin america riven by intense class divisions and social inequality that have been sharply intensified by the covid 19 pandemic in peru as throughout latin america the burning question is the independent political mobilization of the working class in opposition to every section of the bourgeoisie and all its political parties and the corporatist trade unions this can be achieved only on the basis of a socialist and internationalist program directed at the overthrow of the dictatorship of corporate and finance capital and the reorganization of socioeconomic life on socialist foundations this requires above all the building of a revolutionary party of the working class a peruvian section of the international committee of the fourth international

in 2019 room101 commemorated its decennial anniversary as a cigar brand with a brand new blend bearing the appropriate name of 10th anniversary sold in a singular 6 x 52 toro vitola the cigar incorporated a nicaraguan rosado wrapper along with an undisclosed binder and filler with only 500 boxes of 20 released the next july the company teased a follow up in the series named 11th anniversary although it took until december for the cigars to start shipping to retailers once again there was only one vitola albeit a slightly larger 6 x 54 torpedo but this time the blend was announced as a nicaraguan puro in addition there were twice as many made compared to the 11th anniversary specifically 1 000 boxes of 20 cigars with the aforementioned cigars released the prior two years it was no surprise when room101 announced the 12th anniversary which includes aspects from both of the previous creations in the series like the 10th anniversary the newest version is a 6 x 52 toro vitola and like the 11th anniversary it is a nicaraguan puro production was handled at abdel fern√°ndez s tabacalera aj fernandez cigars de nicaragua s a factory located in estel√≠ nicaragua with fern√°ndez growing all of the tobacco as well each cigar carries an msrp of 11 but instead of a set number of boxes room101 only produced as many cigars as were needed to fulfill the orders that they received cigar reviewed room101 12th anniversary room101 12th anniversary country of origin nicaragua nicaragua factory tabacalera aj fernandez cigars de nicaragua s a tabacalera aj fernandez cigars de nicaragua s a wrapper nicaragua nicaragua binder nicaragua nicaragua filler nicaragua nicaragua length 6 inches 6 inches ring gauge 52 52 vitola toro toro msrp 11 box of 20 220 11 box of 20 220 release date 2021 2021 number of cigars released undisclosed undisclosed number of cigars smoked for review 3 a rustic dark espresso brown wrapper covers the room101 12th anniversary one that has plenty of tooth as well as quite a few veins running up and down its length there is also a touch of oil present and after an inspection i find that one of the samples has a small soft spot located about halfway down the cigar aroma from the wrapper is a combination of earth raisins black pepper and leather while the foot brings notes of barnyard wood hay and dark chocolate finally the cold draw features flavors of cedar black pepper sourdough bread espresso beans and slight raisin sweetness as well as a copious amount of spice the 12th anniversary lights up easily enough and immediately brings a flavor of leather tack that quickly transitions into a main combination of mesquite and earth secondary notes of salted peanuts yeast leather creamy hay and cocoa nibs flit in and out on the palate while a slight espresso bitterness is present on the finish in addition the retrohale features both black pepper and marshmallow sweetness although the former is easily more obvious than the latter so far construction wise the draw is excellent after a simple straight cut but the burn has minor issues early on and the smoke production is about average flavor is medium but rising while both the body and strength end the first third just under medium while earth and mesquite remain the top flavor combination during the second third of the room101 12th anniversary the marshmallow sweetness on the retrohale increases noticeably easily becoming a major factor in the profile additional flavors of peanuts hay sourdough bread hay and bitter espresso beans are present in various amounts while the black pepper on the retrohale has stayed at about the same level thankfully the burn has evened up nicely and the draw continues along its excellent path but the smoke production remains about average flavor increases slightly to a point just over medium body is still at a solid medium and strength is also at medium by the end of the second third unfortunately the rich marshmallow sweetness that was so prominent in the second third sees a major reduction in distinctness during the final third of the room101 while the profile continues to be topped by the familiar combination of mesquite and gritty earth flavors of freshly roasted coffee beans hay cocoa nibs generic nuts and bread are also present and the black pepper on the retrohale decreases noticeably from its high point in the second third in terms of construction the draw is as excellent as ever and the burn continues to give me no major issues while the smoke production has increased just a bit flavor ends at medium full body ends at medium and the strength increases enough to just barely cross over the medium mark by the time i put the nub down with about an inch remaining final notes at the same time room101 announced the 12th anniversary the company also introduced the big payback sumatra featuring an ecuadorian sumatra wrapper a honduran binder and nicaraguan fillers matt booth room101 s owner is no stranger to pushing the envelope so it was no great surprise when he announced he would be entering the hemp derived cannabinoid market by announcing a line of delta 8 thc cartridges under its new room101 cana brand as was the case with the 11th anniversary the words no good deeds are printed on the inside of the main band this is not exactly unusual since room101 has a long history of placing messages inside its bands although the room101 originally started as a jewelry brand in 2003 the three anniversary creations so far are referring to the year when the company released its first cigars in 2009 the cigars smoked for this review were purchased by halfwheel final smoking time for all three samples averaged one hour and 28 minutes if you would like to purchase any of the room101 12th anniversary cigars site sponsors atlantic cigar co and stogies world class cigars have them in stock now 87 overall score for me room101 releases have run the gamut when it comes to enjoyment from an amazing cigar like the daruma mutante to a not as amazing chief cool arrow chingonomo the blend of the room101 12th anniversary lands squarely in the middle of the pack for me with a blend that features distinct flavors of mesquite and earth albeit as part of a profile that does not change much between thirds in addition while there is a very nice marshmallow sweetness present on the retrohale it loses its distinctness after the second third and never regains it in the end the 12th anniversary is a worthy addition to room101 s line of commemorative releases but i prefer the 11th anniversary blend a bit more

greaney minn beryl novak bought 40 acres of forest here in 1966 for 700 eventually moved an old one room shack to the site for a deer hunting cabin and then liked it so much he moved in for good that was 1977 he hasn t lived anyplace else since he hasn t slept in any other bed not a single night away since may 1993 i m kind of a homebody novak said he also hasn t hunted deer anywhere else and on saturday morning nov 6 novak will be in his favorite deer stand a 5 by 8 foot tarpaper shack with a slide up window where odds are he will see some deer whether or not he gets a legal buck will be up to the fates of course much like the other nearly half million minnesota hunters out and about but don t bet against him advertisement beryl novak the stand is just 50 yards from his house about an hour s drive north of hibbing overlooking a mowed clearing with a backdrop of spruce and balsam about 140 yards out he has shot dozens of deer from this spot most with his trusty 270 winchester some of them just minutes into the first morning of the season the annual deer hunt has become part of his life s routine a rhythm that revolves around nature s seasons things like putting up firewood tending his big garden planting and grafting dozens of apple trees and walking hundreds of miles each autumn in search of grouse already this season he s bagged two dozen grouse by walking slowly watching and listening on forest trails beryl novak walks past a deer rub while grouse hunting monday nov 1 2021 steve kuchera duluth news tribune but it hasn t been easy i figure it s about 5 miles walking for each bird he said as we walked and talked in his woods shotguns at the ready on a brisk november morning we flushed a couple grouse that day but didn t get any shots advertisement over the years living out here novak has had close calls with wolves and has battled with bears but it all seems to come in stride for an outdoorsman who doesn t rattle easily who seemingly has seen and done everything the northwoods has to offer started young novak 71 shot his first deer at age 10 in 1960 hunting alone he still has the paper hunting license and aluminum buck tag pressed between pages in a photo album since then novak figures he s shot 75 deer in these woods northwest of cook beryl novak still has his deer license and tag from 1960 steve kuchera duluth news tribune he has a memory like a steel trap and rattles off dates and antler counts from hunting seasons a half century ago like they happened yesterday novak was born and raised in this country and graduated from orr high school in 1968 he liked cars of course and girls but his passion has always been the outdoors hunting fishing and trapping my dad died when i was 5 novak said but i had a mentor teach me grouse hunting joe kasun when i was 7 he gave me a single shot 22 to use and one 22 short bullet and took me grouse hunting and told me not to miss i got one deer hunting though i had to figure out on my own advertisement and he has a 10 year old beryl novak poses with the buck he shot in 1960 contributed beryl novack novak attended a vocational college and then with a low draft number looming enlisted in the u s air force and stayed in for nearly four years from 1970 74 he was stationed at several bases across the u s and spent eight months in vietnam at the 483rd usaf hospital at cam ranh bay where the base would come under occasional rocket attack and where he saw the horrors of war firsthand with a parade of wounded on display through his military service he would come home on leave scheduled around hunting seasons i came home to hunt he said it s what i thought about when i was over there related a northwoods living novak s one room home is 16 by 20 feet what city folks these days might call a tiny house it has no running water there s a hand pump outside a few steps an outhouse of course and a sauna shed too advertisement i don t have to worry about pipes freezing novak quipped it s an armstrong pump a big barrel wood stove heats the place when it s cold and novak has a few seasons worth of fuel stacked neatly outside there s a gas range for cooking a bed in the corner and a small tv that gets three stations over the airwaves beryl novak talks with a visitor in his one room cabin monday nov 1 2021 steve kuchera duluth news tribune why would you need any more than that everything on tv is all so damned depressing anyway novak said there s a 2017 calendar on the door still next to a reminder note for next year s dental appointment dusty cds and dvds and piles of outdoor and gardening magazines cover much of the kitchen table a few old buck antlers trophies from long past seasons are stashed in the corner a few mounted fish adorn the walls antlers from past hunts lay on a table in beryl novak s cabin monday nov 1 2021 steve kuchera duluth news tribune advertisement novak worked the usual northwoods jobs over the years including as a logger and then on a sand and gravel crew he trapped and sold furs beaver otter fisher and pine marten until the bottom dropped out of the fur market and prices plummeted he picked wild blueberries and sold them to grocery stores in town he cut and sold balsam boughs and firewood for a spell too novak formally retired in 1995 meaning that s the point he stopped trying to earn a living and focused on the living part there wasn t anyone left calling me who i wanted to talk to people would say but we can t get ahold of you and i d say that s the point beryl novak it doesn t cost much to live up here i get by pretty cheap he said it s not that he doesn t like people novak said just that he found it hard always trying to get along you can t satisfy people so i said the hell with it and here i am he said adding that he doesn t consider himself a hermit i get visitors just not as many as i used to everyone is dying off beryl novak unloads his shotgun outside the one room cabin he s lived in since 1977 after a grouse hunt monday nov 1 2021 steve kuchera duluth news tribune advertisement his last car broke down in 2005 and he hasn t driven one since although he does have a four wheel atv that can get him the mile or so down the road to another 43 acre parcel he owns and hunts on he keeps mowed trails on his land that attract deer grouse and other wildlife and make for easy walking he has planted hundreds of apple plum and pine trees along the trails novak depends on the kindness of a few friends and neighbors to get him to his annual doctor and dental checkups or to bring him fresh food on occasion in return he shares crops from his garden or maybe a cleaned and packaged grouse breast he stocks up on provisions in town a few times each year most everything else he grows or shoots on his own conservation officers occasionally add to his larder by dropping off an illegally killed deer this year s drought cut into his sweet corn crop but his melons onions and carrots did well with him

greaney minn beryl novak bought 40 acres of forest here in 1966 for 700 eventually moved an old one room shack to the site for a deer hunting cabin and then liked it so much he moved in for good that was 1977 he hasn t lived anyplace else since he hasn t slept in any other bed not a single night away since may 1993 i m kind of a homebody novak said he also hasn t hunted deer anywhere else and on saturday morning nov 6 novak will be in his favorite deer stand a 5 by 8 foot tarpaper shack with a slide up window where odds are he will see some deer whether or not he gets a legal buck will be up to the fates of course much like the other nearly half million minnesota hunters out and about but don t bet against him advertisement beryl novak the stand is just 50 yards from his house about an hour s drive north of hibbing overlooking a mowed clearing with a backdrop of spruce and balsam about 140 yards out he has shot dozens of deer from this spot most with his trusty 270 winchester some of them just minutes into the first morning of the season the annual deer hunt has become part of his life s routine a rhythm that revolves around nature s seasons things like putting up firewood tending his big garden planting and grafting dozens of apple trees and walking hundreds of miles each autumn in search of grouse already this season he s bagged two dozen grouse by walking slowly watching and listening on forest trails beryl novak walks past a deer rub while grouse hunting monday nov 1 2021 steve kuchera duluth news tribune but it hasn t been easy i figure it s about 5 miles walking for each bird he said as we walked and talked in his woods shotguns at the ready on a brisk november morning we flushed a couple grouse that day but didn t get any shots advertisement over the years living out here novak has had close calls with wolves and has battled with bears but it all seems to come in stride for an outdoorsman who doesn t rattle easily who seemingly has seen and done everything the northwoods has to offer started young novak 71 shot his first deer at age 10 in 1960 hunting alone he still has the paper hunting license and aluminum buck tag pressed between pages in a photo album since then novak figures he s shot 75 deer in these woods northwest of cook beryl novak still has his deer license and tag from 1960 steve kuchera duluth news tribune he has a memory like a steel trap and rattles off dates and antler counts from hunting seasons a half century ago like they happened yesterday novak was born and raised in this country and graduated from orr high school in 1968 he liked cars of course and girls but his passion has always been the outdoors hunting fishing and trapping my dad died when i was 5 novak said but i had a mentor teach me grouse hunting joe kasun when i was 7 he gave me a single shot 22 to use and one 22 short bullet and took me grouse hunting and told me not to miss i got one deer hunting though i had to figure out on my own advertisement and he has a 10 year old beryl novak poses with the buck he shot in 1960 contributed beryl novack novak attended a vocational college and then with a low draft number looming enlisted in the u s air force and stayed in for nearly four years from 1970 74 he was stationed at several bases across the u s and spent eight months in vietnam at the 483rd usaf hospital at cam ranh bay where the base would come under occasional rocket attack and where he saw the horrors of war firsthand with a parade of wounded on display through his military service he would come home on leave scheduled around hunting seasons i came home to hunt he said it s what i thought about when i was over there related a northwoods living novak s one room home is 16 by 20 feet what city folks these days might call a tiny house it has no running water there s a hand pump outside a few steps an outhouse of course and a sauna shed too advertisement i don t have to worry about pipes freezing novak quipped it s an armstrong pump a big barrel wood stove heats the place when it s cold and novak has a few seasons worth of fuel stacked neatly outside there s a gas range for cooking a bed in the corner and a small tv that gets three stations over the airwaves beryl novak talks with a visitor in his one room cabin monday nov 1 2021 steve kuchera duluth news tribune why would you need any more than that everything on tv is all so damned depressing anyway novak said there s a 2017 calendar on the door still next to a reminder note for next year s dental appointment dusty cds and dvds and piles of outdoor and gardening magazines cover much of the kitchen table a few old buck antlers trophies from long past seasons are stashed in the corner a few mounted fish adorn the walls antlers from past hunts lay on a table in beryl novak s cabin monday nov 1 2021 steve kuchera duluth news tribune advertisement novak worked the usual northwoods jobs over the years including as a logger and then on a sand and gravel crew he trapped and sold furs beaver otter fisher and pine marten until the bottom dropped out of the fur market and prices plummeted he picked wild blueberries and sold them to grocery stores in town he cut and sold balsam boughs and firewood for a spell too novak formally retired in 1995 meaning that s the point he stopped trying to earn a living and focused on the living part there wasn t anyone left calling me who i wanted to talk to people would say but we can t get ahold of you and i d say that s the point beryl novak it doesn t cost much to live up here i get by pretty cheap he said it s not that he doesn t like people novak said just that he found it hard always trying to get along you can t satisfy people so i said the hell with it and here i am he said adding that he doesn t consider himself a hermit i get visitors just not as many as i used to everyone is dying off beryl novak unloads his shotgun outside the one room cabin he s lived in since 1977 after a grouse hunt monday nov 1 2021 steve kuchera duluth news tribune advertisement his last car broke down in 2005 and he hasn t driven one since although he does have a four wheel atv that can get him the mile or so down the road to another 43 acre parcel he owns and hunts on he keeps mowed trails on his land that attract deer grouse and other wildlife and make for easy walking he has planted hundreds of apple plum and pine trees along the trails novak depends on the kindness of a few friends and neighbors to get him to his annual doctor and dental checkups or to bring him fresh food on occasion in return he shares crops from his garden or maybe a cleaned and packaged grouse breast he stocks up on provisions in town a few times each year most everything else he grows or shoots on his own conservation officers occasionally add to his larder by dropping off an illegally killed deer this year s drought cut into his sweet corn crop but his melons onions and carrots did well with him

vol 45 no 45 friday november 5 2021 biden s bet that economy would boost democrats falls flat print front page email this story you have entered an invalid email address to required from required message you have entered an invalid email address from email required message required washington ap the u s economy was supposed to help president joe biden and democrats but as of late it s been hurting them with voters biden on friday praised the u s economy for performing better than the rest of the world saying it s largely because of his 1 9 trillion coronavirus relief package and plans for additional spending of roughly 2 75 trillion on infrastructure families schools health care and climate change yet americans have turned pessimistic about the economy as inflation has persisted on tuesday voters in virginia rewarded republican glenn youngkin with a win in the governor s election in part based on a belief that he would be better for economic growth the president could not ignore these realities yet he said friday at the white house that the latest numbers show a ruggedly energetic economy we still have to tackle the costs that american families are facing but this recovery is faster stronger and fairer and wider than almost anyone could have predicted biden said that s what the numbers say the president also acknowledged that voters can t just rely on the numbers they need to feel it in their lives and their bank accounts and their hopes and expectations this question as to whether americans are feeling what the economic numbers show is at the heart of biden s challenge in the months leading up to the 2022 elections when control of the house and senate could possibly slip from the democrats it s not enough for the president to highlight friday s employment report of 531 000 job gains and a 4 6 unemployment report in october so long as the pandemic rages and shortages of basic goods ranging from auto to furniture keep pushing up prices beneath this challenge rests a deeper set of questions about how politics and the economy mingle after the pandemic do americans care more about job growth or inflation are they skeptical that government spending can permanently improve the economy for the better can democrats expect to be rewarded for their results or are voters indifferent to policy achievements these questions also pose an obstacle as house democrats were preparing on friday to vote on biden s bipartisan 1 trillion infrastructure deal that has already cleared the senate and move forward with a 1 75 trillion mix of social spending and matching increases after attending the u n climate summit biden suggested at a tuesday news conference in glasgow scotland that the failure to pass his agenda earlier would have no impact on how the democrats fared in the 2021 election i ve not seen any evidence that whether or not i am doing well or poorly whether or not i ve got my agenda passed or not is going to have any real impact on winning or losing the president said even if we had passed my agenda i wouldn t claim we won because biden s agenda passed economists across the ideological spectrum noted that the country faces an unusual situation after the coronavirus the delta variant appears to have hobbled growth late this summer and the rush of money from the government caused consumer and business demand to surge in ways not seen in recent recoveries as a result some reliable indicators of the economy have become less reliable yes there has been a solid recovery in hiring yet so many people have stopped working or seeking jobs that the adjusted unemployment rate is closer to 7 3 instead of 4 6 said heidi shierholz president of the liberal economic policy institute and a former chief economist at the labor department we are still in a huge hole shierholz said coming out of the covid recession has created some unique circumstances that people never experienced before this created a dickensian like framework in which it could be the best of times and the worst of times the economy is poised for the fastest growth since 1984 and the stock market s dow jones industrial average hit a record high this week yet inflation is running high at an annualized rate of 5 4 and eating into paychecks employers are struggling to find workers despite raising wages container ships are stuck waiting to dock at ports creating empty shelves and long delays for consumers ahead of the holiday shopping season inflation is outpacing wage gains and that s a big problem said michael strain director of economic policy studies at the center right american enterprise institute it feels like the economy has gotten worse average gasoline prices have jumped more than 60 from a year ago to 3 42 a gallon according to the american automobile association the jump has been so swift that biden last week called on opec nations to pump more oil even as he simultaneously called for moving away from fossil fuels to have a zero emissions economy by 2050 voters so far seem to believe that the economy would fare better under republicans in tuesday s election in virginia more than a third of voters said the economy was their top priority according to ap votecast of that key group 63 broke for youngkin on the belief that a republican could do more for growth more importantly 54 of virginia voters said they disapproved of how biden was handling the economy that nearly matches a recent ap norc survey in which 58 nationwide disliked the president s economic stewardship a sharp reversal from march when 60 backed biden on the economy republican lawmakers have been effective at hammering biden and democrats on the inflation issue the biden administration initially tried to minimize inflation as a problem by calling it transitory but the consensus by many economists is that it will keep running above the federal reserve s 2 target until the second half of next year senate republican leader mitch mcconnell interpreted the results of tuesday s elections as a rejection of biden s economic policies washington democrats have super charged inflation re created welfare without work requirements and made america significantly less energy independent the kentucky senator said in a wednesday floor speech the american people will not stand for this that s what voters told democrats last night there is also the possibility that biden misread what voters were saying in last year s elections much of the president s ability to create a broader coalition came from opposition to donald trump rather than a full embrace of his ideas paul winfree director of economic policy studies at the conservative heritage foundation interprets the disapproval of biden as a sign that voters see his expansion of government spending as going too far to the left the 2020 election was a referendum on trump as an individual more than anything else winfree said now we see voters saying that the democrats have misidentified their mandate stuart stevens co founder of the lincoln project a conservative group that staunchly opposes trump said that biden has struggled to communicate its successes with the economy he noted that many americans believe the country is on the wrong track even though vaccinations are up the stock market is climbing and the unemployment rate is falling stevens concluded friday on twitter the democratic party has a huge messaging problem

cited in today s call are adjusted to exclude noncontrolling interest in egypt and egypt tax barrels finally i d like to remind everyone that today s discussion will contain forward looking estimates

located with the supplemental information on our website and with that i will turn the call over to john john christmann chief executive officer and president good morning and thank you for joining us our top priority coming into 2021 was to continue strengthening the balance sheet through debt reduction with the significant recent strides in that regard and a favorable outlook for continued free cash flow generation we are in a position today to announce some material changes in our capital investment plans and use of free cash flow first we are moving toward a capital budget that will sustain or slightly grow global production volumes this is being accomplished through a gradual ramp in activity over the next few quarters primarily in egypt where we are anticipating psc modernization terms will be approved by year end but also in the onshore u s second we are committing to a significant increase in cash return to shareholders while a stronger commodity price environment has accelerated progress on the balance sheet it s the quality and cash flow generating capacity of our core operating areas through a range of commodity price environments that are enabling our new capital return framework we have a substantial inventory of quality drilling opportunities throughout our portfolio in addition to egypt which now has the deepest inventory in more than a decade we also have significant potential in our onshore u s portfolio primarily in the southern midland basin alpine high and austin chalk in this price environment there are many compelling drilling opportunities that should be funded and we anticipate adding a fourth onshore u s rig in 2022 with regard to our new capital return framework we are committed to returning a minimum of 60 of our free cash flow to shareholders this begins with our base dividend which in september we announced would increase to an annualized rate of 0 25 per share yesterday we announced a doubling of that rate to 0 50 per share in early october we took the more significant step of initiating a share repurchase program through october 31 we have repurchased 14 7 million shares and expect to continue returning capital in this manner through the fourth quarter and into 2022 our commitment is to return at least 60 of free cash flow to shareholders and we will exceed this amount in the current quarter we believe that apa currently offers one of the highest free cash flow yields in our peer group and that this framework delivers an attractive and highly competitive return to our shareholders turning now to the third quarter results and highlights through a combination of strong commodity prices capital and cost discipline and good well performance we generated nearly 1 2 billion of adjusted ebitda making it our strongest quarter of the year thus far we anticipate fourth quarter will be even stronger u s production exceeded guidance in the third quarter as we continue to see good performance in the permian oil plays alpine high and the austin chalk internationally production was a bit below guidance as we experienced some extended maintenance turnarounds and compressor outages in the north sea and lower volumes in egypt associated with the impact of strengthening oil prices on our production sharing contracts we expect gross production in both the u k and egypt will increase in the fourth quarter in the u s we placed a total of 10 wells online during the quarter this included nine wells in the southern midland basin three of which were three miles in length at alpine high no new wells were placed on production during the quarter but performance from this year s duc completions as well as the underlying base production volumes continue to exceed expectations in the east texas austin chalk we drilled four operated wells earlier this year two of which are on production we recently added a third rig in the u s which will be used to continue the delineation of our austin chalk acreage position we have now gathered a substantial amount of data in this play that indicates returns will compete with other quality portfolio opportunities dave pursell can provide more details around the austin chalk during the q a turning to international operations in egypt gross production has begun to turn higher putting us on a good trajectory as we enter 2022 in anticipation of modernized psc terms we recently increased our rig count to 11 we will likely add more rigs in 2022 as modernized terms would return egypt to being the most attractive investment opportunity within our portfolio in the north sea we continue to operate one floating rig and one platform crew as expected production was up modestly in the third quarter compared to the second quarter as we continued to work through both planned and unplanned maintenance downtime on the drilling front we recently td ed storr 2 development well which we plan to place online in january while one of the primary objectives in this well was wet we encountered more than 300 feet of net pay in other targets which we are projecting will ip around 20 million cubic feet per day of gas and 2 500 barrels per day of condensate our 59 working interest in this well provides good leverage to what should be robust north sea natural gas and condensate prices over the coming months in block 58 offshore suriname our partner total is currently running two rigs one of which is conducting a flow test at sapakara south and the other is drilling the bonboni exploration well in the northern portion of the block these operations are still ongoing and the data we collect will help inform the next steps in the block 58 appraisal and exploration programs on block 53 we are finalizing plans for our next exploration well location with partners petronas and cepsa the noble gerry de souza drillship is scheduled to commence drilling this well in the first quarter the plan is to drill one well in block 53 in 2022 but we have an option on the drillship for two additional wells if warranted before closing i want to comment on the charge we took this quarter related to the gulf of mexico properties we sold to fieldwood in 2013 since fieldwood emerged from bankruptcy in august we have independently assessed the situation and have elected to book the contingent liability that you saw in our press release steve will walk you through some of the details in closing i d like to make a few remarks about the progress we are making on the esg front we recently announced that we have eliminated all routine flaring in u s operations this was an ambitious goal that we set at the beginning of the year and achieved three months ahead of schedule additionally through the end of the third quarter flaring intensity in the u s was only 0 38 significantly below our target of less than 1 our global safety performance has also been strong we have delivered a 35 improvement in our total recordable incident rate compared to this time last year we have also progressed a number of important initiatives that foster diversity and inclusion within the organization and that enhance the health and well being of our employees in october we published our 2021 sustainability report which i hope you will review for a more in depth look at our esg philosophy performance initiatives and success stories finally we are in the process of establishing some very rigorous short medium and long term esg goals which will include further efforts on ghg and methane emissions and we look forward to discussing these in the near future and with that i will turn the call over to steve riney who will provide additional details on our third quarter results and outlook steve riney executive vice president and chief financial officer thank you john in my prepared remarks this morning i ll make some additional comments on our third quarter performance provide a bit more color on the fieldwood related contingent liability review aspects of altus midstream s recently announced combination with eagleclaw and provide some more context around our free cash flow outlook and capital framework as noted in our news release yesterday under generally accepted accounting principles apa corporation reported a third quarter 2021 consolidated loss of 113 million or 0 30 per diluted common share these results include a number of items that are outside of core earnings excluding the impact of the fieldwood related contingent liability a loss on extinguishment of debt a charge for tax related valuation allowance and some other smaller items adjusted net income for the third quarter was 372 million or 0 98 per share most of our financial results were in line with or better than guidance this quarter upstream capital investment was considerably below guidance primarily due to the timing of infrastructure spending in egypt and lower exploration costs in suriname our teams have done a good job holding the line on capital and loe despite service cost inflation and we expect these will finish the year at or below our original 2021 guidance g a was also below guidance this quarter mostly due to the timing of some costs which we now expect to be incurred in the fourth quarter i d like to provide a bit more color now on the fieldwood aro situation through fieldwood s most recent bankruptcy process we had to rely on third party estimates of the remaining net abandonment obligations related to our legacy properties since fieldwood emerged from bankruptcy in august we have conducted our own evaluations based on that work it appears the combination of the various financial security packages and the anticipated future net cash flows from the properties will not be sufficient to fund all of the remaining abandonment obligations accounting rules require that the entire undiscounted contingent obligation and the offsetting undiscounted value of the financial security will be brought onto our books these are recorded independently as a liability and an asset without netting them against one another accordingly in the third quarter we brought on to our books the anticipated net aro obligation of 1 2 billion we also recorded the offsetting value of the financial security in the amount of 740 million as a reminder the financial security includes a funded abandonment trust letters of credit and surety bonds as abandonment activity occurs it will be funded first by the free cash flows currently being generated by the legacy properties to the extent these cash flows are insufficient apache corporation will be required to fund the activity and will be reimbursed through the financial security only after the operating cash flows and financial security packages are fully depleted will apache corporation be obligated to fund the activity without a source of reimbursement the undiscounted net liability is 446 million and we anticipate it will be at least 2026 before apache incurs costs in excess of the available financial security a few weeks ago our majority owned midstream company altus announced that it will combine with the parent company of eagleclaw midstream to form the largest integrated midstream company in the delaware basin we considered a wide range of strategic options for altus for more than a year ultimately we determined that this transaction would allow all altus shareholders to reposition equity holdings into a pro forma company with the best combination of scale synergies asset quality and attractive growth opportunities the transaction would also preserve the 6 per share annual cash dividend for the public shareholders and provide near term optionality for apa to monetize a meaningful portion of our current position such a secondary sale would benefit the combined company by improving the public float it would also provide apa with cash flow a portion of which would be deployed in the alpine high activity thereby enhancing dedicated sources of revenue for the company reducing our ownership interest in altus to a minority position provides a number of benefits for apa as well including simplification of our financial reporting increased comparability with our upstream only peers and improved leverage metrics upon deconsolidation of 1 3 billion of debt and preferred equity as of september 30 as we proceed toward closing which is anticipated in the first quarter of 2022 we will provide further detail around the accounting treatment and the financial statement impacts of this transaction with respect to portfolio management more generally as we build the capital investment program to a level capable of sustaining or slightly growing production you will see increasing activity in our core asset areas primarily in the u s onshore and in egypt this will demonstrate both the quality and running room in our core assets as well as the need for a more accelerated pace of noncore asset divestments as part of that in 2022 we anticipate a minimum of 500 million of further noncore u s onshore asset divestments i d like to close by reiterating some of john s comments regarding apa s free cash flow generation capacity and its anticipated uses as always there can be some confusion around a term like free cash flow so we want to be clear what it means at apa you will find our definition of free cash flow in our financial and operational supplement which we publish with every quarterly earnings report in the fourth quarter of this year at current strip pricing we expect to generate free cash flow in excess of 600 million which would result in full year 2021 free cash flow of around 2 billion under our new capital return framework a minimum of 60 of this free cash flow would go to ordinary dividends and share repurchases and as john indicated we expect to exceed the 60 framework in the current quarter looking ahead to next year we currently contemplate a capital budget of around 1 5 billion this would consist of roughly 1 3 billion for development and 200 million for exploration and appraisal activities mostly in suriname as we ve indicated we believe the planned level of activity would put our global total boe production on a sustaining to slightly growing long term trajectory this excludes any future production contribution from suriname the near term allocation of capital would likely be biased to increasing oil production which would offset declining gas and ngl production that said the commodity price environment is very active and we have considerable flexibility within our portfolio to redirect capital as appropriate based on this investment level we anticipate free cash flow in 2022 would again be in the neighborhood of 2 billion prior to any benefits of egypt psc modernization finally i would like to caveat all of this with as is customary the final plan for 2022 will be reviewed in the fourth quarter call in february and with that i will turn the call over to the operator for q a questions answers operator you have your first question coming from the line of doug leggate from bank of america your line is now open doug leggate bank of america merrill lynch analyst well thanks good morning everybody just checking john can you hear me ok i m finding it difficult john christmann chief executive officer and president yes good morning doug doug leggate bank of america merrill lynch analyst phone company has been giving me some problems john i m going to start with egypt if i may i m sure you saw the report we put out a month or so ago one of your smaller peers has been a little bit more transparent on the potential changes in terms from the psc modernization so i wonder if conceptually you could walk us through how you see the moving parts as it relates to increased profit oil and in particular the potential for legacy stranded capital cost recovery if you could put some maybe a range of potential impacts on you assuming similar terms applied john christmann chief executive officer and president well doug it s a great question and you know from our perspective we re the largest onshore producer in egypt you ve hit on some of the key points we ve made the decision not to give more color on that until it s finalized i will tell you that the modernized psc has recently been approved by the cabinet and it has moved on to parliament so we re getting close and we expect that everything is on track for a year end approval but in terms of any more color you ve done a good piece of work out there and i ll let steve comment on a couple of things steve riney executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah doug the thing i would add to that based on your work you ve demonstrated you understand how the pscs work the backlog while we haven t indicated exactly how much that is the mechanism to recover that is that it is the backlog would be and we ve shared this publicly already the backlog would be recovered over a five year period on a quarterly basis and that backlog would roll into the other costs for cost recovery so it is all subject the sum of all of that is subject to the 40 limit on cost recovery barrels the benefit the real benefit as you ve noted in your write up is that by aggregating all of these into a single bucket for cost recovery purposes you don t end up with stranded costs in any of the smaller buckets and that will allow us to get this backlog of costs recovered as well especially in this price environment doug leggate bank of america merrill lynch analyst steve i know you don t want to give specifics but in my note i did suggest the potential that the impact could be several hundred million dollars plus would you push back on that or give some affirmation that we re in the ballpark steve riney executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah doug i think i need to be really careful about that so i think we won t comment on it at this point in time doug leggate bank of america merrill lynch analyst ok i understand let me move on very quickly to my second question which is understandably suriname you ve got a well test i guess you drilled out the plugs about 3 5 weeks ago john i guess i m a little surprised that you re not ready to give us some updates there or on bonboni where our guys on the ground are suggesting that you re already in the formation there so i m just wondering if you can offer any color around those two pieces of potential news flow that we expect i guess in the coming months and i ll leave it there thank you john christmann chief executive officer and president great question doug and i ll address sapakara south first number one you can appreciate that there s multiple phases of a flow test that you go through and sometimes even more important than the flow period is the buildup and the pressure response and all of those things so it s early i ll just tell you save your question i m not in a position to reveal anything on it today but hold your question and we ll be able to respond in the near future so as we turn to bonboni yes total s got two rigs the developer is at sapakara south the valiant is at bonboni i ll remind everybody it s a 45 kilometer step out to the north it is a key well and i think the prospectivity up there will inform the northern portion of the block as well as have some implications on block 53 so once again i m not in a position to provide any update but i d just say stay tuned right and we ll be in a position to update you when we can doug leggate bank of america merrill lynch analyst awesome thanks so much guys operator your next question comes from the line of neal dingmann from truist securities you may ask your question neal dingmann truist securities analyst hello john nice update on the shareholder return i was going to ask one thing around that just your thoughts i don t know either you or the company s sort of personal thoughts on something about doing more of a variable versus a buyback i mean obviously your stock appears to me on many levels quite cheap here so i m just wondering how you think about the two alternatives john christmann chief executive officer and president yes neal i mean i guess i ll start out and just on the framework i ll just give a few comments here it really should not come as a surprise that anybody that s engaged with us over the last several years when we ve been on the road and in our meetings steve and i have been really clear that a quality e p needs to have a strong balance sheet you need to have a sustaining to low growth profile multiple years of inventory but not too many years of inventory and we should be throwing off the majority of our free cash flow to shareholders we ve had a lot of work to do that the volatile pricing environment has at times impacted but we re in a position where we re finally here if you look at the framework we believe you want to do a nice mix you need a competitive dividend we re not big fans of the variable dividend i mean in terms of how that works and i think with where our share price is especially today is as cheap as it is that that would be the primary means of how we d look at it steve any more specifics you want to provide steve riney executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah sorry about that thanks for the question because i think it is important to share some of the context around the framework that we ve rolled out today and i think john framed it exactly right in terms of the history of where we ve been i think if you just step back and think about the industry it wasn t too long ago that the industry was all about growth and really little or no returns to shareholders and more recently we ve finally gotten to where it s about moderated growth ambitions and really starting to roll out these returns frameworks and i think the big step right now is to figure out well what s the right return framework and i d say it s kind of early days for the industry in general and we re all kind of figuring that out now the returns frameworks right now are migrating toward a percent of free cash flow and i think that s probably good the ranges out there are pretty broad i see ranges from 25 all the way up to 75 and we re probably going to find a sweet spot in there and i think it s starting to migrate toward somewhere around 50 as an industry for apa specifically i mean we just took a significant step in improving the capital structure of the company with the debt tender this fall and that was 100 focused on debt reduction we know there s more to do on the balance sheet and we ll get to that and to be clear we still want to get to investment grade but that can take some time and that s ok we do have to just recognize that shareholders are pretty important too and we need to find a balance in returns to shareholders while at the same time continuing to improve the balance sheet and the industry has chosen 50 because they re kind of migrating toward that we chose 60 we think this is the right balance for apa we have a quality diversified portfolio it s exposed to a good range of commodity price and geographic mix it s capable of sustaining free cash flow for many many years and remember free cash flow the basis for the returns calculation is after capital spending so we ve been improving the balance sheet we can still continue to strengthen the balance sheet up to 40 still available for other uses including debt reduction but i d say in the near term we certainly have a bias for dividends and buybacks and remember also we did talk about in my prepared remarks we talked about the fact that we re going to probably pick up the pace on noncore asset sales and that s also a source of funds for continuing to strengthen the balance sheet but also for potentially for more returns to shareholders as well so we feel pretty good about that balance in the 60 level as john indicated we re not particular fans of the variable dividends at this point in time we ll continue to look at that for the future and consider how the market reacts to those i think the variable dividend needs to be in general a smaller piece and just in terms of balancing dividends versus buybacks for now we re just happy to lean into buybacks we believe our share price is too low we ve been discounting for several months now greater than 25 free cash flow yield it s one of the highest in the peer group we don t believe our base cash flow generating capacity is actually fully appreciated by the market and we need to continue to work on that we know that but for now the share price is just too low so we ll continue with leaning in on the buybacks we know we need to have a competitive ordinary dividend yield and it needs to be competitive against other e ps as well as the broader market and i think that s probably higher than what we see as the typical 2 ordinary dividend yield we see today and we ll figure that out it s about getting to a balance around what s the right strength of balance sheet that certainly is trending to something stronger but also what price are we going to base all of that on because i think it s a valid question as to what we all think mid cycle price is now so we ll get on with raising the dividend as well we just need to be thoughtful about that it was only 18 months ago that we cut the dividend by 90 and that was a pretty painful process we re going to make sure we don t put ourselves in a situation where we have to do something like that again probably more than you asked us for but i wanted to take the opportunity to lay out a lot of context around the returns framework neal dingmann truist securities analyst no i appreciate it i think what you said about the both said about the shareholder return makes a lot of or about the share buyback makes sense and one just quick follow up john just thoughts on future or i d say near term medium term alpine high activity given not only the strong natural gas prices post the altus deal and given that cheniere long term supply contract agreement seems to be getting closer to fruition so given all of that maybe what you could say about alpine high john christmann chief executive officer and president yes i mean when you look at our u s program neal we ve got two rigs in the southern midland basin we picked up another one that s in the chalk now we ve indicated we will be adding another rig probably middle of next year which would put us three that will go to permian and quite frankly then we envision those rigs kind of working those assets in tandem we re in pad drilling you ll be seeing those move and with the time it takes on the unconventional side to mobilize a rig drill pads and see production your short term windows are kind of we re benefiting from those right now at alpine high with the ducs that we did earlier right so i think you re going to see a very well thought out efficient capital program in the u s where we re moving those rigs around those plays based on the how we ve laid the inventory out and the infrastructure so we can maximize those returns but there is a portion of the altus piece if we sell down all those shares that we do put in there but it will all fit into our framework so it s nice to have quality inventory and options because then we can just really plan it out and be thoughtful but you ll see activity across our permian next year in a very thoughtful way neal dingmann truist securities analyst got it thank you all so much for the time john christmann chief executive officer and president you bet thank you neal operator your next question comes from the line of michael scialla from stifel you may ask your question michael scialla stifel financial corp analyst yeah good morning buddy see what the next steps would be at keskesi and kwaskwasi is the issue with both appraisals there just lack of reservoir quality sands as you stepped out did you just step out too far on the edge so you need to move back toward the discoveries with the next appraisals or is it more complicated than that john christmann chief executive officer and president no mike it s a good question i will tell you that at keskesi it was a big step out we knew it looked a little different in terms of the signature so we knew there was more risk to it but there is work to do at keskesi in closer but i think from the priorities it will all be kind of put into as you re working across all the discoveries and the appraisal program we re kind of integrating data we prioritize with the appraisal things that would be what i ll call lower gor black oil that you could potentially fast track and so we re working those in a queue based on the learnings and kind of integrating everything in some of that will come to one of the reasons why krabdagoe is the next exploration well it s in the neighborhood and we like the way it looks so i think it s all part of an integrated plan michael scialla stifel financial corp analyst ok helpful and maybe just to follow up on neal s question can you talk about that decision to put the third rig in the chalk versus the midland or alpine high and steve mentioned a plan to add a fourth rig next year any early preview on where that might land and i guess any possibility of going beyond four rigs in the u s next year dave pursell executive vice president development yes this is dave pursell it s a good question so remember on the chalk we talked about drilling a handful of wells in our brazos county acreage position one because we re trying to maintain optionality we ve had significant experience a little bit to the west in the washington county area and we had a decent acreage position put together and wanted to hold it together and we like what we ve seen so far it s consistent with the geology we ve seen in washington county and well results and so we really just want to leverage that experience we liked what we saw and felt like it was time to put a rig there and continue to progress that position the thing to remember it s near infrastructure there s a lot of pipe and infrastructure in the area it s less than 100 miles from houston ship channel so we re getting henry hub pricing and lls pricing for the crude the gors are a little bit higher than what you typically see in the permian so there s a little bit of a gas component there too which we like in these markets so for us it was a pretty easy decision on the chalk the extra rig we talked about the incremental rig in the middle of 2022 i think it s important to point out first of all that as we think about adding another rig it s harder to stand up a rig quickly it s a couple of quarters to from the time you make that decision until the time you re turning to the right just because of long lead items and supply chain issues and to make sure that we have everything we need to keep that rig running i think john highlighted that there s a lot to do in the permian we have two rigs in the southern midland basin we have a lot of development inventory that we re not getting to which includes alpine high and we have a lot of good opportunities for that rig and we ll post you on those in february but you can imagine that alpine would be on that list of places we d be looking to drill next year steve riney executive vice president and chief financial officer and to be clear there will be no fifth rig in the onshore u s next year dave pursell executive vice president development yes yes thank you steve michael scialla stifel financial corp analyst thanks guys john christmann chief executive officer and president thank you mike operator your next question comes from the line of bob brackett from bernstein research your line is now open bob brackett sanford c bernstein analyst good morning all just a question following up on the austin chalk and the alpine high how do you think longer term about the balance of gas directed drilling versus oil directed drilling any thoughts there dave pursell executive vice president development yes bob i think the beauty of a diverse portfolio is we have the ability to flex that and so i m going to give you a nonanswer because it really depends on where commodity markets go we re obviously we ve got a very constructive crude market and a gas market that s becoming more constructive we d like to see the back end of the gas curve strengthen a little bit from here but again with the diverse portfolio both diverse in the permian and diverse globally we have the ability to flex and move and take advantage of commodity markets across the globe so i ll leave it at that but we re watching the forward curve on gas let s just leave it at that bob brackett sanford c bernstein analyst ok perfectly clear if we re traveling the globe can you talk about inflation and sort of what you re baking in domestically where you might be seeing something a bit higher versus maybe some of the international assets what s baked into that sort of capex guide in terms of inflation john christmann chief executive officer and president yes bob i mean you look today and it s the commodities right i mean steel is up where we ve got fuel your power cost your people costs i mean but it s really steel and people is how we frame it and we have factored some of that into that capital number as we look at our programs i mean we try to get ahead on the purchases and so you get into the middle of 22 it is baked into our capital numbers bob brackett sanford c bernstein analyst any difference domestically versus internationally and is there a number you d hazard to throw out john christmann chief executive officer and president no i mean i think you can look at those numbers and easily you get into the i mean 15 20 number easily in some places even higher but not a lot of difference between the two you just don t have i mean the nice thing about a place like egypt there s not as much competition for rig adds and things and so it s probably easier to pick up rigs in egypt than i would say in the u s just because i take you back to 2014 we were running 28 rigs there so it s not like we re going up to a level where we ve got to bring new equipment in and those sorts of things i don t know dave any more specific you want to say dave pursell executive vice president development yes the only thing i d add is if you think about the type of drilling that we do in egypt it s vertical wells it s more commodity drilling compared to what we re doing in the permian where a lot of the well cost is really on the completion side so just less i think john hit it there s less inflation in egypt and it s really just because of the type of wells that we tend to drill kind of day in and day out john christmann chief executive officer and president the other thing i would add bob is some of the targeted divestments have been on our higher water cut central basin platform properties where we re burning more energy and moving more fluid and those types of things are helping our numbers too right in terms of what we re targeting so there s we re trying to be really smart about the portfolio and factoring all those in bob brackett sanford c bernstein analyst great that makes sense thanks much operator your next question is from leo mariani from keybanc please go ahead leo mariani keybanc capital markets analyst hi guys i just wanted to follow up on the stock buyback program here i guess high level you guys talked about roughly i guess 2 billion of free cash flow i know there s some dividend here but 60 to the buyback i mean that certainly could imply kind of north of 1 billion on the buyback and just doing our math that certainly seems to be a very large percentage of your shares outstanding currently kind of approaching 15 upwards of that maybe in one year next year just wanted to get a sense of do you guys think that a number of that size is roughly correct and is it feasible to buy back that much stock steve riney executive vice president and chief financial officer well if the share price stays roughly where it is then that will be the outcome yes and if oil prices stay where they are leo mariani keybanc capital markets analyst right ok and just on steve riney executive vice president and chief financial officer yes i think it is feasible yes leo mariani keybanc capital markets analyst ok and then just wanted to follow up on the austin chalk here so obviously at this point you ve dedicated a rig i guess in your slide deck you kind of talked about one well result looked very strong presumably there s probably more than that in terms of results that maybe you guys have seen out there i was hoping maybe you could give us a little bit more color in terms of inventory kind of areal extent of where you guys have drilled is there kind of an acreage number you think is a sweet spot out there for you that would kind of give you just a number of years of inventory and maybe just more color about what that rig is doing is it all development work is there going to be a mix of some exploration in there can you maybe just provide a little bit more color about what the one rig is doing and what you ve seen so far john christmann chief executive officer and president yes one comment from me is not only do we have the operated rig but we re also a non op in some of magnolia s operations so there s quite a bit of data dave i ll let you jump in dave pursell executive vice president development yes leo it s a good question on the brazos county side we haven t really talked yet about the size of this but there s some i wouldn t call it exploration but there s some additional delineation work we re doing to see kind of how big this could be but when we look at it there s easily over five rig years worth of development to do in this one spot so and again we re leveraging a lot of our knowledge on the work we ve done over in the washington county area as operator and as john suggested a fairly significant non op position so we ll leave it at that leo mariani keybanc capital markets analyst ok thanks guys operator next is from john freeman from raymond james please go ahead john freeman raymond james financial inc analyst hi guys thanks for taking my questions john christmann chief executive officer and president you bet john john freeman raymond james financial inc analyst i wanted to follow up on alpine high which i m sure you would have a couple of quarters ago i don t think we would have realized we d be having multiple questions on alpine high but obviously a lot of things have changed and so i guess when i sort of look at alpine high and what gas ngl prices have done and then following up on the recent altus eagleclaw deal with those processing gathering where it s gotten a lot more attractive and then i know that you ve done some stuff on sort of wider spacing than you used to do there as well i m just i m curious as it sounds pretty likely that that fourth rig will go to alpine high if there might be some plan to get an update on sort of the economic model for alpine high because it has been quite a while since we ve seen it dave pursell executive vice president development yes john this is dave look for that as we get into 2022 and really kind of hone in on where that additional rig s going to focus but you re right i mean it s not just gas price and cost structure we ve done some things on performance on some of the ducs with spacing as well as frack design and some of those wells are in the public domain and the results are very very good certainly exceeded our expectations so there s a number of factors that would kind of drive us to really focus on alpine as well as some of the other opportunities out there john freeman raymond james financial inc analyst ok and then just a follow up question on egypt so if i heard you right john it sounded like the 11 rigs was going to go higher post the modernization getting completed if i heard that right and obviously it s been a while since we ve been at this sort of an activity set so egypt sort of until at least suriname gets to a point where it s at first oil egypt kind of becomes the growth driver for the company and i m just i guess i m just sort of curious when we think historically have been sort of like an eight rig program or so and kind of keep production roughly flat if we go 11 rigs plus is this sort of like a double digit type growing asset just i guess any additional color how you re thinking about egypt john christmann chief executive officer and president yes i mean clearly we ve been gradually ramping right we went from five or we started the year around five rigs we went to d8 now we re at 11 the plan would be to go up another step i don t see us going back needing to go back to where we once were in the mid 20 range but it will it s going to turn the corner we ve been slightly underinvesting in egypt for quite a number of years and it definitely will turn the trajectory the other way which is what egypt wants and quite frankly part of the overall win win that s in this for egypt and apa john freeman raymond james financial inc analyst got it i appreciate it john christmann chief executive officer and president thank you operator your next question is from michael scialla from stifel your line is now open michael scialla stifel financial corp analyst actually john just asked my two follow up questions but i ll ask one more the asset retirement liability being put back to you with those gulf of mexico assets does fieldwood continue to operate there and do you have any input on what they do there steve riney executive vice president and chief financial officer no those assets came out of fieldwood so the legacy fieldwood company is now a company called quarternorth and they don t own the old fieldwood assets that apache had sold to them those came out and went into an entity that we now call gom shelf there is a person that s kind of contract managing those assets because there are assets that are still producing the contract today is in place with quarternorth the old fieldwood organization to operate those assets for us and we ll continue to evaluate whether that s the best long term situation michael scialla stifel financial corp analyst is there any thought on just taking over or could you potentially take over operations there would you want i mean if you ve got all the liability would it make sense to operate it yourself steve riney executive vice president and chief financial officer well we d have to ask the lawyers that of whether we can operate those assets or not i believe there are some issues with us being able to operate them but i doubt that we would take over operatorship of those assets at this point in time the nature of the assets there they re a large inventory of properties that came out of fieldwood a number of them are in abandonment activity today and a number of them a smaller number of them are operating and still generating free cash flow and i won t go through the details unless somebody wants me to but we booked a net 1 2 billion liability on our balance sheet that s the gross abandonment obligation less the free cash flows that we see coming out of those assets for their remaining life and then we also booked on the asset side of our balance sheet 740 million of various forms of financial security that we have in place to fund that abandonment obligation so a net liability on our part a net obligation of about 450 million that obligation we won t actually start funding anything on that obligation until 2026 at the soonest in terms of costs that could be incurred that we wouldn t have any form of reimbursement for and then that would carry over for about five or six years after 2026 in terms of that situation the present value of all of those costs today are about 250 million because we had to book an undiscounted number of the 450 million the other thing i just might comment on is that the way we went about doing the work because we only got access to the raw data behind all of this in august and we ve been pouring through that since we got that we ve looked hard at the abandonment costs and we ve looked the second priority was to look at the operating assets and the cash flow from the pdps on those and then the third priority was to look at capital investment opportunities because any assets like these are going to have up hole recompletion opportunities and things like that that was the third priority and we really haven t gotten through all of those there are literally hundreds of capital investment opportunities we got to the ones that we thought were the highest priorities seemed like the best opportunities and so those are included in the free cash flows but we think there are more we think that there are opportunities to reduce the operating and overhead costs in the pdps and we believe there are probably more opportunities on the investment side that we just haven t been able to get to yet so we ll be you should be watching for those over the coming quarters and that has a decent chance of possibly bringing that 450 million liability down over time and that would also decrease obviously the present value of that opportunity michael scialla stifel financial corp analyst thanks for the detail on that steve one more you had mentioned steve about the divestitures you plan next year i know you guys don t want to give detail on that but i m just curious can you speak broadly as to what assets might be put in that divestiture bucket i m assuming they re on the domestic side and outside of your kind of three core areas or core areas and that intersection john christmann chief executive officer and president mike actually we sold some central basin platform properties earlier this year that were higher cost higher water cut later life things things we ve had in the portfolio for a long long time what i call some of the legacy you can anticipate more of those types of assets is probably what would make sense michael scialla stifel financial corp analyst yes ok very good thank you guys john christmann chief executive officer and president thank you operator you have your last question coming from the line of doug leggate from bank of america please go ahead doug leggate bank of america merrill lynch analyst hey guys sorry for double dipping today but i had a couple of things i wanted some clarification on after i queued up again the first one is on the buyback i think i missed the comment and i ll ask the question like this when you take disposals potentially into account as well as i guess you ve already dealt with the egyptian thing as it relates to cash flow is there an upward limit on how aggressive you would expect to be with the buybacks in absolute terms john christmann chief executive officer and president no doug leggate bank of america merrill lynch analyst ok simple enough and my follow up is just a question steve riney executive vice president and chief financial officer so just to give a bit of color on that doug i think again i think our shares are trading at a pretty meaningful discount today they have improved over the last month or so and that no doubt is part of the purpose of the buyback but we believe they re still trading at a meaningful discount relative to the price environment we find ourselves in and we just think that s for long term shareholders that s one of the better investment opportunities we can make and so we ll continue doing that as long as the free cash flow holds up so that s why we say it s a minimum of 60 doug leggate bank of america merrill lynch analyst steve the 500 million does that go to the balance sheet or does that go to buybacks as well because that s not technically operating cash flow steve riney executive vice president and chief financial officer yes we re just going to remain noncommittal on what the buybacks and for that matter the other 40 can go to i mean the disposal proceeds and the other 40 of free cash flow because yes we ll deal with that as it occurs it could go to balance sheet strengthening it could go to more buybacks it could raise the dividend quicker we ve got a number of things on the horizon with egypt modernization also occurring so we ve got a lot of things still ahead of us here doug leggate bank of america merrill lynch analyst i don t want to belabor the point but the credit agencies do they have a view on the buyback have you run this past them to get their opinion steve riney executive vice president and chief financial officer we haven t spoken to them yet but we will be speaking with them shortly doug leggate bank of america merrill lynch analyst ok my last one steve riney executive vice president and chief financial officer we will reassure them of the same thing that we ve talked about here today we re still going to have plenty of free cash flow to do further balance sheet improvement and cash flow from asset disposals if we need to do that and if we feel like that s the best thing to do at the point in time doug leggate bank of america merrill lynch analyst thank you my follow up steve is a really quick one for clarification cheniere has your contract kicking in pari passu with their third corpus christi development which has not even fid ed yet my understanding was that that contract could become effective middle of next year can you just offer some clarification on the timing and maybe what you

greaney minn beryl novak bought 40 acres of forest here in 1966 for 700 eventually moved an old one room shack to the site for a deer hunting cabin and then liked it so much he moved in for good that was 1977 he hasn t lived anyplace else since he hasn t slept in any other bed not a single night away since may 1993 i m kind of a homebody novak said he also hasn t hunted deer anywhere else and on saturday morning nov 6 novak will be in his favorite deer stand a 5 by 8 foot tarpaper shack with a slide up window where odds are he will see some deer whether or not he gets a legal buck will be up to the fates of course much like the other nearly half million minnesota hunters out and about but don t bet against him advertisement beryl novak the stand is just 50 yards from his house about an hour s drive north of hibbing overlooking a mowed clearing with a backdrop of spruce and balsam about 140 yards out he has shot dozens of deer from this spot most with his trusty 270 winchester some of them just minutes into the first morning of the season the annual deer hunt has become part of his life s routine a rhythm that revolves around nature s seasons things like putting up firewood tending his big garden planting and grafting dozens of apple trees and walking hundreds of miles each autumn in search of grouse already this season he s bagged two dozen grouse by walking slowly watching and listening on forest trails beryl novak walks past a deer rub while grouse hunting monday nov 1 2021 steve kuchera duluth news tribune but it hasn t been easy i figure it s about 5 miles walking for each bird he said as we walked and talked in his woods shotguns at the ready on a brisk november morning we flushed a couple grouse that day but didn t get any shots advertisement over the years living out here novak has had close calls with wolves and has battled with bears but it all seems to come in stride for an outdoorsman who doesn t rattle easily who seemingly has seen and done everything the northwoods has to offer started young novak 71 shot his first deer at age 10 in 1960 hunting alone he still has the paper hunting license and aluminum buck tag pressed between pages in a photo album since then novak figures he s shot 75 deer in these woods northwest of cook beryl novak still has his deer license and tag from 1960 steve kuchera duluth news tribune he has a memory like a steel trap and rattles off dates and antler counts from hunting seasons a half century ago like they happened yesterday novak was born and raised in this country and graduated from orr high school in 1968 he liked cars of course and girls but his passion has always been the outdoors hunting fishing and trapping my dad died when i was 5 novak said but i had a mentor teach me grouse hunting joe kasun when i was 7 he gave me a single shot 22 to use and one 22 short bullet and took me grouse hunting and told me not to miss i got one deer hunting though i had to figure out on my own advertisement and he has a 10 year old beryl novak poses with the buck he shot in 1960 contributed beryl novack novak attended a vocational college and then with a low draft number looming enlisted in the u s air force and stayed in for nearly four years from 1970 74 he was stationed at several bases across the u s and spent eight months in vietnam at the 483rd usaf hospital at cam ranh bay where the base would come under occasional rocket attack and where he saw the horrors of war firsthand with a parade of wounded on display through his military service he would come home on leave scheduled around hunting seasons i came home to hunt he said it s what i thought about when i was over there related a northwoods living novak s one room home is 16 by 20 feet what city folks these days might call a tiny house it has no running water there s a hand pump outside a few steps an outhouse of course and a sauna shed too advertisement i don t have to worry about pipes freezing novak quipped it s an armstrong pump a big barrel wood stove heats the place when it s cold and novak has a few seasons worth of fuel stacked neatly outside there s a gas range for cooking a bed in the corner and a small tv that gets three stations over the airwaves beryl novak talks with a visitor in his one room cabin monday nov 1 2021 steve kuchera duluth news tribune why would you need any more than that everything on tv is all so damned depressing anyway novak said there s a 2017 calendar on the door still next to a reminder note for next year s dental appointment dusty cds and dvds and piles of outdoor and gardening magazines cover much of the kitchen table a few old buck antlers trophies from long past seasons are stashed in the corner a few mounted fish adorn the walls antlers from past hunts lay on a table in beryl novak s cabin monday nov 1 2021 steve kuchera duluth news tribune advertisement novak worked the usual northwoods jobs over the years including as a logger and then on a sand and gravel crew he trapped and sold furs beaver otter fisher and pine marten until the bottom dropped out of the fur market and prices plummeted he picked wild blueberries and sold them to grocery stores in town he cut and sold balsam boughs and firewood for a spell too novak formally retired in 1995 meaning that s the point he stopped trying to earn a living and focused on the living part there wasn t anyone left calling me who i wanted to talk to people would say but we can t get ahold of you and i d say that s the point beryl novak it doesn t cost much to live up here i get by pretty cheap he said it s not that he doesn t like people novak said just that he found it hard always trying to get along you can t satisfy people so i said the hell with it and here i am he said adding that he doesn t consider himself a hermit i get visitors just not as many as i used to everyone is dying off beryl novak unloads his shotgun outside the one room cabin he s lived in since 1977 after a grouse hunt monday nov 1 2021 steve kuchera duluth news tribune advertisement his last car broke down in 2005 and he hasn t driven one since although he does have a four wheel atv that can get him the mile or so down the road to another 43 acre parcel he owns and hunts on he keeps mowed trails on his land that attract deer grouse and other wildlife and make for easy walking he has planted hundreds of apple plum and pine trees along the trails novak depends on the kindness of a few friends and neighbors to get him to his annual doctor and dental checkups or to bring him fresh food on occasion in return he shares crops from his garden or maybe a cleaned and packaged grouse breast he stocks up on provisions in town a few times each year most everything else he grows or shoots on his own conservation officers occasionally add to his larder by dropping off an illegally killed deer this year s drought cut into his sweet corn crop but his melons onions and carrots did well with him carrying water from the pump a late may hard freeze crippled novak s apple crop though nipping the buds it s the first time i ve ever had a total failure for apples he noted his last dog died eight years ago and he s not planning to get another i didn t feel it was right to have a dog and not have a way to get him to the vet he said it s bad enough for people to have to take me to the doctor s but it s too much to ask someone else to take my dog to the vet simplifying life at his annual checkup in august in hibbing doctors proclaimed novak perfectly fit he takes no medications and goes years between suffering a cold or the flu because he doesn t mix in crowds and novak noted that he has been perfectly situated to guard against the covid 19 pandemic i ve been social distancing out

home area during one stretch between october 2020 and february 2021 he went 134 days without leaving more than four months between trips to cook just 25 miles away i didn t have any reason i had to go he said he hasn t shaved or had a haircut since 2001 when he grew it out to spite his mom who had been nagging him about his appearance she s long since passed but he still hasn t relented i don t have to live to suit anyone else he said his shoulder length hair falls out a lot it doesn t get that long novak cut off his landline service in 1995 tired of telemarketers and went 20 years without a telephone there wasn t anyone left calling me who i wanted to talk to novak said people would say but we can t get ahold of you and i d say that s the point in spring 2015 a neighbor whose hunting land he keeps watch on gave him an inexpensive cellphone to report problems on he got me one new one since and he s still paying the bills novak said it s definitely not a smartphone he has no computer no email and no facebook it s as if the last 25 years of technology have passed him by and it s clear he doesn t care as long as he has his rifle and shotgun and is fit to walk in the woods he s happy beryl novak poses with the eight point buck he shot in 1977 the first year he lived in his one room cabin contributed beryl novack novak keeps a tattered dog eared paperback of henry david thoreau s essays on the virtues of self reliant backwoods living near his bed it s become a sort of guidebook for his lifestyle it might even be in his pocket on saturday for the deer opener if people
