farming has a role to play in tackling climate change because of its contribution to greenhouse gas emissions ghgs but that contribution is often overstated by anti farming lobby groups and sections of the wider media that may have a vested interest in turning farming into a pariah some of the claims made are so far from the truth that public actions based on the disinformation could even be harmful to the environment and human health see also mythbusters 8 common misconceptions about antibiotics farmers weekly has teamed up with the sustainable food trust sft to look at eight of the common claims made in order to debunk them as myths and replace them with facts 1 water use on dairy farms is unsustainable claim it takes 1 000 litres of water to produce 1 litre of milk this figure is widely used in mainstream media however a study by cranfield university found that only 7 5 8 litres of water less than 1 of the claimed amount is used on uk dairy farms to produce one litre of milk richard young sft policy director explains the cranfield figure relates to mains water he says that other water used on farms is from sustainable cyclical sources such as rain and is not as relevant in a country such as the uk which has relatively high annual average precipitation as in the us for example where forage and feed crops are often irrigated 2 greenhouse gas emissions from farming are higher than any other sector claim food production accounts for 30 of emissions which is higher than transport the 30 figure is often wrongly attributed to emissions from uk farming activities alone but the office for national statistics ons estimates emissions attributable to uk agriculture are about 10 of the national total of the 10 roughly 6 is attributable to livestock farming the ons states robert barbour sft senior researcher explains that the 30 covers everything related to food production and consumption in the uk including processing beyond the farm gate transport and retail costs it also covers emissions from imported food feed fertiliser and even equipment used in food production 3 beef has the highest carbon footprint of all food types claim beef produces 50kg of greenhouse gas emissions per 100g of protein this figure is in fact an average for global production covering a huge variety of production systems when deforestation is factored into calculations for south american cattle on converted rainforest land in particular the figure can be many times greater than the global average unfortunately it is figures for systems such as these that are inflating the average and are wrongly touted as a marker for all beef production emissions from british grass and grass silage fed beef which accounts for more than 90 of uk output are far lower according to the sft a more realistic figure is 10 14kg of carbon dioxide per kilogram of meat from dairy herds and between 15 20kg of carbon dioxide equivalent per kilogram of meat for suckler herds with some achieving even lower figures than this critics also often overlook the carbon sequestration by hedges soils and trees which cut net emissions on grassland farms 4 we must cut uk livestock numbers to reduce emissions claim reducing livestock numbers is as important as cutting fossil fuel use the uk has already seen the national cattle herd reduce by about 20 since the early 1990s defra figures show this has helped reduce farm methane emissions by about 13 according to the sft however while uk demand for red meat remains stable cutting livestock numbers further could see supply run short this could create a gap that would be filled by imports with higher carbon related emissions says mr barbour it is important that we don t cut grazing livestock levels too far because this could ultimately raise global emissions he suggests 5 too much land is devoted to livestock production claim grazing land should be used for arable growing a frequent claim is that too much land is used for livestock production it should instead be switched to crop growing to cut emissions and feed more people say critics roughly two thirds to three quarters of farmland is used for livestock and dairy production according to the ons and the united nations food and agriculture organisation fao but although the facts appear to back up the point the argument sidesteps a key fact 65 of the grasslands are unsuitable for arable growing on steep slopes uplands protected ridges and furrows common land and much more only sheep and in some areas cattle can turn grass into a protein crop for humans reverting to tree growing on these areas would only deny the world a sustainable protein source less well understood by critics are areas that appear to be suitable for arable production but where high rainfall or heavy poor quality and acidic soils preclude crop growing changing to arable growing would be inefficient on this land with lower yields and increased crop failures farming the land would require greater dependence on burning fossil fuel for tillage and using more chemicals to combat pests and disease mr young also points out that ploughing up grassland for arable causes soil carbon and nitrous oxide losses to the atmosphere over 35 years about 40 of the soil carbon is lost for a fertile soil with a good organic matter level this averages about 7t carbon dioxide ha year with higher losses initially gradually declining over the period 6 vegan diets are better for the environment claim switching to a vegan diet reduces your carbon footprint by 73 a recent advertising standards authority ruling banned adverts about a plant based burger that claimed to be better for the environment than its meat alternative the authority found that ingredients in the plant burger had been sourced from around the world incurring carbon use in substantial transport distances it concluded that the carbon footprint was potentially higher than locally reared grass fed beef there is a huge variation in ingredients sourced for meat based and vegan diets a blanket statement that switching to a vegan diet is better for the environment is difficult to justify for example a vegan meal that is based on locally sourced seasonal vegetables will undoubtedly have a lower carbon footprint than beef imported from south america but the reverse can be true many vegan food products rely on rice palm oil or soya grown on deforested land which carry a high carbon footprint figures from the agricultural industries confederation aic show soya beans from countries in south america incur up to 6 573kg of carbon dioxide t of product rice from asia is estimated to produce 2 168kg carbon dioxide t while indonesian palm oil produces 1 422kg carbon dioxide t these figures are all relatively high due to the calculated effect of land use change such as deforestation us based soya bean and rice only produce 465kg and 404kg carbon dioxide t respectively 7 vegan diets are healthier than meat based diets claim red meat doubles the risk of cancer a common claim is that red meat is bad for human health a number of studies have claimed that eating red meat increases cancer risk by 17 100 and should be cut completely from diets however scientists and report authors have raised concerns about the potential samples used which may not have taken into account whether the meat was fresh or processed as well as other behavioural factors such as smoking alcohol consumption and exercise levels the world cancer research fund international does acknowledge an increased risk from eating red meat but it only recommends limiting meat consumption to 350 500g week rather than cutting it out altogether meanwhile longevity studies have failed to show that vegetarians and vegans live longer than their meat eating counterparts a recent research paper by wenpeng you et al featured in the international journal of general medicine showed that life expectancy in meat and dairy consumers was higher it concluded that meat in the diet may be providing energy and vital nutrients that were otherwise unavailable from plant based nutrition the ahdb also recently highlighted figures showing that milk and meat contain between seven and nine important micronutrients red meat includes vitamin b12 which protects immune systems and is not naturally available in plant based food the ahdb suggests 8 soya should be fed to people not animals claim 97 of soya goes through an animal it should go through humans first figures show that the amount of soya used for animal feed is far lower than the 97 figure commonly claimed by lobby groups of the total 3 2m tonnes imported into the uk annually about 2 4m tonnes or 75 is used as livestock feed according to aic statistics however this is not the whole story most soya beans are processed into two components soya meal and soya oil with only about 6 of whole soya beans used directly for human food about 80 of the oil goes into food with the rest mostly used for biodiesel with meal accounting for at least 80 of the weight it is the more valuable part but the food industry depends on the oil for a wide range of processed foods and you cannot have one without the other the aic data also points to good sustainability for soya meal used on uk farms with 57 sourced from regions in north and south america with no risk of deforestation a further 37 is deemed to be farmed at low risk of deforestation

bed bath and beyond nasdaq bbby recently has seen a significant increase in its stock price mainly owing to speculative sentiment the stock has rallied from its recent lows of 4 38 to 23 only to fall back down to 9 53 per share despite the recent rally which can be attributed to speculation is there any value in the stock get the full henry singleton series in pdf get the entire 4 part series on henry singleton in pdf save it to your desktop read it on your tablet or email to your colleagues q2 2022 hedge fund letters conferences and more the recent past has not been kind to bed bath and beyond and the pandemic only worsened the company s fortunes management recently announced that it will be cutting over 150 stores and up to 20 of its corporate and supply chain employees in addition many companies have tended to raise cash when their stocks have rallied and bed bath and beyond has also decided it will use the speculative environment to raise 500 million in cash in order to restructure the company the news led to the stock diving by 21 percent as investors scrambled to reassess since the cash raise will lead to a 12 million dilution of shares management is hoping the liquidity will help the company overcome the transition period as it looks to stem the high levels of cash burn in recent times bed bath and beyond have been burning through significant levels of cash for a number of quarters with cash flow in fy22 coming in at 322 million and the current cash flow to this this month ttm coming in at 722 million regardless the company isn t insolvent and the current cash and cash equivalents for the company stand at 200 million post restructure bed bath and beyond is likely to see far more stable cash flow and the ceo stated the following while there is much work ahead our road map is clear and we re confident that the significant changes we ve announced today will have a positive impact on our performance said sue gove a board member who is serving as interim chief executive what will be the impact of the current restructuring the current average cost per employee for bed bath and beyond stands at 28 29 000 and the total employee count stands at around 55 000 a reduction in headcount will likely cut the total number of employees by up to 10 12 000 and the reduction is likely to reduce total costs by anywhere from 350 400 million which will then push the company towards positive flow and profitability once again meanwhile for many years store count stood at around 1500 but with the pandemic that number fell to 1000 and now the company is set to further reduce store count by another 150 bringing total to around 800 stores the lowest in decades but the lower store count isn t all bad news and there are a number of factors driving this change the biggest factor driving the move away from brick and mortar stores is an increasing preference for online shopping and now that online sales are increasingly overtaking offline sales the entire business model is also set to change online sales increased by over 70 in 2021 and management is aiming to move the majority of their operations online bbby is likely to further cut brick and mortar stores a trend that has become quite common across north america as more and more stores shut down looking forward to the future despite the speculative rallies the current valuation for the company may in fact be inexpensive and with cost cutting becoming an increasing reality should be heading towards profitability in the fourth quarter of fy23 or the first quarter of fy24 the current price to sales stands at 0 15 which is very low even for a traditional brick and mortar retail business when combined with increasing online sales margins are likely to increase as the company reduces its capital intensity although same store sales are expected to fall by 25 for the year and revenue is expected to come in around 6 6 5 billion if profitability were to head towards historical margins which have stood at around 7 8 the company would trade well below its intrinsic value it remains to be seen whether management can manage to achieve its goals and get back on track until then the stock price is likely to see fluctuations should you invest 1 000 in bed bath beyond right now before you consider bed bath beyond you ll want to hear this marketbeat keeps track of wall street s top rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis marketbeat has identified the five stocks that top analysts are quietly whispering to their clients to buy now before the broader market catches on and bed bath beyond wasn t on the list while bed bath beyond currently has a reduce rating among analysts top rated analysts believe these five stocks are better buys view the five stocks here article by parth pala marketbeat

this week s housing industry news showed a continued deceleration in mortgage applications the first increase in time on market in more than two years and a troubling report on mortgage denial rates for black homebuyers on the mortgage front freddie mac otcmkts fmcc reported the 30 year fixed rate mortgage averaged 5 66 as of sept 1 up from last week when it averaged 5 55 the 15 year fixed rate

email to your colleagues q2 2022 hedge fund letters conferences and more and the 5 year treasury indexed hybrid adjustable rate mortgage averaged 4 51 up from last week when it averaged 4 36 the market s renewed perception of a more aggressive monetary policy stance has driven mortgage rates up to almost double what they were a year ago said sam khater freddie mac s chief economist the increase in mortgage rates is coming at a particularly vulnerable time for the housing market as sellers are recalibrating their pricing due to lower purchase demand likely resulting in continued price growth deceleration while mortgage rates continued to climb mortgage applications were in decline for the fourth straight week remaining at their lowest level in 22 years the mortgage bankers association s mba market composite index was down by 3 7 on a seasonally adjusted basis for the week ending aug 26 while the unadjusted index was down 5 the unadjusted refinance index decreased by 8 from the previous week and was 83 lower than the same week one year ago application volume dropped and remained at a multi decade low last week led by an 8 percent decline in refinance applications which now make up only 30 percent of all applications said joel kan mba associate vice president of economic and industry forecasting purchase applications have declined in eight of the last nine weeks as demand continues to shrink due to higher rates and a weaker economic outlook however rising inventories and slower home price growth could potentially bring some buyers back into the market later this year in other mortgage related news lendingtree nyse tree published data that found the purchase mortgage denial rate for black homebuyers was twice as high as the denial rate for the overall mortgage borrower population in each of the nation s 50 largest metros on average 18 of black homebuyers are denied a mortgage which was nine percentage points higher than the average denial rate for the overall population of 9 denial rates for black borrowers are highest in detroit miami and jacksonville and are lowest in san francisco seattle and sacramento across detroit miami and jacksonville lendingtree found the average denial rate for black borrowers is 25 52 more than double the average denial rate of 12 55 across san francisco seattle and sacramento though discrimination against a homebuyer on the basis of their race is illegal it still happens said lendingtree senior economist jacob channel it is for this reason that both lenders and individuals must learn to spot the signs of discrimination so that they can better avoid it on the homebuying front last month marked the first time since june 2020 that an increase in time on market was recorded according to realtor com homebuyers in august had more active listings to choose from than last year 26 6 even while new sellers continued to pull back realtor com which is operated by news corp nasdaq nws nasdaq nwsa subsidiary move inc noted that a typical home spent 42 days on market in august five days longer than last year and the first increase since june 2020 but still 22 days faster than in 2017 2019 on average time on market was lower across the 50 largest u s metros 37 days on average relative to the national median but also slowed from the august 2021 pace 5 days in the same markets for many of today s buyers the uptick in for sale home options is taking away the sense of urgency that they felt during the past two years when inventory was scarce said danielle hale chief economist for realtor com as a result of this shift coupled with higher mortgage rates competition continued to cool in august with listing price trends indicating that home shoppers are tightening their purse strings as we soak up the last days of summer the housing market is beginning to find more balance between buyer friendliness and still favorable selling conditions homebuyers in search of xl priced homes might

japan s no exit strategy testosterone pit dec 17 2012 one of my sources in japan was told about a yearend bonenkai party where an official from the ministry of finance the most powerful ministry at the core of japan inc had let slip some things perhaps after one too many drinks he confirmed the view propagated by the liberal democratic party the victor in sunday s election that the bank of japan wasn t doing its job that it was just giving away money to the banks which then bought japanese government bonds instead of channeling it into the real economy that s why the ministry of finance is trying to gain control over the bank of japan he said the ministry of finance has pride in its ability and is much more qualified to run things than the bank of japan turf war for him and his ilk independence of the central bank is a non sequitur and elected politicians when they try to bring the powerful bureaucracy under democratic control are a nuisance prime minister yoshihiko noda and his liberal democratic party had attempted to do that now they re out so a new government is being formed by the party that ran the show for fifty years after world war ii and is responsible for building the very institutions and structures that got japan to where it is today with a new prime minister shinzo abe who d already been through the annually revolving prime ministerial door in 2006 2007 this new government is going to fix whatever ails japan by spending even more money and by wrestling control over the printing press away from the bank of japan alas japan engaged in quantitative easing on a massive scale long before the term had been invented it has followed the most profligate keynesian stimulus policies for two decades well over half of its current budget is paid for with borrowed money the country is drowning in liquidity interest rates have been at zero or near zero for over a decade and by the end of this fiscal year gross national debt will hit 240 of gdp the highest in the world read morejapan s no exit strategy

some republican candidates are learning how to use pocketbook politics to trump the bipartisan establishment s don t mention the money narrative on migration our mayor and our governor are incentivizing illegal immigration new york rep nicole malliotakis told fox news on wednesday adding you have the mayor putting up people in fancy hotels upwards of 700 a night costing the taxpayers 300 million you have our governor providing free health care to illegal immigrants when you have senior citizens who are struggling to pay for their medicare you have payouts 2 billion in stimulus checks when you have a single mother who has three children earning 9 000 who got no stimulus check from the government then kathy hochul tells new yorkers she tells her taxpaying citizens if you don t like it move to florida that s how disgusting it has become under one party democrat rule at the city state and federal level the impact of drugs and migration has been hugely negative for ohioans senate gop nominee j d vance told fox on wednesday this is one of the things that really bothers me about tim ryan he says he stands for the working man but what about millions of illegal migrants coming across the border and competing with working people for their jobs what about the fact that ohio is the third leading state when it comes to opioid overdose deaths these guys say that we ve got to show compassion for illegal migrants and of course we do but let s show some compassion for our own citizens let s actually secure the border so that we don t have 100 000 americans dying of fentanyl overdoses we can t run away from the border issue because it s making our country poor numerous polls show that americans want to like immigrants and immigration but they also prioritize their fellow americans who lose jobs and wages to cheap labor migration that populist attitude is helping to bring more latino voters into the gop coalition despite the influence of pro migration gop donors these candidates focus on pocketbook damage of migration has slowly emerged because the establishment and its subordinate media have been hiding the economic damage behind an investor friendly pro migrant pro business narratives this establishment narrative insists that both legal and illegal migrants deserve the homes jobs careers and middle class status that would otherwise go to young better paid american families for example the gop aligned koch network joined with national immigration forum to tout a push poll on august 30 that supposedly shows that most americans want congress to begin working together this year on reforms that could help lower food prices by ensuring a legal reliable workforce for america s farmers and ranchers the skewed poll was quickly used to justify op eds in regional media outlets such as news5cleveland com the op ed tried to shame the vast majority of americans who do not want their friends and families to be shoved aside by corporate hiring of cheap foreign labor amid deep worries that ohio s foodbanks will run out of supplies this winter a top official last week said that the labor shortage among food workers is particularly acute and an irrational fear of immigrants isn t helping we re lacking is labor said the official ohio association of foodbanks executive director lisa hamler fugitt we d rather demonize the people who plant our food grow our food pick our food and bring our food to our grocery stores those are our migrant workers who do the work that most americans have clearly demonstrated they can t or won t do the democrat affiliated immigration hub posted a similarly skewed poll on august 24 voters reject the gop s extreme anti immigrant agenda continue to strongly support pro immigrant solutions including protecting our nation s dreamers farm workers tps holders and undocumented immigrants claimed sergio gonzalez the director of the hub group which is funded by laurene powell jobs who inherited the silicon valley fortune created by steve jobs and apple democrats need to pose as the noble champions of migrants victimized by hateful republicans according to the group s statement several aspects of their immigration record are deeply concerning to swing voters and should be highlighted republicans support separating immigrant families and putting children in cages 67 very serious concerns republicans are trying to deport law abiding immigrants who have lived in and contributed to the united states for many years 60 very serious concerns this statement shows how pro migration business groups and pro migration progressives are testing narratives to minimize public opposition to the mass migration that is shifting wealth and political power from ordinary americans critically the reports and polls produced by the bipartisan establishment almost never mention the money despite the public s deep solidarity with the economic concerns of other americans the establishment s pressure on americans to ignore the money was spotlighted this week by a donor funded trip by gop candidates to the border the script for the trip urged gop sympathy for migrants victimized by president joe biden s border and silence towards the economic worries of the voters victimized by the establishment s easy migration policies women and children who have been enticed into making the dangerous journey to our country are experiencing untold cruelty and suffering dickerson said in an exclusive statement to fox news digital ahead of the trip the women on this trip from all different backgrounds and from all across the country are linking arms to give these victims a voice and demand accountability she added democrats are also trying to create narratives that exclude americans concerns about money and jobs from their own immigration debate in april a democrat narrative creator described six deep narratives or value frameworks that we believe would help to activate a pro immigrant majority jeff chang continued those are interdependence belonging abundance dignity safety and the freedom to thrive and if we are able to move people on one or two into an adoption of all of those deep narratives then what we think we ll do is be able to get people to a worldview in which immigrants are welcomed we call that a narrative system a narrative system of six deep narratives that we want to activate long term in our narrative work chang runs the butterfly lab for immigrant narrative strategy at race forward a progressive group with deep ties to wealthy foundations the base for immigrant stories tends to be focused on community they care about caring said riki conrey the science director at harmony labs the group was also created by wealthy progressives including a co founder of buzzfeed to help manipulate americans media networks she continued we tested like 18 different pieces of creative from like eight different creators from the advocacy stuff to the artist stuff and virtually everything worked to activate the base we found that some things worked outside the base and those things tended to feature things like freedom striving and responsibility said conrey we tested a positive narrative around refugees it worked for our core audiences but it didn t motivate the stretch audiences the folks on the edges what they needed to hear was actually a story of pain of people sacrificing their lives for the u s chang said the fundamental thing that we need to move people toward is a belief that not only does america have a future that we can have a really great future that involves change and innovation diversity tolerance and all of the things that are fundamentally small p progressive said conrey this wealthy investors determined denial of economics in politics also controls chang s understanding of the issue for example he described the immigration issue as a culture war when venting his frustration at americans refusal to put migrants and investors first what we know definitively is that a large part of the culture wars has been organized around anti immigrant narratives and that we have especially in the last decade been very much losing the battle around immigration reform around systematic change in immigration because of anti immigrant narratives but economics is central to the politics of immigration as shown by the pro american economic narratives pushed by malliotakis and vance extraction migration it is easier for government officials to grow the economy by immigration than by growing exports productivity or the birth rate so washington dc deliberately extracts millions of migrants from poor countries and uses them as extra workers consumers and renters this extraction migration policy both grows and skews the national economy it prevents tight labor markets and so it shifts vast wealth from ordinary people to investors billionaires and wall street it makes it difficult for ordinary americans to advance in their careers get married raise families or buy homes extraction migration slows innovation and shrinks americans productivity partly because it allows employers to boost stock prices by using stoop labor and disposable workers instead of the american professionals and productivity boosting technology that would allow americans and their communities to earn more money this migration policy also reduces exports by minimizing shareholder pressure on u s companies to build up beneficial and complementary trade with people in poor countries migration undermines employees workplace rights and it widens the regional economic gaps between the democrats cheap labor coastal states and the republicans heartland and southern states an economy fueled by extraction migration also drains americans political clout over elites alienates young people and radicalizes americans democratic civic culture because it gives an excuse for wealthy elites and progressives to ignore despairing americans at the bottom of society such as drug addicts this economic strategy is enthusiastically pushed by progressives who wish to transform the u s from a society governed by european origin civic culture into an economic empire of jealous identity groups overseen by progressive hall monitors we re trying to become the first multiracial multi ethnic superpower in the world rep rohit khanna d ca told the new york times in march 2022 it will be an extraordinary achievement we will ultimately triumph he boasted but the progressives colonialism like economic strategy kills many migrants it exploits the poverty of migrants and splits foreign families as it extracts human resources from poor home countries to serve wealthy u s investors progressives hide this extraction migration economic policy behind a wide variety of noble sounding narratives and theatrical border security programs progressives claim the u s is a nation of immigrants that migration helps migrants and that the state must renew itself by replacing populations similarly establishment republicans media businesses and major gop donors hide the skew towards investors by ignoring the pocketbook impact and by touting border chaos welfare spending migrant crime and drug smuggling many polls show the public wants to welcome some immigration but the polls also show deep and broad public opposition to labor migration and the inflow of temporary contract workers into jobs needed by young u s graduates this third rail opposition is growing anti establishment multiracial cross sex non racist class based bipartisan rational persistent and recognizes the solidarity that american citizens owe to one another

4 15pm june lows are in play says comerica nyse cma wealth cio the dow closed thursday up 146 points 0 5 at 31 656 while the nasdaq composite lost 31 points 0 3 to 11 785 and the s p 500 added 12 points 0 3 to 3 967 the benchmarks all appeared on pace for their fifth straight day of losses but gradually climbed in afternoon trading the question going forward is whether markets in september will get as low as they did in june according to john lynch chief investment officer at comerica wealth management the june lows are in play in the coming weeks as equity investors finally recognize the intensity of the fed s mission lynch said as reported by cnbc inflation and recession are typically accompanied by lower market multiples and markets need to reassess valuation as interest rates rise the federal reserve both in the form of chairman jerome powell and regional presidents appears very likely to continue to raise interest rates aggressively that continues to hold the attention of investors 12 05pm us indices still running red the major us indices continued in red territory at the noon bell despite the latest numbers from the us ism manufacturing survey pointing to an easing of price pressures in factories at midday the dow jones industrial average was down 0 6 to 31 346 the s p 500 was down by 1 at 3 912 while the nasdaq composite was down by 2 8 at 11 559 us manufacturing activity growth held up in august after slowing in the previous two months thanks to higher new orders and employment but it remains at the lowest rate in more than two years this is amid lingering supply constraints and slowing global growth data from the institute for supply management ism showed ian shepherdson chief economist at pantheon macroeconomics said the ism manufacturing index was unchanged at 52 8 above the consensus of 51 9 this is a pleasant surprise showing yet again that the regional fed and pmi surveys are not always a reliable guide to the national picture the details are good too new orders rose 3 3 points to 51 3 a three month high and employment jumped 4 3 points to 54 2 a five month high shepherdson said in a statement he noted that production dipped lagging prior declines in orders we expect a modest rebound in the headline index over the next few months given the uptick in china s caixin pmi which tends to lead the ism by about three months the ism has weakened less than the caixin appeared to imply because the latter was hit hard by china s lockdowns in the spring so the ism will see a smaller rebound too he said shepherdson said the manufacturing index is much more likely to rise than decline further into the early fall we aren t bothered by the reported uptick in the order backlog the index is not seasonally adjusted and it almost always rises in august the 1 7 point increase is smaller thank usual and the supply measures in the survey continue to point to intense downward pressure on margins and hence their contribution to core inflation shepherdson said at midday the major movers included it services company dxc technology up 4 while health companies merck and johnson and johnson were up 2 and 1 8 respectively on the

35am wall street losses continue us stocks opened lower as investors eye the release of the august jobs report on friday amid continued inflation fears just after the open the dow jones industrial average had slipped 118 points or 0 4 at 31 393 points the s p 500 was down 21 points or 0 5 at 3 934 points and the nasdaq composite had shed 115 points or 1 at 11 701 points nvidia corporation nasdaq nvda fell about 5 as new us rules limit the sale of artificial intelligence chips to china representing a potential loss of about 400 million in sales the company said bed bath beyond inc stock continued to fall down another 3 after the company announced store closures layoffs and a share sale earlier this week as investors await the release of august s non farm payroll report on friday initial jobless claims for the week ended august 27 decreased by 5 000 to 232 000 far below the consensus analyst expectation of 248 000 pantheon macroeconomics chief economist ian shepherdson said so much for the layoffs are taking off story he noted that this was the third straight decline pushing the four week average to 241 500 the lowest in seven weeks the narrative that claims are rising strongly took root in july and continues to defy the evidence he said claims remain extremely low by historical standards which makes perfect sense given that job openings remain near record levels if you re still determined to find a us recession you re going to have to look somewhere else 6 30am non farm payrolls report due friday us stocks were expected to open lower on thursday as investors ponder how far the federal reserve will go in its fight against inflation ahead of the august jobs report expected on friday futures for the dow jones industrial average were trading 0 6 lower pre market while those for the broader s p 500 index were down 0 7 and futures for the tech laden nasdaq 100 lost 1 1 on wednesday the adp private sector jobs report for august showed payrolls grew by just 132 000 lower than the 268 000 jobs added in july and below the 300 000 increase that analysts were expecting for the month swissquote bank senior analyst ipek ozkardeskaya said investors were not pleased with wednesday s softer than expected private jobs data and showed their displeasure by sending all three major indices lower on the last trading day of august good news is bad news as good economic data supports the idea that the us economy could withstand an aggressive monetary policy tightening but bad news is also bad news as the federal reserve is so determined to bring inflation down it is ready to accept a certain slowdown in the economy and the jobs market she added growth in the us jobs market has remained strong despite the series of rate hikes by the fed this year but if friday s more closely watched non farm payroll data show a similar slowdown in the us jobs market ozkardeskaya said that would be more in line with the actual tightening macroeconomic conditions this is something that the fed ultimately wants to achieve because a cooler jobs market should also lead to cooler inflation she added analysts are expecting the bureau of labor statistics to report an increase of 318 000 jobs for august on friday after employers added 528 000 jobs in july ahead of that the latest weekly us initial jobless claims numbers will draw some attention today meanwhile the federal open market committee will meet later this month when it is expected to raise interest rates by 75 basis points matching the moves it made in june and july to bring down a us inflation rate running at 40 year highs in energy markets growing fears of a global recession and prospects of lower demand sent the wti crude oil futures 2 3 lower at 87 53 a barrel and the brent

there are two candidates on the nov 8 ballot for a four year term as state treasurer republican cudahy city council member cpa and economist jack guerrero is challenging democratic incumbent cpa fiona ma here are guerrero s answers to an 11 question survey that the san diego union tribune editorial board emailed candidates q why do you want this job a california s financial crisis is the consequence of severe mismanagement and poor leadership by reckless politicians our credit rating ranks near the bottom with only six states in a worse predicament including illinois which is just about to fall apart for the same trajectory of mismanagement now afflicting california our reliance on debt is greater than ever with higher interest payments both in absolute dollars and as share of the state s budget our debt to gdp ratio now approximates the levels experienced by peripheral eurozone countries which just 10 years ago faced austerity measures and near collapse unfunded pension liabilities now exceed a staggering 1 trillion presenting the single greatest threat to the long term financial stability of the state our business climate is the worst in the country with excessive taxation crippling fees and burdensome regulations destroying jobs and livelihoods and contributing to unprecedented levels of migration from california to more favorable states the list goes on advertisement as mayor and council member of cudahy a working class community where nearly one third of my constituents live in poverty i have observed firsthand the pernicious effects of failed policies by state government like most of my hard working residents i have had enough i believe the time has come for an independent watchdog free from the single party political apparatus of sacramento to serve as a check and balance on a state government run amok i feel called in this moment to step forward as the candidate of the people to restore public trust and to advocate for policies that place citizens first opinion from our opinion team 2022 general election guide between now and early october when voting gets underway the san diego union tribune editorial board is planning to publish dozens of candidate q as and nearly two dozen commentaries connected to a handful of san diego city ballot measures and seven state propositions on the nov 8 election keep checking back as we fill in this voter guide q what in your background makes you a good fit for this job a i bring to the table a unique combination of government experience and private sector leadership at the highest levels of corporate organizations in the public sector i have served constituents in southeast los angeles county as mayor and council member and as a board member to numerous public interest organizations i became involved in local politics in 2013 following a high profile corruption scandal in my city as a new mayor and government reformer i exposed internal control deficiencies in my city and worked with the california controller to identify millions of dollars in wasteful and unlawful spending in a rare display of bipartisan approbation my efforts were recognized by both the democratic state controller and the los angeles times spanish language newspaper la opinión has referred to me as a fierce vigilante against political corruption and as a rare case of a republican with support from constituents in a completely democratic area in the private sector i am a certified public accountant with 20 plus years of diversified financial experience in audit financial planning and analysis mergers and acquisitions corporate treasury tax investor relations and corporate development with fortune 500 companies and professional services firms in los angeles san francisco new york london and zurich in my early career i also audited municipalities and agencies of the federal government i am a graduate of stanford university with a bachelor s degree in quantitative economics and harvard business school with a master s degree in business administration i also studied economics and philosophy at oxford university and have lectured in statistics and economics at the university level q what are your top priorities for the next four years a my principal priorities for the next four years include transformation of the treasurer s office into a source of truthful reporting in financial matters and into a reliably objective and independent check and balance on a legislature run amok specifically i wish to serve as taxpayer advocate during all government proceedings affecting california s budget debt and investment decisions to this end i expect to regularly testify as taxpayer advocate before senate and assembly committees to educate legislators about the economic consequences of their actions for investment decisions within the purview of the treasurer s office i expect to fulfill my fiduciary responsibility to maximize return and minimize risk for state taxpayers and for local municipalities participating in the local agency investment fund sadly for california taxpayers and stakeholders returns on investments have languished amid politically correct woke philosophies that do not closely align with economic objectives where economically compelling and where consistent with maximization strategies for return i also expect to promote investments in california companies that hire and invest in california workers finally as a board member with the public pension funds i will advocate for substantial and long overdue pension reform across the board rooted in truth about the state s impending tsunami and motivated by a desire to create a sustainable retirement program for future generations q what will guide you overall investment philosophy and what concerns other than economic would cause you to divest from any assets or refrain from making investments at all should california be investing in funds based in states with laws that california s political leaders object to a investment policies should conform with the fiduciary responsibility to maximize return and minimize risk regrettably the unrealistically achievable discount rate 7 percent to 7 5 percent used by the pension fund boards and by fuzzy math politicians across the state creates perverse incentives for the funds to invest in risky assets for example a greater share of investments for the california public employees retirement system calpers and the california state teachers retirement system calstrs is now directed to private equity funds which are not securities and exchange commission sec registrants and which do not subscribe to the same standards for financial transparency similarly the funds are also investing in foreign companies which operate in turbulent markets with unstable governments investment policies should focus on maximizing return demanding financial transparency across the board and upholding the highest accounting and disclosure standards for target companies and investments as a certified public accountant i actually read published financial statements and sec forms 10 k and 10 q for all my personal investments because these are informative reports replete with audit opinions about the reliability of the data with respect to divestiture strategy i believe the state should divest from companies that operate in turbulent markets particularly those with unstable government regimes and those companies that follow less than transparent financial reporting many russian companies for example operate with limited disclosures or unreliable accounting standards in any case the decision to divest or invest in any sector or geography should be based on return on investment risk assessment and economic analysis pursuant to the fiduciary responsibility to taxpayers and constituents q the state s two massive pension funds the california public employees retirement system calpers and the california state teachers retirement system calstrs report they are about 72 percent and 73 percent funded what if anything should be changed about the assumptions and or investment strategy of these two funds what do you say to the pensioners of either fund who might be worried about their payments a the state s unfunded pension liability presents the single greatest threat to the long term fiscal stability of the state according to stanford university economists the unfunded pension liability for combined pension funds calpers calstrs and university of california now stands at a staggering 1 trillion this is the difference between the present value of the future stream of obligations and the current value of the assets for comparison the size of california s annual budget is about 300 billion which means we could not shut down government for several years and tax you several times over to recover from this gap as a former pension auditor and university lecturer in statistics i can confirm with mathematical certainty that the system in its current form will fail the solution begins with telling the truth and then coming together as stakeholders to reform the plan for future and existing employees specifically i support the immediate migration of discount rates to more closely align with the risk free rate of return the effect of this strategy is the recalibration of the unfunded pension liability and automatic triggers to local agency participants to contribute more substantially to the pension funds although the treasurer does not have specific authority to change local agency pension programs i support a three tiered plan across the state to migrate all new employees to defined contribution plans to renegotiate unearned and not yet accrued deferred compensation for existing employees and to respect promises for existing retirees to the extent economically feasible q how do you feel about the state bank concept some economists think it is great some think it is oversold and leads to crony capitalism can it work in california a i oppose most government attempts to replicate private sector programs because government has the tendency to operate these programs at greater cost and lower return while crowding out private investments in the same sector which almost universally operate more efficiently when i was a young auditor i examined the financial statements of a precariously run government backed financial services nonprofit ostensibly created to extend credit in troubled communities the cold reality of its pricing structure was that it was so out of sync with its credit risk that it led to bailouts by the government agency and greater demands for support from the taxpayer i fear that a similar program at the state level perhaps one more directly managed by government bureaucrats who pay no price for poorly managed decisions would lead to taxpayer subsidization on a recurring basis a better strategy would be to create helpful business environments for private sector entities to succeed particularly in communities that can most directly benefit from their services q are you satisfied with the amount of money state government returns to taxpayers under the gann limit which limits the state s spending each year if so why if not what would you do about it a i would start enforcing the gann limit also known as the state appropriations limit in form and substance across the board to restrict the growth of government spending and to require excess revenue be returned to the taxpayer unfortunately sneaky politicians find ways to exploit loopholes in the law and circumvent these restrictions with the consequence of growing government well in excess of population growth during every year of the current administration this failed strategy displaces private investment overburdens our people with crippling taxation and slows the pace of economic growth as mayor and council member i have consistently advocated for limits on the expansionary direction of my local government and i would bring the same discipline to sacramento q what can and will you do as treasurer to address the state s housing crisis a the state treasurer serves as chair of various committees that invest in private public partnerships and extend tax credits and financing options for key development projects of public interest within the budgetary parameters extended to these committees i would work to manage these programs efficiently and effectively across geographies with a view towards improving housing stock and development but more fundamentally i would advocate for state policies that lower taxes pay down debt reduce the size of government curtail abuse of the california environmental quality act ceqa and create better business climate for all sectors a healthy and thriving private sector means greater employment opportunities rising wages and improved quality of life across the board q what can and will you do as treasurer to address the climate emergency a my investment philosophy focuses on the treasurer s fiduciary responsibility to maximize return minimize risk and demand financial transparency across the board while upholding the highest accounting and disclosure standards for target companies and investments having committed to these parameters there is still substantial flexibility about where to direct the state s investments including housing and construction related sectors as well as renewable energy investments throughout the state q what is your position on proposition 1 which would establish the rights for californians to an abortion and to contraceptives in the state constitution a as a roman catholic who believes in the dignity of human life at all stages from conception to natural death i oppose the radical agenda of proposition 1 which would legalize taxpayer funded abortion on demand to the moment of birth for any reason or no reason at all this would become the most extreme the most permissive and the most expensive pro abortion law in the entire country the goals of the initiative are simply out of touch with ordinary californians most of whom reject the late term procedure altogether for me the question of when life begins is not an issue of theology or philosophy my catholic faith informs my conviction that killing innocent children is morally reprehensible but elementary biology informs my academic understanding that life begins at the moment of fertilization when dna is firmly established and irrevocable from that point forward within weeks the earliest formation of the heart begins brain signals can be detected the embryo begins to spontaneously move and the diaphragm muscle is completely formed these are some examples of the evidence for life at the earliest stages of pregnancy and as science and technology evolve we can detect the evidence for life and its viability earlier and earlier against this scientific backdrop it is truly horrific for any society to believe that the systematic and premeditated killing of children in the womb to the moment of birth is ever agreeable i oppose proposition 1 and pray for an end to abortion and to the conditions that victimize women into these decisions q why should voters elect you over your opponent a when my parents immigrated to the united states from mexico in the 1970s there was no better place to begin their new life than california i believe our beautiful state has the ability and capacity to become great once again but it will require a new direction rooted in truth fiscal discipline and economic growth for all sectors and geographies i am proud of my record as a public servant and government reformer in promoting economic growth and development exposing government corruption at every instance and conducting myself with the highest standards of character and integrity consistent with the family values inculcated by my immigrant parents as an elected official i write my own ordinances and resolutions and have never once accepted campaign contributions for city council from any vendors or contractors that conduct business with my city i want to bring the same discipline to sacramento and believe my broad government and private sector experience in finance and economics with some of the largest corporate organizations in the world position me uniquely to bring fresh leadership to the treasurer s office
from a bearish perspective there s a fair probability that the crypto market entered a descending channel or wedge on aug 15 after it failed to break above the 1 2 trillion total market capitalization resistance even if the pattern isn t yet clearly distinguishable the last couple of weeks have not been positive total crypto market cap usd billion source tradingview for example the 940 billion total market cap seen on aug 29 was the lowest in 43 days the worsening conditions have been accompanied by a steep correction in traditional markets and the tech heavy nasdaq composite index has declined by 12 since aug 15 and even wti oil prices plummeted 11 from aug 29 to sept 1 investors sought shelter in the dollar and united states treasuries after federal reserve chair jerome powell reiterated the bank s commitment to contain inflation by tightening the economy as a result investors took profits on riskier assets causing the u s dollar index dxy to reach its highest level in over two decades at 109 6 on sept 1 the index measures the dollar s strength against a basket of top foreign currencies more importantly the regulatory newsflow remains largely unfavorable especially after u s federal prosecutors requested internal records from binance crypto exchange to look deeper into possible money laundering and recruitment of u s customers since late 2020 authorities have been investigating whether binance violated the bank secrecy act according to reuters crypto investor sentiment re enters the bearish zone the risk off attitude caused by federal reserve tightening led

tokens performed negatively but retail demand in china slightly improved the okx tether usdt premium is a good gauge of china based retail crypto trader demand it measures the difference between china

curiously the move happened while the crypto total market cap dropped 18 5 since aug 15 data shows there hasn t been panic selling from retail traders as the index remains relatively neutral traders must also analyze futures markets to exclude externalities specific to the tether instrument perpetual contracts also known as inverse swaps have an embedded rate usually charged every eight hours exchanges use this fee to avoid exchange risk imbalances a positive funding rate indicates that longs buyers demand more leverage however the opposite situation occurs when shorts sellers require additional leverage causing the funding rate to turn negative accumulated perpetual futures funding rate on sept 1 source coinglass perpetual contracts reflected a moderately bearish sentiment as the accumulated funding rate was negative in every instance the current fees resulted from an unstable situation with higher demand from leverage shorts and those betting on a price decrease still even the 0 70 negative weekly funding rate for ethereum classic etc was not enough to discourage short sellers negative regulatory and macroeconomic pin down sentiment the negative 6 9 weekly performance should be investors least worry right now because regulators have been targeting major crypto exchanges for example they claim that altcoins should have been registered as securities and that the sector has been used to facilitate money laundering moreover the weak sentiment metrics and imbalanced leverage data signal investors are worried about the impacts of a global recession even though tether data in asian markets shows no signs of retail panic selling there is no evidence of traders having a bullish appetite because the total crypto market cap approached its lowest level in 45 days thus bears have reason to believe that the current descending formation will continue in the upcoming weeks the views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily

u s strategic petroleum reserve hits lowest level since 1985 the u s strategic petroleum reserve spr hit historic lows this week as president joe biden continues to order a record release of barrels from the emergency stockpile the spr now sits at around 453 million barrels the lowest level in 37 years for perspective the u s energy information administration estimates that in 2021 the united states consumed an average of about 19 78 million barrels of petroleum per day if oil and gas production were to halt completely today s spr would have just enough supply to fuel the united states for 22 days by repeatedly tapping into the spr the biden administration is attempting to use the stockpile as a tool to bring down gas prices and tamper historic inflation u s department of energy secretary jennifer granholm recently emphasized this point the release of a million barrels per day is the biggest tool at our disposal however the spr was created to deal with supply emergencies and to be used as a safety net when hurricanes and other natural disasters hit not as an instrument to manipulate the market for short term relief at the gas pump evidence proves the temporary nature of this fix national gas prices hit historic highs this summer even though president biden first began releasing barrels from the emergency stockpile in late 2021 and has only increased their removal since predicting this flux the eia s stephen nally testified during a senate energy and natural resources hearing last year that any release from the spr would only provide temporary and short lived impacts based on past analysis it would provide temporary relief there are limits to what can be released in a short term situation in reality and despite what sec granholm may say there are many other tools at the administration s disposal that don t rely on siphoning off our strategic reserves a better solution would be to embrace america s role as a leader in natural gas and oil by ramping up domestic energy production and improving pipeline infrastructure to make energy more affordable and readily available however the biden administration has continuously taken actions to discourage domestic production including banning federal leasing for new development canceling domestic pipelines taxing natural gas and promoting a regulatory environment that hampers investment in future oil and natural gas projects unfortunately short term solutions like releasing barrels from the spr are par for the course for the current administration in recent weeks alone sec granholm sent letters to new england governors urging them to improve preparedness of oil reserves ahead of the coming winter and penned similar pleas to major oil companies asking them to hold onto their stocks to help offset future energy shortages from draining the spr to record lows to writing letters that pass the buck to begging opec to increase their production and traveling to saudi arabia for fist bump diplomacy it s clear that the biden administration is bent on enacting duct tape solutions rather than taking any meaningful action to lower american s pain at the pump bottom line as our country heads into hurricane season and winter months the biden administration continues to drain our emergency supplies rather than increase domestic energy production in a responsible and meaningful way releasing barrels from the strategic petroleum reserve to meet global energy demands is not a long term strategy but an unserious fix to a serious problem energy central

that panic underscores how life in china s megacities of which there are 17 with populations of 10 million people or more has taken a drastic turn this year with the arrival of more transmissible variants although infections are far lower than in many other countries officials follow a playbook of early and strict lockdowns to cut off transmission chains despite the growing economic costs president xi jinping has doubled down on the approach saying that the lives saved by his covid zero policy is worth the disruption there is additional pressure to tame flare ups in the run up to the chinese communist party congress next month when mr xi is expected to secure a precedent breaking third term as leader chengdu has found more than 900 cases in 10 days and other cities have locked down over just one infection shanghai the country s main financial hub had originally planned eight days of mass testing but as infections piled up the lockdown stretched out cutting down tim a freelancer and his wife spent the afternoon ordering from multiple online apps to secure enough food rather than fight the crowds in person they also decided to cut down on portion sizes so the ingredients they had could last longer while i m not too worried it will escalate to what happened in shanghai i don t see it coming under control within the short term either he said advertisement the capital of sichuan province is the fourth chinese megacity to be locked down this year compared with just two in all of 2021 and none in 2020 after the wuhan crisis died down chengdu is the biggest city since shanghai to be locked down and its plight has drawn nationwide attention with the topic getting nearly 500 million views as of 4pm on thursday on china s twitter like weibo platform many expressed resignation as recurrent lockdowns continuous testing and stringent contact tracing become entrenched in everyday chinese lives it s so hard i m lying flat and going to sleep now said roxie huang using a popular term that refers to the ennui faced by young people who responded to a sense of powerlessness with indifference a lot of the behaviour in the pandemic era doesn t really have a rational cause huang said it s hopeless the run up to chengdu s snap lockdown announcement had eerie similarities to what happened in shanghai in both cities people were arrested by the authorities for inciting panic by spreading rumours about impending restrictions only for officials to take those very steps just a few days later nevertheless chengdu is a less economically important city than shanghai it accounts for 1 7 per cent of the country s gross domestic production compared with shanghai s 3 8 per cent while home to technology companies and automakers including toyota motor and vw china chengdu is located in the less developed and wealthy western region we don t expect a shanghai style setback wrote david qu a china economist at bloomberg economics we do expect a widespread impact on sentiment that amplifies the damage beyond the direct hit to activity advertisement that said there ares now even bigger downside risks to the third quarter growth forecast of 4 5 per cent he wrote for chengdu residents uncertainty reigns while shanghai is the worst case scenario other megacities like the southern technology hub of shenzhen emerged from their lockdowns in just a week it s completely a mess now the earliest rumour was the lockdown is going to be three days and nobody actually believed that said mr hu who fled to his suburban house and what i now hear now is that it will be 10 days but who knows he said adding wherever the virus lands the ground will burn bloomberg
workers at the penn square apple store in oklahoma city have filed with the national labor relations board to hold a union election becoming the third us location to have done so according to a press release over 70 percent of the store s salespeople genius admins technicians creatives and operations specialists have signed cards to say they re interested in being represented by the communications workers of america cwa the nlrb s bar for a sufficient showing of interest for an election is 30 percent of workers signing union cards the filing was reported previously by bloomberg and the outlet writes that michael forsythe an employee and organizer at the oklahoma city store said workers are looking for more transparency and input on issues like safety scheduling and pay related apple retail workers vote to unionize a store in maryland there has been one successful union drive at apple s us retail stores in june workers at apple s towson town center store in maryland voted to unionize campaigns at other stores such as one in new york city which also hopes to organize with the cwa and another in louisville kentucky haven t gotten to the point of holding an election there was an election scheduled in atlanta but the cwa called it off saying it would be impossible to hold a fair election thanks to apple s repeated violations of the national labor relations act earlier this year apple s vice president of people and retail deirdre o brien tried to convince employees not to unionize saying that doing so would put another organization in the middle of our relationship one that does not have a deep understanding of apple or our business organizers in maryland were largely employees of the apple store though the union did work with the international association of machinists and aerospace workers the company has also been accused of union busting via captive audience meetings and by not allowing employees to post union flyers apple also addressed a major complaint from some workers money in may the company bumped up the starting hourly wages at its retail stores from 20 to 22 given apple s apparent efforts against unionization and the lack of elections or other public union activities it was easy to assume that the campaign to unionize the company s retail locations had deflated however experts have told the verge that fast moving campaigns like the one to organize starbucks aren t the norm and that it can take years or organize a location in other words it wasn t out of the ordinary that there wasn t news coming out of new york or atlanta every day organizers at towson town center also mentioned that they ve been hearing from people at other stores who were quietly trying to organize their own campaigns the campaign in oklahoma city reinforces the idea that union campaigns haven t gone away at apple now that the petition is filed the nlrb will have to certify that there s been a sufficient showing of interest if it determines there is apple and organizers can come to an agreement on how to hold the election which happened in atlanta or the nlrb can hold a hearing and issue a decision on how the election will take place

our goal here at credible operations inc nmls number 1681276 referred to as credible below is to give you the tools and confidence you need to improve your finances although we do promote products from our partner lenders all opinions are our own some reasons for a cash out refinance are better than others learn when a cash out refinance makes sense and when it doesn t istock if you need money using the equity you have built up in your home to get a cash out refinance can be a cost effective way to get funds despite recent increases mortgage refinance rates are still generally lower than rates for many other types of credit including credit cards and personal loans but a cash out refinance also comes with closing costs and risks so you should be sure the benefits of borrowing this way outweigh the potential downsides let s look at how cash out refinancing works when it makes sense and when it might not credible makes it easy to find a cash out refinance rate that works for you by allowing you to compare mortgage refinance rates from top lenders in minutes how cash out refinancing works a cash out refinance replaces your current mortgage with a new larger mortgage the difference between the two amounts goes to you as cash back at closing which you can then use for anything you want as long as you have equity in your home you may be eligible for a cash out refinance lenders base your eligibility on several factors your credit score the higher your credit score the lower your interest rate on your cash out refi your home appraisal value some lenders require an on site appraisal of your home s interior and exterior while others require only a drive by loan to value ltv ratio this is the outstanding principal balance of the current mortgage versus the current appraised value of your home the age of your mortgage some lenders only allow you to apply for a cash out refi if your mortgage is at least 12 months old comparing mortgage rates from multiple lenders can help ensure you find the best rate available to you with credible you can easily compare cash out refinance rates from multiple lenders without affecting your credit how much cash can you take out of your home multiple factors affect how much you can take out of your home with a cash out refinance with a conventional cash out refinance you can borrow up to 80 of the value of your home this is referred to as loan to value ratio or ltv keep in mind that the percentage required often depends on the lender and whether you re willing or required to pay for private mortgage insurance pmi on the new loan before determining the maximum amount you can cash out you must subtract the balance owed on your current mortgage here s an example home value 550 000 maximum withdrawal 80 440 000 550 000 x 0 80 current mortgage balance 300 000 maximum cash out amount 140 000 440 000 300 000 the requirements for va and fha cash out refinances are somewhat different va loans a va cash out refinance lets you borrow up to 100 of your home s value although some lenders limit the ltv to 90 available to active duty service members national guard and reserve members veterans and many surviving spouses these loans often charge fees unless you have a disability from a service related accident fha loans an fha cash out refinance comes with an annual mortgage insurance fee and other upfront fees and you can only borrow up to 80 of your home s ltv you may also need a credit score of at least 600 to qualify what is private mortgage insurance and how does it work 7 ways to use your cash out refinance it makes sense to use a cash out refinance for many things but some purposes come with higher costs and risks than others so you should consider the pros and cons carefully 1 financing home improvement projects makes sense if the home improvement will increase your home s value financing home improvement or remodeling projects can add value to your home so it may make sense to use a cash out refinance to fund the project for example a minor kitchen remodel costs an average of 28 279 and recoups more than 71 of the investment at resale according to remodeling magazine s 2022 cost vs value report you could use a personal loan to pay for the project but personal loan rates are typically much higher than mortgage rates however renovation projects can be expensive so make sure you can afford the payments 2 paying off credit card debt makes sense if you can realize interest savings and manage the new payments credit card debt is unsecured meaning if you default on your payments you won t lose your home however when using a cash out refi to pay off your credit cards you roll the debt into your home if you default your home is at risk mortgage interest rates are typically much lower than credit card rates so using a cash out refinance could significantly reduce the total interest you ll pay on the debt just be sure you can manage the monthly mortgage payment and that the savings are worth the added risk to your home how does debt consolidation work 3 paying down student loans makes sense if you have private student loans at very high interest rates because federal student loans generally have lower interest flexible repayment terms and provide access to loan forgiveness programs it s rarely a good idea to use a cash out refinance to pay them off but if you have high interest private student loans or private student loans with unmanageable monthly payment amounts a cash out refinance can be a way to reduce costs and get a lower payment keep in mind though that if you use a 30 year cash out refinance to pay off a 10 year student loan you could end up paying more in interest in the long run and as with paying off credit card debt using a cash out refinance to pay off student loan debt turns that unsecured debt into one secured by your home 4 paying for a child s college education makes sense if you ve fully tapped federal student loans have plenty of equity and can manage the monthly payment with the rising cost of college not many people have the total cost to attend set aside for their children a cash out refi that uses your home s equity can be a way to fund an education without taking out multiple student loans but keep in mind you ll need to have sufficient equity in a 2021 report by collegeboard the average cost to attend an in state four year public university was 27 330 out of state tuition for a four year public university was 44 150 on average if you don t have that kind of equity in your home you may not qualify for a cash out refi how to decide which student loans to pay off first 5 paying for investments not recommended for most homeowners making an investment whether the stock market real estate or cryptocurrency can turn the cash you get from a cash out refi into more money in the long run but keep in mind that this isn t recommended for most people since investing is already a complex and risky prospect proceed with caution if you re going to do this 6 buying an investment property makes sense if you have ample equity in your home and can recoup your costs through income from the investment property investment properties tend to increase in value over time and they offer the potential for income they also offer tax advantages like possibly deducting mortgage interest property insurance and property management fees but investing in property can be expensive and there s still a financial risk 7 covering emergency expenses not recommended in most cases many americans have little or no emergency funds because a cash out refinance involves a closing process that s much like the one you went through when you bought your home refinancing may not get you the cash you need quickly enough a personal loan may be a better option to cover emergencies since many online lenders can fund loans in a few days after approval some even promise next day funding some emergencies like a trip to the emergency room may be covered or partially covered by insurance or the provider may have an optional payment plan available and charge little or no interest you can also try negotiating any steep medical bills to help bring the cost down how do i build an emergency fund other ways to tap your home equity in addition to a cash out refinance you have other options for tapping your home equity home equity loan best for getting the cash you need without affecting your current mortgage like a cash out refinance a home equity loan lets you borrow against your home s equity however instead of replacing your current mortgage a home equity loan is a second mortgage you borrow the cash you need and your current mortgage remains untouched closing costs for a home equity loan can be lower because you re borrowing less than you might with a cash out refinance and you won t lose ground on your first mortgage home equity line of credit heloc best for only borrowing what you need a home equity line of credit is a lot like a credit card you only borrow what you need and you only pay interest on the amount you borrow instead of borrowing a large amount all at once you can borrow smaller amounts when needed as long as you do so during the loan s draw period when the draw period ends you ll repay only what you borrowed along with interest interest rates vary but may be lower than with a home equity loan reverse mortgage best for people over the age of 62 if you need money to cover healthcare expenses pay off your mortgage or add to your income you might consider a reverse mortgage a type of loan secured by your home it allows you to keep your home but convert part of the equity into cash however if you can t keep up with basic home maintenance property taxes or insurance your lender can call for your loan to be due and payable in full limited cash out refinance best for homeowners who only need up to 2 000 a limited cash out refinance replaces your existing mortgage with a new one but unlike a traditional cash out refinance the cash you receive from a limited cash out refi doesn t come from the equity in your home instead

refunding bonds that will save the state s general fund 5 2 billion over the next 20 years we created new jobs by funding innovative projects from green energy to transportation approved a record number of affordable housing units invested hundreds of millions of dollars to combat our homelessness crisis and helped tens of thousands of californians save for college retirement and a better quality of life but we still face immense challenges both old and new the covid 19 pandemic has underscored just how many californians are forced to work low paying jobs that do not provide adequate wages or health care are living only a paycheck away from eviction or foreclosure and are struggling to save for their futures as treasurer i will continue to invest california s money in a socially and financially responsible manner i will continue to prioritize funding for health care housing jobs the environment and our schools while making it easier for californians to afford college and retirement opinion from our opinion team 2022 general election guide between now and early october when voting gets underway the san diego union tribune editorial board is planning to publish dozens of candidate q as and nearly two dozen commentaries connected to a handful of san diego city ballot measures and seven state propositions on the nov 8 election keep checking back as we fill in this voter guide q what in your background makes you a good fit for this job a i ve served the last three and a half years as state treasurer and formerly as chair of the board of equalization speaker pro tempore of the california state assembly and as a san francisco supervisor as a certified public accountant with a bachelor s degree in accounting a master s degree in taxation and an mba i have the financial knowledge and experience to ensure california remains an economic leader and powerhouse investing in the people and small businesses that are the foundation of our success q what are your top priorities for the next four years a housing i have prioritized housing in my office to make processes more efficient and cost effective for the past three years i have personally chaired the california debt limit allocation committee cdlac or bond committee and california tax credit allocation committee ctcac to ensure we continue to meet including during the pandemic reform our regulations and align definitions and timelines between the two agencies the ctcac and cdlac subsidize the building and rehabilitation of affordable housing i also sell the bonds that fund the calvet farm and home loan program my office successfully sold the three tranches totaling 2 billion for the no place like home bonds i also am a voting member of the california housing finance authority which has a number of programs under our purview and my office embarked on our first student housing project at santa rosa community college district and hope to build more student faculty housing at other community college sites we also recently delivered a report from california forward regarding the california dream for all shared appreciation loan revolving fund that will help provide gap funding for those first time home buyers who need a little help making their down payment in the 2022 2023 budget the governor and legislature allocated 500 million to help more residents buy their first homes and start to build equity as a result of this study i will continue to keep california competitive by proactively engaging with businesses both large and small stakeholders community leaders and others to match them up with grant loan and bond opportunities in the state through my three savings programs i will actively encourage more californians to save for higher education retirement and a better quality of life q what will guide your overall investment philosophy and what concerns other than economic would cause you to divest from any assets or refrain from making investments at all a i believe climate change is real and we have a responsibility to take action today so our kids and grandkids will have clean water to drink and fresh air to breathe and live without fear of losing all their possessions in the next wildfire for three years i was the only california state teachers retirement system calstrs member to stand with the youth earth guardians i was recently joined by another calstrs member i also believe we should use more carbon pricing to help reduce emissions and meet our climate goals the revenue generated via carbon pricing can be redirected to support underserved communities that are being disproportionately affected by climate change in 2023 calstrs will conduct a new asset liability study and a large part will be incorporating climate change scenarios california leads with its values and should invest in line with those values q the state s two massive pension funds the california public employees retirement system calpers and the california state teachers retirement system calstrs report they are about 72 percent to 73 percent funded what if anything should be changed about the assumptions and or investment strategy of these two funds what do you say to the pensioners of either fund who might be worried about their payments a strong investment returns over the long term will be key to reducing costs for employers and members calpers and calstrs are longtime investors which require discipline to maintain their respective asset allocations with targets of 6 8 percent for calpers and 7 percent for calstrs to better attain our funds assumed rate of return goals the calpers board recently adopted a new asset allocation that increases investments in private markets like private equity real estate and private debt private equity remains the fund s highest earning asset class similarly the calstrs board recently established an allocation for private equity californians are living longer with men in the state having the eighth longest life expectancy in the nation at 76 2 years and california women with the second longest life expectancy in the country at 82 years according to u s centers for disease control and prevention data released this month having said that times have changed from when people retired at age 67 with life expectancies of men at age 65 back in the 1960s regarding calpers during times of surpluses then gov jerry brown and now gov gavin newsom have been making extra pension contributions to calpers to pay down unfunded liabilities to save the state money in the long term similar to a home mortgage which i support at calstrs similarly since 2019 2020 the state has made supplemental payments that help pay down the state s share of calstrs unfunded liabilities q how do you feel about the state bank concept some economists think it is great some think it is oversold and leads to crony capitalism can it work in california a i recognize that there are parts of the population that are underserved by the traditional banking system we need to make sure any state banking option or alternative is properly vetted my office is working with the legislature and the administration to explore potential options now to fill these gaps in the banking system the calaccount blue ribbon commission is meeting over the course of the next year to develop a report to the legislature exploring the viability of a public banking option and other alternatives to fill the gaps and address inequities q are you satisfied with the amount of money state government returns to taxpayers under the gann limit which limits the state s spending each year if so why if not what would you do about it a i am happy californians have received direct stimulus in their bank accounts in light of historic surpluses however we are always looking at ways to cut bloated government spending for example the state pays the federal government to process social security payments other states have found ways to process these payments at a significant savings senate bill 973 is on the governor s desk and directs the department of social services to report back to the legislature on ways to cut the costs of the contract and redirect funds to the aged blind deaf and disabled q what can and will you do as treasurer to address the state s housing crisis a solving the housing crisis is possible if we increase the options for our housing stock across the board for affordable housing our bonds and tax credits have been oversubscribed for the past 3 5 years we have been actively lobbying congress and the biden administration to decrease our bond requirement from 50 percent to 25 percent which would allow us to approve more state 4 percent tax credit deals see my response about my priorities above for more q what can and will you do as treasurer to address the climate emergency a as mentioned i ve joined california s young people in calling for fossil fuel divestments at our state s two pension funds as treasurer i chair a number of boards and authorities that incentivize the cleaning and greening of our state s economy i chair the california alternative energy and advanced transportation financing authority caeatfa which provides financing for energy resources that use alternative methods of generation which minimize environmental degradation and promote resource conservation caeatfa also finances transportation technologies that conserve energy reduce air pollution and promote economic development and jobs i also chair the california pollution control financing authority cpcfa which provides financing for pollution control facilities to aid in meeting environmental standards cpcfa also administers the california capital access program which has helped over 7 000 small business borrowers obtain over 1 billion in loans since 1994 the sustainable communities grant and loan program which assists communities implementing smart growth strategies and the cal reuse program which offers low interest forgivable loans to assist public and private partners in redeveloping contaminated brownfields q what is your position on proposition 1 which would establish the rights for californians to an13 abortion and to contraceptives in the state constitution a i strongly support proposition 1 and have always been a staunch advocate for a woman s right to choose q why should voters elect you over your opponent a from my time on the san francisco board of supervisors installing stop signs and speed bumps to the california state assembly passing 60 bills under two governors during the great recession to the board of equalization leading the biggest reforms for accountability in the agency s history to the state treasurer s office i have built a track record as a principled problem solver with a proven ability to lead during difficult times last year my office processed 3 2 trillion worth of transactions even through the pandemic and held over 300 webinars to help small businesses nonprofits and veterans access resources to help them stay afloat we are building more affordable housing than ever before and helping more californians save for college and retirement than ever before over the past 3 5 years we have made remarkable strides in uplifting and financially strengthening all californians from their health care and housing to their schools and small businesses i would be honored to earn your vote to continue this work over the next four years

san diego s illumina won a legal battle thursday against u s antitrust regulators who sought to derail last year s 7 1 billion acquisition of grail a provider of a blood test that can pinpoint dozens of different types of cancer before symptoms arise an administrative law judge ruled that the vertical merger between illumina and grail did not violate competition laws in a court challenge brought by the u s federal trade commission details of the ruling weren t available because its full text hasn t been made public yet but it comes following a hotly contested fight where the ftc aimed to unwind the blockbuster deal that closed in august 2021 advertisement during an 18 day trial and sharply written court filings both sides argued that their respective positions would save lives holly vedova director of the ftc s bureau of competition said the agency put on a strong case the bureau of competition is disappointed with this decision vedova said in a statement we are reviewing the opinion and evaluating our options illumina called the decision a step forward in making grail s early detection tests for up to 50 different types of cancer more widely available as we ve stated from the outset this transaction is pro competitive will advance innovation lower health care costs and save lives said charles dadswell illumina s general counsel we are pleased that after considering the evidence the administrative law judge has reached the same conclusion while illumina came out on top in this round the company still faces regulatory scrutiny around the grail acquisition the european commission is investigating it recently rejected illumina s challenge to its jurisdiction illumina said it would appeal the ruling but it set aside 453 million to cover likely fines european regulators also are requiring illumina to operate grail as a separate entity overseen by an independent monitoring trustee until their investigation concludes illumina is the top maker of genomic sequencing hardware software and chemistry particularly advanced next generation sequencing technology seven years ago illumina started grail internally with the goal of developing a single blood test capable of screening for multiple types of cancer the disease kills about 630 000 americans each year in 2016 illumina spun off grail which went on to raise money from johnson johnson amazon s jeff bezos and others in june 2021 grail launched its galleri early detection cancer screening test it does not have u s food and drug administration clearance but it is the first such test to be available commercially at select facilities under a laboratory developed test designation illumina maintained 12 percent ownership of grail and brought it back into the fold to add financial heft and regulatory expertise to galleri s commercialization efforts too many of us have experienced or witnessed the devastating effects of cancer when it is diagnosed too late said illumina chief executive francis desouza in a statement our mission in bringing illumina and grail back together is to save many thousands of lives by working to ensure that everyone can find and afford a galleri test there are several competitors on grail s heels with their own single sample multiple cancer early detection tests including exact sciences guardant health freenome and singlera the market is expected to reach 75 billion by 2035 most of grail s competitors rely on illumina s next generation sequencing technology to run their early detection cancer tests because illumina is like the anchor tenant in the gene sequencing market the ftc argued the illumina grail combination created huge incentives for illumina to favor galleri hindering rivals ability to compete illumina disagreed it offered contractual guarantees aimed at ensuring that grail competitors have long term access to illumina equipment and supplies at reasonable prices illumina announced the antitrust win thursday morning its shares ended trading down less than 1 percent at 200 62 on the nasdaq exchange

under a new proposal from the white house about 400 000 virginians could become student debt free vpm news posed a question to the community last week how would student loan forgiveness affect your life dozens of people responded to our request online below are some of those responses the following has been edited for length and clarity gerri we had 4 children go through college on student loans each one paid them off from their post college earnings each is contributing to society both through employment and community service they did not expect the government to relieve them of their responsibilities i strongly feel the government has done a disservice to these folks in not allowing the benefit of accepting accountability for their decisions andrea we ve been able to pay off a lot with the 0 interest rates during covid but this 10 000 will get us even closer to paying it off and save our family money allowing us to put money toward our retirement and our children s college education which will be enormously expensive by the time they enter college erica student loan forgiveness won t affect me because i finished paying off my loans about 10 years ago had this been implemented during the crash of 08 my life might have been markedly different because the amount of forgiveness is about equal to my undergraduate loans i made a major decision that year which was to defer and then ultimately decline admission to graduate school because i did not think at the time it was wise to take on additional debt when the economy job market was as rough as it was had my loans been forgiven then i would have pursued a master s program that would have resulted in a teaching job which according to my county s pay scale would have me earning nearly 40 less than i do in my current profession it s strange to think of debt forgiveness having a negative impact on someone s financial livelihood but that would have been the case for me that said i am not opposed to providing debt forgiveness to federal borrowers their circumstances are likely very dissimilar to my own jeremy i m grateful for 10 000 in forgiveness but it s not a huge amount for my situation i have about 160 000 in loans my wife has about 60 000 but between the legal challenges that are probably going to show up and the general lack of trust in how these loans have been administered i m not really holding out any hope that i ll see any real relief before i make my 25 years of making payments toward my graduate degree i also don t see how any of this fixes the root cause of the issue which is that the cost of higher education is outpacing inflation and there s an overall decrease in funding for public schools at the state level seth the student loan forgiveness would not help me i ve paid my loans off versus investing that money it makes me a little upset i wish i hadn t paid them back because i d be much richer than just having the 10 000 in my pocket right now had i invested in the stock market with that 10 000 i d probably have 20 000 so in the end it helps me zero kristine the student loan forgiveness will be a huge boost for me i currently make about 60 of the median area income which means i do not qualify for rental assistance but i do qualify for state programs for first time home buyers so forgiving my student loan will really improve my credit worthiness meaning that i will qualify for better home mortgage rates and i can start saving a little more for that down payment and while i love my landlord i would really prefer to be a homeowner for my two kids and have a place for ourselves

route to germany deepening europe s difficulties in securing winter fuel further soured sentiment in the united states ahead of the long labor day weekend data showed on friday that u s employers hired more workers than expected in august but moderate wage growth and a rise in the unemployment rate to 3 7 suggested there could be less pressure on the federal reserve to deliver a third 75 basis
