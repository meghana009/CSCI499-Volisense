on march 29 russian and ukrainian negotiators held their first face to face negotiations in nearly three weeks in istanbul turkey after over three hours of talks both sides issued statements compared to the previous deadlock in negotiations talks this time saw success the turkish foreign minister said that this round of negotiations has made the most important progress so far in russia ukraine negotiations negotiators from both sides expressed optimism about the progress and were even confident it was a sufficient foundation for vladimir putin and volodymyr zelenskyy to move on to their first in person heads of state meeting after the talks russia expressed that it would mitigate the situation with adopted measures the most important of which would be a reduction in military operations around kyiv russian deputy minister of defense alexander fomin said decisions were made to build mutual trust and create the necessary conditions for further negotiations it stands to reason that this should be considered a sign of goodwill as russia seeks to end the conflict unexpectedly however u s led western nations along with zelenskyy have sought to spoil the progress not only was no recognition or appreciation shown for this act to establish mutual trust but instead the west and zelenskyy called the credibility of the talks outcome into question and persisted in keeping their guard up what reasons does the west have for denigrating the talks before answering that let s examine what was achieved in the march 29 talks ukraine proposed that in exchange for its neutrality it would get a security guarantee this means ukraine wouldn t join any military alliances and wouldn t have military bases the proposal also included a 15 year consultation period on the status of crimea effective upon a complete cease fire ukraine envisaged obtaining a security guarantee similar to nato s article 5 collective defense clause with poland israel turkey or canada serving as potential security guarantors ukrainian negotiator oleksandr chaly said if we manage to consolidate these key provisions and for us this is the most fundamental then ukraine will be in a position to actually fix its current status as a non bloc and non nuclear state in the form of permanent neutrality we will not host foreign military bases on our territory as well as deploy military contingents on our territory and we will not enter into military political alliances these proposals are the most detailed and concrete ukraine has publicly expressed to date on march 29 russian and ukrainian negotiators entered a new round of talks in istanbul turkey at the office of the turkish president in the dolmabahce palace when turkish president recep tayyip erdogan met with representatives of both parties before the start of the peace talks he expressed his willingness to facilitate a future russia ukraine meeting take another look at russia the head of the russian negotiation delegation vladimir medinsky said on march 29 that the russia ukraine talks were constructive we have received proposals from the ukrainian side for consideration clearly formulated their position on inclusion in the treaty these proposals will be considered in the near future and will be presented to the president and our response will be given accordingly medinsky said he further stated that putin is likely to meet zelenskyy as long as an agreement is ready for signing he even suggested a meeting between president vladimir putin and his ukrainian counterpart volodymyr zelenskyy be organized concurrently with the initialing of a bilateral treaty by the two foreign ministers according to german media coverage shortly after the end of the russia ukraine negotiations russia did seem to put its announced measures into practice ukraine s general staff of the armed forces announced that they observed the withdrawal of russian troops from in and around the capital kyiv russia s also reduced bombing when reports of the outcome of these talks were first seen many probably believed that the end of the war was imminent as the news spread on march 29 two major international benchmark oil prices dropped by more than 5 and major stock indexes in europe and the u s rose sharply however on march 30 western leadership which had been strongly condemning the war did not express the slightest affirmation or welcoming of the progress of the peace talks instead they voiced mistrust the u s said russia s reduction in military operations was a redeployment not a withdrawal and the world must prepare for further large scale russian offensives in other parts of ukraine joe biden held a conference call with leaders of four of the u s s main western european allies britain france germany and italy the white house released a statement saying the five leaders agreed not to ease severe economic sanctions on russia asked by reporters whether progress in the negotiations brought the war near to an end biden responded i don t read anything into it until i see what their actions are in a press release a spokesman for the british prime minister said there can be no relaxation of western resolve until the horror inflicted on ukraine is over on march 29 zelenskyy stated that the ukrainians are not naive people ukrainians have already learned during these 34 days of invasion and over the past eight years of the war in donbas that only a concrete result can be trusted of course there are different views inside russia chechen leader ramzan kadyrov declared that the russian military s special military operations in ukraine cannot be stopped and kyiv must be captured kadyrov has arrived in the southern ukrainian city of mariupol to boost morale on the front lines on march 29 he said i declare that it is necessary to complete what has been started not to stop we must go to kyiv and capture it kadyrov expressed doubts about russia ukraine negotiations he said i don t think these puppets have any power to make decisions they take their orders from the disciples of stepan bandera and nazis russian negotiator medinsky also said the reduction in military action did not mean a ceasefire regarding the current situation an analyst at germany s newspaper handelsblatt believes that the market is currently happy but not optimistic about the future it s hard to imagine that after four weeks of war putin would be satisfied with the fruits of the istanbul negotiations there are many signs that putin is really regrouping his armed forces and redeveloping his plans the new york times believes despite the positive signs of progress innumerable diplomatic pitfalls remain for example international security guarantees are not applicable to the disputed donbas region while separatists claim donbas territorial sovereignty extends significantly beyond the territory they controlled before the war thus reaching an agreement will take several weeks of further negotiations according to analysts at bloomberg russia s order to withdraw troops from around kyiv is likely a tactical decision russian commanders have already said that they plan to concentrate their forces on the east in order to liberate the donbas region bloomberg cited a source close to the kremlin claiming that the de escalation of the conflict did not mean a ceasefire or a full withdrawal of troops from around the capital and russia is still making demands for sweeping concessions that are impossible for ukraine to agree to evgeny minchenko a moscow based political adviser said i think there was very serious misunderstanding of what both sides said in istanbul after the talks so far i just heard that there will be less action near kyiv and chernihiv because the russian army is concentrating its resources against the ukrainian army in donbas one source familiar with the kremlin s thinking said russia s aim now is probably to take all of the territory of the eastern provinces luhansk and donetsk as well as a land corridor from the russian border to the crimean peninsula in short this would require ukraine to agree to permanent loss of about 20 of its territory in another article a source close to the kremlin was quoted as saying that a solution could only be reached if the battlefield situation was in line with russia s goals and that a massive ukrainian military defeat the was likely necessary to achieve that pentagon press secretary john kirby said putin s goals extended far beyond the donbas region and that people should not deceive themselves by accepting moscow s suggestions that it would reduce attacks around kyiv kirby said of the pentagon we re not prepared to call this a retreat or even a withdrawal analysts believe that an immediate cease fire between both sides is highly unlikely notably on the same day as the russia ukraine negotiations kirby announced that the united states would send 400 more troops and more fighter jets to eastern europe to strengthen nato s defense capabilities in the region on the same day denmark also announced that it would counter the russian threat by sending an 800 person battalion to nato bases in the baltic states u s deputy secretary of the treasury wally adeyemo said the u s and its allies intend to impose new sanctions on russia s many key industries including those connected to military operations supply chains just a day earlier on march 28 russian foreign minister sergey lavrov emphasized that russia was looking forward to resolving the conflict through diplomatic channels but would not accept western mediation i ve given you examples but there are a lot of other examples where diplomatic achievements were destroyed by our western counterparts they can t be trusted now lavrov said

be really creative about what you fill with soil maslowe says whether you ve set aside a small plot of land or a discarded sneaker the two most important factors to consider as you re plotting your garden remain the same the first is soil lead contamination is common in boston area dirt maslowe says so it s crucial to test before you plant and if necessary bring in fresh uncontaminated soil to grow your food in the second is sunlight plants need at least six and often up to eight hours of sun per day so if you don t have a bright spot in the yard for your garden your best bet is to grow your grub in a small container that you can move around to catch optimal rays as for what you should plant cherry tomatoes and lettuces are great for beginners so are asian greens like bok choy maslowe says garlic onions and leeks are ultra versatile in the kitchen steer clear of cucumbers though they re more susceptible to disease than other vegetables so they can be frustrating for budding

photo conservation north measuring carbon stocks in the forest an international team of scientists including researchers from university of northern british columbia unbc have published a new peer reviewed study on the importance of protecting primary forests in bc s interior wetbelt iwb bioregion for the climate scientists from the unbc griffith university in australia the conservation biology institute in oregon wild heritage in oregon and conservation north were part of the study which underscores the seriousness of b c s emissions tied to the logging of old growth forests the study used data collected in the field as well as government datasets to estimate how much carbon is contained within unlogged old growth spruce redcedar and hemlock forests how much has been emitted to the atmosphere by clearcut logging the iwb is a vast largely forested area of 16 5 million ha along the western flanks of the canadian rockies and northern columbia mountains it contains rare old growth spruce forests referred to in other parts of the world as boreal rainforest and the rare inland temperate rainforest logging in this ecosystem accelerated from the 1970s to the 2000s the region contains underappreciated carbon stocks that can help canada meet its climate and conservation targets said lead researcher dr dominick dellasala in their natural state these forests constitute an irreplaceable natural climate solution but we re turning them into lumber and threatening to turn them into pellets the government of canada has pledged to protect 30 percent of its lands and waters by 2030 in order to mitigate the climate crisis the interior wetbelt contains some of the most carbon dense forests on the planet said art fredeen a study co author at unbc if we summed up all of the carbon from historically logged timber in the iwb it would exceed b c s total greenhouse gas emissions for 2019 9 times over instead of increasing the b c s carbon debt by further logging old carbon rich landscapes we should be conserving them paradigm shift in forestry still needed the provincial government recently announced it s deferring 1 7 million hectares of old growth forests at risk of permanent loss b c also announced last fall that an expert panel had mapped 2 6 million hectares of unprotected old growth forests at risk and asked 204 first nations to decide whether they supported the temporary deferral of logging the province has now heard from 188 first nations of which 75 have agreed to the deferrals that will initially last two years while over 60 have asked for more time to decide and incorporate indigenous knowledge into the plans however ecologist and co author michelle connolly of conservation north said these temporary deferrals don t go far enough and there needs to be major forestry reforms to protect carbon dense old growth forests she said these forests need time to recover the logging related carbon debt and improve monitoring of carbon stocks and stock changes connolly said this is what the promised paradigm shift that was called for in the 2020 old growth strategic review panel ought to look like on the ground protecting all old growth is objectively good for the climate because of how much carbon they store and that s partly what our study has revealed a truly progressive forest policy would actually protect at least all old growth forests and provide support for first nations to do that said connolly she said the deferrals put the onus on first nations to decide without any funding to examine whether they wanted to do that and what that would mean for them or alternative conservation options what ought to be happening to be truly progressive is to actually support first nations in protecting these places most people in b c agree that protecting old growth forests is really important and now we have evidence that the climate is a really good reason to do that aboveground carbon storage under reported dr dellasala added that for the very first time we have a comprehensive assessment of how important b c s interior rainforests are to the global climate and how much has been lost to logging in the case of climate change the forest is worth far more standing then cut down for wood products the study also reported that nearly one quarter of the entire iwb has been logged the majority within the inland rainforest since the 1970s resulting in live above ground carbon declining by at least 18 per cent however the researchers said this is likely an underestimate because government data appears to underestimate the amount of aboveground carbon storage in the most carbon rich stands and because logging has been concentrated in low to mid elevations below 2000 m where carbon density is the greatest the study suggests the province is under reporting logging related carbon emissions by as much as 75 per cent carbon storage is the element that s really really important adds connolly that s what our group has

time we are pleased that this study finds that large majorities of virginia parents recognize the tremendous supports that out of school time programs provide but we need to do even more to ensure

every child in an afterschool program in our country today three more are waiting to get in the families of 24 6 million children more than ever before are unable to access a program there are significant inequities with black and latino children among those most likely to be unable to access the afterschool programs their parents want for them we need to make it possible for all students

new york ap after emily pina s parents separated the 27 year old in phoenix said she spent years listening to her dad beg for the return of his family he turned up the volume once her mom started dating sound familiar it s the same thing as kanye and kim she said and like the celebrity couple her dad s digital life played a role in his breakup as it often does in contentious divorces kanye west now legally known as ye has gone quiet on instagram after weeks of ranting publicly about kim kardashian in the name of fatherhood which many saw as bullying and intimidation his targets included kardashian her boyfriend pete davidson and trevor noah who weighed in on the daily show in pina s case she said her parents divorce was impacted in part when her father who has since died was scammed out of 10 000 after meeting a woman online and attempting to bring her to the u s she turned out to be a man at a computer in other cases instagram twitter and facebook are weaponized directly against an estranged spouse as divorce proceedings progress still more divorce cases include digital theft of emails joint bank accounts and other shared logins dan stock a new york family law attorney warns that sounding off against a partner digitally can have lasting consequences when texts posts photos and other wrongs are hauled into court that s especially true when child custody arrangements are on the table even kanye shouldn t be trash talking on social media unless as may be the case he has a divorce court death wish stock said it s one thing to be the victim of a social media bully but it s an early holiday present to the case you are making if you are that victim s divorce attorney the sentiment was echoed by a dozen other lawyers who handle divorce child custody and relationship abuse cases especially those in california and a handful of other states with relatively new legal standards of coercive control as a form of non physical abuse the laws allow judges leeway in doling out punishments advocates for victims of harassment and abuse agreed they said acting out online in pending domestic abuse and divorce cases is routine it s really interesting with kim she s pretty much the most protected woman in america right all the resources and she is a great example of how even if you have all the resources it doesn t matter said lenora claire a stalking and harassment survivor and victims advocate in beverly hills california it s been really painful to watch but also really eye opening for the public who maybe aren t as enmeshed in this issue as i am she said katie hood ceo of the nonprofit one love foundation has seen numerous occasions of social media turned against one person by another in divorces and breakups her organization provides young people with tools and resources to spot signs of healthy and unhealthy relationships a breakup is the most dangerous time in a relationship that s when the abusive person s control has been broken and they do a lot of things to try to wrest back control control the narrative control how their ex partner is perceived she said watching the kim and ye divorce play out on social media has resonated with many victims of relationship abuse hood said a lot of people i ve talked to are saying this reminds me of my ex this reminds me of how my ex responded to the breakup she said social media is an amplification point a new channel in the old days before we had all this you couldn t see how your ex was moving on with their life or how they were spending their time or who they were with years ago hood recalled a friend went through a breakup and her ex tried to sabotage her through phone calls to employers and family members about what an awful person she was telling secrets and threatening to share harmful photos well now you just have to press post on social media or go to linkedin or set up fake accounts and bomb people with information that can really be damaging she said there have been a couple of visible consequences for west he was banned from instagram for 24 hours and he was disinvited from performing at the april 3 grammy awards after slinging a racial slur at noah who hosted the ceremony ye wound up winning two grammys but was a no show as an audience member he dropped out of headlining at coachella valley music and arts festival according to tmz and other reports giving organizers less than two weeks to find a replacement he hasn t publicly spoken a word of it since in february kardashian spoke up in a los angeles superior court filing about her estranged husband s unsettling online behavior urging a judge to ignore ye s attempts to slow down their divorce and end their marriage as soon as possible she was successful after arguing in part mr west has disseminated on social media the parties private communications and misinformation about personal family matters and co parenting which has caused emotional distress west has been open about his mental health struggles and his diagnosis of bipolar disorder when you re in this state you re hyper paranoid about everything everyone west told david letterman in 2019 this is my experience other people have different experiences everyone now is an actor everything s a conspiracy you feel the government is putting chips in your head you feel you re being recorded you feel all these things ari lightman a professor of digital media at carnegie mellon university s heinz college studies online communities and the downsides of digital security and privacy divorce he said plays into broader issues on social media in a sense using social media this way is a protest movement right and there s a very vocal group online that s almost acting as judge and jury lightman said i really like what trevor noah said that we shouldn t cancel kanye but counsel him dan jaffe a family law attorney in los angeles has handled wealthy high profile clients for decades these are real people with real feelings things get lost and convoluted when we use the media to try and resolve these factors the lawyers should be resolving these factors her lawyers absolutely have to be thinking about going in and getting court orders for a temporary restraining order for domestic violence in california it can be based on emotional upset not necessarily physical abuse he said receiving orders of protection for such behavior due to coercive control is far from guaranteed said another longtime los angeles divorce attorney for the rich and famous alexandra leichter the standards offer hope for victims but there remains a reluctance among some judges to weigh in on free speech grounds there s no doubt she said that digital technology has opened up a whole new branch of coercive control judges can order them to stop not to use the media email not to contact the person leichter said does it always work i d be lying if i told you that it does it s a much more complex situation with electronic media ___ how to tell you

1977 ford f 100 prerunner is one seriously high flying thrill machine this amazing 1977 ford f 100 prerunner is equally comfy on the street and highly capable off the pavement over the past few years prerunners vehicles that were historically used to pre run an off road racecourse before the real thing began have become incredibly popular road legal weekend toys among enthusiasts it s easy to see the appeal of such a machine of course given the fact that they re nearly as capable as a full blown race truck yet also tame enough to drive on the street that certainly applies to this incredible 1977 ford f 100 prerunner built by rob of rj fabrication in hesperia california which shawn davis from the youtube channel autotopiala recently got to experience firsthand as rob reveals this 1977 ford f 100 prerunner build wasn t completed using a bone stock pickup rather it had already been converted into an off road racer by a company called raceco rob s buddy purchased it from them and proceeded to take it out one day but unfortunately got a little too sideways and flipped it thus the truck was in need of some repairs so rob obliged by making it even better than it was before rob started that process by replacing two thirds of the body and adding some extra bars to the truck s existing roll cage to beef it up in case the owner repeated his unfortunate incident at some point in the future he then added two spares in the bed before dropping in a 427 cubic inch dart based v8 that s essentially a punched out 351 windsor which is topped off with a holley terminator fuel injection setup output is around 525 horsepower which is enough that power flows to the wheels via a c6 automatic transmission and a trophy truck style rear end with 5 43 gears as one might imagine the suspension of this vintage ford received the most attention and the parts list here is indeed impressive with items such as fox 4 0 bypass shocks and 3 0 coilovers which given it an impressive 21 inches of front wheel travel and 28 inches of rear travel while the whole thing rolls on massive 40 inch bfgoodrich tires despite all of that hardcore stuff this 1977 ford f 100 cruises down the road quite nicely but off the pavement it s an entirely different animal rob catches a little air with davis in the passenger seat and he walks away with a blown mind from this incredibly visceral machine which proves why exactly prerunners are so popular these days
suzhou china and rockville md april 13 2022 prnewswire ascentage pharma 6855 hk a global biopharmaceutical company engaged in developing novel therapies for cancers chronic hepatitis b chb and age related diseases today announced that it has presented the latest results from six preclinical studies of the company s five investigational drug candidates the bcl 2 inhibitor lisaftoclax apg 2575 and the mdm2 p53 inhibitor alrizomadlin apg 115 two key candidates in the company s apoptosis targeted pipeline as well as the fak inhibitor apg 2449 the eed inhibitor apg 5918 and the kras inhibitor apg 1842 at the 2022 american association for cancer research aacr annual meeting the aacr annual meeting is one of the world s largest and long standing scientific gatherings in the field of cancer research covering cutting edge advances in all the areas of cancer research and innovation the annual event attracts tremendous interest from the global cancer research community dr yifan zhai chief medical officer of ascentage pharma said at this year s aacr annual meeting we presented preclinical data that support potential combination approaches between our lead candidates with drugs of different targets and mechanism of actions these studies represent our ongoing effort in addressing important unmet medical needs in cancer treatment it is worth pointing out that the results from three preclinical studies of the mdm2 p53 inhibitor alrizomadlin have demonstrated broad therapeutic potential and highlighted a novel mechanism of action meanwhile we also reported encouraging results supporting the upcoming clinical development of the eed inhibitor apg 5918 we will actively advance these programs to bring meaningful clinical benefits to patients the details of these posters presented at aacr 2022 are as follows drug candidate presentation title abstract lisaftoclax alrizomadlin co targeting mdm2 p53 and bcl 2 apoptosis pathways overcomes resistance conferred by acquired bcl 2 gene mutations in preclinical models 3964 alrizomadlin inhibition of mdm2 p53 interaction by alrizomadlin apg 115 induces pyroptotic cell death in gasdermin e gsdme expressing cancer cells 2998 mdm2 inhibitor alrizomadlin apg 115 stabilizes p53 and synergizes with proteasome inhibitors in multiple myeloma 5439 apg 2449 fak inhibitor apg 2449 and cdk4 6 inhibitor palbociclib synergistically suppress mesothelioma tumor growth via autophagy induction 2563 apg 5918 preclinical development of embryonic ectoderm development eed inhibitor apg 5918 eedi 5273 for cancer therapy 3939 apg 1842 development of covalent krasg12c inhibitor apg 1842 for the treatment of solid tumors 2664 co targeting mdm2 p53 and bcl 2 apoptosis pathways overcomes resistance conferred by acquired bcl 2 gene mutations in preclinical models abstract poster number 3964 introduction the bcl 2 inhibitor venetoclax although efficacious in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia meets significant resistance in a large number of patients due to acquired bcl 2 gene mutations among acquired mutations those proximal to bh3 binding motifs e g g101v d103e and v156d have the most significant impact on bcl 2 binding to bh3 only pro death proteins and bh3 mimetics e g venetoclax hence it is important to identify novel therapeutics that address this emerging unmet need conclusions our study demonstrates alrizomadlin combined with lisaftoclax synergistically inhibited the proliferation of rs4 11 bcl 2 mutant cell lines and the growth of cell derived xenografts in vivo co targeting bcl 2 and mdm2 p53 apoptosis pathways represents a new and effective strategy to overcome drug resistance conferred by clinically bcl 2 gene mutations inhibition of mdm2 p53 interaction by alrizomadlin apg 115 induces pyroptotic cell death in gasdermin e gsdme expressing cancer cells abstract poster number 2998 introduction the mouse double minute 2 mdm2 p53 inhibitor alrizomadlin apg 115 is an investigational agent known to induce apoptosis of tp53 wild type cancer cells aguilar et al j med chem 2017 emerging evidence suggests that activation of p53 by alrizomadlin also promotes antitumor immunity in the tumor microenvironment fang et al jitc 2019 zhou et al nat immunol 2021 but the links between these processes are not yet completely understood pyroptosis refers to inflammatory programmed cell death central to this process is the family of gasdermins which can form pores in cell plasma membranes resulting in lysis and release of immune stimulants in cells expressing these proteins gsdme can be cleaved by caspase 3 which converts noninflammatory apoptosis to pyroptosis zhang et al nature 2020 in this context caspase 3 gsdme appears to represent a switch between apoptosis and pyroptosis given that alrizomadlin elicits its apoptogenic activity primarily by activating caspase 3 we hypothesized that the mdm2 p53 inhibitor might also induce pyroptosis in gsdme expressing cells by cleaving caspases conclusions our study demonstrates that in addition to apoptosis mdm2 p53 inhibitor alrizomadlin induces caspase mediated pyroptosis in gsdme expressing cancer cells in this study we reveal for the first time that apoptosis inducing alrizomadlin induces both apoptosis and pyroptosis in gsdme expressing cancer cells gsdme dependent pyroptosis is a previously unrecognized mechanism of action for alrizomadlin to exert antitumor immunity with potentially important implications for clinical development of therapy involving mdm2 p53 inhibition mdm2 inhibitor alrizomadlin apg 115 stabilizes p53 and synergizes with proteasome inhibitors in multiple myeloma abstract poster number 5439 introduction multiple myeloma mm accounts for about 2 of all cancers and 18 of all hematologic malignancies in the us recent therapeutic advances e g immunomodulators proteasome inhibitors monoclonal antibodies have improved outcomes but mm inevitably relapses and is considered incurable genomic analysis shows that the tp53 gene encoding tumor suppressor protein p53 is infrequently mutated in patients with mm of whom about 82 retain wildtype wt tp53 mouse double minute 2 mdm2 is an e3 ubiquitin ligase that inhibits p53 via proteasome degradation proteasome inhibitors might help to stabilize p53 and synergize with mdm2 inhibitors therefore mdm2 inhibitors that activate p53 might constitute an attractive pharmacologic approach to mm alrizomadlin is an investigational novel small molecule targeting the p53 mdm2 interaction and is in clinical development for solid and hematologic cancers this study aimed to evaluate whether alrizomadlin can potentiate the antitumor effects of proteasome inhibitors in mm conclusions the results demonstrate that the combination of mdm2 inhibitor alrizomadlin and proteasome inhibitors have synergistic antitumor effects on mm tumors harboring wt tp53 in animal models these data warrant clinical studies to test this novel therapeutic option for patients with refractory mm fak inhibitor apg 2449 and cdk4 6 inhibitor palbociclib synergistically suppress mesothelioma tumor growth via autophagy induction abstract poster number 2563 introduction malignant mesothelioma is a rare but highly lethal malignancy with a 5 year survival rate of less than 10 among the most common genomic abnormalities are alterations of cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor 2a b cdkn2a b and neurofibromin 2 nf2 mesothelioma cells lacking expression of cdkn2a b or nf2 are reported to be sensitive to cdk4 6 or focal adhesion kinase fak inhibition in this study apg 2449 as a clinical stage fak alk ros1 multi kinase inhibitor combined with cdk4 6 inhibitor palbociclib demonstrated anti tumor activity conclusions these results demonstrate that the combination of palbociclib and apg 2449 synergistically inhibits tumor growth in mesothelioma and such effect is mediated by induced autophagy and enhanced cellular senescence the preclinical study suggests that apg 2449 combined with cdk4 6 inhibitors may have therapeutic potential in mesothelioma and may warrant future clinical development preclinical development of embryonic ectoderm development eed inhibitor apg 5918 eedi 5273 for cancer therapy abstract poster number 3939 introduction three core components constitute the polycomb repressive complex 2 prc2 a multiprotein complex that catalyzes the methylation of histone h3 at lysine 27 h3k27me3 enhancer of zeste homolog 2 ezh2 embryonic ectoderm development eed and suppressor of zeste 12 protein homolog suz12 dysregulated function of prc2 has been implicated in the development of a variety of cancer types with the use of tazemetostat an ezh2 inhibitor inhibition of prc2 functions has been proven to be a successful cancer therapeutic strategy nevertheless the activity of an ezh2 inhibitor might be compensated due to acquired resistance through secondary mutations in ezh2 or its paralog ezh1 because binding of eed with trimethylated h3k27 h3k27me3 is the prerequisite for the activation of the methyltransferase activity of ezh2 allosterically targeting eed is emerging as a novel approach to inhibit prc2 apg 5918 eedi 5273 has been reported as a novel bioactive and potent eed inhibitor in this study we further characterized apg 5918 for cancer therapy in a preclinical setting conclusions apg 5918 was thoroughly characterized in the preclinical stage with potent biochemical binding activity to eed protein in vitro anti proliferatively activity and in vivo antitumor activities apg 5918 showed definitive in vitro and in vivo target engagement and on target antitumor activity apg 5918 demonstrated strong pd pk correlation in mice bearing karpas 422 xenograft tumors apg 5918 appeared to be similar or more potent than mak683 an eed inhibitor under clinical development in terms of biochemical in vitro and in vivo activities in summary our results suggest potential utility of apg 5918 in cancer therapy and it deserves further clinical investigation development of covalent krasg12c inhibitor apg 1842 for the treatment of solid tumors abstract poster number 2664 introduction the kras gene is frequently mutated in human cancers and the krasg12c mutation occurs in approximately 13 of non small cell lung cancers nsclcs and in 1 to 3 of colorectal cancers and other solid tumors krasg12c small molecule inhibitors amg510 and mrtx849 have been investigated as treatment options for solid tumors with the kras g12c mutation in this study apg 1842 was characterized as a potent

and corporate secretary so i m going to start the meeting today by asking amanda to read our disclosure statement amanda sutton thank you dan before we begin i remind you that certain information presented today may constitute forward looking statements such statements reflect north west s current expectations estimates projections and assumptions these forward looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to certain risks which could cause actual performance and financial results in the future to vary materially from those contemplated in the forward looking statements for additional information on these risks please see north west s annual information form and itâ s md a under the heading risk factors dan dan mcconnell all right thanks amanda let s start with an overview of our fourth quarter as done in previous calls we ll also provide a comparison on a 2 year basis just to provide context to these results when it s relevant so sales in the quarter increased 2 4 to 579 million led by same store sales in international excluding the foreign exchange impact consolidated sales actually increased by 2 9 same store sales were up 0 1 on top of a 16 8 increase in the fourth quarter last year our diluted earnings per share increased 12 7 in the quarter to 0 71 and that s more than double the 0 33 from q4 of 2019 adjusted net earnings which includes the impact of after tax insurance related gains and after tax share based compensation costs increased 1 9 million or 6 1 compared to last year during these last couple of years our teams have really taken to heart our values particularly being customer driven this is especially important because as circumstances around us change we have to be resilient adaptable and enterprising during the quarter government consumer income support funds continue to dwindle particularly in northern canada and travel restrictions are less severe compared to what they were just last year with a customer driven focus we have been able to retain and grow our market share in both our canadian and international markets in spite of this shift in tailwinds from the covid 19 we have focused on maintaining our in stock positions in order to navigate supply chain challenges as an essential food service provider our vendors do understand that we need to prioritize fill rates to guarantee food security in our communities it hasn t been easy or smooth we have felt some we have felt some vendor shortages and delays as well as weather issues this winter that slowed our flow of goods however our teams continued to adjust by procuring inventory earlier to account for extended lead times which definitely was successful for us coming into the holiday season this includes increasing our inventory levels compared to last year as we take a more aggressive position in sealift and winter road stores in canada to navigate supply chain constraints and rising costs due to industry wide inflation in fact we secured additional warehouse space furthering our ability to move heavily heavy products and optimize high cube freight on the winter road network all right so having set the context let s talk a little bit now about canadian sales in q4 sales increased 1 3 to 333 million building on an exceptional sales gain of last year same store sales were down 3 compared to a 21 2 increase last year on a 2 year basis same store sales were up 17 7 compared to the fourth quarter of 2019 we were able to hold our ground on food sales in canada despite lower income support as the as they remained flat to last year on a same store basis compared to the 15 7 increase in 2020 however these factors had a larger impact on general merchandise sales which decreased 12 on a same store basis coming off of a 41 6 increase last year that said overall food and general merchandise same store sales have remained strong over a 2 year period with increases of 15 7 and 25 1 respectively compared to 2019 on the other hand our international operations sales continued to have a healthy growth trajectory in q4 they increased 5 7 to 194 million and were up 16 4 compared to 2019 same store sales remained strong increasing 5 on top of a 10 7 sales gain last year across the different international jurisdictions a strong in stock position also allowed us to capture sales as i said before this has not been smooth sailing supply chain challenges continue but we have been able to be even better in stock than our competition which has allowed us to grow our market share higher snap payments and native corporation payments helped drive sales in alaska and in our tourism dependent markets we are seeing a positive trend of revenge travel although still well below pre pandemic levels food sales in international were up 6 1 on a same store basis compared to a 7 5 sales gain last year on general merchandise we were able to relatively hold our current ground during the holy season in international with sales decreasing 0 5 overall however note that last year we had a tremendous performance with a 35 2 increase on a same store sales basis similar to last quarter supply chain issues and inflationary trends put some pressure on our gross profit which actually decreased at 1 7 compared to last year due to a 134 basis point reduction as a rate of sales the decrease in rate was primarily due to changes in product sales blend particularly related to general merchandise sales and higher shrink and markdowns compared to last year let me provide some context to these results on a 2 year basis because of the high sell through we experienced in last year in 2020 our turns markdowns and shrink improved substantially to 2019 our gross profit rate in q4 of 2020 was 266 basis points above 2019 now if we compare our 2021 gp rate to 2019 our fourth quarter rate of 31 9 is still 132 basis points better than 2019 so when we re considering all together we believe this rate is within an acceptable range to deploy a more customer driven approach that is what we re doing in certain key markets categories and items here our focus has remained on keeping both our customers trust and the momentum on market share capture by closely monitoring competitive pricing levels with a balanced approach we are taking steps to mitigate inflationary cost increases as much as possible to meet our value offer to our customers while not losing sight of driving value for our shareholders in terms of expenses we ve been very focused on finding efficiencies where available during the quarter there was a 3 6 million decrease compared to last year mainly due to insurance related gains that offset higher expenses of new store and share based compensation costs these are inclusive of 4 1 million in special payments to non bonus eligible frontline associates in recognition of their contributions to serve our customers excluding the insurance gain and share based compensation costs expenses decreased 0 1 compared to last year all right now let s shift gears and transition to talk about the performance of the airline the passenger and charter related business continues to recover compared to last year after the community travel restrictions experienced back in 2020 however this trend was somewhat impacted later in the quarter by new covid travel restrictions related to omicron overall the improvement in our passenger business partially mitigated the impact of the remote air carrier support program and canada emergency wage subsidy payments that we did receive last year on the other hand the cargo business continues to perform well providing an edge against the competition to navigate the supply chain constraints as we use it to transport our own cargo to the stores on top of that third party cargo also performed better than last year as we were able to get some traction with some new clients bringing all of the above together the company s net earnings increased 2 8 million to 35 6 million as mentioned earlier adjusted net earnings increased 1 9 million or 6 1 compared to last year a lower interest expense resulting from lower debt levels as well as a lower effective tax rate driven by higher blend of international operations supported these results now in terms of our short term outlook there are still uncertainties related to covid 19 and macroeconomic implications as we continue to monitor the development of new variants the lockdown situation in china and the war in ukraine forecasting in this current macro climate is difficult but company wide overall we anticipate our same store sales same store 2022 sales to be lower than last year but higher than compared to pre pandemic levels on the near term supply chain constraints will continue to challenge our operations we expect that the current stock levels and in stock focus of our teams will allow us to navigate this moving forward we re encouraged with the positive trends of tourism and expect this to continue throughout the next year as tourism dependent markets recover from record 2 year lows on this front income support in our markets particularly in northern canadian and u s markets will be lower compared to last year throughout our stores and banners operational excellence will continue to be a priority improving execution assortment and product flow we will also focus our efforts on continuing to capture market share by investing in our stores for the long term through accelerating store renovations that were postponed during the pandemic this is going to enhance our customers experience in alaska we opened our third store in gamble at the end of january heading into 2022 our store expansion plans will continue and we re hoping to announce some new store openings in the coming months in canada we are advancing price optimization focused on controlling costs and mitigating inflationary impacts we are enhancing our procedures and systems to be able to calibrate opportunities where we can access price elasticity on an ongoing basis to tackle opportunities that will help us better serve our customers and gain market share always with gross profit dollars at top of mind as mentioned on previous calls this is an ongoing process of being a better retailer doing discrete tests and pilots before deploying banner wide okay let me finalize by saying that i m extremely pleased with the financial results in the quarter for fiscal 2021 i would like to again thank our people and teams we are moving with purpose towards the future and their everyday actions are the foundation upon which the trust of our customers and communities is built i m confident that by aligning our business model to the value proposition we have for our people customers communities and shareholders we will be able to keep the great momentum we ll be able to keep the great momentum that we have and position our north west company for success in the years to come with that i will now ask the operator to open up the call for any questions question and answer session operator thank you the first question is from michael van aelst td securities please go ahead michael van aelst hi good afternoon dan mcconnell good afternoon michael michael van aelst a couple of other questions so just to start off your 2022 guidance where you say you expect your ebitda to decline year over year it s not clear to me whether you re talking about adjusted ebitda or just reported ebitda because you do call out the the insurance case gained as a key reason for the drop dan mcconnell yes it would be reported michael our reported ebitda and i don t think we said did you say year after year we said next year michael van aelst year over year yes so 2022 over 2021 dan mcconnell yes yes that s right yes michael van aelst okay and do you care to comment at all on adjusted ebitda since that s what people focus on more dan mcconnell no we typically don t comment on adjusted ebitda michael van aelst okay all right you mentioned that you were a little static y there on your comments but they re pretty thorough you did mention gross margin of 31 9 did you say that that is better that s the better level going forward given your balanced approach dan mcconnell that s correct yes michael van aelst all right all right so i guess when you look at the in market spending increase that you got during covid some of that was forced upon consumers during covid but some how much of that do you think has turned more permanent considering your better pricing in your in stock positions dan mcconnell that s a big question obviously we re expecting to be more than less i mean we ve we think we have some great momentum behind us michael and we re going to continue to keep our customers trust that we ve gained over the last two years but it s really hard to put a number to it it s especially with all the volatility in the markets now with all the things that are happening so it s really tough to quantify michael van aelst i guess as you ve seen the travel restrictions come off at different times over the past couple of years and i don t know if they re starting to ease in the north now but are you starting to see any kind of leakage in your market share dan mcconnell we are starting to see sorry go ahead michael i didn t let you finish michael van aelst just yes mostly back to destination shopping i m assuming dan mcconnell yes exactly no you re exactly right michael van aelst because i know i started this year dan mcconnell yes michael van aelst all right and just finally before i get back in the queue there was a comment on acquisition opportunities and your outlook in the annual report and just kind of curious what type of businesses you re looking for and what geographies are your focus dan mcconnell the same type of markets that we operate in today and they would be predominantly retail if that s the nature of your question michael van aelst okay so just standard like food retail general merchandise retail dan mcconnell you got it yes michael van aelst are you more interested in filling in some holes within your caribbean cost u less type markets or more so in the north dan mcconnell if you ask more interested currently more in northern territories simply because that s where we see the opportunities present themselves so that would be in alaska and in canada michael van aelst perfect all right thank you dan mcconnell thanks operator thank you the next question is from mark petrie bibc please go ahead unidentified analyst hi good afternoon this is kunaal filling in for mark thanks for taking our questions dan mcconnell no problem i was going to say that doesn t sound like mark unidentified analyst no so given the various elements of your company could you talk about the impact of higher oil prices on your business so you ll have higher freight costs impacting the airline but then a boom to the alaska economy so can you share with us how you re thinking about that through the course of 2022 dan mcconnell okay it s good obviously we do and as i indicated in my discussion just earlier we do and have tried to purchase prepurchase a lot of our product to the extent that we could just given our concentration and our winter road that was just i guess coming to an end now so that s a lot of that product has been accounted for as far as the it s going to be obviously the same impacts of it in the inflation in the oil that we see right throughout the entire market but when i look at the alaska example typically the higher price of oil has a positive correlation to the economy and to the market in alaska so that could be an opportunity for us obviously and we don t know what the pfd for example is going to be but we think that it could be a positive gain for alaska as far as their economy is concerned and everywhere else we think it s going to be a bit of a drain on the business so it s there s a bit of a hedge we get a checkmark in alaska and we obviously in some of the other markets it s something that we re going to have to work through as we ve had some hedge just by the nature of our business of prefiling our product before the increases came through but then later on in the year it s something that we re going to have to mitigate unidentified analyst okay great that s helpful and then as a follow up can you comment on the price optimization initiatives and how they ve been progressing and also what has the customer response been so far given the previous question about more drainage from in market shopping dan mcconnell it s really it s too early to really raise our arms but i can say that obviously as i indicated it s going to be something that we test we ve had some wins but we are by no means at a place where we think it s a blanket rollout that s going to have yet as of today it won t have a significant benefit but it s definitely our outlook and our expectation is that it will have a significant benefit as we continue to build that competency through the latter half of 2022 unidentified analyst okay great thatâ s helpful thanks very much dan mcconnell all right thank you operator and the next question is from john vincent rbc capital markets please go ahead john vincent hello good afternoon congrats on the quarter i just have a quick question on capital allocation on the 120 million of capex for next year should we expect to see that go entirely to store new builds or where do you where do you see that going next year dan mcconnell well there s a mix of different projects in there some of it is through the acquisitions that we talked about in alaska commercial company some of it is some new store rebuilds and a lot of it is actually to renovating existing under i guess you can call it plants or facilities that are in need of investment so it s kind of a really good kind of hedge or mix of all those things john vincent okay got it and then just on inflation more generally for the business i understand the sort of ongoing pricing optimization efforts just wondering if there are any other levers in the business that you see as a good way to deal with inflation maybe on the cost structure i know you mentioned there were some wins in sort of costs being down a little bit year over year but just wondering if you have any thoughts on that going forward dan mcconnell you know what obviously our cost optimization is something that we think about regularly we do have some initiatives that we re well into to try and reduce some of the drainage costs on our business such as our shrink increase our turns and obviously make our through some of the programs we developed in our labor to make our labor much more efficient and effective so i would say amongst those triggers we re hoping that we can offset i wouldn t say entirely for sure but take a chunk out of it and just create that thrift throughout the entire chain as everybody feels the inflation this isn t something that s just exclusive to industry obviously people are feeling it individually in their homes so it s no surprise to anybody so yes we do have initiatives that we ve coincidentally started and are well underway to be able to optimize some of our expense reduction john vincent got it and then maybe just one more for me since you mentioned labor i m just wondering we ve heard from some other retailers that they re having trouble attracting talent and retaining labor within their stores just wondering if you re seeing any of those impacts or has that kind of been a nonissue for you so far dan mcconnell i wouldn t say it s this is always a big struggle that we have so it s something that we put a lot of time and attention to we have a pretty unique offering so we try to cater our applications and the people that fit the experience that we have to offer so yes we do definitely we are preparing for it we have felt it not too much more than we do typically but we have some pretty significant plans through our people strategy that we re trying to combat just churn as it is we re trying to keep more people increase the value proposition for our employees getting more creative as to how we offer that and so it s of high focus for us but as of right now it s been no more than not significantly more than it has been in previous years keeping in mind that it always is a challenge for us john vincent okay well congrats on the quarter once again thanks very much dan mcconnell hey appreciate it thanks operator thank you the next question is from michael van aelst td securities please go ahead michael van aelst hi i just wanted to follow up on some of the cost comments that you made because i think a number of them were tied to offsetting some of the cost of goods sold inflation but your sg a was flat year over year excluding the stock based comp and the insurance gains and that s pretty impressive you said you decreased your incentive plan costs but you added a higher store count so can you kind of discuss the underlying inflationary pressures that you re seeing in opex and how you re offsetting them and then how could this outcome differ if at all in 2022 dan mcconnell okay so there s a couple of questions there so your first question is how we were able to offset costs there was a lot of covid related costs there was not as much obviously in 2020 but so but we did kind of rein that in a little bit in 2021 despite the payment that we the incremental payment that we gave our frontline staff so that was but otherwise there wasn t nearly the expense obviously there was for 2020 as far as how we re mitigating inflationary costs moving forward i think it s the same as everybody we re trying to on one part we re being very selective on what we pass through obviously not trying to keep gross profit dollars strong but obviously at some point to the extent of the rate as far as really offsetting some of the other inflationary pressures it s trying to look at different mix we have some different programs we have different programs on the type of product that we re selling we re creating more solutions less expensive solutions whether it be private label or other such items that we might be looking at to try and create some choices for our customers we do have initiatives that are controlling labor our labor optimization has been a big one as i mentioned to the last question so that s probably one of the bigger cost effective measures that we re looking at this year i d say in labor and then creating trying to avoid some of the inflationary pressures by finding solutions for our customers of maybe in the private label kind of sector and lower cost alternatives michael van aelst okay and then on nsa you talked about the large cargo door atr and in the in your annual report you also mentioned that it s kind of being used as a proof of concept what are you looking at in terms of metrics to determine if it s successful and if it is successful what would that mean for either future fleet expansion or upgrades to what you have now like swapping out things like that dan mcconnell okay there s two perspectives there there s a premium because of its uniqueness and the lack of supply for this type of option so for construction materials other larger sized cargo this is an option for that so you d get a better significantly better margin and there s also an efficiency play when dealing with north west freight in fact it s kind of along that same line that i was speaking about earlier with the labor optimization it s there s significant labor savings in the side door and how it interacts with our supply chain and with offloading into our stores so those are the efficiencies and the kpis are correlated to basically identifying the outcomes of those two hypotheses if you will so really cargo utilization efficiencies and just market value for having such an asset michael van aelst so if it continues to be successful would you be thinking of swapping some of your existing atrs into these large cargo door units or would you be just adding more planes dan mcconnell no well no it would be the prior it would be a conversion of some of our atrs into optimizing with a larger side door i mean unless hey look if demand spiked to a point that there was more demand than i forecast then we wouldn t be adverse to getting another plane to satisfy that demand but i don t see that happening that s not our current thinking thank you michael van aelst thanks very much and good quarter good year dan mcconnell thank you operator thank you we have no further questions at this time i would now like to turn the meeting back to mr mcconnell dan mcconnell no i think that s all i have operator so thank you everybody very much for attending and if there s any further questions obviously everybody knows that where we can be reached so please give us a shout operator thank you the conference has now ended please disconnect your lines at this time we thank you for your participation dan mcconnell thank you bye bye

russia ukraine war preventing food insecurity in nigeria assistant to the administrator in the bureau for resilience and food security u s agency for international development usaid dr jim barnhart the permanent representative of the u s mission to the un agencies in rome ambassador cindy mccain and the assistant to the administrator in the bureau for resilience and food security u s agency for international development usaid dr jim barnhart chart the path for nigeria and the rest of africa to escape food insecurity as a result of the russian ukrainian war writes united states bureau chief olukorede yishau the world food programme wfp feeds 138 million people in more than 80 countries including nigeria ethiopia and south sudan the middle east and africa get forty per cent of wheat and corn exports from ukraine now ukraine and russia are in a war situation and there are fears that a continuation of the war possesses a threat to nigeria and the rest of africa this threat to food security was the concern of the permanent representative of the u s mission to the un agencies in rome ambassador cindy mccain and the assistant to the administrator in the bureau for resilience and food security u s agency for international development usaid dr jim barnhart when they spoke at a virtual conference on tuesday april 5 they pointed out that the food and agriculture organisation fao estimates that as many as 13 million more people worldwide will be pushed into food insecurity as a result of russian ukrainian war dr barnhart who recently visited senegal and niger said the usaid was focusing on resilience and food security in the face of major shocks like the war in ukraine he added that putin s unprovoked and unjustified invasion of ukraine not only threatens the lives and livelihoods of everyday ukrainians but is already having substantial impact on the global food supply he explained with russia and ukraine as major suppliers of the world s exports and agriculture inputs such as fertiliser the effects of the war would reverberate for years to come according to him before the war the food security context was already bad due to the lasting covid 19 impacts ongoing humanitarian emergencies high global food prices and high fertiliser prices if not mitigated these price increases could result in significant increases in global poverty hunger and malnutrition particularly in regions like sub saharan africa and from the last global food crisis in 2007 and 2008 we saw the destabilising effect this can have on international order during that time food riots occurred in at least 14 african countries and even with the release of grain reserves or the cessation of hostilities the impacts will persist there will be irreversible effects on food production as farmers lack the resources and inputs to plant their spring and summer crops barnhart said for ambassador mccain refugee camps in rwanda kenya and some other parts of africa would also be touched by food insecurity adding that decisions must be made about the long term prospect for refugee camps dr barnhart said in east africa for instance nasa used their expertise on satellite imagery to map groundwater and other kinds of changes in climate and provide information to smallholder farmers through digital technology and so that s one way that we re doing that and we also then work in particular parts of the country parts of countries we call them zones of influence where we see that the overlay of climate change and poverty are causing these parts of these countries to get in potential crisis and so we bring in all sorts of technology as the ambassador noted and then other types of investments to try to help these communities not only get through these crisis but actually thrive in the long run and so that s what we re trying to do in east africa southern africa and west africa as well barnhart said dr barnhart said good water management could be helpful to grow better crops and could use less water and produce more it s a challenge though this is going to be a challenge within the short term for sure he urged the governments on the continent to avoid closing themselves off and stay open to trade allow markets to operate do not close off shipping routes to whether that be fertiliser seeds et cetera allow that movement of trade and then also be able to if needed reallocate resources to ensure that the most vulnerable are getting nutrition support required and other kinds of basic staples to allow them to get through this period it s going to be tough and i think the ambassador is quite right in stating that this is a period that is that none of us foresaw given the fact that this was an unprovoked war that has put us into a very difficult situation barnhart added on nigeria s ban of some food import to promote local production dr barnhart said the united states was trying to ensure that nigeria continues to export fertiliser and other products that it makes around the continent adding that a number of countries depend on trade with nigeria the idea of promoting local investments in agriculture products i think is a good one and i think we can have debates about the policy measures that are the best way to do that nigeria has chosen to do what s called an import substitution model where they ban imports of products to promote that we can discuss that i think the bottom line is that if the nigeria smallholder farmer is able to improve their quality of life then that would be something we d want to talk further about but it s an interesting it s an interesting idea he added the duo also looked at the effect of the war on fuel prices and fuel shortage and the role of the united states and the organisation of petroleum exporting countries opec dr barnhart said the issue of fuel price rises it has two it s impacting the market in two fundamental ways so in terms of a lot of the petroleum and gas products are turned into fertilizer so that s part of the problem in terms of the rising prices that we re seeing for fertiliser around the world and in some areas there s an issue of supply in parts of africa with fertiliser which then impacts the yields of and productivity of farmers across the continent and then secondly the higher fuel prices are increasing the cost of movement of agriculture products around the world correct so we re seeing two effects that are raising these prices addressing the best way forward in terms of improving the country s food security ambassador mccain urged citizens within the countries from all across africa to demand good leadership adding that the united states of america would be a great partner in trying to help dr barnhart added that one of the things that the united states had been trying to do with the feed the future and other usaid programmes was to build the capacity on the african continent on food security and nutrition and so i think one of the lessons learned i believe is that we need to continue to work with our partner countries u s government and other international partners and the un system to help them develop the capacity for production of these types of inputs so that you have some self sufficiency and it would still allow for the global markets to flourish and i think the idea of trade is incredibly important that we continue to maintain but also build that capacity so that the that ghana has the ability to withstand certain shocks so that is something that we continue to work on with our partners he said dr barnhart said it was a fair to consider the risk that other crises will be de prioritised particularly those impacted by food security as a result of the conflict in ukraine those of us in the development world are very much attempting to grapple with and address it s why in our as i said i was in a g7 meeting just yesterday on this particular issue with our food security partners within the g7 trying to ensure that a we ve got the best data and so a we need to know as quickly as possible but as thoroughly as possible where we re seeing the biggest crises at the moment we re still it s still early days in the crisis in terms of broader global food security issue right we re seeing price increases we re looking at supply where are the stocks particularly for staples and where are the stocks for fertilizer what are we looking at for the next the next growing cycle particularly on the african continent to make sure that we maintain the a laser like focus on those areas where we see the biggest threats for communities coming to the fore and so is there a possibility i would say that it s more a matter of trying to make sure that we maintain a focus on where those problem sets are and it s still early days yet for us to be able to try to figure out exactly where that would be but i guess we are definitely on the case it s my it s what keeps me up at night trying to make sure that we re staying on top of this crisis that is moving very quickly and is still and is still one that we re grappling with he explained
the recent intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc report states in its strongest terms yet the need for action to reduce emissions and one of the key strategies it outlines for policymakers is agroecology encompassing a range of techniques from intercropping to agroforestry agroecology is a solution that can contribute to both climate mitigation and adaptation the ipcc stressed based on traditional knowledge agroecology can solve multiple challenges at once including the biodiversity crisis and food insecurity as part of a special series top food systems author anna lappé discusses the power and promise of agroecology to mitigate and adapt to climate change the satellite imagery is staggering an antarctic ice shelf roughly the size of new york city collapsing into the ocean its demise captured and reported by nasa scientists in mid march was only the latest startling news from a region where temperatures have soared up to 40 celsius 72 fahrenheit above average from melting ice sheets to tornadoes ravaging new orleans and wildfires sweeping texas it s ever clearer that the climate crisis is here now in its sixth major report since 1990 the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc conveyed the urgency the scientific evidence is unequivocal climate change is a threat to human wellbeing and the health of the planet said ipcc working group ii co chair hans otto pörtner any further delay in concerted global action will miss a brief and rapidly closing window to secure a livable future responsible for roughly one third of the world s carbon emissions the global food system is one of the key places for transformative action among the 3 675 pages of working group ii s report on climate impacts adaptations and vulnerabilities the authors 270 of them from 67 countries share evidence for strategies that can be adopted rapidly to reduce the food system s climate impacts while strengthening resilience and improving health food security and the well being of food producers one strategy the ipcc highlights is agroecology defined in the report as a holistic approach to farming agroecology as a practice includes techniques such as intercropping and planting cover crops integrating livestock and trees into landscapes and deploying organic farming methods to enhance biodiversity and soil health while eliminating dependence on external inputs like pesticides and synthetic fertilizer it s a nature based solution that can contribute to both climate mitigation and adaptation the ipcc stresses it s also a solution grounded in an embrace of the human rights of indigenous and small scale producers as articulated in the 13 principles of agroecology from the united nation s high level panel of experts on food security and nutrition a science a practice and a movement while its principles trace back millennia agroecology s roots in academia originate in the 1920s and 1930s as agronomists increasingly looked at how farming and ecosystems could be integrated the term itself dates to mexico in the late 1970s it was there that a group of researchers were beginning to raise the alarm about a suite of relatively new agricultural practices being promoted there and in other key regions of the world dubbed the green revolution and underwritten initially by the rockefeller foundation the approach centered on high yielding hybrid seeds whose vigor was only possible with annual seed purchases and massive investments in irrigation systems along with heavy use of fossil fuel based fertilizers herbicides and other pesticides as liz carlisle a professor at the university of california santa barbara describes in healing grounds climate justice and the deep roots of regenerative farming mexican scientist efraím hernández xolocotzi mexican plant pathologist roberto garcía espinosa and californian ecologist steve gliessman were documenting how agricultural practices long embraced by indigenous mayan farmers in mesoamerica were producing high yields without the financial and ecological costs of green revolution methods as they spent time in the field the colleagues came to believe that these farmers approaches were far more effective than the ones being promoted by their own institution carlisle writes they decided to develop a new academic program one that would put these farmers voices front and center it was the summer of 1978 when they launched a master s degree program at the colegio superior de agricultura tropical the focus what they called agroecology from the beginning they grounded the concept in wisdom from indigenous communities and in the voices of farmers themselves echoes of this work reverberate in the ipcc report today whose authors stress agroecology s roots in indigenous and local knowledge around the world agroecology proponents are quick to underscore that the concept refers not simply to these agricultural practices and the academic field that has blossomed around them but as maywa montenegro an assistant professor in the department of environmental studies at the university of california santa cruz told mongabay the field of agroecology includes the academy but very importantly is not limited to it agroecology is a science practice and a movement shifting resources and local resilience while the new ipcc report helps underscore just how much potential agroecology holds the movement element of agroecology is critical because achieving the mitigation and adaptation potentials of agroecology will require major transformations in policy and a substantial shift in public and private resources the report shows what benefits could accrue from such a shift particularly for greater climate resilience by building healthy soil agroecological practices like agroforestry provide buffers against drought note the ipcc authors and reduce soil erosion during storms adopting agroforestry integrating trees into farming landscapes shelters stock and crops in heat waves and agroecology which emphasizes multi cropping leads to increased resilience to disease and pests say the authors with high confidence they write adoption of agroecology principles and practices will be highly beneficial to maintaining healthy productive food systems under climate change agroecology also significantly reduces food system emissions in one study the ipcc cites a european union wide shift toward agroecology would cut the region s emissions by 47 compared with 2010 levels without affecting its food security another cited study echoed this finding showing that these practices don t just hold yields steady but can actually increase them small scale farmers adopting agroecological practices across asia africa and latin america on farms of 2 hectares 5 acres or smaller saw their yields jump by 25 the resiliency benefits of agroecological practices in the face of the climate crisis have been well documented perhaps nowhere has this mattered more than in the philippines made up of more than 7 600 islands the country s geography has made it one of the most at risk from the climate crisis but leaders in the agroecology movement there have seen the results of decades of work cris panerio the national coordinator of a food and farming ngo called masipag at the forefront of that organizing told mongabay that their farmers have reported recovering faster after being hit by typhoons and floods extreme weather events made worse by the climate crisis compared with their conventional counterparts they credit agroecological practices including planting rice varieties their farmers have bred for adaptation to such conditions through farmer led and participatory rice breeding projects masipag has collected and developed more than 2 000 rice varieties since 1985 in contrast to the hybrid rice developed by irri or philrice panerio explained seeds that need to be purchased year after year and require synthetic inputs to deliver high yields masipag varieties can be saved and shared among farmers and flourish without pesticides or synthetic fertilizer today masipag farmers are independent from the formal rice breeding sector says panerio tapping their own seed banks and a central backup seed bank should they need it panerio s group fosters farmer to farmer learning emphasizing rice and habitat diversity in the rice fields of their members panerio describes fish ponds integrated with raised beds growing a variety of vegetables and livestock incorporated onto farms native forest and fruit trees are also included whenever possible you can only imagine the biomass from such a farm system panerio said with everything except the food itself and firewood turned into biofertilizers through composting or mulching all this adds up to a much smaller carbon footprint than that of a farm dependent on purchased seeds and fossil fuel based pesticides and fertilizer an explicit climate solution the benefits of such agroecological approaches led the authors of this ipcc report to emphasize their feasibility and effectiveness as a climate solution as cornell university professor rachel bezner kerr a coordinating lead author on the chapter on food fiber and ecosystem products told mongabay previous ipcc reports have mentioned agroecology but this report is highlighting the emerging and increased evidence around agroecology as an adaptation and mitigation solution indeed agroecology is mentioned throughout the report including in the chapter on health and importantly bezner kerr notes it s included in the summary report for policymakers for bezner kerr this is a sign of the deeper understanding of humanity s dependence on biodiversity and healthy ecosystems agroecology is one of those strategies that links people to nature in a very explicit way it s this dependency bezner kerr has been documenting through decades of research in partnership with farming communities particularly in malawi where she s been conducting fieldwork in partnership with a local nonprofit as part of a 22 year long research collaboration when reached by skype bezner kerr described the work there partnering with farmers to document food security nutrition and biodiversity on the landscapes where farmers have adopted agroecology approaches bezner kerr emphasized that this is exactly the kind of participatory learning the report lauds the report emphasizes the evidence that inclusive adaptation strategies are essential and agroecology is one of those approaches that emphasizes co knowledge production participatory and inclusive methods it s not just about adding compost to soil it s much more than that for agroecology critics a common charge is that it cannot scale but bezner kerr argues it s quite the opposite agroecology lends itself to scaling out because it relies on farmer to farmer methodologies local knowledge available resources and adaptation to local context indeed many agroecological efforts around the world operate across significant landscape scales panerio s organization in the philippines includes a network of hundreds of organizations reaching 30 000 farmers directly and roughly three times as many through those farmers relationships in another example community managed natural farming efforts in andhra pradesh india now include 700 000 farmer participants globally la via campesina which was founded in the mid 1990s now represents more than 300 million smallholder farmers pastoralists fisherfolks indigenous peoples agricultural and food workers landless peoples women youth consumers urban food insecure people and ngos in his 1981 book the gift of good land u s farmer and poet wendell berry urged us to address our thorniest crises by solving for pattern a poetic phrase for systems thinking solving for pattern is a call for solutions that create a cascade of co benefits agroecology is just such a solution for those farmers in the philippines it has meant resilience in the face of extreme climate shocks while producing nourishing food for their own communities and achieving independence from expensive inputs for the farmers bezner kerr is working with in malawi it means agricultural approaches that boost local biodiversity not diminish it the counterpoint what my mother frances moore lappé and i called solving by dissection in our book hope s edge is the tactic of applying a technical fix to a discrete aspect of a crisis without considering the whole and triggering a cascade of consequences as berry wrote such a solution is dangerous because it acts destructively upon the larger patterns in which it is contained it acts destructively upon those patterns because it is formed in ignorance or disregard of them for years the ipcc has warned against solve by dissection responses to the climate crisis and in this latest report the authors underscore the concern even more clearly as maarten van aalst a contributing lead author noted we have explicitly added the notion that responses to climate change can generate significant risks of their own maladaptation inadvertently creating or aggravating risks for bezner kerr a food system maladaptation would be the rush to respond to droughts by promoting irrigation for example in the short term irrigation can reduce climate risks for producers and consumers she said but if done in an area with limited groundwater and with capital intensive irrigation it can lead to groundwater depletion salinization and worsening inequalities and debt loads for small scale producers in contrast agroecology can help farmers thrive in drought conditions by using seeds bred for drought tolerance building soil organic matter so the land can retain more water or using swales and other techniques to capture rainfall all of which are good for the ecosystem and for the farmer panerio sees maladaptation in the promotion of glyphosate based herbicides like roundup to reduce plowing and thus soil carbon loss while glyphosate can reduce the need to till for weed control panerio has seen the consequences of widespread use of this herbicide setting aside its health risks which are now widely known the introduction of genetically engineered corn and other crops resistant to glyphosate the two are marketed together heavily traps farmers in debt corn farmers get their inputs from traders the same people who buy the farmers corn panerio said in the end the traders profit two ways one from the sale of inputs engineered corn seeds pesticides and fertilizer and the other for the low price of the corn he also sees the ecosystem impacts the widespread use of glyphosate causes soil erosion year round in the dry season areas sprayed with glyphosate have no vegetation and are devastated by wind erosion panerio said in the wet seasons the topsoil is washed away by rain after the corn is harvested mounting evidence and growing momentum for agroecology advocates its multiple benefits are its superpower as this latest ipcc report documents evidence of these benefits continues to mount other recent studies have pulled together evidence from the field including the politics of knowledge from the global alliance for the future of food which emphasizes how small farmers and indigenous peoples are co creators and scientists in demonstrating agroecology s impact disclosure the foundation where the writer works is a member of the network worldwide the momentum for agroecology is growing within the academy and beyond since the first academic agroecology program launched in 1978 the field has exploded there are now dozens of agroecology schools and programs around the world ucsc s montenegro notes the sustainable agriculture education association s growing list of degree granting programs in agroecology as well as applied student farm programs where students learn experientially her own university has had a long standing esteemed agroecology program and recently launched a new agroecology major even in the united states where the vast majority of agricultural land goes to high input commodity production and half of all corn is diverted to ethanol there is palpable excitement about the resurgent interest in agroecology montenegro said the movement beyond the walls of the academy is growing too its advocates know however that for agroecology to really take hold it will require a significant transformation of how agriculture is financed and incentivized and where research dollars go today relatively little public and private funding is geared to these approaches one study found that among european donors less than 15 of agricultural budgets were directed toward agroecological approaches among philanthropies focused on climate solutions food systems funding has historically been a tiny fraction with agroecology representing even less that is changing too with efforts like the agroecology fund and other networks within philanthropy promoting agroecological solutions given the very limited investment in agroecological research and implementation to date bezner kerr said the fact that there is such evidence points to even greater potential should it be given more investment and attention by governments and other groups interested in adaptation and mitigation solutions this is one of the reasons why it s important advocates stress that agroecology be considered holistically it s not just what happens on the farm it s the social movements needed to move policy and shift power into the hands of farmers themselves nearly half a century ago when those researchers sought a way to describe the practices they were documenting in the fields of indigenous farmers in rural mexico the term agroecology resonated today it s a concept that

paris after plummeting in value following russia s invasion of ukraine the ruble has clawed its way back to its pre war levels but this should be of little comfort to the kremlin because the factors that drove the ruble s rebound augur additional problems for russia s economic performance the west has exhibited near unprecedented unity and resolve in its response to russian president vladimir putin s war on ukraine within just three days of the invasion western governments had frozen much of the russian central bank s foreign currency reserves within their respective jurisdictions this move triggered financial panic within russia and spurred a powerful policy response on february 28 the central bank imposed strict capital controls tightened currency trading restrictions and hiked its key policy rate from 9 5 per cent to 20 per cent russia s government then ordered all russian exporters to repatriate and exchange 80 per cent of their export revenues for rubles and the central bank introduced a 30 per cent commission later reduced to 12 per cent on foreign currency purchases various categories of buyers were banned from purchasing us dollars and holders of foreign currency denominated bank deposits faced major constraints withdrawing their savings despite this swift policy response however the ruble s official exchange rate moved from 81 rubles per dollar before the war to 139 per dollar on march 9 though the black market rate reportedly was much higher inflation accelerated substantially with the growth rate of the official consumer price index rising to 2 per cent per week 181 per cent in annual terms in the first three weeks of the war before slowing to 1 per cent per week 68 per cent per year the ruble has since returned to the 80 per dollar range but its appreciation is not necessarily real if a currency s trade is severely restricted its exchange rate does not reflect its market value during the soviet era the communist party s flagship newspaper pravda consistently reported that the ruble s official exchange rate was 0 6 per dollar but nobody viewed that as a proxy for the currency s real strength to be sure there are tangible signs that the pressure on the ruble is subsiding late last week the central bank removed the 12 per cent fee for purchasing dollars relaxed certain limitations for currency denominated deposits and most importantly cut its policy rate from 20 per cent to 17 per cent while signalling further easing to come these actions speak louder than any official statements about the strength of the russian economy even so growth projections for russia this year remain bleak according to the central bank gdp will decline by 8 per cent this year before the war it was expected to increase by 2 4 per cent the institute of international finance predicts a 15 per cent fall in gdp while the european bank for reconstruction and development and most international investment banks forecast a 10 per cent recession the head of russia s accounts chamber alexei kudrin agrees the ruble s recent appreciation does not invalidate these pessimistic views because the exchange rate s recovery is merely a reflection of unprecedented restrictions on imports and higher oil and gas prices western governments have imposed severe sanctions on technology exports to russia which have been reinforced by a private sector boycott with more than 600 western companies having withdrawn from russia households and enterprises have lost access to many imported consumer goods and intermediate inputs at home while airspace closures and boycotts by airbus boeing and major insurers and leasing companies have made it all but impossible for russians to travel to the west because these restrictions have substantially reduced russian demand for imports note economists oleg itskhoki and dmitry mukhin they have also lowered demand for dollars which are needed to purchase such goods thereby driving the ruble s exchange rate upward but that is not good news for russia s economy which is bound to slow down just as the covid 19 pandemic forced firms around the world to reckon with their dependence on global supply chains putin s war has shown russian enterprises that they cannot function without imports even those that source their supplies domestically have come to realise that their suppliers depend on imports from the west that is why russia s automotive industry has ground to a halt with sales in march falling to a third of their level in march 2021 moreover the demand for dollars has been further reduced by financial sanctions that essentially outlaw russia s use of dollars even to pay off its dollar denominated debt these measures have already resulted in a technical sovereign default the second factor driving the ruble s appreciation is the high price of oil which has returned to its 2014 levels back then the ruble was trading at 38 per dollar or 52 per dollar in today s prices after adjusting for inflation in both russia and the united states today s oil prices thus imply the possibility of further ruble appreciation save for the fact that geopolitical risk and capital flight have made the ruble weaker than it otherwise might have been today s exchange rate indicates that russia s balance of payments is strongly supported by current oil prices which implies that fiscal performance is holding up well too while the early sanctions froze much of putin s stock of cash high oil prices have ensured substantial daily inflows but this too could become a problem for putin as eu high representative for foreign affairs and security policy josep borrell recently pointed out the eu has sent 35 billion euros 38 1 billion to russia since the start of the war but just 1 billion euros in aid to ukraine this appalling disparity has not been lost on european leaders as the growing support for an oil and gas embargo attests in fact europeans are already speaking about the embargo not in terms of if but rather in terms of when an eu wide decision to stop importing russian oil and gas will have catastrophic consequences for russia s federal budget and make the ruble s recent recovery unsustainable

suzhou china and rockville md april 13 2022 prnewswire ascentage pharma 6855 hk a global biopharmaceutical company engaged in developing novel therapies for cancers chronic hepatitis b chb and age related diseases today announced that it has presented the latest results from six preclinical studies of the company s five investigational drug candidates the bcl 2 inhibitor lisaftoclax apg 2575 and the mdm2 p53 inhibitor alrizomadlin apg 115 two key candidates in the company s apoptosis targeted pipeline as well as the fak inhibitor apg 2449 the eed inhibitor apg 5918 and the kras inhibitor apg 1842 at the 2022 american association for cancer research aacr annual meeting the aacr annual meeting is one of the world s largest and long standing scientific gatherings in the field of cancer research covering cutting edge advances in all the areas of cancer research and innovation the annual event attracts tremendous interest from the global cancer research community dr yifan zhai chief medical officer of ascentage pharma said at this year s aacr annual meeting we presented preclinical data that support potential combination approaches between our lead candidates with drugs of different targets and mechanism of actions these studies represent our ongoing effort in addressing important unmet medical needs in cancer treatment it is worth pointing out that the results from three preclinical studies of the mdm2 p53 inhibitor alrizomadlin have demonstrated broad therapeutic potential and highlighted a novel mechanism of action meanwhile we also reported encouraging results supporting the upcoming clinical development of the eed inhibitor apg 5918 we will actively advance these programs to bring meaningful clinical benefits to patients the details of these posters presented at aacr 2022 are as follows drug candidate presentation title abstract lisaftoclax alrizomadlin co targeting mdm2 p53 and bcl 2 apoptosis pathways overcomes resistance conferred by acquired bcl 2 gene mutations in preclinical models 3964 alrizomadlin inhibition of mdm2 p53 interaction by alrizomadlin apg 115 induces pyroptotic cell death in gasdermin e gsdme expressing cancer cells 2998 mdm2 inhibitor alrizomadlin apg 115 stabilizes p53 and synergizes with proteasome inhibitors in multiple myeloma 5439 apg 2449 fak inhibitor apg 2449 and cdk4 6 inhibitor palbociclib synergistically suppress mesothelioma tumor growth via autophagy induction 2563 apg 5918 preclinical development of embryonic ectoderm development eed inhibitor apg 5918 eedi 5273 for cancer therapy 3939 apg 1842 development of covalent krasg12c inhibitor apg 1842 for the treatment of solid tumors 2664 co targeting mdm2 p53 and bcl 2 apoptosis pathways overcomes resistance conferred by acquired bcl 2 gene mutations in preclinical models abstract poster number 3964 introduction the bcl 2 inhibitor venetoclax although efficacious in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia meets significant resistance in a large number of patients due to acquired bcl 2 gene mutations among acquired mutations those proximal to bh3 binding motifs e g g101v d103e and v156d have the most significant impact on bcl 2 binding to bh3 only pro death proteins and bh3 mimetics e g venetoclax hence it is important to identify novel therapeutics that address this emerging unmet need conclusions our study demonstrates alrizomadlin combined with lisaftoclax synergistically inhibited the proliferation of rs4 11 bcl 2 mutant cell lines and the growth of cell derived xenografts in vivo co targeting bcl 2 and mdm2 p53 apoptosis pathways represents a new and effective strategy to overcome drug resistance conferred by clinically bcl 2 gene mutations inhibition of mdm2 p53 interaction by alrizomadlin apg 115 induces pyroptotic cell death in gasdermin e gsdme expressing cancer cells abstract poster number 2998 introduction the mouse double minute 2 mdm2 p53 inhibitor alrizomadlin apg 115 is an investigational agent known to induce apoptosis of tp53 wild type cancer cells aguilar et al j med chem 2017 emerging evidence suggests that activation of p53 by alrizomadlin also promotes antitumor immunity in the tumor microenvironment fang et al jitc 2019 zhou et al nat immunol 2021 but the links between these processes are not yet completely understood pyroptosis refers to inflammatory programmed cell death central to this process is the family of gasdermins which can form pores in cell plasma membranes resulting in lysis and release of immune stimulants in cells expressing these proteins gsdme can be cleaved by caspase 3 which converts noninflammatory apoptosis to pyroptosis zhang et al nature 2020 in this context caspase 3 gsdme appears to represent a switch between apoptosis and pyroptosis given that alrizomadlin elicits its apoptogenic activity primarily by activating caspase 3 we hypothesized that the mdm2 p53 inhibitor might also induce pyroptosis in gsdme expressing cells by cleaving caspases conclusions our study demonstrates that in addition to apoptosis mdm2 p53 inhibitor alrizomadlin induces caspase mediated pyroptosis in gsdme expressing cancer cells in this study we reveal for the first time that apoptosis inducing alrizomadlin induces both apoptosis and pyroptosis in gsdme expressing cancer cells gsdme dependent pyroptosis is a previously unrecognized mechanism of action for alrizomadlin to exert antitumor immunity with potentially important implications for clinical development of therapy involving mdm2 p53 inhibition mdm2 inhibitor alrizomadlin apg 115 stabilizes p53 and synergizes with proteasome inhibitors in multiple myeloma abstract poster number 5439 introduction multiple myeloma mm accounts for about 2 of all cancers and 18 of all hematologic malignancies in the us recent therapeutic advances e g immunomodulators proteasome inhibitors monoclonal antibodies have improved outcomes but mm inevitably relapses and is considered incurable genomic analysis shows that the tp53 gene encoding tumor suppressor protein p53 is infrequently mutated in patients with mm of whom about 82 retain wildtype wt tp53 mouse double minute 2 mdm2 is an e3 ubiquitin ligase that inhibits p53 via proteasome degradation proteasome inhibitors might help to stabilize p53 and synergize with mdm2 inhibitors therefore mdm2 inhibitors that activate p53 might constitute an attractive pharmacologic approach to mm alrizomadlin is an investigational novel small molecule targeting the p53 mdm2 interaction and is in clinical development for solid and hematologic cancers this study aimed to evaluate whether alrizomadlin can potentiate the antitumor effects of proteasome inhibitors in mm conclusions the results demonstrate that the combination of mdm2 inhibitor alrizomadlin and proteasome inhibitors have synergistic antitumor effects on mm tumors harboring wt tp53 in animal models these data warrant clinical studies to test this novel therapeutic option for patients with refractory mm fak inhibitor apg 2449 and cdk4 6 inhibitor palbociclib synergistically suppress mesothelioma tumor growth via autophagy induction abstract poster number 2563 introduction malignant mesothelioma is a rare but highly lethal malignancy with a 5 year survival rate of less than 10 among the most common genomic abnormalities are alterations of cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor 2a b cdkn2a b and neurofibromin 2 nf2 mesothelioma cells lacking expression of cdkn2a b or nf2 are reported to be sensitive to cdk4 6 or focal adhesion kinase fak inhibition in this study apg 2449 as a clinical stage fak alk ros1 multi kinase inhibitor combined with cdk4 6 inhibitor palbociclib demonstrated anti tumor activity conclusions these results demonstrate that the combination of palbociclib and apg 2449 synergistically inhibits tumor growth in mesothelioma and such effect is mediated by induced autophagy and enhanced cellular senescence the preclinical study suggests that apg 2449 combined with cdk4 6 inhibitors may have therapeutic potential in mesothelioma and may warrant future clinical development preclinical development of embryonic ectoderm development eed inhibitor apg 5918 eedi 5273 for cancer therapy abstract poster number 3939 introduction three core components constitute the polycomb repressive complex 2 prc2 a multiprotein complex that catalyzes the methylation of histone h3 at lysine 27 h3k27me3 enhancer of zeste homolog 2 ezh2 embryonic ectoderm development eed and suppressor of zeste 12 protein homolog suz12 dysregulated function of prc2 has been implicated in the development of a variety of cancer types with the use of tazemetostat an ezh2 inhibitor inhibition of prc2 functions has been proven to be a successful cancer therapeutic strategy nevertheless the activity of an ezh2 inhibitor might be compensated due to acquired resistance through secondary mutations in ezh2 or its paralog ezh1 because binding of eed with trimethylated h3k27 h3k27me3 is the prerequisite for the activation of the methyltransferase activity of ezh2 allosterically targeting eed is emerging as a novel approach to inhibit prc2 apg 5918 eedi 5273 has been reported as a novel bioactive and potent eed inhibitor in this study we further characterized apg 5918 for cancer therapy in a preclinical setting conclusions apg 5918 was thoroughly characterized in the preclinical stage with potent biochemical binding activity to eed protein in vitro anti proliferatively activity and in vivo antitumor activities apg 5918 showed definitive in vitro and in vivo target engagement and on target antitumor activity apg 5918 demonstrated strong pd pk correlation in mice bearing karpas 422 xenograft tumors apg 5918 appeared to be similar or more potent than mak683 an eed inhibitor under clinical development in terms of biochemical in vitro and in vivo activities in summary our results suggest potential utility of apg 5918 in cancer therapy and it deserves further clinical investigation development of covalent krasg12c inhibitor apg 1842 for the treatment of solid tumors abstract poster number 2664 introduction the kras gene is frequently mutated in human cancers and the krasg12c mutation occurs in approximately 13 of non small cell lung cancers nsclcs and in 1 to 3 of colorectal cancers and other solid tumors krasg12c small molecule inhibitors amg510 and mrtx849 have been investigated as treatment options for solid tumors with the kras g12c mutation in this study apg 1842 was characterized as a potent selective and covalent krasg12c inhibitor with demonstrated inhibition on kras dependent signaling and anti tumor activity both in vitro and in vivo conclusions collectively these results demonstrate that apg 1842 is a potent bioavailable and highly selective krasg12c inhibitor our data provide the preclinical evidence for clinical development of apg 1842 in patients with krasg12c mutant solid

chinese and us flags flutter outside the building of an american company in beijing jan 21 2021 market upbeat despite us identifying 12 chinese firms for possible delisting china and the united states could still find a way out of the ongoing audit dispute regarding us listed chinese companies despite the us securities and exchange commission adding 12 such companies to a provisional delisting list on tuesday experts said on wednesday the 12 chinese companies were identified to face delisting risks in accordance with the us holding foreign companies accountable act if the 12 companies fail to provide evidence within 15 business days that they still meet us requirements for listed companies they will likely be conclusively identified under the hfcaa and may have to delist in 2024 unconfirmed reports suggested the 15 day period would end on may 3 the list includes sohu com ltd a prominent name in china s media and entertainment industry other companies include noah holdings ltd a wealth and asset management service provider and china automotive systems inc a power steering components and systems supplier the move marked the fourth batch of chinese issuers to face such action in the previous three batches 11 companies figured in the provisional delisting list since march with five being moved to the conclusive delisting list most of the 12 companies identified on tuesday closed in the red on tuesday with sohu down 0 68 percent to 19 01 on nasdaq some observers cautioned the market should not interpret tuesday s sec move as a worsening of the audit issue ren zeyu an associate professor at the china university of political science and law in beijing said it is not a surprise that more chinese firms are added to the delisting list as us authorities routinely implement the hfcaa and the list could further grow in the near future being added to the list does not necessarily lead to delisting in 2024 as china and us regulators are still seeking solutions to the audit dispute ren said on the other hand the growing delisting list indeed highlights the pressure on both sides to resolve the dispute before 2024 the hfcaa which was enacted in 2020 allows the sec to delist foreign companies from us exchanges if they are found to be not in compliance with us audit requirements for three consecutive years chinese issuers listed in the us have since landed in a dilemma if they should comply with domestic laws or open their audit books to us regulators china has made headway in resolving the dispute by launching a draft revision of confidentiality rules for overseas listing on april 2 this is expected to pave the way for possible on site inspections related to us listed chinese companies auditing work that are acceptable to both sides experts said the draft revision released by the china securities regulatory commission and other authorities scraps a requirement that on site inspections should be mainly conducted by chinese regulators or rely on their inspection results the revised provisions indicate china s willingness to collaborate with but not necessarily lead cross border audit inspection in contrast to the previous version said a morgan stanley report with the draft revised provisions reflecting china s proactive moves the likelihood of a final agreement being reached over the audit dispute is now higher the report said yet experts still called for positive responses from the us to promote a final resolution of the dispute which will be in the interests of both the companies and international investors concerned dong dengxin director of the wuhan university of science and technology s finance and securities institute said the delisting and compliance risks facing us listed chinese companies cannot be mitigated as long as the hfcaa remains effective for these companies to avoid the risks the ultimate choice would be to shift their listing venues to other exchanges such as those in hong kong and the chinese mainland or to go private dong said shi jing in shanghai and kaifusai julaiti in beijing contributed to this story
photo taken on nov 23 2021 shows the white house in washington dc the united states us banks have pulled out of russia in the wake of various sanctions but some wall street firms are taking advantage of the sell off in russian bonds to make a quick buck under sanctions imposed by the us government against russia us companies are prohibited from buying russian government bonds directly from major russian financial institutions but the treasury department issued a memo saying it is legal to trade russian assets on the secondary market the memo shows the us government s friendliness to wall street leaving a back door for its arbitrage no wonder the trading volumes in russian corporate debt have risen to a two year high since the outbreak of the ukraine conflict taking advantage of crises for arbitrage is something that wall street is very good at when the european debt crisis erupted for example ireland was the hardest hit zone but templeton global bond fund bet that the european union would bail it out so it bought a 10th of ireland s sovereign debt and gained tremendous profits with russia s financial system severely tested by sanctions wall street is not going to pass up the opportunity to make a quick profit although wall street firms said they were giving up on the russian market they haven t wall street has 10 billion of exposure to russian bonds alone as well as a large exposure to traditional russian financial businesses even if the wall street companies violate the us government sanctions the fine they need to pay is only a small fraction of their profits in other words the us led sanctions are comparable to an order banning companies from other countries to trade with the sanction targets reserving the target markets for us companies only wall street has various means for arbitrage usually it combines such approaches as credit default swaps which refers to financial derivatives that allow an investor to swap or offset their credit risk with that of another investor buying low and selling high of russian corporate stock equity and bonds and acting as a middleman earning brokerage fees by brokering deals between investors eager to dump russian bonds as well as hedge funds willing to take risks in the name of helping clients manage their exposure but if there is a russian debt default it will render the wall street buys worthless with the larger risk that since different countries hold nearly 100 billion in russian sovereignty debt a debt default by russia would have systematic repercussions for the global financial system and economy

the overnight rate to one per cent the bank also increased its projection for gdp growth to 4 2 per cent this year from the initial four per cent laid out in its january monetary policy report and bumped up inflation expectations to a 5 3 per cent average from 4 2 per cent these revisions come as little surprise given all that s transpired since the previous estimates were released in january mendes wrote notably however the bank of canada is more optimistic on growth in 2023 than us as we see rate hikes biting earlier and more acutely desjardins sees room for further tightening into next

updated its estimates for neutral interest rates from a range of 1 75 2 75 per cent to a range of two to three per cent we believe that the bank will get the policy rate to at least the low end of

americans wages have dropped by almost 3 percent under president joe biden s high migration big spending policies according to data presented by one of president barack obama s top economists inflation ran 8 5 in the year ending last month while nominal wages grew only 5 6 a decline in inflation adjusted wages of 2 7 jason furman at harvard university wrote in a wall street journal article that is a larger decline than any pre pandemic year in the last forty years he said in an april 12 tweet americans disposable income fell because prices inflated faster than wages rose prices rose by a shocking 8 5 percent while wages rose by an impressive 5 6 percent republicans are spotlighting the economic damage for example a message from the republican national committee pointed out fact real average hourly earnings are down 2 7 and real average weekly earnings are down 3 6 fact bidenflation is costing americans 433 per month just to maintain the same level of living but establishment experts rarely mention the impact of mass migration on americans wages and housing furman for example keeps a narrow focus on dollar inflation not the impact of biden s other economic policies since january 2020 biden has largely opened the nation s borders to a wave of roughly 2 million migrant workers and families that huge inflow of legal immigrants illegal immigrants quasi legal asylum seekers and visa workers inflates the u s economy for investors ceos and tax collectors that policy will re inflate the two decade long cheap labor bubble that was burst in 2020 by president donald trump s policies for example the new migrants need homes so they are helping to inflate rents and revenues for housing investors nationwide rent prices have increased significantly year over year said a report by rent com released march 15 one and two bedroom rents were up 24 4 percent and 21 8 percent respectively the inflow of job seeking migrants also reduces wage growth because employers no longer have to offer wages increases to find willing american workers said rob law the director of regulatory affairs and policy for the center for immigration studies if you have a tight labor market then wages go up because employers must outbid each other to hire willing americans he said but employers have a government subsidy in the form of a basically unlimited combination of legal pseudo legal and just blatantly illegal workers he said inflation and immigration are the one two punch that cripples american workers take home pay law said cheap labor migration also reduces high tech investment by companies and farms the result is that some u s companies use stoop labor instead of american made machines ricardo shared a video picking sweet potatoes in mississippi workers are bent over for hours picking the vegetable in cold wet muddy conditions wefeedyou pic twitter com slb6ojhzqm united farm workers ufwupdates april 12 2022 economists and reporters ignore the economic impact of the government s long standing economic policy of inflating the economy with imported workers renters and consumers law said it s an across the board economic impact when you have a surplus of workers there s an increase in demand for housing in certain areas there is a decrease in the ability to get certain preferred supplies or food stock when you are importing a whole new wave of people across the board americans are finding themselves worse off with their pay their job opportunities their housing even healthcare in the form of longer lines the professional class likes to pretend that immigration is really only about humanitarian stuff and naturalizations immigration has a direct impact on every aspect of our american society from the economy from taxes from public services which is why it s so critically important that you consider what the levels are too much of it legal or illegal is collectively a net loss to communities furman recognized the value of a tight labor market where employers must compete for workers saying there are good reasons to run a hot economy bringing in workers whom employers would normally be reluctant to hire those with say a past felony conviction a disability or lower educational attainment is genuinely wonderful but in economics all good things don t always go together millions of new jobs don t necessarily lead to higher pay for the 150 million workers who are already employed hot economies allow inflation because employers can easily and quickly raise prices faster than wages he argued with so many eager customers businesses can charge higher prices which goes up more the bargaining power of workers or the pricing power of businesses is theoretically ambiguous he said the lesson he said is that federal policy should not overheat the economy by piling on spending programs back in 2016 when he was working for obama furman admitted that government policy had a devastating impact on americans because it pushed many millions of americans perhaps 20 million men out of the labor market into poverty and onto charity and welfare this is caused by policies and institutions not by technology admitted jason furman an economist who chairs the president s council of economic advisors we shouldn t accept it as inevitable he told a brookings institute expert dave wessel on august 10 the activists who want more immigration seized on the bad inflation news to argue that the government should extract more migrants from poor countries catherine rampell for example is a pro migration op ed writer for the washington post who tried to argue on april 11 that more immigration would make biden less unpopular democrats are terrified that a coming border surge might tank their midterm chances but they have largely ignored a much more serious immigration related political risk the problem in the months ahead isn t that the united states will allow in too many immigrants it s that we ll admit too few particularly the kinds of workers who can fill critical labor market shortages rampell princeton 07 is a persistent advocate for the colonization style extraction of human resources from foreign countries for use in the u s economy that is good for ceos but especially good for clever investors such as her harvard graduate brother who works for andreessen horowitz an investment firm in silicon valley meanwhile polls show that immigration is helping to wreck the democrats standing in the polls breitbart news reported on april 11 a cbs news yougov poll shows that even when americans are not told the current level of overall immigration to the u s where more than a million green cards are awarded more than a million temporary visas are allotted and hundreds of thousands of illegal aliens are added to the population annually they continue to back reductions and limits over expansions and uncontrolled migration the poll asks americans what do you think u s immigration policy should generally be about 61 percent of americans said some immigration should be allowed but based on strict criteria suggesting an overall reduction with a more rigorous vetting and assimilation policy about 19 percent of americans said they want to stop most or all immigration to the u s while 20 percent said allow a lot of immigration including most or all people who want to enter suggesting support for an open border policy realclearpolitics com reported on april 12 that a sample of recent polls shows that biden s immigration policy is backed by just 35 percent of americans and is opposed by 59 percent also multiple democratic legislators are protesting as biden is scheduled to open the southern border on may 23 to all economic migrants who claim they are seeking asylum

tickers nau nauff 5e50 source streetwise reports 4 13 22 if you re looking for epic gold deposits in america you probably want to start in nevada home to the carlin and cortez trends and the country s top gold mines one junior explorer is hitting long intercepts of oxide gold mineralization at its flagship gold project in nevada and it is becoming a real butte nevgold team inside the golden butte pit at the limousine butte project in nevada from left senior geologist robert springs president and ceo brandon bonifacio and chief geologist derick unger source nevgold corp drill results from nevgold corp s nau tsx nauff otc 5e50 fse limousine butte project in nevada are driving up the company s share price as the nevada based gold explorer continues to find long intercepts of oxide gold mineralization nevgold shares closed out march at ca 0 57 apiece but popped to close at 0 82 on april 6 after telling the market drill hole cv22 001 intercepted 0 86 gram per tonne gold 0 86 g t au in oxide mineralization over 175 2 meters between 212 and 387 2 meters down hole cv22 001 includes a higher grade 58 2 meter interval grading 2 13 g t au and an even sweeter interval inside that interval of 12 32 g t gold over 5 9 meters the company says the gold is contained in oxide mineralization which would make recovering the gold easier and more importantly cheaper this is an excellent start of the program and as nevgold has added a second drill rig to the 10 000 meter drill program we should now see a rather continuous news flow of additional assay results with the next batch of drill results being released within the next few weeks wrote thibaut lepouttre in his caesars report newsletter the good news doesn t end there sister hole cv22 002 some 700 meters away hit a strikingly similar 0 83 g t au in oxides over 126 2 meters between 127 4 meters and 253 meters down hole and cv22 03 hit 94 4 meters running 0 23 g t gold starting at roughly 60 metres down hole these encouraging holes from the cadillac valley target area at limousine butte now extend the mineralization over 1 kilometer along strike and another 400 meters laterally the mineralization is also trending shallower which again simplifies gold recovery so far all the holes drilled at cadillac valley have hit oxide mineralization that shouldn t come as a surprise given that limousine butte sits in nevada s prolific carlin trend which produces the lion s share of america s gold annually more drill results from nevgold s initial drill program at limousine butte will be released in the coming weeks clear near term goals chief executive officer brandon bonifacio has clear near term goals for the project based on our market cap today of approximately ca 30 million if we can get to that one million ounce mark and beyond our peers are trading at ca 85 per ounce so from where we are today that s a clear three times re rating from a valuation standpoint that s our goal for the next couple of months to extract that value based on the current drilling and driving to that resource bonifacio told streetwise reports he added that a 1 million ounce resource would not bake in any resource expansion or exploration upside bonifacio plans to advance limousine butte through to a prefeasibility study in the next 12 18 months which is when the story will start to attract the eyeballs of potential suitors looking at gold projects in nevada drill target map at nevgold s limousine butte gold project in nevada source nevgold corp about 2 kilometers northeast of cadillac valley nevgold is also drilling its resurrection ridge target both targets are part of limousine butte one drill hole at resurrection ridge published by nevgold earlier this year hit 61 6 meters running 2 19 g t au

on any production from limousine butte while mcewen mining inc mux tsx mux nyse holds another 0 5 royalty at home in nevada the team at nevgold should feel at home in nevada giulio bonifacio father to brandon founded nevada copper in 2005 and served as president and ceo as the junior de risked and developed the pumpkin hollow iron oxide copper project near yerington nev into a producing asset the

before agnico eagle mines ltd aem tsx aem nyse and yamana bought it for ca 4 1 billion ca 4 1b in 2014 a lot of the group has worked together before and we have decades of experience advancing mining projects in the state of nevada this gives us a significant competitive advantage compared to our peers as we know how to get things done in an efficient low cost manner when you consider the assay labs drill rig operators permitting officials etc bonifacio told streetwise cedar wash and ptarmigan elsewhere in nevada nevgold holds the cedar wash gold property a grassroots discovery made by mcewen mining in 2015 mcewen mining still holds a 2 5 royalty on the property but that can be bought down to 1 in 0 5 increments totalling 1 75m about 7 000 meters of shallow reverse circulation drilling were completed at cedar wash by mcewen mining in 2016 2017 the best result returned 10 7 meters running 2 g t gold but a lot of the drilling was only down to about 30 to 40 meters below

there s about a 40 free trading float that works out to give or take 20 million shares of the outstanding 50 million we ve had good volume for a smaller company after putting out our drill results

a growing baby formula shortage has retailers like target and walmart limiting purchases leaving parents to make multiple trips just to confront empty shelves in the wake of a recent recall by abbott laboratories in february abbott recalled powdered formula manufactured at a michigan plant after several babies fell ill with bacterial infections and two died according to the u s food drug administration the recall compounded existing inventory troubles due to supply chain snarls and ingredient shortages brought on by the pandemic now families in some parts of the country are finding formula tough to come by we know that this recall has further exacerbated an industrywide infant formula supply shortage we are doing everything we can to address it abbott told the washington post in a statement including ramping up production of similac air freighting in product from europe and working with health care providers to identify alternative formulas walgreens and cvs are both limiting formula purchases to three per transaction online or in stores the companies told the washington post while target told the post it is limiting online formula purchases to four units per item costco representatives declined to comment but a two pack for one brand being sold on its website was capped at two per order due to increased demand and various supplier challenges infant and toddler formulas are seeing constraint across the country scott goldberg director of corporate communications at walgreens boots alliance told the post in an email similar to other retailers we put into effect purchase limits of three per transaction on all infant and toddler formula to help improve inventory we continue to work diligently with our supplier partners to best meet customer demands walmart and kroger were also rationing some formula purchases as of tuesday the wall street journal reported roughly 30 of formula products were out of stock across the country the week of april 3 according to data from datasembly a retail software company what started as a spotty shortage in 2021 has grown into a nationwide problem according to neil saunders president of globaldata retail in new york baby formula is still available in some shops but supply is very patchy and out of stocks arise very quickly saunders wrote in an email unfortunately shortages encourage some people to buy in bulk and hoard which further contributes to availability issues this is why some retailers have put in place quantity restrictions consumers are having to shop around for formula saunders said searching multiple locations and routinely encountering empty shelves and out of stock messages online as this is an essential product saunders added there is a lot of worry among parents emily pyeatt 22 recently went to eight different stores in search of formula for her 8 month old ever since the recall forced her to change brands she s been burning increasing amounts of time and gas money trying to track down formula this is the scariest thing i ve ever experienced she posted on facebook afterward how are we supposed to feed our children when there s no formula on the shelves down to her last three cans pyeatt said she has been easing her son onto more solid food to help the formula last longer store managers trying to be helpful have suggested she breast feed or switch to whole milk or other alternatives that aren t safe for an infant her son s age she d be breast feeding if she could she said but like many women she struggled to produce enough it was a very heartbreaking decision to stop and i think it s upsetting for someone to say that pyeatt said i pray for the women who have babies who are not old enough for solid food the shortage is heaping financial burden upon families at a time when households are already grappling with the highest inflation surge in four decades baby formula the only viable substitute for breast milk is expensive with the average cost of popular brands well exceeding 1 000 in the infant s first year according to the u s surgeon general as parents are navigating the extraordinary stress of this recall we are particularly concerned about risky practices that can jeopardize an infant s growth and development brian dittmeier senior director of public policy at the national wic association wrote in an email before switching formulas parents should consult with their child s health care provider diluting formula making formula at home or substituting cow s milk for breast milk is not nutritionally comparable with breast milk or infant formula dittmeier cautioned and could cause nutrient deficiencies that can have a pronounced impact on an infant s growth and development parents who are struggling to find formula can contact their local wic agencies and food banks for help locating it in their communities dittmeier said but tools to track availability haven t been working well in recent weeks and the ripple effects of the shortages across manufacturers and state lines will likely continue to weigh on families in the near future this formula shortage is so scary i find my milk anywhere a san antonio woman using the handle daniella_ayee posted tuesday on twitter the february recall applies to certain formulas under the similac alimentum and elecare labels in which the first two digits of the container code are 22 or 37 the code contains k8 sh or z2 and has an expiration date of april 1 or later packages that don t meet all of those conditions are not affected according to the company and the fda the impacted products have already been pulled from shelves but if you are worried you may have purchased them prior search for the lot number on the formula container on the abbott website reports of illness tied to the bad batches of formula surfaced five months before the recall was initiated according to a letter sent last week to the fda by sens robert p casey jr d penn and sherrod brown d ohio for nearly half a year potentially contaminated product remained on store shelves and in baby bottles subjecting unsuspecting families to unacceptable risk the senators wrote adding that the prospect of finding a new formula as a result of the recall has posed a logistical financial and emotional burden for families across the u s

photo taken on nov 23 2021 shows the white house in washington dc the united states us banks have pulled out of russia in the wake of various sanctions but some wall street firms are taking advantage of the sell off in russian bonds to make a quick buck under sanctions imposed by the us government against russia us companies are prohibited from buying russian government bonds directly from major russian financial institutions but the treasury department issued a memo saying it is legal to trade russian assets on the secondary market the memo shows the us government s friendliness to wall street leaving a back door for its arbitrage no wonder the trading volumes in russian corporate debt have risen to a two year high since the outbreak of the ukraine conflict taking advantage of crises for arbitrage is something that wall street is very good at when the european debt crisis erupted for example ireland was the hardest hit zone but templeton global bond fund bet that the european union would bail it out so it bought a 10th of ireland s sovereign debt and gained tremendous profits with russia s financial system severely tested by sanctions wall street is not going to pass up the opportunity to make a quick profit although wall street firms said they were giving up on the russian market they haven t wall street has 10 billion of exposure to russian bonds alone as well as a large exposure to traditional russian financial businesses even if the wall street companies violate the us government sanctions the fine they need to pay is only a small fraction of their profits in other words the us led sanctions are comparable to an order banning companies from other countries to trade with the sanction targets reserving the target markets for us companies only wall street has various means for arbitrage usually it combines such approaches as credit default swaps which refers to financial derivatives that allow an investor to swap or offset their credit risk with that of another investor buying low and selling high of russian corporate stock equity and bonds and acting as a middleman earning brokerage fees by brokering deals between investors eager to dump russian bonds as well as hedge funds willing to take risks in the name of helping clients manage their exposure but if there is a russian debt default it will render the wall street buys worthless with the larger risk that since different countries hold nearly 100 billion in russian sovereignty debt a debt default by russia would have systematic repercussions for the global financial system and economy
