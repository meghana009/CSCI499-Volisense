denise williams roberts owner of lilli s lighting and decor stands in her shop friday june 25 in frisco williams roberts said the winter storms that occurred in the south especially in texas have had major impacts on the furniture industry photo by grace coomaraswamy micheline stone owner of denver based creative living planned to open her frisco location in february but due to pandemic related issues with manufacturing and shipping plus the february winter storm that halted many operations in texas the shop opened three months later and still isn t completely outfitted virtually every industry has been impacted by supply chain issues early last year the pandemic forced many businesses to send employees home or reduce the number of staff members working in person now as activity picks back up manufacturers are struggling to meet demands and prices for goods are steadily increasing shortages have been seen with automobile chips and more recently with the restaurant industry s struggle to acquire basics like oat milk and chicken wings furniture stores are just another industry facing supply chain issues stone opened creative living in denver in 2011 and began setting her sights on summit county she targeted a february opening date but because of manufacturing stalls and shipping delays she s still putting the finishing touches on her store and waiting for the rest of her inventory to come in it took longer than anticipated to actually open our doors and we are still not fully stocked with what we originally ordered and intended for our opening stone said for our denver location we ve been running into more delivery and stock issues slower delivery times lack of product due to supply chain resources just whether it be raw materials or fabrication and covid related issues in the factories any number of things just compounded and disrupted delivery of product and the supply chain stone said she began ordering merchandise for her frisco location in january the store didn t open officially until may 1 and it ll be july 4 before she expects all of the inventory to be in stores to bridge the gap stone said she s been transferring goods from denver to frisco to keep her new shop up and running we ve just been receiving vendor notifications that this is delayed in shipping this is delayed further this is out of stock stone said we do have things in the store but trying to furnish it out being a new store we re pulling stuff from our denver location to fill the space at the time being rather than having things readily delivered and available there at all times stone s business isn t the only furniture store in town experiencing issues like these the owners of lilli s lighting and decor and ifurnish are also experiencing similar backlogs lilli s lighting and decor pictured friday june 25 in frisco features a wide variety of products the store is one of many in summit county that has felt the impact of supply chain issues photo by grace coomaraswamy denise williams roberts owner of lilli s said the winter storms that occurred in the south and especially in texas have had major impacts on the furniture industry williams roberts explained that there are only so many plants that can make what s needed for the foam that goes into cushions for chairs and couches when the february storm forced factories to halt production it caused a severe delay in making the foam thus creating longer lead times for manufacturers to assemble various pieces at the beginning of the pandemic when customers shifted from spending their money on services to products that s when we saw the increase in purchasing williams roberts said people started redecorating so there was already starting to be a strain on that foam production to begin with when we had the emergency and they shut everything down that s really what caused the kind of catastrophic lead times that we re now seeing for furniture williams roberts said eight to 12 weeks was a fairly standard lead time for manufacturers to make various pieces now those same manufacturers are experiencing 26 to 32 week lead times lilli s lighting and decor pictured friday june 25 in frisco features a wide variety of products the store is one of many in summit county that has felt the impact of supply chain issues photo by grace coomaraswamy williams roberts said she has five warehouses where she keeps inventory so she never had an issue keeping her store stocked she said her warehouses were just starting to empty luckily the merchandise she ordered in september and october is now starting to arrive over at ifurnish co owner kelly pestello said early planning saved her store as soon as ifurnish reopened after the shutdown pestello she and her husband and co owner tony began ordering inventory immediately it was just seeing the writing on the wall and that people want to buy furniture and factories can t make it fast enough so we d better start getting stuff on order pestello said both pestello and williams roberts said it s likely that these backlogs will continue well into 2022 in the meantime williams roberts said consumers should jump on a product if they see something they like that s currently available if you see it and you like it get it williams roberts said
takeover tilt for morrisons sees grocery shares surge should you cash in invest more in supermarkets or sit tight and watch how the big guns react everyone loves a bargain particularly private equity firms but disappointment may yet await clayton dubilier rice cd r the group which this week launched a 5 5billion 230p a share bid for morrisons the uk s fourth largest supermarket not only has the approach fuelled the controversy over private equity takeovers of british businesses a scandal exposed in a campaign by this newspaper it has also caused a reappraisal of the value of morrisons marks spencer sainsbury s and tesco in past months their share prices have not reflected their pandemic reinvention the rapid expansion of their online arms was commendably rapid but this week their shares have jumped at last if you are an investor either directly or through such funds as threadneedle uk equity income or uk equity opportunities or schroder global equity income you can dare to hope that your forbearance may be rewarded until this week supermarket shares had been among the most shorted stocks the reassessment may not end even if the competition and markets authority becomes involved in the bid chris beckett of quilter cheviot says supermarkets may be seen as low margin low growth businesses but the bid for morrisons has reminded people of the supermarkets other positive attributes like their good cash flow so lacklustre has been the sector s share performance that clive black of shore capitol told investment extra last december that these companies could be bid targets in 2021 in february asda was bought out by eg group and tdr a private equity firm now the approach for morrisons appears to have put the whole sector in play the view is that cd r must pay more or be outbid by apollo or another private equity group or by amazon which has a tie up with morrisons as a private investor you should now be watching how the institutional shareholders react silchester an asset management group and the largest morrisons shareholder with a 15 per cent stake is not saying anything publicly legal general another major investor contends that the cd r offer significantly undervalues the company beckett says there is speculation that these investors may be looking for a price north of 250p note however that some analysts argue that morrisons is worth 295p a share based on its property portfolio the company the uk s second largest food producer owns its 19 manufacturing sites plus 85 per cent of its 497 stores if cd r succeeds morrisons chairman andy higginson and chief executive david potts would be reunited with their old tesco boss sir terry leahy who is a cd r partner if cd r succeeds morrisons chairman andy higginson and chief executive david potts pictured would be reunited with their old tesco boss sir terry leahy who is a cd r partner while morrisons executives and its big investors deliberate and negotiate ahead of the july 17 deadline when cd r must make its intentions clear you have time to decide on your stance many will be opposed to a private equity takeover of morrisons which threatens jobs britain s food supply and higher prices for shoppers nevertheless the spotlight that has now been turned onto the supermarket sector means that existing shareholders should sit tight those who have previously seen these shares as boring could now consider a flutter because of the changes set to reverberate through the grocery trade from amazon and the new rapid delivery companies like getir analyst natalie berg says amazon has deep pockets and a hunger to disrupt bricks and mortar the company knows that it will never have a meaningful impact on the uk grocery industry without a major acquisition morrisons seems not to be an object of desire for ocado whose shares jumped this week thanks to its joint venture with m s but the payback from a bet on ocado also hangs on the success of the roll out of the technology that it sells to other supermarkets in north america there is a question mark as to whether this technology developed for britain s suburban streets will work as well in the downtown areas of us cities or in sparsely populated states the morrisons bid should provide some overdue excitement for shareholders in the short term but in the longer term the outlook for these stocks will increasingly depend on the higher expectations of british consumers people now want same day delivery some want delivery within the hour the business that can achieve such service and make a profit could be the next grocery stars despite the deliveroo ipo debacle morrisons a business that began in bradford in 1899 has a 5 6billion market capitalisation this is about the same as the 5 4billion price tag put on getir this turkish owned rapid delivery app founded in 2014 is set to launch in london and other cities this year and may soon float on the stock market getir says it wants to democratise the right to laziness an objective that venture capitalists are eager to back pouring money into this instant delivery service and into its european rivals like flink and gorillas although cd r may be a pandemic predator it has shown us that the food retailing sector is anything but boring
in a michigan case appeals court to revisit bump stock ban rick bowmer ap kalamazoo mich a federal appeals court said friday it would rehear a dispute over a trump administration ban on bump stocks a device that allows semiautomatic firearms to fire rapidly the decision comes three months after a three judge panel at the court said a federal judge in kalamazoo michigan should have blocked the ban cases at federal appellate courts are heard by three judge panels but a losing side can ask the full court to reconsider a decision the 6th u s circuit court of appeals based in ohio agreed to a request from the u s justice department the ban came in response to a 2017 shooting in las vegas in which a gunman attached bump stocks to assault style rifles to attack outdoor concert spectators from his hotel room the u s bureau of alcohol tobacco firearms and explosives used a regulation to outlaw the bump stocks critics insist only congress can take that step there have been different opinions about the bump stock ban in federal courts across the country which makes it a strong candidate for an eventual review by the u s supreme court decisions from the 6th circuit set legal precedent in federal courts in michigan ohio tennessee and kentucky back to top

the michigan municipal league mml and local government leaders recently held a virtual conference to call attention to compromise legislation being developed that will balance the needs of short term rental owners permanent local residents and vacationers the conference was moderated by dan gilmartin mml ceo and featured grand rapids city manager mark washington as well as bridget smith frankenmuth city manager derek lemanski short term rental owner in frankenmuth and jenn hill mayor pro tem in marquette gilmartin said the local leaders represented municipalities that have short term rental regulations in place designed to best meet the needs of their respective communities according to the league and local leaders current legislative items sb 446 and hb 4722 create a one size fits all policy that only caters to short term rental owners newly introduced legislation like hb 4985 and others soon to be introduced make clear short term rentals are allowed in michigan while also giving local communities the right to implement reasonable regulations that suit their unique housing needs if the current bills pass all of this work for reasonable regulation will be tossed and the floodgates to short term rentals will be open gilmartin said it would be like adding lighter fluid to an already blazing hot housing market making the demand for attainable housing even more dire here in the state of michigan both sb 445 and hb 4722 define short term rental as the rental of a single family residence a dwelling unit in a one to four family house or any unit or group of units in a condominium for terms of not more than 30 consecutive days both bills state short term rentals are a residential use of property and a permitted use in all residential zones and are not subject to a special use or conditional use permit or procedure different from those required for other dwellings in the same zone short term rentals also are not considered commercial use of a property short term rentals have grown in popularity across the state providing a boost in vacation options for visitors but gilmartin said they ve also brought a reduction in available housing increased noise and nuisance complaints and unequal competition with traditional hotels additionally the blanket legislation can open the door for commercial operators looking for a growth market in residential homes turned into hotels any legislator with their name on these bills or considering voting for them needs to be able to answer these very important questions are you concerned about the skyrocketing cost of home purchasing in your community what s the wisdom of reducing housing supply for michigan residents who live in our communities year round and pay taxes year round during the worst attainable housing crisis our state has seen what percentage of a neighborhood s housing stock should be short term rentals and what provisions in this bill keep a neighborhood from becoming 100 short term rentals gilmartin said grand rapids allows short term rentals but the city is very intentional about using its current zoning laws to regulate them washington said it is important for the city to consider other factors like parking traffic noise and other nuisances it s important that short term rentals be regulated with local control based on how each community and each city and township and village responds to its own residents washington said grand rapids does not allow the entirety of a residence to be used as a short term rental again based on local constituency when developing the zoning laws but sb 445 and hb 4722 do not consider local preferences washington said these bills ignore the reality of how short term rentals operate and many of them are not home sharing but it is actually renting the entire home for extra income for a few short periods of time while the homeowners are away washington said not only have we seen that attempt in grand rapids but also in other cities that i ve had the privilege of working for washington added the city already has seen upticks in some parts of the community in complaints derived from short term rental use it s not unreasonable to expect people have the ability to acquire additional income through the use of their property and we feel we ve responsibly done that by enabling it to occur but within the context of our zoning regulations to make sure that the quality of life for all of our residents will be protected washington said we urge all lawmakers to reject any legislation that ignores the work local communities have done to set fair and local regulations to uplift their local needs what works in grand rapids may not work in other communities across the state and what works in other communities may not work in grand rapids washington estimated grand rapids needs over 9 000 new housing units over the next four years and the need for attainable housing far outreaches the need for short term lodging in order to maintain an acceptable quality of life the city needs additional housing supply and washington said he feared the proposed legislation would lead to a further erosion of housing supply as people outside the community take advantage of available stock frankenmuth a popular vacation destination which has a mix of short term rentals hotels and bed and breakfasts amended its ordinance in 2019 with input from hotels short term rental property owners and residents i think this is really how regulation is supposed to work said smith it protects personal property rights and still respects neighboring properties what s most disheartening is the short term rental bills on the floor ignore this careful collaborative work that we ve done lemanski who along with his wife owns short term rental properties in frankenmuth echoed smith s sentiment and called on lawmakers not to erase local short term rental ordinances with the bills on the floor we re not just renting here we actually own our home here as well so we live in this community lemanski said we comply with all the local tax collection requirements and ensure our guests know the local rules in place for noise we ve kept all our properties up to a t and by doing these things we feel like we re protecting the historic nature of our community up in the u p marquette s hill said like in grand rapids housing is the no 1 issue in her community i ve seen posts on our community pages from folks who have gotten jobs in marquette or are coming here to go to school and they are not able to find housing hill said i personally received for the first time a letter offering to buy my house for cash no appraisal no one seeing the house buying the house as is in as quickly as 24 hours we need to slow down and think about how to balance housing tourism and community the city of marquette has been working on its own short term rental policy since the beginning of 2017 the ordinance has a block by block approach that protects neighborhoods and residents while welcoming visitors to explore neighborhoods as an option to traditional hotels hill said the city again revisited its ordinance in 2018 and expanded it so owners of multi unit properties could rent out all of those units in 2020 the city instituted an ad hoc housing community to address the current housing crisis and will soon release a report regarding the lack of available inventory in marquette hill added we re not the only community in the u p that has short term rental policies other communities do as well hill said we re all taking a thoughtful approach and we encourage the legislature to do the same

by jon rappoport genetic determinism the belief that an individual s character thoughts and actions are the result of his genes freedom means being free from and outside of ironclad cause and effect which side of the argument will win nothing is riding on this except the future of the human race for the past 150 years genetics has been emerging and taking center stage as the pre eminent philosophy of life on planet earth for most people philosophy is of zero concern they refuse to believe it can influence their lives in any way however we currently have the rna covid genetic treatments called vaccines targeting billions of people according to the bought off experts these destructive treatments are working in machine like fashion to protect us from a phantom virus the genetics on which the vaccines are based occupy a distinct philosophic position our thoughts and actions are the effects of our genes scientists can interfere with that structure and replace it with another genetic framework which in turn will impose new all consuming actions thoughts and biological alterations upon us one new machine taking over from an older machine but there has never been a genetic cure for any disease all attempts to prove that a disease stems from genes have failed in this sense genetics is a long con both scientifically and philosophically of course the scientists will never admit this they re dedicated to tinkering and experimenting until they get it right veteran journalist celia farber describes one such experiment jesse gelsinger was 18 years old when he volunteered for a clinical trial at penn state to test the effect on gt on a rare metabolic disorder called otc deficiency within hours of being infused with corrective genes encased in weakened adeno virus jesse suffered multiple organ failure and days later his blood almost totally coagulated swollen beyond recognition and brain dead he was taken off life support just another day at the office for the funders and researchers they re working with billions of dollars and a vision of the future nothing must stand in their way here is one of those visions expressed by gregory stock former director of the program in medicine technology and society at the ucla school of medicine even if half the world s species were lost enormous diversity would still remain when those in the distant future look back on this period of history they will likely see it not as the era when the natural environment was impoverished but as the age when a plethora of new forms some biological some technological some a combination of the two burst onto the scene you need to understand that behind all this envisioning and experimenting there is the solid conviction that freedom and free will are illusions that don t exist therefore all experiments are permitted since they simply substitute one determinism for another one machine for another life itself is viewed as nothing more than a pattern a structure huxley s brave new world wasn t really a radical departure from the emerging genetic science of his time it was a description of better genetic programming carried to a logical conclusion humans would be fully outfitted with a biology that made them content and satisfied with their designated positions in life there was the thunder and the lightning humans genetically conditioned for specific roles and also conditioned to accept those roles beyond the possibility of rebellion what about the centuries of struggle and war and blood to establish political freedom what about the magna carta and the declaration of independence and the constitution and its amendments for the genetic philosophers all that history is waste and meaningless garbage since freedom does not exist i m not talking about a small bunch of crazy philosophers closeted in a cellar and spinning fantasies these people are carrying banners of the new world among the most elite globalists the entire fake pandemic narrative starting with the lie that researchers discovered a new virus was launched in order to open a door for rna genetic technology yes there were other reasons but gene tech was central coming up we will see new genetic treatments called vaccines and drugs based on that tech behind that programs to make deeper and deeper genetic changes in humans the cover story for genetic research and experimentation is we re trying to cure disease the truth machine minds are trying to convert other minds into machines what do contemporary philosophers have in their arsenal to combat this assault here is an example from thomas nagel a professor at new york university even if determinism isn t true for everything that happens even if some things just happen without being determined by causes that were there in advance it would still be very significant if everything we did were determined before we did it however free you might feel when choosing between fruit and cake or between two candidates in an election you would really be able to make only one choice in those circumstances though if the circumstances or your desires had been different you would have chosen differently really that s it professor nagel somehow knows there is no such thing as free will well if that s the case he wrote those words because he had to because of the very determinism he describes he had no choice and people reading those words of his think about them in a way that is also predetermined the whole business is a puppet show and means absolutely nothing the philosophy of determinism is when you scratch the surface a philosophy of nihilism nothing means anything and its perpetrators aren t bothered in the least they re quite content to stand on their absurd pretensions while hard scientists inject populations with genes so much for academia as the guardians of civilization most of them are weak sisters i wouldn t give a nickel for a gaggle of them each one us makes free choices every day of his life taking freedom into your mind implies working on a canvas as big and grand as you want to make it i ll take the flaming poetry of thomas paine december 23 1776 these are the times that try men s souls the summer soldier and the sunshine patriot will in this crisis shrink from the service of their country but he that stands by it now deserves the love and thanks of man and woman tyranny like hell is not easily conquered yet we have this consolation with us that the harder the conflict the more glorious the triumph what we obtain too cheap we esteem too lightly it is dearness only that gives every thing its value heaven knows how to put a proper price upon its goods and it would be strange indeed if so celestial an article as freedom should not be highly rated finally for now in america a country founded on the idea of freedom a country that fought a devastating civil war over slavery can you find one college or university that between the ratification of the constitution and now has taught a year long course year after year called individual freedom this would be a course in which the history of the struggle for freedom is covered philosophic and scientific writings about freedom are covered and most importantly the students actively participate in order to shape their own concepts of freedom that will endure for the rest of their lives can you point to one such course individual freedom regularly taught at one college i can t what does this tell you since the beginning of america powerful forces have been at work to deny refute reject and collapse the very premise on which the nation was based has any student in america ever been awarded a phd in individual freedom i can t find one i see you ve just founded a space travel group i d be very interested in joining i assume you cover all aspects of space travel rockets ships navigation elements of survival during long voyages colonization on distant planets the fantastic marvels of these adventures actually no we study the habits and tasks of ants their nests hierarchy division of labor the biology of communal sharing the ant genome the virtues of overall genetic programming in

driving unprecedented demand for lithium causing lithium miners to rapidly scale operations by 2030 demand for lithium is expected to more than triple¹ in part due to the continued global transition to electric vehicles from traditional fossil fuel based vehicles said mr hawkins that effort will not happen without lithium ensuring its importance for decades to come hlit will provide exposure to

horizons global hydrogen index etf hydr hydr offers global exposure to hydrogen fuel cell and hydrogen technology equipment generation storage and transportation companies in developed and emerging

there are so many reasons to be a proud female leader but when too much emphasis is placed on the qualifier that s where the issues lie opinions expressed by entrepreneur contributors are their own more often than not i m referred to as the first female technology ceo of my industry to list on the nasdaq what this phrase fails to communicate is that in reality i was the first technology ceo in the space to list on nasdaq of any gender i am tired of only being referred to as a female ceo to be clear i am proud to be a woman and i remain dedicated helping other women both in the workplace and in life i am likewise proud of my professional achievements sexism is real and there are barriers to success for women that aren t present for men these barriers are even more challenging for bipoc women and the lgtbq community with that being said my sex shouldn t be a qualifier in everything i do doing so reaffirms the problematic social and scientific view that male is default and female is a deviation related we need to reimagine a more family friendly workplace it s long past the time women should be recognized on par with male leadership i am far from the first to call for this i am simply echoing the calls from the multitude of women pleading to be viewed as what we are smart established and developed leaders leaders who due to how societal expectations are structured likely had to work harder to get where we are today leaders who are no less worthy of respect or importance than our male counterparts the modern american workplace was not designed with women in mind after world war ii the workplace as we know it today was designed to support the outdated idea of a nuclear family i e a man who worked outside the home and a woman who took care of the home and their 2 5 children as a result of these expectations women have long been a minority in business we struggle to get hired once we do the pay is often lower we can t secure capital and because society has long positioned us to be the primary caretaker at home we enjoy fewer promotions due to familial obligations and expectations these issues are only compounded for bipoc and lgbtq women who face even wider pay gaps and are subjected to bias in many forms this is not to say that we shouldn t recognize women in business it is crucial to honor their legacies celebrate the paths they paved for those who come after and learn from their struggles to make the workplace even more progressive and dynamic than when we found it i along with generations of women to follow stand on their shoulders without the sandra day o connors kamala harrises dr rachel levines becky hammonses and whitney wolfe herdes of the world we would not be where we are today there are so many reasons to be a proud female leader but when too much emphasis is placed on the qualifier that s where the issues lie this female qualifier has given rise to various terms to describe women in business like boss babe and girl boss these terms in particular reveal internalized sexism by infantilizing women unnecessarily and problematically attempting to balance permission to assert themselves with care to not threaten those around them have you ever heard of a male ceo be referred to as boy boss or male ceo me neither the industries in which my company operates are highly male dominated go to any industry conference or event and you ll see it firsthand being among the small percentages of women in leadership in the space i often find myself invited to conferences with an agenda full of male leadership only to be offered a spot on a women s panel and nothing else when launching akerna s flagship product mj freeway we invented seed to sale tracking for the industry and yet many who organize these conferences think i can only speak to being a woman in business i code i sell i scale i lead but to them i am merely a female ceo a checked box on a diversity and inclusion initiative and i know my fellow female peers across a variety of industries have experienced the same so how do we fix this gender discrimination that is so deeply baked into business today it starts with the language we use words have power let s drop the qualifier when highlighting women who achieve countless amazing organizations seek to bring women into business and develop them into future leaders but we still have miles to go related 4 ways your company can radically help working mothers ultimately equal representation will be crucial for women to be seen as what we are businesspeople delivering value innovation and skill to our individual companies and missions i hope for a future where women leaders are categorized by skill and success not by gender yes i am a proud female founder but i am so much more than just that

venice italy away from the once maddening crowds of st mark s square tiny certosa island could be a template for building a sustainable future in venice as it tries to relaunch its tourism industry without boomeranging back to pre pandemic day tripping hordes private investment has converted the forgotten public island just a 15 minute waterbus ride from st mark s square into a multifaceted urban park where venetians and venice conoscenti can mix free from the tensions inherent to the lagoon city s perennial plague of mass tourism this is the b side of the venetian lp said alberto sonino who heads the development project that includes a hotel marina restaurant and woodland everyone knows the first song of the a side of our long play almost nobody not even the most expert or locals know the lagoon as an interesting natural and cultural environment it may be now or never for venice whose fragile city and lagoon environment alike are protected as a unesco world heritage site citing overtourism unesco took the rare step this week of recommending venice be placed on its list of world heritage in danger sites a decision is expected next month after a 15 month pause in mass international travel venetians are contemplating how to welcome visitors back to its picture postcard canals and byzantine backdrops without suffering the past indignities of crowds clogging narrow alleyways day trippers picnicking on stoops and selfie takers crowding the rialto bridge the recommendation by unesco s world heritage center took into account mass tourism in particular the passage of cruise ships through the historic center a steady decline in permanent residents as well as governance and management problems advertisement this is not something we propose lightly mechtild roessler director of the world heritage center told the ap it is to alert the international community to do more to address these matters together veneto regional officials have submitted a plan for relaunching the tourism dependent city to rome that calls for controlling arrivals of day trippers boosting permanent residents encouraging startups limiting the stock of private apartment rentals and gaining control over commercial zoning to protect venetian artisans the proposal submitted in march aims to make venice a world sustainability capital and hopes to tap some of the 222 million euros 265 million in eu recovery funds to help hard hit italy relaunch from the pandemic venice is in danger of disappearing if we don t stop and reverse this venice in 10 years will be a desert where you turn the lights on in the morning and turn them off in the evening said nicola pianon a venice native and managing director of the boston consulting group whose strategic plan for venice informed the region s proposal the proposal responds to venetians urgency to reclaim their city from the mass tourism that peaked at some 25 million individual visitors in 2019 and stanch the exodus of 1 000 venetians each year it envisions investments of up to 4 billion euros to attract 12 000 new residents and create 20 000 new jobs as much as venetians groan at the huge tourist flows the pandemic also revealed the extent to which the relationship is symbiotic advertisement along with lost tourist revenue venetians suffered a drastic reduction in public transport heavily subsidized by tourist traffic even city museums could not afford to reopen to residents when lockdowns eased venice without tourists became a city that could not serve its own citizens said anna moretti an expert in destination management at venice s ca foscari university the pandemic paused the city s plans to introduce a day tripper tax last year on visitors who sleep elsewhere 80 percent of the total tourist footfall some 19 million day trippers visited in 2019 spending just 5 euros 6 to 20 euros each according to boston consulting on the other side of that equation the 20 percent of tourists who spend at least one night in venice contribute more than two thirds of all tourist revenue a reservation system with an access fee is expected to launch sometime in 2022 to manage day visitors with an eye on monitoring daily tourist arrivals the city set up a state of the art smart control room near the main railroad bridge last year that identifies how many visitors are in venice at any moment using cellphone data that also reveals their country of origin and location in the city advertisement the technology means that future reservations can be monitored with qr codes downloaded on phones without the need to set up checkpoints pianon said the plan is feasible in a city like venice which has a limited number of access points and is just 2 square miles in area relaunching more sustainable tourism in venice would require diverting tourists to new destinations encouraging more overnight stays discouraging day trips and enabling the repopulation of the city with new residents much could go wrong tourist operators are desperate for business to return and there is a pent up global desire to travel in addition many changes being sought by regional and city officials must be decided in rome including any limits on commercial zoning or airbnb rental properties i think the level of dystopia that we had reached was of such a scale that there has to be a reaction said carlo bagnoli head of an innovation lab venisia at ca foscari university there are many projects emerging from many places certosa island after more than a decade is still a work in progress but its success is in the numbers 3 000 visitors each weekend sonino sees another 10 public sites in the lagoon with redevelopment potential including former hospitals abandoned islands and military bases he blames venetians themselves for the city s predicament being long on talk short on action but he feels the pandemic coupled with the world s abiding interest in venice s future might just be the push the city needs to change i prefer to hope that we catch the opportunity carpe diem is not only a slogan but an opportunity sonino said we need a lot of ideas and a lot of passion to take venice from the past to the future send questions comments to the editors previous next
by madeline holcombe cnn some states are making great strides in vaccinating their residents against covid 19 but the ones that are not may soon be contending with a more transmissible variant experts say about 45 1 of the u s population is fully vaccinated against covid 19 cdc data showed and in 16 states and washington d c that proportion is up to half but some states such as alabama arkansas louisiana mississippi tennessee and wyoming have fully vaccinated less than 35 of residents texas has vaccinated 41 21 of its 27 885 195 residents according to the cdc more than 500 days and 600 000 deaths since the first person in the united states was reported to have died from covid 19 experts have upheld vaccines as the key to reopening the country safely and containing the variants many of which are more transmissible the delta variant which is believed to be more transmissible and cause more severe disease could cause an upsurge in infections but the levels will vary depending on the rates of vaccination in each area said scott gottlieb former commissioner of the u s food and drug administration on cbs s face the nation when we look across the united states we see wide variance in terms of vaccination rates said gottlieb who compared places like vermont and connecticut which have rates of over 80 with others that are struggling to get to 50 new research suggests less vaccinated areas are at risk scientists at helix analyzed nearly 20 000 covid 19 tests collected since april and found the delta variant is quickly rising in counties with fewer vaccinated residents models for delta s spread show the fall could see a peak of around 20 of the infections the u s recorded in january but the distribution of those predicted surges is not even across all areas gottlieb explained connecticut for example where i am shows no upsurge of infection but mississippi alabama arkansas missouri show very substantial upsurges of infection that s based entirely on how much population wide immunity you have based on vaccination he said in springfield missouri the low rate of vaccinations combined with the delta variant has led to a six fold increase in hospitalizations at coxhealth a health care system there according to its ceo steve edwards over the past four and a half weeks the number of patients has risen from around 14 to 83 edwards told cnn on monday adding that the patients are younger and have more severe disease than previously and almost all are unvaccinated the delta variant made up about 10 of cases that were tested three or four weeks ago he said as of last week it appeared to be 90 i think it is the delta variant and there is a lot of kindling with low vaccination rates so it s spreading very rapidly this influx has put new pressures on his staff edwards said compared to previous outbreaks it is harder to know that you re risking your well being for someone that chose not to vaccinate that then puts you and them at risk turning focus to communities more than 300 million vaccine doses have been administered in the us a feat which has enabled students to go back to the classroom businesses to reopen and friends and families to gather once again but there s still a long way to go cnn medical analyst dr leana wen warned over the weekend we certainly have to acknowledge that we have come a long way and we re out of the worst of it we re not going to see the massive surges that we saw over the holidays said wen who is the former health commissioner for baltimore the problem though is that we should really be looking at the numbers for each community instead of looking at the u s as a whole because while the u s as a whole is doing so much better and there are pockets of the country that have very high vaccination rates we also have pockets of the country that are actually undergoing massive surges right now where their hospitals are getting full again wen said the u s has been focused on getting vaccines out and into mass vaccination sites but now it is the time to rethink the way doses are made accessible gottlieb told cbs now we need to think about trying to push out the vaccine into community sites where people could get it delivered to them through a trusted intermediary that s going to mean doctors offices schools places of employment gottlieb said we need to think about a different vaccine delivery strategy to get the people who are still reluctant or who still face challenges getting into those access sites while health experts agree full vaccination offers protection against some variants of covid 19 wen added that it s unknown whether a variant resistant to vaccines will emerge we just don t know if it s anything that we ve learned during covid 19 it s how much we need to be humble in the face of this virus she said she noted that it s certain new variants will develop which could make vaccines slightly ineffective but not entirely this is another reason why those who are unvaccinated should be vaccinated as soon as possible wen said variants of concern on the rise the delta variant along with the gamma or p 1 variant have been deemed variants of concern by the centers for disease control and prevention meaning their danger comes from their ability to transmit more easily or cause more severe disease the gamma variant first identified in brazil has been detected in every u s state where the cdc has variant information vaccination has been shown as the best way for the u s to get ahead of the variants a recent study by public health england found that two doses of a coronavirus vaccine are highly effective against hospitalization caused by the delta variant the study found the pfizer biontech vaccine is 96 effective against hospitalization after two doses surgeon general vivek murthy previously told cnn there isn t enough data to indicate the effectiveness of johnson johnson s one dose vaccine in regard to the delta variant but it has shown it can help prevent hospitalizations and deaths when people are infected with other strains the key is get vaccinated get both doses murthy said edwards the ceo of coxhealth told cnn last week that the delta variant is unlike others we can t tell why one patient is doing poorly and one is doing well there s just something different about how this variant is affecting the immune system of our patients edwards said

mark simon is former group director for next digital parent company for apple daily and current representative of the majority shareholder jimmy lai in the land of the first amendment it s hard to convey what it s like to lose the freedom of the press so ingrained is a free press in the united states law and way of life it is almost impossible for americans to conceive of their government wiping out one of the country s most popular press outlets and clapping its owner officers and writers in jail it used to also be unimaginable in hong kong an international financial center whose success once relied on offering freedoms not granted in mainland china but this is precisely what happened on thursday when one of hong kong s largest newspapers with more than 600 000 paid subscribers to its online news platform was effectively closed down by hong kong authorities beholden to the chinese communist government in beijing advertisement apple daily didn t just die it was murdered and the weapon was the controversial national security law that the china backed authorities rammed through against considerable public opposition the government told apple daily that approximately 100 opinion pieces and video interviews were part of a scheme to collude with foreign powers to damage china s national security i would like to point you to the offending articles so you could see for yourself if they posed any threat but secretary of security john lee won t specify what they are instead authorities give the same answer they always do when someone does something beijing doesn t like you know what you did what jimmy lai and the apple daily team have done to upset the authorities was to advocate for democracy property rights and the rule of law these principles are ones the hong kong people were promised would continue for at least 50 years under the basic law hong kong s mini constitution that came into effect in 1997 advertisement unfortunately the national security law has laid waste to all the promises of the 1984 sino british joint declaration it lets the government act with its own beijing approved national security courts and judges essentially allowing authorities to trump all the other laws that once made hong kong free as the closing of apple daily demonstrated consequences are imparted by edict before anyone has their day in court when apple daily closed the company had more than 50 million in cash available in its treasury accounts in hong kong the paper s parent company next digital filed that figure in a document submitted under the penalty of criminal sanctions to the hong kong stock exchange late last month yet officials wouldn t allow apple daily to access these funds under threat of violating the national security law add to this additional pressure the arrest this week of a lead apple daily editorial writer a letter from the government owned hong kong science park where apple daily has its offices saying the government was about to enter the building and continued phone threats to apple daily journalists threatening arrest if publishing continued in the end the authorities simply left the team no choice advertisement so apple daily in hong kong is no more across the world many recognize this as a blow to free speech president biden accuses beijing of denying basic liberties and assaulting hong kong s autonomy and democratic institutions and processes but the consequences of closing apple daily down will be felt by even those who didn t necessarily like its point of view share this article share the lifeblood of any financial center is the rule of law and free flow of information advocating for democracy was only part of what apple daily filled its pages with our business pages were often described as a scandal sheet many of the corporate elites and tycoons despised the paper for our reporting on their activities something companies and executives in china do not have to worry about yet when was exposure and reporting not a benefit to free and open financial markets china has a very different understanding of the relationship between business and the government than we have in the united states businesses are assumed to do what china wants whether that means turning over technology or personal data this makes the scrutiny and exposure provided by a free press all the more important to keeping hong kong a free and open financial market advertisement but as apple daily s demise shows the national security law makes this work impossible could a critical economic analysis of china s power grid or a state owned company be a threat to china s national security how about a short on the yuan apparently it serves china s interests to keep the lines of what is permitted deliberately vague jimmy lai often told us no free press no free market those in the international business community who believe the closure of apple daily will have no impact on them are about to learn this lesson the hard way

if you were planning on buying a bunch of fireworks for your kickass 4th of july festivities you better stock up now because they might be gone if you wait until the last minute honestly they might be gone already the demand for fireworks is high this year unfortunately the supply is extremely low the fireworks industry is warning customers that supply ahead of independence day will be down about 30 percent this year due to supply chain issues get our free mobile app i was talking to the manager at phantom fireworks on miller road and he said their supply is half of what they normally have for the 4th of july weekend while we were on the phone he said there was a delivery truck at his store and it was only a third full one of the issues stems from last year when consumer fireworks increased by 90 nobody could go to public celebrations so everyone bought fireworks to launch from their own backyards shipping issues from china due to the covid 19 pandemic is also to blame i hadn t really given much of this a thought until i noticed i wasn t really seeing any fireworks stands in the area when normally there s one on every corner i know some people that are driving from state to state trying to piece their fireworks displays together that s a little crazy to me i guess some people are just a bit more committed to the 4th than others if you don t go and get your fireworks now you might have to spend your festivities lighting snakes and smoke bombs hell you might not be able to find those either

on joe holland s office wall hangs a framed copy of the 2003 recall ballot that ousted governor gray davis including the names of arnold schwarzenegger and 134 other politicos media hacks low rent movie stars sex workers and sundry self promoters who signed up to replace him for holland the registrar of voters for santa barbara county also county clerk recorder and assessor it s not only a personal memento of the first election that he oversaw but also a professional reminder to leave no detail overlooked in staging one we ran out of ballots holland recalled of that historic 2003 event we had a record turnout for a special election a tale of two elections newsmakers checked in with joe for an update on his office as he deals with the logistical complexities of a return from pandemic mode and prepares to manage two elections in a year when most local jurisdictions ordinarily would have none for starters there is the city of santa barbara s contest for the mayor and three city council seats as a historic matter it is the last time the city will have its longstanding odd year local election in 2018 voters approved measure b to move city elections to even years in line with federal state and nearly all other municipal elections in california and against the wisdom of cranky critics who prefer the singular focus on local issues yielded by off year campaigning without competing and loud political distractions but we digress the transition also represents a boon for the winners of those four sb races who all will get five year terms as the new voting system aligns with the laws of arithmetic for holland running santa barbara s election is a straightforward affair which his office will administer at a cost of about 400 000 to the city santa barbara uses an all mail in ballot system that despite the rantings of donald trump is trustworthy efficient and effective in increasing turnout election day is nov 2 and ballots will be sent out 29 days before that

recall petitions 1 719 900 to be precise to put the matter on a statewide ballot this after a 30 day waiting period that followed submission of the signatures during which voters who had signed had the opportunity to withdraw their names a total of checks notes um 43 did so even though newsom is heavily favored to stomp the bid to remove him from office it s still a big deal of 54 efforts to oust governors since the power of recall was voted into the state constitution in 1911 this is only the second time one actually has qualified the other of course included the singular unforgettable brief candidacy of arianna huffington now the key questions for 2021 are when will the recall take place and what will the rules for the election be deep in the weeds after the statewide cost of the election is officially determined the secretary of state will formally certify it then the whole mishegoss goes to lt governor eleni kounalakis who will set a special election date somewhere between 60 and 80 days after a democratic party apparatchik if there ever was one the lite gov is certain to pick a date that looks most favorable to newsom s chances right now the conventional wisdom among dems is the sooner the better for now the pandemic has receded vaccines are fully available the economy is starting to come back and the governor is bathing in free money thanks to unexpected bonus state revenue owing to the covid stock market boom plus the zillions of dollars congress and president biden approved in pandemic relief the future lies ahead newsom and his allies figure things can only go downhill from here think drought wildfires power shutoffs covid variant surges who knows maybe locusts too so have urged the recall election be held as early as august election officials throughout the state have said that s too early apparently pandemic supply chain interruptions have delayed deliveries of paper needed for ballots or something and that as a practical matter the earliest possible date is sept 14 that s a far cry from what dems were saying a few months ago when they figured newsom would do best with an election around thanksgiving bottom line although the legislature has approved 215 million to be spread among 58 counties to pay for the recall holland remains unsure how much santa barbara will get also the terms of the election all mail in person a hybrid so far are uncertain and could affect local costs which holland estimates could be as much as 25 35 million depending on the number of names on the ballot the number of in person voting sites and how many days those would be open as far as i know the recall could be anytime between sept 14 and the first of december he said adding that his office is tanned rested and ready for anything we paraphrase state politics are what they are he added related stories
professor niyi osundare is a leading african poet dramatist linguist and literary critic he became the first anglophone african poet to win the noma award africa s most prestigious book award he was awarded the fonlon nichols prize for his excellence in literary creativity combined with significant contributions to human rights in africa in 2014 he was admitted to the national order of merit nigeria s highest honour for intellectual distinction and creative achievement he was also declared the distinguished professor of english at the university of new orleans in this interview by kehinde oyetimi he speaks on the various inanities truncating nigeria s progress considering the decades you have spent in the diaspora you are referred to as one outside looking inside you just returned to the country a short while ago and this coincides with the present buhari administration s celebration of six years in government also tied to this is the celebration of the june 12 democracy day what is your assessment of this yes indeed i have been shuttling between nigeria and the united states for about 24 years owing to a family emergency so i have been outside but i have also been very much inside at the same time people often assume that once you are overseas you are completely out of nigeria not really so in all cases the internet has made things a lot easier now our world has become smaller and more connected additionally being inside or outside is basically psychological i have never lived one moment without thoughts of nigeria since family issues took me to the us many years ago this country is so central to my consciousness and the consciousness of my family nigeria still remains my root although my branches are also in different parts of the world now as i have always observed exile is a state of mind now on to nigeria our country the way we take her the way we judge and appreciate those who have pledged to lead her and to lead us her abundant possibilities and disappointing failures like other nigerians i knew president buhari when he was a military dictator 1984 i think the coup that brought him to power was announced on december 31 1983 so by january 1 it was a new dispensation the shagari government had been swept from power it was now buhari and idiagbon at the helm the government they ousted was an infamous one corrupt and inept i don t know if people actually shed any tears for the ouster of the shagari government but within a week or two we were beginning to see dictatorial tendencies in buhari and idiagbon things became extremely difficult when the new junta began by promulgating decree 2 that flagrantly stripped nigerians of their right to liberty and protection from the caprices of tyrannical governance nigeria became tighter really tighter as a pall of fear and trepidation fell on the entire country basically this decree empowered government to arrest citizens detain them for as long as it pleased while the victim was denied any resort to legal reprieve general buhari saw the corruption and decay in nigeria and he felt that he should do something about them he meant well no doubt but his practical demonstration of patriotic leadership was draconian and dismissive of the people s right to civil liberty the new strongman was taciturn and distant and kept most of his motives and intentions behind a wall of imperial silence the country became really hot with people complaining of the new tipatipa government it was in this situation that another military adventurer maneuvered his way to power in august the following year 1985 babangida the great human rights president the consummate pretender who like his fellow military despots dumped nigeria in the pit we are in today the point i am making is president buhari is not new to the leadership history of this country i am old enough to be able to compare what he was 1983 84 with what he is now 2015 to the present essentially what we have is the story of the same man with the same tendencies austere taciturn and impatient with the fine details of democratic governance this was why his bid for power under a democratic dispensation was greeted with skepticism and incredulity but as happened during his first coming the corruption and ineptitude that necessitated his clarion for change in 1984 showed up again as the tragic flaws of the jonathan government his campaign presented him as a reformed if not converted dictator and born again democrat his agenda resonated with nigerians to fight corruption to make the nigerian space and nigerians more secure improve our international image make it possible for us to love one another as nigerians and make the country more united the first four years put the war against corruption on the front pages of nigeria s newspapers with gory revelations most of which have led to no conviction then came the dispiriting embarrassment that the man chosen to lead the war against corruption was is himself allegedly a victim of that malaise and you wonder what kind of background check was done before the appointment of the anti corruption czar at work here again is the typical shoddy nigerian way of doing or undoing things and the resultant inevitability of failure then the cabinet and other political and military appointments and what in the opinion of many has been a persistent violation of federal character and what those appointments said about the president who made them now let me enter a caveat here personally i am one of those nigerians no matter how few we are who believe that merit not the accident of geo ethnic provenance should rule the decision of appointments but if the federal character clause has been worked into nigeria s constitution and one of your campaign promises is to abide by it if elected then you should do that with an earnestness and sincerity of purpose that does not permit the favour of certain parts of the country to the disadvantage of others by the logic of his appointments and at times his pronouncements president buhari needs to be more sensitive to the complex diversity and quarrelsome competitiveness of the myriad nations that throng the nigeria house he needs to show in word and practical demonstration that the whole of nigeria is his ethnic constituency with regard to security here is one area where the buhari government has been most insecure most embarrassingly inept granted the caliphate dream of boko haram has been curtailed but the terrorist snake has only been scorched not killed their notorious forays still litter our streets with corpses and make short work of our peace of mind but by far it is the seemingly interminable spate of kidnappings and abductions that have been rattling the country since the beginning of buhari s second term that are shaping up to be the dark bloody spot of his presidency the frequency and unchallenged effrontery of these abductions are simply mind boggling almost legendary dapchi kankara dandume kagara jangebe afaka kassami birninyauri if chibok was considered one of the major reasons for the fall of the jonathan government i wonder what to say about the endless chain of abductions now happening on a weekly basis in this country consider the trauma on the mostly young victims of these abductions already branded and blighted by a nation unable to protect them in this vulnerable stage of their lives imagine the traumatic afflictions of parents and relations that have been forced to sell all they own in order to provide the ransoms that seem to be increasing with each successful extortion in the northern part of our country today it takes an awful lot of courage to send your children to school considering the various bands of armed terrorists lurking somewhere near the school gate and the seemingly seamless sambisas that have sprung up in nearly every state no doubt the abductors have found a new lucrative use for whatever is left of our once thriving forests and then you wonder what is the president doing about all this where are the master plans for arresting this state of anarchy we have expensive government in place quite alright but for goodness sake where is governance where are the rulers who swore to serve and protect us way down south in the thicker forests it is kidnapping murder rape arson extortion and other terrorist acts by herdsmen who drive their cattle with ak 47 rifle hanging from their shoulders the battle for whatever is left of our rainforest has turned local farmers and itinerant herdsmen into mortal enemies erstwhile neighbours and friends are at each other s throats thriving farmlands have turned into killing fields as attacks are followed by more gory reprisals from the middle belt to the southwest from the southeast to our lush and nearly lost delta there are daily skirmishes between the owners of the land and itinerant herdsmen whose own stocks of wealth trample farmlands and munch the crops that should normally feed the people the rows between these two groups have resulted in wanton destruction maiming and murder of the most barbaric kind yet the herders graze their cows virtually anywhere and any time with an obvious air of impunity and entitlement arising from their belief that their ethnic affinity with the current oga at the top bespeaks a combination of protection and endorsement the aggrieved farmers are feeling increasingly betrayed by a government whose partiality they are beginning to take for granted so right now nigeria is taking fire from both sides in the north you cannot send your child to school because of the fear of abductors in the south you cannot tend your farms for fear of armed herders the former paves the nation s way to an illiterate future the latter drives us towards severe famine again i ask where are the rulers who swore to serve and protect us where is our government s plan for the solution of the problems what has president buhari been saying and doing the question that frequently comes to my mind is why is the country unraveling in president buhari s second term did our president hide his true character from us in his first term was he waiting for the second term after which he will never need our votes again if this were his first term would the security in the country be like this would his reaction to the security be the way it is at the moment are we seeing the actions of the second term president who no longer needs our votes and is therefore free to ride the horse the way he pleases i have not been able to find an answer from what i am seeing now we are living in a country that has a very expensive government but has no governance at all let s say it the way it is so far in president buhari s second term nigeria has become a failed state there is no need for any prevarication any euphemism here right now nigeria is like an old battered jalopy with broken bolts and missing nuts the economy is in shambles with the naira nosediving everyday and runaway inflation making an expensive mockery of the national currency hunger walks the streets with a retinue of armed or unarmed robbers and kidnappers i have never felt so unsafe in this country since i came back from the united states a few days ago every morning people have been telling me oga don t come home yet o now when i walk in the streets i look over my shoulders because you could be kidnapped anywhere i have kept wondering where is government where are the people that are supposed to make our lives secure where is our president why is he so content with being absent from our lives our woes two times now i have been compelled by sheer patriotic necessity to ask him to say something to do something to be present in our lives when rulers stage his kind of absence they put themselves and the nation in danger when a leader is too silent he runs the risk of abandoning the field to a slew of conspiracy theories and false ventriloquisms there is also the lurking possibility of the misreading of his silence at the moment nigeria is in a parlous state the type i have never seen before president buhari needs to convince us all that he thinks about all of us that he thinks about this country that he thinks about his legacy he needs to make sure that he doesn t end up in history as nigeria s last president this is very important nigeria is in danger the way it is at the moment i am not used to raising unnecessary alarm but when the truth is there we have to speak it so as to save ourselves nigeria looks very much to me now like a country without governance a veritable banana republic except for the fact it cannot produce enough banana to quench its citizens hunger i am acutely worried at the way we and our rulers have normalised the abnormal the almost weekly abductions in the northern part of the country have become so routine now that their newspaper reports are beginning to miss the front page the president has never said anything of memorable substance about it the governors look pathetic in their pitiable helplessness our brave legislators right honourables all of them enacted a law that ignored the cause of kidnapping and abduction but went bravely tough on the payment of ransoms and then you wonder why is our politics so full of tragic tomfoolery next nepa or whatever fanciful name it is called now i have stuck to its old acronym because of its serendipitous rhyme with leper almost routinely these days you hear of a whole nation being plunged into darkness as a result of the collapse of the national grid in saner more thoughtfully governed countries this is the kind of catastrophe that occurs only in times of war or serious natural disasters such as earthquakes hurricanes and typhoons but in obodo dike naijiria thanks to our rulers we have normalised the abnormality of that national embarrassment from aso rock to the remotest local government area as my brother ogoo okonkwo alias dr damages is fond of asking who did this to us in nigeria why are our rulers so thoughtless can it be because they are elected by thoughtless people what bothers me about the nigerian situation is the way we have been drifting even more importantly the way we have got used to it this is what kills a nation nigeria is dying it doesn t make any sense to me at all that we do not have people really coming out and talking about all these problems to be sure buhari did not create the nepa problem but he promised us that he was going to slay that dragon once and for all but like his predecessors in office nigeria s nepa nemesis is wrestling him to the ground in 2021 for goodness sake africa s delinquent giant adg cannot light up its people s nights illuminate their classrooms and laboratories and put power to the muscle of their factories michael faraday must be wincing in his grave here we are brave nigerians going steadily deaf from the noise of myriad generators and our rulers are daily praying to foreigners to come over and dump their investments in nigeria s impenetrable darkness i cannot help joining kunle ajibade in his patriotic exclamation what a country there have been secessionist tendencies in the various regions of the country many are advocating restructuring others are warning that our unity is not negotiable do you see any silver lining should we continue as one country in my interview after the2019 noipofest niyi osundare international poetry festival gracefully hosted by the university of calabar i averred ruefully that the nigerian civil war had not ended a number of respondents chose to disagree with me but i said no the scars are still very much there no victor no vanquished declared the young willowy general gowon at the end of that war he was trying to play the abraham lincoln of nigeria from what we see now nothing could have been farther from the truth there was no victor in the nigerian civil war because we were are all losers but there were countless vanquished what we are seeing in the south east today is a continuation of a war that never ended as psychologists would put it there has been no closure to the civil war for the factors that brought it about are still with us i remember the military slogan during that war was to keep nigeria one is a task that must be done yes indeed that was the rallying cry but the ceaselessly inventive wole soyinka himself a prominent political victim of that war came up with a moral logical alternative to keep nigeria one justice must be done soyinka s statement is even truer more pertinent now than it was at the time it was made to keep nigeria one justice must be done in all its ramifications the foundation of the country has to be strong nigeria has never had that kind of a foundation but we pretend a lot we keep deceiving ourselves with meretricious platitudes such as you must love your country nigeria s unity is not negotiable is poverty in nigeria non negotiable is ethnic imbalance non negotiable is bad governance non negotiable is corruption non negotiable these are issues that we are facing now how can you love a country which never loves you nigeria doesn t make her citizens patriotic time our rulers stopped selling the illusion that nigeria s unity is not negotiable even when every second they violate the very foundation of that unity with their lack of vision and respect for social justice shall we begin for instance by preaching national unity to the swelling ranks of bandits who now constitute an alternative government in many parts of the country or the rampaging herdsmen and local farmers locked in mortal combat over diminishing grazing terrains again let s ask why are the herdsmen farmers conflicts so rife so perilous now in president buhari s second term what is the president s understanding of the causes of these conflicts what expert advice has he sought regarding the solutions to the problem what is it in his public utterances and body language that is fueling the crisis i grew up in the 50s and 60s in ikere ekiti a then rural agrarian town in the southwest nigeria our family house in odo oja right in the centre of the town was is just a few compounds from the area where nigerians from the northern parts of the country lived and plied their trade we celebrated all the muslim festivals with them and many of them joined us at christmas they also never missed our indigenous traditional celebrations in this thriving cosmopolitan village in this united nations of nigeria were representatives from other ethnic groups igbo urhobo efik agatu idoma ebira nupe and of course i grew up listening to stories about wondrous edo history and culture yes as children we cracked jokes with itinerant fulani men singing agunmumdaadaani this is the nigeria that i knew all of a sudden we have now become enemies to one another thanks to successive visionless leaders and their moral and cognitive deficit president buhari tell me how long how deeply have you thought about the causes of this dramatic tragic transformation why are nigerians so dangerously at each other s throat under your watch ask then do something for the present cracks in the nigeria house may end up as the overriding legacy of your presidency you lived many years in the united states of america where the population is larger than nigeria s and yet they produce beef and have no issues whatsoever like us in cattle rearing for commercial purposes why are we unable to adopt same practices which work in such country i think i have tackled the basic burden of this question in my february 10 2021 open letter to president buhari stop open grazing for it is anachronistic unwise uneconomical and needlessly dangerous for the herders the cattle and as we have found out in recent times for the very stability of the nigeria nation establish modern functional ranches with adequate facilities for the cattle and the herders herders also need education social welfare and human dignity let the nigerian elite who own the cows treat the herdsmen the way they treat their own children by ensuring their access to sound formal education and life more abundant random peripatetic herding has no place in the 21st century let no one glamorise that anomaly as a way of life for any group of people let our rulers make full use of our universities and their faculties of agriculture let s press modern science into service and banish the incubus of ignorance and backwardness that has always stood between us and progress beyond all that let our rulers as well as the ruled cultivate the staple indispensable habit of thinking and purposive reflection most if not all nigeria s problems are caused by a deficit of thought or the habit of acting first and thinking later this is why our journey to progress has always been a tragic crawl this is why ours is a country bedeviled by avoidable mistakes the world is ruled by those who think before they act other countries have conquered the moon and are now blazing the trail to saturn in nigeria our president and his team are busy tracing ancient cattle grazing routes and charging us to join in their heroic effort we lost the 20th century now we are on the way to losing the 21st mr president who will lead nigeria out of its millennial slumber you referred to our university system earlier recent developments have proven to us that the malaise has also extended to our ivory towers it is becoming increasingly difficult to appoint a vice chancellor what with the infightings the university of lagos the university of ibadan the lagos state university and many others are pitiable examples of this saddening drift are you not worried of course i am worried but hardly surprised as i said last week at the graduate conference organised by university of ibadan s faculty of arts when the news reached us abroad regarding the debacle arising from the appointment of a new vice chancellor at the university of ibadan about six months ago three colleagues from different african countries told me how terribly disappointed they were in the opinion of these colleagues whose love and respect for ui have grown over the years ui by its age and track record should be above such a disgraceful impasse one of them was actually pained at seeing ui regarded as one of africa s answers to oxford and cambridge and harvard fail so dismally at the election of its own academic leader painful but not surprising the v c appointment debacle is a symptom of the malaise that has gripped our so called university system in the past three decades or so as the university degenerated from trailblazer into blaze trailer the pervasive decay of the larger nigerian society crashed through the gate of the ivory tower resulting in a foul fusion of the proverbial town and gown contest for vice chancellorship is now just like the battle for spots in the political arena the do or die battle has become more desperate and bloody since the emoluments attached to the post went through an astronomical hike a couple of years ago the v c once regarded as primus inter pares has been catapulted into a lavishly remunerated chief executive as happens in the corporate world like other appointees to public office v cs now see their appointment as a rare opportunity to climb out of the pit of relative material poverty that is the lot of their not so lucky colleagues big emoluments big trouble now a very important caveat not all nigerian vice chancellors are afflicted with this vice in fact this country has produced some vice chancellors that could have managed the best universities anywhere in the world there are also some contestants for the post whose major motivation is the eagerness to serve and the hunger to make a difference nigeria surely needs more members of this endangered tribe of patriotic intellectuals in order to bring the lost universe back to its university lastly let our current office seekers know that the battle for university autonomy that finally produced the present process for the selection of vice chancellor took the asuu many years of hard negotiations characterised by incredible sacrifice agony and sundry risks the present generation must hold and guard this hard won dispensation and never give the government any excuse for reverting to those sweeping powers of the past that enabled them to appoint transfer suspend vice chancellors without recourse to due process and proper consultation don t you then find it laughable when you hear our ministry of health say that nigeria can provide a local vaccine for covid 19 also you were in the united states when the pandemic broke out my heart was thumping with fear and anxiety in the first six months of last year as covid 9 rampaged all over the world leaving death and suffering in its wake it was speculated that nigeria might lose half of its population a speculation roundly justified by the country s rickety healthcare system the carnage taking place in many parts of the world even in countries with incredible wealth and first rate healthcare facilities i kept a close tab on the situation in nigeria and was gratefully surprised that our losses didn t come as predicted the federal ministry of health deserves praise so does the lagos state government which leveraged proactively on its ebola experience and secured the major gateway to nigeria but nigeria has been lucky astonishingly lucky we surely need a rigorous scientific research to unravel the cause reason for this luck and preserve it for future use and very important we are not out of the woods yet for covid and its protean variants are still on the rampage on the other side it is shocking that the federal republic of nigeria had no viable vaccine plan throughout as usual the giant of africa was content with begging and borrowing vaccines from other more organised countries for its over 200 million human beings moreover what further proof of the nigerian malaise do we need than the fact that for the first nine months of 2020 when serious purposeful nations were lavishing funds and care on their universities and research institutes engaged in the search for covid vaccine the nigerian university system was paralysed by a long avoidable strike nigeria still hasn t mastered the idea and import of the university though it has them now mushrooming in tenths and dozens this is why our electrical engineering departments wallow in darkness while their counterparts in civil engineering don t know how to make water pump this is why the more universities we have the deeper and broader our epidemic of ignorance and illiteracy can all this be happening if we are a nation with leaders who think and care and act and citizens who make sure they do what is your take on the clamours for nigeria s restructuring here in brief is my take on this important issue if our rulers do not restructure nigeria nigeria will restructure itself it is already happening we have a country made up of randomly assembled ethnicities which for over 100 years have lived more in conflict than cooperation more in fellow felling than fellow feeling but our rulers live in denial of its parlous state since the civil war i have never seen nigeria so divided and so angrily so defiantly so there is danger in this anger possible doom in the defiance right now the country is in a state of undeclared war a war on many fronts the signs are visible even audible to everyone except our rulers president buhari this is time to talk with the people not to talk at them a time for democratic dialogue not monarchical monologue a time to soften up and listen not to scoff and scold those who want the country restructured have given their reasons let those who do not want it restructured also provide their own reasons we can then go on from there the nigeria house must not fall but its very foundation must be re examined and re jigged the in equity among its constituent parts must be addressed its moral structure must be re engineered the country just cannot continue in its present state without heading for the rock you should not miss these headlines from nigerian tribune we have not had water supply in months abeokuta residents in spite of the huge

gregory hood american renaissance june 25 2021 credit image michael brochstein zuma wire americans are spontaneously organizing to oppose critical race theory president donald trump has a plan to remove it and calls it divisive and radical florida and at least three other states banned it in classrooms and governor ron desantis is probably using the battle to prepare for a presidential run conservative leaders including steve bannon are joining the fight and formerly unknown activists such as christopher rufo have become prominent leaders many progressives and journalists are responding with a variation of the bait and switch they use to talk about the great replacement critical race theory doesn t really exist isn t a threat isn t being taught and isn t what conservatives say it is at the same time critical race theory is a good thing and we need more vox conservatives have appropriated critical race theory as a convenient catchall to describe basically any serious attempt to teach the history of race and racism it s now a prop in the never ending culture war where caricature and bad faith can muddy the waters the texas tribune those who study the discipline say that the attacks have nothing to do with critical race theory but instead are targeting any teachings that challenge the dominate narratives about the country s history and identity u s news world report dozens of republicans backed bills banning the teaching of divisive topics on race and inequality are piling up in congress and in statehouses gop led states have seen divisive discussions about how racism and oppression are represented in school curricula and in a wider culture critical race theory assumes that structural racism is built into american institutions and that those institutions must be examined deconstructed and dismantled huge swathes of americans are racist and they too must be deconstructed by its nature it s divisive i would argue that it s designed to encourage radical political activism many americans sense its radicalism and don t want it taught in schools some public school students can t even read or do basic math they don t need crt however now that there s a reaction to it journalists and academics have changed their story on what it is now it s just talking about the history of racism the loudoun county school board says it isn t even teaching crt while it warns darkly about the kkk organizing nearby conservatives says new york magazine are giving in to hysteria the atlantic says they are fixated we re used to this sort of thing non whites can see racism in bird watching in expressions like brown bag lunch and when people hold up three fingers to indicate the number three they are feted for seeing racism when none exists at the same time powerful institutions heap scorn on parents who worry that their children may be tormented by anti racist educators words like hysteria or fixate imply mental illness teachers are already compiling blacklists of parents who are insufficiently enthusiastic about critical race theory however i side with critical race theory we should study it american students should examine the american power structure the attitudes that support it and the financial interests that benefit from it american institutions are systematically biased privileged groups don t just get preferences in jobs and education or favorable media they have entire careers created for them outsiders can be insulted attacked jailed they can even be killed they are politically voiceless the proponents of critical race theory have just one problem whites are the politically powerless group whites have no collective power aside from this website and a few others no one speaks in defense of whites as whites there are whites who have positions of great power but they would lose that power instantly if they used it explicitly to defend whites critical race theory cites a mythical white privilege or even a white supremacist society as rationales that defend the power structure i note in passing a cnn article called in china the media doesn t hold the powerful accountable it ensures those in power hold onto it is america any different my entire life i have heard people with sinecures big salaries power and prominent platforms tell me that they are oppressed long ago i understood that those who lectured me about privilege were some of the most privileged people in history elites during other times usually at least had to do something to show their right to lead our political class claims the right to lead because they claim they need to be protected from ordinary people crt is a broad subject but i will describe it as fairly as i can there are two ways to understand it the first is as a structural framework as a way of understanding the world crt began when scholars tried to explain persistent racial inequality after legal equality and even racial preferences daniel hosang of yale university said that crt is not just a set of beliefs or a political ideology but an approach a way to move past the superficial explanations that are given about equality and suffering and to ask for new kinds of explanations that s legitimate why is the country the way it is even after the supposed goals of the civil rights movement were met in this crt is like marxism which explained social conditions as the outgrowth of modes of production and class conflict marxist scholars have a theory that explains social relations the right lacks such a scholarly approach there are elements of a kind of rightist critical theory that date back to the 19th century conservative thinkers such as edmund burke to joseph de maistre defended traditions and prejudices not because they were inherent or unchallengeable tradition explained the way the world works better than rational explanations did in many ways burke and de maistre s commentaries on the french revolution were a kind of critical theory from the right which dismantled the assumptions about the self evident truths of democracy equality and the rights of man critical theory or what is somewhat loosely and inaccurately called cultural marxism is an internally coherent approach it shows that things most of us think are normal or non ideological are the products of important cultural assumptions backed by power these assumptions can be deconstructed and changed critical race theory as it is used today may not be a political program per se but it has political goals and is built on certain assumptions first race is not a biological reality but a social construct designed to protect those in power the white race doesn t really exist but was invented to prevent the poor from uniting across racial barriers and overturning an unjust system the most popular variation of this argument is the idea that groups like the irish are not white but became white as those in power needed new allies to fight social movements from below second racism is embedded in american institutions and this racism protects whites social relations between whites and others are determined by this unjust protection of privilege in american law and custom thus we have white privilege an invisible knapsack of advantages we carry everywhere third whites are the default mode of american society such that whites enjoy the privilege of being raceless and this hurts non whites phia salter and glen adams write of the assumption that race and ethnicity apply only to certain others who acquire racialized subjectivity primarily by virtue of deviation from a raceless white american or european norm instead crt shows that race is central to social relations and power relations and just about everything else in passing i question whether racial invisibility is a privilege but instead proof of white weakness white identity was taken for granted for most of american history and colorblindness was white america s way to deal with the country after the civil rights movement finally crt is a set of tools for understanding dynamics of oppression and power including the consequences of private violence as well as state sanctioned wrongs against vulnerable populations the purpose is not just to understand the world but to change it it is to quote a recent slate article not only to turn the page on the past but to to live together in a more perfect union whites have been and still are in a position of power and racial equity is both achievable and desirable of course achieving this may mean dismantling the white race itself though we are assured this is meant only as a social construct there are mainstream conservative critiques of crt first it prevents real debate because of the assumption that whites are automatically in a position of power debating a person of color isn t a debate it s a way of inflicting trauma that s why there are speech codes that s why it s impossible to be racist against whites because racism is prejudice plus power and non whites by definition have no power this is of course the end of the so called marketplace of ideas we can t discuss ideas if every discussion is a contest with a victim who paradoxically gets to decide what can be said conservatives and classical liberals are right to say this is the end of self government it means state orthodoxy and a way to enforce it and punish dissent the more victimized a person is the greater his moral right this means people have an interest in inventing new categories of victims and hierarchies can change yesterday s oppressed white homosexuals become today s white oppressors who owe reparations ordinary americans can understand this critique but it has weaknesses language and social relationships do reflect power for decades conservatives have been reacting to each new social innovation with exasperated sighs about political correctness or wokeness the implicit assumption is that people will eventually fight back but they never do without a positive defense of existing identities traditions and hierarchies the only thing on your side is inertia thus we end up with the tiresome spectacle of conservatism as liberalism within the speed limit ratifying each new leftist advance after a decent interval normal americans grumble about how crazy things are getting but because they are abandoned by their political cultural and religious leaders they think they don t have a moral right to fight back besides who wants to face violent antifa negative media coverage or perhaps worst of all job loss principles are a luxury when you have a family children and mortgage a second conservative rebuttal is more powerful this is what christopher rufo and countless parents working against critical race theory in school have said crt is inherently divisive crt supporters may claim that this process will somehow lead to social peace it s the same claim president joe biden made when he said that promoting the tulsa race libel would lead to greater healing there is no evidence this works crt rewards grievances and complaints in the 1960s well meaning naïve whites thought legal equality would bring racial peace instead it brought riots crime and a subculture of anti white contempt since the great awokening of the late obama administration whites have moved left on a host of racial issues this didn t lead to peace either it fueled more demands where does this process end even reparations whatever their scope would not make blacks happy or bring equality crt promotes eternal conflict there is the possibility of a common civic american nationalism and that is what mr rufo and many well meaning americans of all races want however why should non whites go along with this it is an unalterable historic fact that this country was founded by men who understood it to be a white nation for ourselves and our posterity you can t defend the founders with today s racial dogma you can t defend any american hero or leader unless he is from the last few decades you can t even claim american leaders were forgivable because the result was the egalitarian democratic society we enjoy today american leaders were myopic at best they unleashed historical processes that they would have never supported if they had foreseen the consequences those of us who defended confederate heroes and the battle flag understood this and were mocked by conservatives today conservatives moan about the desecration of washington jefferson teddy roosevelt and others i have a question for them are you willing to lose everything you claim to love rather than understand why we were right and you were wrong do you really think the emerging non white american majority will honor your heroes and heritage why should they non white media figures and academics have careers and identities that depend on promoting grievances against the historic american nation if whites keep making concessions non whites would be idiots to stop accepting them non whites who refuse to think of themselves as victims who love this country or who want whites to stop acting like fools are a noble minority if they were more of them i might reconsider some of my own assumptions but there aren t the final argument of anti crt activists is very weak but has become increasingly prominent crt must be opposed because it might lead to white identity politics this is similar to charles murray s argument that we must discuss race honestly because if we don t white identity politics will rise and this is somehow bad crt is bad because it is like white identitarianism consider this exchange from two leading activists against crt borysenko is right about this critical race theory and white identitarianism are two sides of the same coin they are both poison for our country and should be rejected christopher f rufo realchrisrufo june 21 2021 i can imagine them using this argument to prove they are not racist and are taking a noble stand against the hated white nationalists and most white americans don t want to mobilize as whites they want simply to think they are individuals and that we can all get along that doesn t change the fact that they are wrong and that this attitude leads to oblivion christopher rufo argues that interracial marriage is a sign of progress and will lead to greater unity chris rufo endorses the great replacement pic twitter com jhzjeqv245 scott greer 6 2 iq 187 scottmgreer june 23 2021 what s the evidence for that the products of mixed race relationships from ida bae wells to colin kaepernick to sean king are not happily assuming a common american identity they are working to dismantle it did barack obama get america past race the way many americans hoped he would besides a café au lait america would not be free of racial tension colorism has always been a problem for blacks happy go lucky interracial marriages are more common in stock photos than in real life according to current projections whites will be a minority in almost every western country even in our indigenous european homelands do whites have the right to resist this if not our fate depends on convincing non whites and mixed race people to stop exploiting a system that rewards them for being anti white the result will probably be not just white dispossession but white elimination this may sound extreme but do conservatives who bemoan the plight of chinese uighurs really believe a different fate awaits us many chinese policies use the same language being used against us and they have the same objective dispossession followed by erasure if white conservatives want us to care about the plight of chinese muslims i don t think it s too much to ask them to care about us this brings us to the real question why are we in this position why are we in the pathetic dilemma of hiding behind non white spokespeople to advocate our interests or appealing to universal classical liberal norms that few non whites accept why the wishful thinking that non white migrants will assimilate to a culture that is bent on self destruction we are not deracinated individuals who invent ourselves we are the product of a biological and cultural line that began hundreds of thousands of years ago our identity is largely unchosen we live in systems that are not have never been and never will be equal groups rise and fall and an individual s fate is tied to that of his group he may betray or defect from his group and perhaps individually prosper but he will not be honored for doing so like f w de klerk or one time liberal icons such as franklin roosevelt or lyndon johnson non whites will throw away white renegades when they are no longer needed do joe biden and nancy pelosi secretly dream that a grateful non white america will build monuments to them in gratitude for trying to be priests in cult of george floyd and for promising to root out systemic racism if so they are fools it is a core tenet of white privilege that you will always always be racist many of us don t want to admit that we are not autonomous individuals many believe we can be liberated from history tradition and even from nature modern americans seek liberation from the past the power to begin the world anew this seems like a triumphal quest but where does it lead we see the answers around us everywhere it leads to nihilistic mobs destroying beauty accomplishment and order it leads to a society led by those who despise the accomplishments of those who came before this includes conservatives or classical liberals who defend america and the west not because it is ours and an inseparable part of us or because of its inherent greatness but because it produced liberal democracy what good is such a system if it is fulfilling enoch powell s prophecy and is heaping up its own funeral pyre i take heart from the resistance against critical race theory it may lead to a tactical success yet i know that even in success it will fail if it ends there it will fail for the same reason american conservatism always fails you can t conserve liberalism more specifically you can t conservative a system that truly is racist structurally unequal and spiritually destructive against us ultimately that is the question that those who oppose crt must confront the spiritual rubicon they must cross if we are to avoid the death of the west because critical race theory is right about the way society functions it s just wrong about who is in power the very fact that professors get fat salaries to teach whites shame in their history that journalists hound white advocates while protecting the powerful that major corporations subsidize anti white political movements like black lives matter while denying white advocates basic financial services and that the government see whites as something close to an enemy show us the obvious truth it s so obvious that we often overlook it like fish swimming in water those who control the most powerful governmental military and financial institutions in the world are opposed to white people the fact that well paid functionaries justify this oppression by claiming victimhood does not change anything we are a stateless people without power representation or political consciousness until that changes things will only get worse crt shows us the way to examine the messages in movies newspaper articles television programs and government pronouncements it lets us deconstruct the music fashion literature and art that ruling the class promotes it lets us identify why institutions developed the way they did and how we can change them most of all it lets us dismiss this dangerous fantasy that we are free and makes us understand that we are ruled that we have a despicable and dishonest ruling class that claims to be victims does not change the structural realities of power even though i don t know them personally i am speaking to parents who are appalled when their children come home from school crying because they ve been told they are racists by teachers who seem to revel in their pain i m speaking to ambitious young men who are treated by those with power as dangerous threats i m speaking to christians betrayed by their pastors seekers robbed of tradition youth robbed of purpose i m speaking to the children of broken families and the young adults who have given up hope of ever being able to start their own families and i m speaking to those who enslaved by debt shame and lies turn to our supposed leaders who then blame them for the situation our rulers brought about it s not enough to say that critical race theory is hurting america we need to understand that we are the people subjugated by power ruled by a system far more sinister than anything george iii could have dreamed of the liberation we seek can be found only in racial solidarity because the pain we suffer is being imposed on us because of our race critical race theory as practiced today is anti white we must be pro white that begins by using the tools our foes have given us to break out of the mental prison they built breaking coca cola is forcing employees to complete online training telling them to try to be less white these images are from an internal whistleblower pic twitter com gri4n20esz karlyn borysenko most dangerous knitter alive drkarlynb february 19 2021 something important is happening it may have begun with something as simple as a parent who finally sees what those in power want to do to his children and who understands that it s wrong however it must end with the recognition that this is more than one battle we need to stand together as people of good will as americans and as whites if we are to live in a world that we know is right if we don t we will continue to be ruled by deceivers suffer more humiliations and see our already horrifying situation grow worse all the while we will be told by our rulers that we are free indeed privileged and that there is always something more for which we must repent the only thing for which we must repent is to have let things get so bad when we run the schools we will teach critical race theory as it should be taught as a warning from the past that we should never forget and as a reminder to our children that they should never forgive what was done to our people for the crime of being white
