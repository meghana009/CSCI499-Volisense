brambles underperformed on the s p asx 200 index by 17 per cent over the past year 62 per cent over the past two years and 45 per cent over the past three years the stock has not only lost its traditional premium to other industrials stocks it was embarrassingly kicked out of the s p asx 20 index last month at the core of this active shareholder engagement is a fundamental difference between brambles and perpetual over how to measure the performance of the capital intensive chep pallets business brambles which owns and rents about 300 million pallets globally to fast moving consumer goods companies says its americas business is generating returns well above the cost of capital and has significant growth potential its proof points for the claim of good performance in the americas are the results for the six months to december which showed a 1 3 percentage point rise in profit margins to 16 1 per cent and a 2 1 percentage point rise in return on capital invested to 18 per cent skamvougeras says free cash flow yield is a far better measure of the performance of the chep pallets business and on that basis brambles americas business is not recovering its cost of capital advertisement in our opinion the fundamental problem with chep in the us is that it s not correctly charging for its cost to serve he says lost opportunity he says brambles appears to have passed up the opportunity presented by the covid 19 disruption in supply chains to exercise pricing power in a note to clients jefferies analyst anthony moulder said brambles failed to exhibit operating leverage during the strongest demand from fast moving consumer goods companies seen in years perpetual argues that chep s largest us competitor whitewood pallet recyclers have more than doubled what they charge in the past year compared to chep s 13 per cent price increase but brambles says it is confident its us wooden pallet pricing increases are appropriate in both recovering cost to serve and enabling the company to make an appropriate return on the capital investments in multi year assets advertisement it says the 13 per cent price uplift in the first half is the blended increase across the portfolio and that only a proportion of the portfolio has been repriced because on average contracts come up for renewal every three years in the brambles annual report mullen said chief executive graham chipchase was reinventing the company with increased investment in technology the us pallets deal with costco is a way of digitising the business the use of radio frequency identification tracking technology would allow brambles to improve asset efficiency and forecasting also brambles is spending us70 million on the implementation of salesforce software to manage customer relations brambles has a poor track record for deal making in the us in 2008 it signed a landmark pallets contract with the world s biggest retailer walmart to expand its presence in the us market advertisement it foolishly agreed to evergreen terms which allow walmart free re use of the chep pallet pool in its distribution centres and stores walmart deal could bite brambles the walmart deal has the potential to come back and bite brambles if it follows the lead of costco and demands to use plastic pallets analyst moulder estimates the cost of a plastic pallet replacement pool for walmart would be about us1 1 billion although this would be offset by lower replacement capital expenditure of us360 million it would further depress earnings because of the increased capital investment in plastic pallets which were three times the cost of a traditional blue chep pallet moulder has also highlighted the high cost of leakage from the brambles pallet pool he says that between fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2021 brambles purchased 367 million pallets in total while increasing its net pallets balance by only 74 million advertisement this is because 293 million pallets were either lost or scrapped in its normal course of operation moulder says these replacement pallets have historically been in the range of 11 per cent to 12 per cent of the pool but are now running at about 17 per cent better options perpetual s head of equities paul skamvougeras david rowe the costco plastic pallet project involves an extensive pilot program with costco s suppliers and is being managed by chep s north america president laura nador a decision is expected before june 30 the company says it will only proceed with the plastic pallets deal if the return on capital invested is greater than 15 per cent much will depend on resin prices at the time of the deal if the return on capital invested is between 10 per cent and 15 per cent it will require further assessment and if it is less than 10 per cent the deal is off skamvougeras believes it could be in shareholders interests for the board to explore other options for the us business including its possible sale kkr was said to be looking at the entire company last year according to the australian financial review s street talk advertisement over the past decade pallet and container pooling businesses have been sold on an average transaction multiple of 12 5 times ebitda skamvougeras says putting aside the premium chep should attract as the clear global leader then we estimate the current share price is suggesting its chep us business is only worth four times analysts and investors seem to be thinking that the board s current us strategy is value dilutive hence we wonder if something needs to change

gwyneth rees the beautiful anatomy of despair by debut author niall stewart is a surprisingly uplifting tragicomedy about loving belonging and hoping woven together by the poignant stories of its four central characters a timely work of literary fiction with significant psychological and sociological depth it examines the fundamental question of what makes us happy and considers whether striving for happiness as an end goal is really a sensible and worthwhile act sign up to our daily newsletter get the latest news and reviews from our specialist arts writers sign up thank you for signing up

learn more sorry there seem to be some issues please try again later submitting you could then in a sense describe it as a lyrical philosophical study on how to go about your life acted out by four driven friends who on the surface seem to be driving forward yet at the same time continue to lurch from personal crisis to crisis in their blinkered quest for material success these two states of being as we soon come to learn are intrinsically connected and indeed the opening paragraphs of the novel set out perfectly what is to be explored the aristotelian path to happiness is surely a treacherous one demanding our excellence and virtue at every step what can we learn really from people who were resolute it is not the purpose of life to be happy what really is the point of well being if it does not contain at least occasional pleasure are we to be dismissed as hedonists because it is better when the pleasant outweighs the painful we are wired to seek out happiness it guarantees us some sort of future and we are condemned to pursue it forever the beautiful anatomy of despair by niall stewart examines the corrosive impact of pursuing happiness as a life goal the story begins at a meditation retreat in san francisco in 2014 where we meet tristan a contemplative 20 something british legal professional looking to find himself here he is drawn to seb a younger more confident man with whom he is keen to strike up a friendship following the retreat he starts spending time with seb and eventually joins him and seb s older sister camilla at a society dinner but then the narrative jumps to a new set up and new character this time toby who works a 14 hour day city job in london and is attending parties in the evening with his careless hedonistic friend igor painfully shy and crippled with self doubt and self hatred toby puts on a front of contentment while being secretly distressed about how everyone seems to be having a better life than him is it too late to pretend to be someone else he muses at a party the next evening he is trashing his apartment as alcohol releases the full fury of his inner loathing next we jump to italy s amalfi coast where cordelia green is tied to her long term boyfriend freddie despite or perhaps because of the fact it makes both their lives more difficult but after cordelia receives some bad family news it falls to freddie to return to london to inform her parents that she is missing it s on this cliff hanger that we jump forward to 2017 and back to tristan in a gut wrenching scene about devastating heartbreak we find him writing a letter to his now ex seb detailing how one year on from their parting he searches for him on the internet and still follows his movements from afar spending all his time wondering how to go on without him the grief and loss so frankly expressed by tristan will be relatable to everyone but there is little doubt that this has become obsessional and that his former partner was as much of a shield against the emptiness inside as a lover what i particularly love about the beautiful anatomy of despair is how dark yet honest emotions are portrayed unfiltered and with no promise of quick recovery with tristan we watch as he wallows in his misery if only seb could witness his desolation he would return tristan muses while of course the very opposite is true to his credit tristan does try to get better for instance he ploughs through biographies and autobiographies consoled somewhat by the shared complexity of other people s lives we cheer for him willing him to improve while through access to some of seb s diary entries we also come to learn more about their relationship and how it was doomed with seb s infidelity and growing sense of relationship ennui what is expressed so well in these well realised characters is how the pursuit of distraction travel work parties is to try and mask an unnerving sense of not knowing where life is heading or their place within it author niall stewart makes a confident literary debut with probing psychological novel the beautiful anatomy of despair they are connected as friends and occasional lovers yet each is truly alone and deep down they recognise this as they battle with inner demons for instance academic igor is starting to tire of his party boy lifestyle as he enters his 30s while investment banker toby becomes more resentful as he tries to keep up the appearance of success and as the book s exquisite title suggests there is more turmoil to come with devastating secrets unearthed and events spiralling out of the characters control insisting a reconciliation with life as it is and with themselves as they really are not all of them however will be able to make this crucial transition all told then this is both a simple and complex narrative brilliantly executed by author niall stewart perhaps this line in the book sums it up best we re just people muddling along as best we can i will not be made to feel guilty about it a bold and original psychodrama that skewers the world as we know it the beautiful anatomy of despair is also a sensitive and perceptive social commentary on the futility of pursuing happiness as life s goal on the contrary it shows us how instead of trying to manipulate life and seek unrealistic expectations of happiness we should perhaps concentrate on genuine connections both with ourselves and others the prose is articulate without falling into the trap of self indulgence a common issue with literary fiction and the ideas explored are elucidated clearly through the narrative and cast it s not every day that you come across a novel tackling the views of philosophers such as aristotle and the epicureans that is so imaginative and absorbing we come to care for the plights of the characters however personally flawed they may be and this helps illuminate the sound life lessons being put forth such as consideration of why we give our power so freely to others why we attach meaning to things that don t really matter and how can we live our own lives when sheltering in another s apartment the intricate character studies are to be praised and the mixture of light and dark littered with many throw away but spot on observations make the novel despite the sobering tenor a joy to devour most of all i loved the dark nights of the soul where the false exterior falls away and leaves fears exposed it is part of being human and this honesty is impactful at times you are deeper beneath the skin of a given character than they are in conclusion then this is a triumphant literary debut that manages to take a bleak outlook and turn it into a bold new take on reinvention and its limits particularly relevant to today s post modern thrill seeking generation it claws out the inner piping of the generation z and millennial crowd shining an interrogatory light into well groomed faces with rictus smiles the beautiful anatomy of despair is on full display and handled with the intelligence care and spectacle of a medical school dissection the beautiful anatomy of despair by niall stewart austin macauley publishers is out now on amazon in paperback hardcover and ebook priced at 8 99 12 99 and 3 50 respectively for more information visit www niallstewart co uk or follow him on twitter or instagram nialltfstewart q a interview with author niall stewart author niall stewart has made a confident literary debut with his thought provoking novel the beautiful anatomy of despair we caught up with the author who is based in edinburgh and london to find out more about the book s philosophical exploration of the pursuit of happiness and social examination of modern masculinity q how would you sum up the beautiful anatomy of despair a anatomy is a novel about the pursuit of happiness a group of friends struggling in the modern world coming to terms with what it requires of them and trying to find their place in it these are characters who want to know what happiness looks like and they re asking whether it s achievable and if it is at what price to themselves and others it is achieved q what inspired you to become an author and how have you found the journey thus far a writing is a way to figure out the world and the human condition in all its beautiful squalor also if you re fascinated by people but enjoy your own company the life of a novelist offers the best of both worlds i people watch when i m having my morning coffee in one of my local cafes but then i adjourn home to my laptop insulated from the outside world and create my own virtual reality the journey thus far seductive and occasionally perilous q what personal life lessons have you drawn on for the ideas explored in your novel a the biggest lesson life has taught me so far is that if you re looking for answers make sure you re asking the right questions this in many ways is the experience of the characters in the beautiful anatomy of despair and like all of us they want answers to the big questions what do they want their lives to look like should they accept their lot or strive to alter it life is a journey but who s driving the bus and if it s not us how do we get our hands on the wheel q you have said that it can be difficult to distinguish between cheerfulness and despair can you explain what you mean a we can all project a cheerfulness we re not feeling fake it till you make it these days that approach is so instinctive we re not always aware we re doing it so there s that but there s another angle to it pain and pleasure so often spring from the same source and sometimes what should be our best moment turns into our worst at your highest moment be careful that s when the devil comes for you as denzel washington recently told will smith q your novel in a sense celebrates a more mournful outlook on life why is despair worth praise a out of the wound comes salvation or as franklin d roosevelt put it only if you ve been in the deepest valley can you ever know how magnificent it is to be on the highest mountain in any event some degree of despair is unavoidable and a life spent striving to avoid pain or pretending it doesn t exist or downplaying the havoc it can wreak strikes me as a brittle form of salvation the pursuit of the perfect life the hobbesian endless circle of desire round and round we go is a really good way to make ourselves miserable because we can never satisfy all our wants q why did you choose to explore the themes of despair loneliness and the blind pursuit of happiness through mostly male characters a i wanted to study society s shifting expectations of maleness the crisis of masculinity is i think one of the great issues of our time so much machismo comes from a place of insecurity modelled on some abstract idea of power and i thought it would be interesting to explore what happens to an individual who is at odds with the world but who no longer has any real control over what happens to him in it q what was the greatest challenge you faced in writing your novel and how did you overcome it a persuading my family it was worth giving up a very promising legal career to write it but i can be very persuasive q what do you hope readers will gain from reading your novel a i hope they see in my version of reality a world they recognise in effect yes that is the way it is q as well as on amazon and waterstones your book is available at numerous independent bookstores across the uk as a book lover yourself why do you think it important that independent bookstores are championed a i love an indie bookshop they re communities and their stock is so carefully curated it s an invitation into someone s personal collection q what can we expect from you next

4 of illinois past 10 governors went to prison four of the past 10 former illinois governors are among the public officials who have been convicted of offenses in illinois the state needs stricter ethics reforms to change its culture of corruption a rainstorm exposed some of the earliest corruption in illinois when it revealed three county commissioners had let a contractor whitewash chicago city hall instead of painting it and pocketed the difference the commissioners were convicted in 1869 kicking off illinois infamous history of corruption now illinois ranks second in public corruption convictions on a per capita basis and chicago ranks first according to u s department of justice data for 1976 to 2019 this culture of corruption has infiltrated the governor s mansion with four of illinois past 10 governors spending time in federal prison an additional two governors were prosecuted for wrongdoing but acquitted at trial even current gov j b pritzker has come under federal investigation for a toilet removal scheme that resulted in property tax breaks at one of his gold coast mansions rod blagojevich 2003 2009 convicted in 2011 rod blagojevich was impeached in 2009 amid numerous allegations of corruption including an attempt to profit from president barack obama s vacated u s senate seat after his presidential victory blagojevich insisted on his innocence after his arrest in december 2008 saying i intend to stay on the job and i will fight this thing every step of the way i have done nothing wrong but a conversation secretly recorded by government agents overheard blagojevich discussing the senate seat saying i got this thing and its golden and i m not just giving it up for nothing blagojevich was ultimately convicted in 2011 and served nearly eight years of his 14 year sentence in federal prison before former president donald trump commuted his sentence george ryan 1999 2003 convicted in 2006 a fatal crash in 1994 revealed former gov george ryan s corruption and his licenses for bribes scheme when a truck driver crashed into a family s car and killed six of the children the truck driver at fault in the deadly accident had received his license through a bribe while ryan was illinois secretary of state the crash showed the consequences of his for profit bribery scheme at ryan s trial he was indicted after leaving the governor s office in 2003 for leveraging his public office and allegedly trading government contracts and leases for personal gain he went to federal prison in 2007 to serve for the offenses he had committed during his time as governor from 1999 2003 and as illinois secretary of state from 1991 1999 daniel walker 1973 1977 pleaded guilty in 1987 former gov dan walker spent time in federal prison for offenses unrelated to his public office walker committed bank fraud and perjury while working at a savings and loan company outside chicago in the years after serving as governor he pleaded guilty in 1987 to these criminal offenses from his private dealings and served just 18 months of his seven year prison sentence otto kerner 1961 1968 convicted in 1973 the first former governor to be convicted of federal corruption charges in illinois was otto kerner who was convicted for bribery involving horse racing conspiracy and income tax evasion mr clean kerner s nickname as governor was accused of trading political favors for racetrack stock he secretly purchased in 1966 while governor at the time of his conviction in 1973 he was a judge for the u s court of appeals for the seventh circuit appointed by president lyndon johnson kerner s corruption conviction not only made him the first illinois governor to be convicted of a crime but also made him the first sitting appellate judge to be convicted in u s history acquitted at trial len small 1921 1929 and william stratton 1953 1961 two former governors len small and william stratton were charged with crimes but eventually acquitted small was indicted while governor on charges of embezzlement committed during his time as state treasurer eight of the jurors who acquitted small eventually landed state jobs during his tenure in the executive office stratton was indicted after leaving office on charges of tax evasion the indictment charged he had evaded taxes on unreported income in four of his years as governor toilet scandal in the governor s mansion a contractor removed all the toilets in one of pritzker s gold coast mansions and promptly reinstalled a single working toilet in pritzker s hangout meeting area after the mansion was deemed uninhabitable the county inspector s evaluation cut pritzker s property tax bill by 331 000 an investigation in 2018 by the cook county inspector general described the incident as a scheme to defraud and pritzker pledged to repay the money when it was exposed during his gubernatorial campaign the pritzkers came under federal investigation following the scandal making pritzker yet another illinois governor whose actions have been called into question for corruption moving forward with a new ethics legacy on march 2 former long serving illinois house speaker michael j madigan was indicted by a federal grand jury on racketeering and bribery charges adding yet another high ranking public official to the list of illinois lawmakers who have broken the public s trust and come under scrutiny for corruption the passage of senate bill 539 the omnibus ethics package signed by pritzker last october was an overdue first step for illinois to break with the corrupt practices that defined the legislative process under madigan but more is needed for illinois to shake off its reputation for corruption in public offices and to ensure public officials are held to high standards of transparency accountability and fairness illinois policy institute experts have formulated further steps to bring permanent change including at least a one year buffer between the time a lawmaker leaves office and becomes a lobbyist this would create a longer cooling off period and bring the lobbying restrictions of illinois more in line with other states empower the legislative inspector general to issue subpoenas for documents and witnesses and to publish their findings of wrongdoing without first seeking permission from the legislative ethics commission lawmakers should also consider adding a ninth member a non lawmaker to the legislative ethics commission include the financial interests of filers immediate family members on statements of economic interest eliminate loopholes that would allow lawmakers to lobby other units of government one such loophole is that the bill language only restricts lawmakers from being employed as lobbyists for a firm registered to lobby the unit of government they serve this bars lawmakers from working as lobbyists for big firms but allows them to open their own shops and get around that restriction ethics reforms may not stop illinois from sending a fifth governor to prison but they offer tools to combat corruption and send the message that illinois is done with the old way of doing business

photo credit rosshelen shutterstock inflation has been the dominant story in the u s economy for most of the last year year over year increases in the consumer price index have reached their highest levels in 40 years with consumers paying more for expenses from food to housing to energy and one of the categories that has consistently seen the highest price increases in this inflationary period is vehicles both new and used while the early months of the covid 19 pandemic saw lower demand for vehicles as people avoided travel and commuting the vehicle market has rebounded strongly since the second half of 2020 covid related concerns and transitions to remote or hybrid work have put a dent in public transit ridership and instead more former transit users have opted to buy cars low interest rates strong government stimulus and a rebounding economy have given many households the wherewithal to make vehicle purchases a lingering challenge however has been supply covid 19 outbreaks over the last two years have disrupted global supply chains and carmakers have been particularly hard hit obtaining parts like semiconductor chips has been more challenging and backlogs at ports worldwide have made it harder to ship new vehicles in total manufacturers produced approximately 1 7 million fewer vehicles in 2021 than 2019 and with a limited number of new vehicles hitting the market used models are selling at a significant premium according to data from the u s bureau of economic analysis per capita annual spending on used cars jumped 10 9 between 2019 and 2020 from 460 to 510 this increase was the second highest single year increase in nearly 25 years the new vehicle market is historically prone to larger swings but spending on new vehicles only increased by about 2 1 from 2019 to 2020 from 870 to 889 car shoppers in some locations have felt the effects of these price increases more than others typically residents of the central u s tend to spend the most on both new and used vehicles annually residents in these locations are typically more car dependent because their rural geography puts more distance between people and communities while residents of less car oriented locations can spend less or put off vehicle purchases more easily their car dependent peers spend more and now are carrying the extra burden of rising prices the data used in this analysis is

attiyah said the agency s decision is the biggest in its history adding that despite the drop in the level of oil prices by about 5 per barrel immediately after the announcement prices have soon resumed their rise again at the end of last week and the price of brent crude futures contracts recorded a level of 100 97 a barrel during the day in an exclusive statement to qatar news agency qna he al attiyah added that the rise in oil prices to record levels and reaching their peak at the end of last month to 130 per barrel is due to a group of factors foremost of which is the imbalance of supply and demand which greatly affected the movement of oil prices in addition to the political turmoil witnessed by the major producing countries specifically in relation to what is happening in the middle east which owns the largest share of global production in addition to the impact of oil prices on the exchange rate of the us dollar the higher the dollar price the higher its cost to buyers of other currencies he explained that the current fluctuations in the oil market were due to the geopolitical tensions resulting from the russia ukraine war expecting the markets to suffer from a shortage in supply due to the absence of russian supplies which may reach 3 million barrels per day of russian oil supplies in the month of april as a result of the series of international sanctions imposed over moscow al attiyah pointed out that the deficit between opec goal and its actual production is more than one million barrels per day which may cause more pressure on oil prices in terms of the fact that opec plays a key role in maintaining the stability of oil markets as it produces a total of 40 of total global production he ruled out the response of opec organisation to the demands of western countries aimed at pumping more oil pointing to the refusal of the major producers in the organisation to pump more crude and saying that it would be difficult for opec countries oil production to replace russian oil quickly however increasing oil production does not directly mean an increase in oil exports to europe as reorienting oil market conditions is not an easy task on the alternatives to russian oil for the european continent al attiyah pointed out that russia is ranked second in the world in crude oil production with 14 of the total global production during the past year 2021 and that nearly 60 of russia s oil exports go to the european continent he drove home that the alternatives to solving this problem may be to change the policy of the largest producers of crude oil in opec and to persuade them to pump more oil supplies until then it seems that oil producing countries will benefit from higher prices although most opec members see the current high oil prices as a short term benefit he felt the high prices motivate importing countries to invest in alternative sources of oil while the ability of oil producing countries to increase the supply of crude diminishes due to a lack of investment in the sector he stressed that global demand for fossil fuels will decline in the long run but not as fast as the international energy agency expects amer al showbaki an oil expert and specialist in energy affairs said that withdrawing from the strategic stockpile does not address the structural imbalance in the oil markets whether in terms of lack of investment or the loss of russian oil as a result of the sanctions imposed on russia pointing out that the sanctions if applied will lead to a loss of the market from 1 to 3 million barrels of oil per day as a result of companies avoiding buying it and the automatic volumes of major international companies in dealing with russian companies for fear of international sanctions he added that despite the compensation of some indian companies as a result of buying russian oil their purchases amounted to the equivalent of half a full year in one month benefiting from the cuts approved by russia on oil prices by 30 35 per barrel including the risk and additional insurance on russian oil shipments he added that there was a necessity that prompted the international energy agency and the united states to dispose of emergency stocks and strategic reserves such as cases of war force majeure unforeseeable circumstances that prevent someone from fulfilling a contract and emergencies to pump quantities that limit the rise in prices but these countries resort to the reserve came mainly due to the lack of response opec to increase production then there is also the consideration that the iea and the us are convinced that opec countries will not respond in the medium future that is at least during the next six months and therefore they released part of their strategic stockpile amounting to 180 million barrels by one million barrels for a period of six months and this temporarily contributed to calming prices around 100 per barrel al showbaki explained that the impact of the strategic stockpile will be limited in the occurrence of temporary stability in oil prices noting that the international powers expect that prices during the period of pumping the stock will stabilise and may decrease and after the specified period that is during the six months iranian oil may return to the markets after the conclusion of the nuclear agreement with iran also venezuelan oil may enter the market circle in addition to the gradual increase in production from opec as it increased quantities from 400 to 433 000 barrels until the end of the retained quantity however the gap in opec is increasing because the commitment rate reached 152 with 1 3 million barrels shortage of production and the withdrawal from the strategic stockpile may cover this difference he suggested the return of oil prices to rise again after the expiry of the period of pumping the emergency stockpile six months pointing out that there are factors that enhance the rise in oil prices most notably the recovery of the global economy after the coronavirus pandemic the recovery of global demand the russia ukraine war and its repercussions as well as the opec policy regarding production that predicting that the fundamentals of the market have not changed which calls for pumping more oil he added the state of uncertainty still controls the iranian file and the return of iranian oil is not yet clear therefore the scenario of a rise in oil prices is likely to occur al showbaki pointed out that there were other benefits to the stockpile which is the testing of the rapid withdrawal mechanism from the stockpile which for the first time is being applied and was preceded by calls from the us department of energy to know the extent of the response and conduct the necessary stress tests in addition to replacing the old heavy crude oil with light shale oil from the current american production in line with the need of modern refineries that require light quality of new oil to develop the industry

listen to this article listen to this article president biden recently released a 5 8 trillion 2023 budget proposal that illustrates a disconnect between the role that federal fiscal and borrowing policy plays in the domestic economy and inflation the rationale behind the tax borrow and spending 2023 budget flies in the face of inflation s primary cause too many dollars chasing too many goods fueled by federal borrowing this adversely impacts the bond market long term interest rates business expansion job creation and home buying especially at the time when the federal reserve is seeking to limit the amount of dollars in the economy by increasing short term interest rates and removing dollars from the money supply rather than coordinating with the fed s monetary policy biden s proposal runs counter to fed policy and will only prolong inflation the president astonishingly trying to tax america back to prosperity would increase taxes on wealthy individuals and large corporations by 2 5 trillion over the next 10 years while also repealing tax breaks for oil and gas companies at the very time he is exhorting them to produce more oil to reduce inflation at the gas pumps for the wealthiest americans individuals earning more than 400 000 or couples earning 450 000 annually biden would impose a tax rate as high as 39 6 and for households worth 100 million or more the president proposes a 20 minimum wealth tax on income and unrealized gains on stocks and bonds rather than on actual gains when the stocks and bonds are sold unclear is the constitutionality of a wealth tax and whether the payments would be refunded if future capital losses arise the slippery slope for middle class long islanders is that while a wealth tax is focused on higher income taxpayers once enacted history has shown that there isn t a tax that congress doesn t know how to expand while it s no secret that high oil prices are contributing to current inflation levels rather than encouraging more domestic oil production the president s inexplicable punitive policies would result in less oil production the president would take away unused leases on public lands penalize oil companies for not producing oil from those leases and increase taxes on the oil and gas industry by eliminating significant tax deductions including intangible drilling expenses for labor site preparation and repairs and production from marginal wells and finally the deduction that mineral rights owners can claim for a percentage of the value depletion for the reserves removed from their property would end these policy changes alone would cost the industry 43 6 billion in tax breaks through the next 10 years hopefully realistic heads prevail and the oil and gas provisions are dead on arrival if they reach congress as for corporations biden s favorite pinata his proposed tax rate increase from 21 to 28 ignores the fact that corporations do not pay taxes the consumers of their goods and services do when tax increases are passed along to them as america struggles to emerge from inflation and it will certainly be painful as interest rates increase and there are fewer dollars in the economy to finance home purchases business expansion and job creation the last thing the domestic economy and american households need is for president biden to propose a budget that douses economic expansion by fanning the flames of inflation that everyone is trying to extinguish martin cantor is director of the long island center for socio economic policy and a former suffolk county economic development commissioner he can be reached at

elon musk won t join twitter s board after all instead he suggests turning twitter s hq into a homeless shelter billionaire entrepreneur elon musk has decided not to join social media giant twitter s board of directors leaving some conservatives wondering if ever having free speech on the platform is just a pipe dream but actually skipping the boardroom might even give him more of a voice in a tweet late sunday twitter s chief executive parag agrawal announced musk decided not to join the company s board elon s appointment to the board was to become officially effective on 4 9 but elon shared that same morning that he would not be joining the board agrawal wrote in a reposted note originally sent to tesla employees i believe this is for the best elon has decided not to join our board i sent a brief note to the company sharing with you all here pic twitter com lfrxacavvk parag agrawal paraga april 11 2022 agrawal didn t give a reason for musk s decision not to join the board but wrote we were excited to collaborate and clear about the risks we also believed that having elon as a fiduciary of the company where he like all board members has to act in the best interests of the company and all our shareholders was the best path forward we have and will always value input from our shareholders whether they are on our board or not elon is our biggest shareholder and we will remain open to his input he continued please sign up for cbn newsletters and download the cbn news app to ensure you keep receiving the latest news from a distinctly christian perspective the washington times victor morton and ryan lovelace noted agrawal may have hinted at musk s reasoning in his tweet writing mr agrawal s fiduciary duty reference and his noting that board members must act in the company s best interests would have at least the potential to require mr musk to muzzle his public criticism of the company in addition board membership can rein in a person s ability to purchase shares because he would have access to inside information about the company as a board member musk couldn t own more than 14 9 percent of the company s stock according to the wall street journal so his decision has left analysts wondering if he intends to purchase more twitter stock although the tesla and spacex ceo didn t respond to multiple media requests for comment the newspaper pointed out he did tweet his own comments over the weekend including one face emoji with its hand over its mouth and other criticisms suggestions and apparent jokes about the platform all of which were later deleted one of his more intriguing comments was a suggestion to turn twitter s san francisco headquarters into a homeless shelter that comment was partly inspired by the fact those many twitter employees now work at home but it s also being seen as another hint at his overall dissatisfaction with twitter s management axios noted that musk s decision not to join the twitter board could be a prelude to him walking away the start of a hostile takeover or anything in between chester spatt a finance professor at carnegie mellon university and former chief economist at the u s securities and exchange commission said musk as the largest shareholder could potentially swing back hard at twitter executives and board members and force the company to move in a new direction at some point he could throw the directors out he could replace the board spatt said he could probably launch that with his current 9 stake and potentially be very successful according to a filing from the u s securities and exchange commission musk purchased a 9 2 stake in twitter inc meaning he now controls roughly 73 5 million shares in the company making him the largest shareholder of the brand fox business reported musk has described himself as a free speech absolutist and has said he doesn t think twitter is living up to free speech principles as cbn s faithwire reported last week twitter s shares jumped more than 25 in the wake of the monday morning news of musk s stock purchase and individual stocks were priced at 49 81 each as of monday morning twitter s stock had dropped to 46 31 per share musk s large purchase of twitter stock came just days after he took to twitter to question the left leaning platform s approach to free speech even asking if he needed to create a new social media site himself in a series of tweets late last month musk commented that twitter serves as the de facto public town square failing to adhere to free speech principles fundamentally undermines democracy free speech is essential to a functioning democracy do you believe twitter rigorously adheres to this principle he asked his followers is a new platform needed musk continued is a new platform needed elon musk elonmusk march 26 2022 the world s richest man also told his 81 3 million twitter followers last month that he was giving serious thought to building his own social media platform am giving serious thought to this elon musk elonmusk march 27 2022 musk had earlier tweeted his own yes or no poll asking his followers free speech is essential to a functioning democracy do you believe twitter rigorously adheres to this principle the final results out of 2 035 924 votes 70 4 no 29 6 yes

stay and other travel developments cnn for the third week in a row the us centers for disease control and prevention did not add a single new destination to its highest risk level 4 category for travel in fact seven destinations in asia and the caribbean moved to the cdc s lowest risk category for travel during the pandemic which is level 1 moving into that enviable ranking on monday were island getaways the philippines and saint kitts and nevis but much of europe including its popular travel powerhouses remained stubbornly lodged at level 4 take the united kingdom for instance it s been at level 4 since july 19 2021 that puts england scotland wales and northern ireland all in the very high risk category for covid 19 the cdc designates a destination a level 4 risk when more than 500 cases per 100 000 residents have been registered in the past 28 days cdc avoid level 4 destinations the ha penny bridge is a signature symbol of dublin ireland like almost all of europe ireland is

awaiting a better grade from the cdc aruba australia and bermuda still the general trend in risk level has been downward for much of the world in recent weeks and africa in particular has seen its risk assessments dropping in late february the number of spots in level 4 swelled to more than 140 illustrating the vast range and rapid spread of omicron but on april 11 that number shrank down to roughly 90 destinations that s less than half of the approximately 235 places the cdc monitors the cdc advises avoiding travel to level 4 countries cdc thresholds for travel health notices are based

destinations in level 1 are in africa including ghana kenya morocco and senegal unknown finally there are destinations for which the cdc has an unknown risk because of a lack of information usually but not always these are small remote places or places with ongoing warfare or unrest the cdc made three additions to the category on monday burkina faso faroe islands madagascar burkina faso had been at level 1 and the other two at level 4 the azores cambodia macau and tanzania are among the locations currently listed in the unknown category the cdc advises against travel to these places precisely because the risks are unknown a medical expert weighs in on risk levels transmission rates are one guidepost for travelers personal risk calculations according to cnn medical analyst dr leana wen we are entering a phase in the pandemic where people need to make their own decisions based on their medical circumstances as well as their risk tolerance when it comes to contracting covid 19 wen said in mid february you should interpret level 4 to mean this is a place with a lot of community transmission of covid 19 so if you go there is a higher chance that you could contract the coronavirus said wen who is an emergency physician and professor of health policy and management at the george washington university milken institute school of public health some people will decide the risk is too high for them wen said other people will say because i am vaccinated and boosted i am willing to take on that risk so this really needs to be a personal decision that people weigh understanding that right now the cdc is classifying the different levels based on community transmission rates and basically only that wen said they re not taking into account individual circumstances more considerations for travel there are other factors to weigh in addition to transmission rates according to wen the transmission rates are one guidepost wen said another is what precautions are required and followed in the place that you re going and then the third is what are you planning to do once you re there are you planning to visit a lot of attractions and go to indoor bars that s very different from you re going somewhere where you re planning to lie on the beach all day and not interact with anyone else that s very different those are very different levels of risk vaccination is the most significant safety factor for travel since unvaccinated travelers are more likely to become ill and transmit covid 19 to others wen said people should be wearing a high quality mask n95 kn95 or kf94 anytime they re in crowded indoor settings with people of unknown vaccination status she said and it s also important to consider what you would do if you end up testing positive away from home where will you stay and how easy will it be to get a test to return home

coffee may not be the first thing you think of when it comes to haitian exports â but thatâ s about to change haitian blue is the island nationâ s latest product to hit the specialty coffee market the bean made its debut at coffee fest portland in 2021 where it quickly became renowned for its silky buttery body and sweet nutty notes since then the beanâ s popularity has skyrocketed however many have wondered why haiti doesnâ t have greater representation in the coffee market since it lies in prime real estate along the coffee belt just like the nation itself haitian coffee has gone through several cycles of boom and bust and the production of haitian blue is nothing short of a herculean feat 200 some years in the making while haiti currently accounts for less than 1 of the worldâ s coffee production there was a time when this small nation supplied half of all the worldâ s coffee beans haitiâ s relationship with coffee is long and storied with origins dating back to the 1700s when it was a french colony known as saint domingue as they did with many of their colonial holdings such as vietnam the french promptly imported coffee plants and started farming them according to some stories the original plants were brought straight from the jardin royal des plantes medicinales the famous french botanical garden by a naval officer who kept them alive using his own water rations and risking dangerous dehydration for his troubles new varieties were introduced from other coffee bearing caribbean islands like martinique and by 1778 saint domingue had become the worldâ s top coffee producer churning out half the worldâ s beans all on its own however the haitian coffee industry had one major problem the entire operation was completely reliant on slave labor an unfortunate fact that soon led haiti to unrest and revolution a major slave revolt began in 1791 during which many of the islandâ s plantations either suffered severe damage or were completely burned to the ground the fighting continued until 1794 ending with the abolishment of slavery in france however with the napoleonic wars beginning the island nation saw new perils in 1802 when napoleonâ s army tried to reconquer the island this prompted a series of brutal engagements that ended with a french withdrawal in 1804 and the establishment of haiti the worldâ s first nation to arise from a slave rebellion the coffee industry started to reassert itself in the 1850s and while the country experienced a cycle of boom and bust economics by 1949 it was back in action as the worldâ s third largest coffee producer unfortunately political turmoil during the 1950s led to a dramatic drop in production and then the collapse of the international coffee agreement in 1989 and the us trade embargo on haiti in the 1990s further squashed haitiâ s coffee production however the most significant and tragic setback for the haitian coffee industry and the nation at large was the devastating earthquake 12 years ago on jan 12 2010 the country was rocked by a magnitude 7 earthquake just 15 miles outside of the capital of port au prince plus two powerful aftershocks of magnitudes 5 9 and 5 5 shortly after the first quake the loss of life was tremendous with some reports suggesting more than 300 000 dead the capital which was still recovering from major hurricanes in 2008 was decimated more than 1 million haitians were left homeless since then thanks in part to a global effort haiti is on the road to recovery luckily for coffee fans part of that recovery has been aimed at coffee farmers and finding new ways to distribute the fruits of their labor to the world while haitian coffee production is back on the rise the country struggles with low yields compared to its many competitors as of 2021 the average coffee yield in haiti is only 250 kilograms per hectare whereas places like rwanda can yield up to triple that amount the reason for this is the unusual nature of typica coffee plants and the old fashioned growing methods employed in haiti surprisingly haitiâ s modern coffee plants all stem from the original coffee plant brought over from europe and the farming techniques have remained largely unchanged within that time period because of a lack of national resources typica coffee trees grow particularly tall clocking in at about five meters as they reach full maturity however they suffer from both a small cherry yield and susceptibility to pests and diseases pairing typicaâ s unpredictable nature with the fact that most haitian coffee farmers donâ t have the resources for or access to the chemicals needed for fertilization and pest control the country has its work cut out if it plans to compete on a global level despite the numerous hurdles to competitive coffee production haitiâ s greatest asset as it continues to cultivate its coffee industry is its astonishing 922 named mountains which reach a maximum height of 8 800 feet above sea level as many coffee aficionados know this is high enough to produce some incredibly flavorful specialty coffee as a result enterprising companies have been established in haiti to distribute these high quality beans directly to lucrative markets in europe and the united states with an emphasis on improving coffee quality and production groups like cafe kreyol and singing rooster are working at the farm level to buy small lots of both roasted and green coffee beans directly from farmers helping to provide them with sustainable income and expand the industry at large taking a sip of haitian coffee means getting a taste of coffee history and with haitian blue hitting us specialty shops thatâ s easier to do than ever before read next the history of spanish coffee how a fiery cocktail

for months democrats and their allies have claimed that republican u s sen ron johnson and some of his top donors benefited from a key provision he pushed for in president donald trump s signature 2017 tax bill during a meeting with gop supporters friday in medford johnson was asked by an audience member how they should respond to an ad attacking the senator for his wealth and support for the measure johnson acknowledged the oshkosh based plastics business he owned pacur llc benefited from the small business tax provision as did some of his prominent donors but johnson running for re election said many other businesses benefited as well according to a recording obtained by the journal sentinel now did my business benefit sure did some of my donor businesses sure when you give tax relief to everybody everybody benefits johnson said so they want to make it sound like i carved out some loophole for a couple of people what i did is i made sure that 95 of american businesses weren t left behind in tax reform i m really proud of that achievement the issue may persist throughout the campaign as democrats try to flip johnson s seat which could determine the party that controls the u s senate during the meeting in northern wisconsin johnson defended his work on the pass through provision and said he received criticism from the white house and talk radio in wisconsin as republicans were pushing hard to pass the sweeping tax overhaul i was making sure that every small business in america and wisconsin got tax relief and would be able to remain competitive with the big guys he said in august an investigation from propublica found that the tax provision johnson championed delivered millions in tax savings to key donors of his campaigns dick and liz uihlein of pleasant prairie based uline and diane hendricks of beloit based abc supply johnson pushed for a tax break for small businesses and other so called pass through entities in these businesses profits pass through to the owners who pay taxes on their personal returns johnson has said pass through entities represent more than 90 of all businesses and during the 2017 tax overhaul he sought to keep them competitive with large publicly held c corporations pacur llc the oshkosh based plastic company that johnson helped found was structured as a pass through business johnson disclosed in his official statement of economic interest that he sold his interest in the business for between 5 million and 20 million in 2020 he said the deal had been in the works since 2018 johnson s campaign spokesman jake wilkins said the audio is exactly what senator johnson has said in public and private for years despite strong opposition he secured tax relief for more than 90 of u s businesses who benefited from it after it became law while it is true that pacur is an llc and received tax relief along with the other more than 20 million tax filers that take advantage of his efforts that s the necessary result of ensuring all businesses get a tax cut so they can remain competitive with big business c corps it is a gross distortion to imply his tax cuts were a special deal for a few his tax cuts benefited the many wilkins also launched a broadside over ads that have run on the subject if media outlets were honest and unbiased they would fact check the democrat attack ads and label them mostly false wilkins said in a statement although the ads do contain a kernel of truth they grossly distort the full impact of his important legislative achievement and falsely imply a selfish motive during the taylor county meeting johnson took on what he called the distorted attack ads that have run against him they said i doubled my wealth he said that s true johnson explained that after he got elected in 2010 he took all of his marketable securities and placed them in cash so that he would have no conflicts meanwhile the stock market went up 3 8 times he said the reason his wealth doubled is that he sold his business i sat on cash he said i m still sitting on cash i knew during the covid recession that this was a good time to invest in the stock market i didn t i stayed invested in i ve just got cash ok he added i m not asking anybody to feel sorry for me

for happiness as an end goal is really a sensible and worthwhile act sign up to our daily dewsbury reporter today newsletter sign up thank you for signing up did you know with an ad lite subscription

it as a lyrical philosophical study on how to go about your life acted out by four driven friends who on the surface seem to be driving forward yet at the same time continue to lurch from personal crisis to crisis in their blinkered quest for material success these two states of being as we soon come to learn are intrinsically connected and indeed the opening paragraphs of the novel set out perfectly what is to be explored the aristotelian path to happiness is surely a treacherous one demanding our excellence and virtue at every step what can we learn really from people who were resolute it is not the purpose of life to be happy what really is the point of well being if it does not contain at least occasional pleasure are we to be dismissed as hedonists because it is better when the pleasant outweighs the painful we are wired to seek out happiness it guarantees us some sort of future and we are condemned to pursue it forever the beautiful anatomy of despair by niall stewart examines the corrosive impact of pursuing happiness as a life goal the story begins at a meditation retreat in san francisco in 2014 where we meet tristan a contemplative 20 something british legal professional looking to find himself here he is drawn to seb a younger more confident man with whom he is keen to strike up a friendship following the retreat he starts spending time with seb and eventually joins him and seb s older sister camilla at a society dinner but then the narrative jumps to a new set up and new character this time toby who works a 14 hour day city job in london and is attending parties in the evening with his careless hedonistic friend igor painfully shy and crippled with self doubt and self hatred toby puts on a front of contentment while being secretly distressed about how everyone seems to be having a better life than him is it too late to pretend to be someone else he muses at a party the next evening he is trashing his apartment as alcohol releases the full fury of his inner loathing next we jump to italy s amalfi coast where cordelia green is tied to her long term boyfriend freddie despite or perhaps because of the fact it makes both their lives more difficult but after cordelia receives some bad family news it falls to freddie to return to london to inform her parents that she is missing it s on this cliff hanger that we jump forward to 2017 and back to tristan in a gut wrenching scene about devastating heartbreak we find him writing a letter to his now ex seb detailing how one year on from their parting he searches for him on the internet and still follows his movements from afar spending all his time wondering how to go on without him the grief and loss so frankly expressed by tristan will be relatable to everyone but there is little doubt that this has become obsessional and that his former partner was as much of a shield against the emptiness inside as a lover what i particularly love about the beautiful anatomy of despair is how dark yet honest emotions are portrayed unfiltered and with no promise of quick recovery with tristan we watch as he wallows in his misery if only seb could witness his desolation he would return tristan muses while of course the very opposite is true to his credit tristan does try to get better for instance he ploughs through biographies and autobiographies consoled somewhat by the shared complexity of other people s lives we cheer for him willing him to improve while through access to some of seb s diary entries we also come to learn more about their relationship and how it was doomed with seb s infidelity and growing sense of relationship ennui what is expressed so well in these well realised characters is how the pursuit of distraction travel work parties is to try and mask an unnerving sense of not knowing where life is heading or their place within it author niall stewart makes a confident literary debut with probing psychological novel the beautiful anatomy of despair they are connected as friends and occasional lovers yet each is truly alone and deep down they recognise this as they battle with inner demons for instance academic igor is starting to tire of his party boy lifestyle as he enters his 30s while investment banker toby becomes more resentful as he tries to keep up the appearance of success and as the book s exquisite title suggests there is more turmoil to come with devastating secrets unearthed and events spiralling out of the characters control insisting a reconciliation with life as it is and with themselves as they really are not all of them however will be able to make this crucial transition all told then this is both a simple and complex narrative brilliantly executed by author niall stewart perhaps this line in the book sums it up best we re just people muddling along as best we can i will not be made to feel guilty about it a bold and original psychodrama that skewers the world as we know it the beautiful anatomy of despair is also a sensitive and perceptive social commentary on the futility of pursuing happiness as life s goal on the contrary it shows us how instead of trying to manipulate life and seek unrealistic expectations of happiness we should perhaps concentrate on genuine connections both with ourselves and others the prose is articulate without falling into the trap of self indulgence a common issue with literary fiction and the ideas explored are elucidated clearly through the narrative and cast it s not every day that you come across a novel tackling the views of philosophers such as aristotle and the epicureans that is so imaginative and absorbing we come to care for the plights of the characters however personally flawed they may be and this helps illuminate the sound life lessons being put forth such as consideration of why we give our power so freely to others why we attach meaning to things that don t really matter and how can we live our own lives when sheltering in another s apartment the intricate character studies are to be praised and the mixture of light and dark littered with many throw away but spot on observations make the novel despite the sobering tenor a joy to devour most of all i loved the dark nights of the soul where the false exterior falls away and leaves fears exposed it is part of being human and this honesty is impactful at times you are deeper beneath the skin of a given character than they are in conclusion then this is a triumphant literary debut that manages to take a bleak outlook and turn it into a bold new take on reinvention and its limits particularly relevant to today s post modern thrill seeking generation it claws out the inner piping of the generation z and millennial crowd shining an interrogatory light into well groomed faces with rictus smiles the beautiful anatomy of despair is on full display and handled with the intelligence care and spectacle of a medical school dissection the beautiful anatomy of despair by niall stewart austin macauley publishers is out now on amazon in paperback hardcover and ebook priced at 8 99 12 99 and 3 50 respectively for more information visit www niallstewart co uk or follow him on twitter or instagram nialltfstewart q a interview with author niall stewart author niall stewart has made a confident literary debut with his thought provoking novel the beautiful anatomy of despair we caught up with the author who is based in edinburgh and london to find out more about the book s philosophical exploration of the pursuit of happiness and social examination of modern masculinity q how would you sum up the beautiful anatomy of despair a anatomy is a novel about the pursuit of happiness a group of friends struggling in the modern world coming to terms with what it requires of them and trying to find their place in it these are characters who want to know what happiness looks like and they re asking whether it s achievable and if it is at what price to themselves and others it is achieved q what inspired you to become an author and how have you found the journey thus far a writing is a way to figure out the world and the human condition in all its beautiful squalor also if you re fascinated by people but enjoy your own company the life of a novelist offers the best of both worlds i people watch when i m having my morning coffee in one of my local cafes but then i adjourn home to my laptop insulated from the outside world and create my own virtual reality the journey thus far seductive and occasionally perilous q what personal life lessons have you drawn on for the ideas explored in your novel a the biggest lesson life has taught me so far is that if you re looking for answers make sure you re asking the right questions this in many ways is the experience of the characters in the beautiful anatomy of despair and like all of us they want answers to the big questions what do they want their lives to look like should they accept their lot or strive to alter it life is a journey but who s driving the bus and if it s not us how do we get our hands on the wheel q you have said that it can be difficult to distinguish between cheerfulness and despair can you explain what you mean a we can all project a cheerfulness we re not feeling fake it till you make it these days that approach is so instinctive we re not always aware we re doing it so there s that but there s another angle to it pain and pleasure so often spring from the same source and sometimes what should be our best moment turns into our worst at your highest moment be careful that s when the devil comes for you as denzel washington recently told will smith q your novel in a sense celebrates a more mournful outlook on life why is despair worth praise a out of the wound comes salvation or as franklin d roosevelt put it only if you ve been in the deepest valley can you ever know how magnificent it is to be on the highest mountain in any event some degree of despair is unavoidable and a life spent striving to avoid pain or pretending it doesn t exist or downplaying the havoc it can wreak strikes me as a brittle form of salvation the pursuit of the perfect life the hobbesian endless circle of desire round and round we go is a really good way to make ourselves miserable because we can never satisfy all our wants q why did you choose to explore the themes of despair loneliness and the blind pursuit of happiness through mostly male characters a i wanted to study society s shifting expectations of maleness the crisis of masculinity is i think one of the great issues of our time so much machismo comes from a place of insecurity modelled on some abstract idea of power and i thought it would be interesting to explore what happens to an individual who is at odds with the world but who no longer has any real control over what happens to him in it q what was the greatest challenge you faced in writing your novel and how did you overcome it a persuading my family it was worth giving up a very promising legal career to write it but i can be very persuasive q what do you hope readers will gain from reading your novel a i hope they see in my version of reality a world they recognise in effect yes that is the way it is q as well as on amazon and waterstones your book is available at numerous independent bookstores across the uk as a book lover yourself why do you think it important that independent bookstores are championed a i love an indie bookshop they re communities and their stock is so carefully curated it s an

new psychological debut novel the beautiful anatomy of despair by niall stewart is a brilliant examination of angst suffering and coming to terms with loss in a modern individualistic society by gwyneth rees the beautiful anatomy of despair by debut author niall stewart is a surprisingly uplifting tragicomedy about loving belonging and hoping woven together by the poignant stories of its four central characters a timely work of literary fiction with significant psychological and sociological depth it examines the fundamental question of what makes us happy and considers whether striving for happiness as an end goal is really a sensible and worthwhile act sign up to our daily newsletter sign up thank you for signing up did you know with a digital subscription to blackpool gazette you can get unlimited access to the website including our premium content as well as benefiting from fewer ads loyalty rewards and much more learn more sorry there seem to be some issues please try again later submitting you could then in a sense describe it as a lyrical philosophical study on how to go about your life acted out by four driven friends who on the surface seem to be driving forward yet at the same time continue to lurch from personal crisis to crisis in their blinkered quest for material success these two states of being as we soon come to learn are intrinsically connected and indeed the opening paragraphs of the novel set out perfectly what is to be explored the aristotelian path to happiness is surely a treacherous one demanding our excellence and virtue at every step what can we learn really from people who were resolute it is not the purpose of life to be happy what really is the point of well being if it does not contain at least occasional pleasure are we to be dismissed as hedonists because it is better when the pleasant outweighs the painful we are wired to seek out happiness it guarantees us some sort of future and we are condemned to pursue it forever the beautiful anatomy of despair by niall stewart examines the corrosive impact of pursuing happiness as a life goal the story begins at a meditation retreat in san francisco in 2014 where we meet tristan a contemplative 20 something british legal professional looking to find himself here he is drawn to seb a younger more confident man with whom he is keen to strike up a friendship following the retreat he starts spending time with seb and eventually joins him and seb s older sister camilla at a society dinner but then the narrative jumps to a new set up and new character this time toby who works a 14 hour day city job in london and is attending parties in the evening with his careless hedonistic friend igor painfully shy and crippled with self doubt and self hatred toby puts on a front of contentment while being secretly distressed about how everyone seems to be having a better life than him is it too late to pretend to be someone else he muses at a party the next evening he is trashing his apartment as alcohol releases the full fury of his inner loathing next we jump to italy s amalfi coast where cordelia green is tied to her long term boyfriend freddie despite or perhaps because of the fact it makes both their lives more difficult but after cordelia receives some bad family news it falls to freddie to return to london to inform her parents that she is missing it s on this cliff hanger that we jump forward to 2017 and back to tristan in a gut wrenching scene about devastating heartbreak we find him writing a letter to his now ex seb detailing how one year on from their parting he searches for him on the internet and still follows his movements from afar spending all his time wondering how to go on without him the grief and loss so frankly expressed by tristan will be relatable to everyone but there is little doubt that this has become obsessional and that his former partner was as much of a shield against the emptiness inside as a lover what i particularly love about the beautiful anatomy of despair is how dark yet honest emotions are portrayed unfiltered and with no promise of quick recovery with tristan we watch as he wallows in his misery if only seb could witness his desolation he would return tristan muses while of course the very opposite is true to his credit tristan does try to get better for instance he ploughs through biographies and autobiographies consoled somewhat by the shared complexity of other people s lives we cheer for him willing him to improve while through access to some of seb s diary entries we also come to learn more about their relationship and how it was doomed with seb s infidelity and growing sense of relationship ennui what is expressed so well in these well realised characters is how the pursuit of distraction travel work parties is to try and mask an unnerving sense of not knowing where life is heading or their place within it author niall stewart makes a confident literary debut with probing psychological novel the beautiful anatomy of despair they are connected as friends and occasional lovers yet each is truly alone and deep down they recognise this as they battle with inner demons for instance academic igor is starting to tire of his party boy lifestyle as he enters his 30s while investment banker toby becomes more resentful as he tries to keep up the appearance of success and as the book s exquisite title suggests there is more turmoil to come with devastating secrets unearthed and events spiralling out of the characters control insisting a reconciliation with life as it is and with themselves as they really are not all of them however will be able to make this crucial transition all told then this is both a simple and complex narrative brilliantly executed by author niall stewart perhaps this line in the book sums it up best we re just people muddling along as best we can i will not be made to feel guilty about it a bold and original psychodrama that skewers the world as we know it the beautiful anatomy of despair is also a sensitive and perceptive social commentary on the futility of pursuing happiness as life s goal on the contrary it shows us how instead of trying to manipulate life and seek unrealistic expectations of happiness we should perhaps concentrate on genuine connections both with ourselves and others the prose is articulate without falling into the trap of self indulgence a common issue with literary fiction and the ideas explored are elucidated clearly through the narrative and cast it s not every day that you come across a novel tackling the views of philosophers such as aristotle and the epicureans that is so imaginative and absorbing we come to care for the plights of the characters however personally flawed they may be and this helps illuminate the sound life lessons being put forth such as consideration of why we give our power so freely to others why we attach meaning to things that don t really matter and how can we live our own lives when sheltering in another s apartment the intricate character studies are to be praised and the mixture of light and dark littered with many throw away but spot on observations make the novel despite the sobering tenor a joy to devour most of all i loved the dark nights of the soul where the false exterior falls away and leaves fears exposed it is part of being human and this honesty is impactful at times you are deeper beneath the skin of a given character than they are in conclusion then this is a triumphant literary debut that manages to take a bleak outlook and turn it into a bold new take on reinvention and its limits particularly relevant to today s post modern thrill seeking generation it claws out the inner piping of the generation z and millennial crowd shining an interrogatory light into well groomed faces with rictus smiles the beautiful anatomy of despair is on full display and handled with the intelligence care and spectacle of a medical school dissection the beautiful anatomy of despair by niall stewart austin macauley publishers is out now on amazon in paperback hardcover and ebook priced at 8 99 12 99 and 3 50 respectively for more information visit www niallstewart co uk or follow him on twitter or instagram nialltfstewart q a interview with author niall stewart author niall stewart has made a confident literary debut with his thought provoking novel the beautiful anatomy of despair we caught up with the author who is based in edinburgh and london to find out more about the book s philosophical exploration of the pursuit of happiness and social examination of modern masculinity q how would you sum up the beautiful anatomy of despair a anatomy is a novel about the pursuit of happiness a group of friends struggling in the modern world coming to terms with what it requires of them and trying to find their place in it these are characters who want to know what happiness looks like and they re asking whether it s achievable and if it is at what price to themselves and others it is achieved q what inspired you to become an author and how have you found the journey thus far a writing is a way to figure out the world and the human condition in all its beautiful squalor also if you re fascinated by people but enjoy your own company the life of a novelist offers the best of both worlds i people watch when i m having my morning coffee in one of my local cafes but then i adjourn home to my laptop insulated from the outside world and create my own virtual reality the journey thus far seductive and occasionally perilous q what personal life lessons have you drawn on for the ideas explored in your novel a the biggest lesson life has taught me so far is that if you re looking for answers make sure you re asking the right questions this in many ways is the experience of the characters in the beautiful anatomy of despair and like all of us they want answers to the big questions what do they want their lives to look like should they accept their lot or strive to alter it life is a journey but who s driving the bus and if it s not us how do we get our hands on the wheel q you have said that it can be difficult to distinguish between cheerfulness and despair can you explain what you mean a we can all project a cheerfulness we re not feeling fake it till you make it these days that approach is so instinctive we re not always aware we re doing it so there s that but there s another angle to it pain and pleasure so often spring from the same source and sometimes what should be our best moment turns into our worst at your highest moment be careful that s when the devil comes for you as denzel washington recently told will smith q your novel in a sense celebrates a more mournful outlook on life why is despair worth praise a out of the wound comes salvation or as franklin d roosevelt put it only if you ve been in the deepest valley can you ever know how magnificent it is to be on the highest mountain in any event some degree of despair is unavoidable and a life spent striving to avoid pain or pretending it doesn t exist or downplaying the havoc it can wreak strikes me as a brittle form of salvation the pursuit of the perfect life the hobbesian endless circle of desire round and round we go is a really good way to make ourselves miserable because we can never satisfy all our wants q why did you choose to explore the themes of despair loneliness and the blind pursuit of happiness through mostly male characters a i wanted to study society s shifting expectations of maleness the crisis of masculinity is i think one of the great issues of our time so much machismo comes from a place of insecurity modelled on some abstract idea of power and i thought it would be interesting to explore what happens to an individual who is at odds with the world but who no longer has any real control over what happens to him in it q what was the greatest challenge you faced in writing your novel and how did you overcome it a persuading my family it was worth giving up a very promising legal career to write it but i can be very persuasive q what do you hope readers will gain from reading your novel a i hope they see in my version of reality a world they recognise in effect yes that is the way it is q as well as on amazon and waterstones your book is available at numerous independent bookstores across the uk as a book lover yourself why do you think it important that independent bookstores are championed a i love an indie bookshop they re communities and their stock is so carefully curated it s an invitation into someone s personal collection q what can we expect from you next

michael balsamo and zeke miller the associated press washington president joe biden on monday took fresh aim at ghost guns the privately made firearms without serial numbers that are increasingly cropping up in violent crimes as he struggles to break past gun control opposition to address firearm deaths speaking at the white house biden highlighted the justice department s work to finalize new regulations to crack down on ghost guns and announced the nomination of steve dettelbach who served as a u s attorney in ohio from 2009 to 2016 to run the bureau of alcohol tobacco firearms and explosives law enforcement is sounding the alarm biden said of ghost guns briefly holding one up for cameras to see in the rose garden our communities are paying the price he promised the new regulations would save lives still the announcement on guns highlights the limits of biden s influence to push a sweeping congressional overhaul of the nation s firearm laws in response to both a recent surge in violent crime and continued mass shootings congress has deadlocked on legislative proposals to reform gun laws for a decade and executive actions have faced stiff headwinds in federal courts even as the democratic base has grown more vocal in calling on biden to take more consequential action dettelbach s confirmation too is likely to be an uphill battle biden had to withdraw the nomination of his first atf nominee gun control advocate david chipman after it stalled for months because of opposition from republicans and some democrats in the senate both republican and democratic administrations have failed to get nominees for the atf position through the politically fraught process since the director s position was made confirmable in 2006 since then only one nominee former u s attorney b todd jones has been confirmed jones made it through the senate in 2013 but only after a six month struggle jones was acting director when president barack obama nominated him in january 2013 the biden administration s plan on guns was first reported by politico for nearly a year the ghost gun rule has been making its way through the federal regulation process gun safety groups and democrats in congress have been pushing for the justice department to finish the rule for months it will probably be met with heavy resistance from gun groups and draw litigation in the coming weeks gun owners of america vowed that it would immediately fight the rule just as we opposed the trump administration s arbitrary ban on bump stocks goa will also sue biden s atf to halt the implementation of this rule aidan johnston the group s director of federal affairs said in a statement the group believes the rule violates the u s constitution and several federal laws support but gun safety advocacy groups like everytown for gun safety which pushed the federal government for years to take action on ghost guns applauded biden s moves and insisted that both dettelbach s appointment and the finalized rule will help combat gun violence ghost guns look like a gun they shoot like a gun and they kill like a gun but up until now they haven t been regulated like a gun said john feinblatt everytown s president christian heyne the vice president of policy at brady another gun control group said dettelbach was an unimpeachable public servant who has spent a career using the levers of government to hold negligent or nefarious actors accountable justice department statistics show that nearly 24 000 ghost guns were recovered by law enforcement at crime scenes and reported to the government from 2016 to 2020 it is hard to say how many are circulating on the streets in part because in many cases police departments don t contact the government about the guns because they can t be traced adjusts definition the new rule changes the current definition of a firearm under federal law to include unfinished parts like the frame of a handgun or the receiver of a long gun it says those parts must be licensed and include serial numbers manufacturers must also run background checks before a sale as they do with other commercially made firearms the requirement applies regardless of how the firearm was made meaning it includes ghost guns made from individual parts kits or by 3d printers federally licensed firearms dealers must retain key records until they shut down their business or licensed activity and then transfer the records to atf as they are currently required to do at the end of licensed activity previously these dealers were permitted to destroy most records after 20 years making it harder for law enforcement to trace firearms found at crime scenes a year ago this week standing here with many of you i instructed the attorney gen eral to write a regulation that would rein in the proliferation of ghost guns because i was having trouble getting anything passed in the congress biden said the rule goes into effect 120 days from the date of publication in the federal register for years federal officials have been sounding the alarm about an increasing black market for homemade military style semi automatic rifles and handguns as well as turning up more frequently at crime scenes ghost guns have been increasingly encountered when federal agents buy guns in undercover operations from gang members and other criminals some states like california have enacted laws in recent years to require serial numbers to be stamped on ghost guns critically important pennsylvania attorney general josh shapiro who was attending monday s event at the white house applauded the move and pointed to a serious uptick in ghost guns being found by police police in philadelphia have seen nearly a 500 increase in the number of ghost guns recovered in the past two years shapiro said and just last week a police officer there was shot by a ghost gun wielding 18 year old who police said had also shot three others this loophole has caused our nation countless lives shapiro said in an interview today is a critically important step to close that loophole he said the move is likely to help drive down violence and aid both police and prosecutors in bringing their cases the rule is also likely to help bring down the number of people who shouldn t be purchasing firearms before a gun lands in their hand he said there are two challenges one criminals can easily buy them without going through a background check and two they are unserialized and untraceable unfinished the critical component in building an untraceable gun is what is known as the lower receiver a part typically made of metal or polymer an unfinished receiver sometimes referred to as an 80 percent receiver can be legally bought online with no serial numbers or other markings on it no license required police across the country have been reporting spikes in ghost guns being recovered by officers the new york police department for example said officers found 131 firearms without serial numbers since january a gunman who killed his wife and four others in northern california in 2017 had been prohibited from owning firearms but he built his own to skirt the

china s state refiners are honouring existing russian oil contracts but avoiding new ones despite steep discounts heeding beijing s call for caution as western sanctions mount against russia over its invasion of ukraine six people told reuters state run sinopec 600028 ss asia s largest refiner cnooc petrochina 601857 ss and sinochem have stayed on the sidelines in trading fresh russian cargoes for may loadings said the people who all have knowledge of the matter but spoke on condition of anonymity given the sensitivity of the subject chinese state owned firms do not wish to be seen as openly supporting moscow by buying extra volumes of oil said two of the people after washington banned russian oil last month and the european union slapped sanctions on top russian exporter rosneft rosn mm and gazprom neft sibn mm soes are cautious as their actions could be seen as representing the chinese government and none of them wants to be singled out as a buyer of russian oil said one of the people sinopec and petrochina declined comment cnooc and sinochem did not immediately respond to a request for comment china and russia have developed increasingly close ties in recent years and as recently as february announced a no limits partnership and china has refused to condemn russia s action in ukraine or call it an invasion china has repeatedly criticised western sanctions against russia although a senior diplomat said on saturday that beijing is not deliberately circumventing sanctions on russia china the world s largest oil importer is the top buyer of russian crude at 1 6 million barrels per day half of which is supplied via pipelines under government to government contracts sources expect china s state firms to honour its long term and existing contracts for russian oil but steer clear of new spot deals a drop in china s imports of russian oil could prompt its giant state refiners to turn to alternative sources adding to global supply concerns that had driven benchmark brent oil prices lcoc1 to 14 year highs near 140 per barrel in early march after russia invaded ukraine on feb 24 brent futures have since eased to below 110 after the united states and allies announced plans to release stocks from strategic reserves risk control and compliance first before the ukraine crisis russia supplied 15 of china s oil imports half of that via the east siberian and atasu alashankou pipelines and the rest by tankers from its black sea baltic sea and far east ports unipec the trading arm of sinopec and a leading russian oil buyer has warned its global teams at regular internal meetings in recent weeks against the risks of dealing with russian oil the message and tone are clear risk control and compliance comes before profits said one of the sources who was briefed on the meetings although russian oil is hugely discounted there are many issues like securing shipping insurance and payment snags another of the sources with a refinery that regularly processes russian crude said his plant was told by unipec to find replacement to maintain normal operations beyond shipments that have arrived in march and due to arrive in april there will be no more russian oil going forward said this source unipec loaded 500 000 tonnes of urals from russia s baltic ports in march the highest volume in months supplied by surgutneftegaz on spot and under a rosneft export tender that unipec won for loadings between september 2021 and march 2022 according to traders and shipping data its latest urals deals will be two april loading shipments totalling 200 000 tonnes from russian producer surgutneftegaz sngs mm said two traders with knowledge of the deals in contrast india has so far booked at least 14 million barrels or about 2 million tonnes of russian oil since feb 24 versus nearly 16 million barrels in all of 2021 according to reuters calculations other state buyers petrochina cnooc and sinochem have shunned russia s espo blend for may loading sources said sinopec is facing payment problems even for deals agreed earlier as risk averse state banks look to scale down financing russian oil related deals the second source said teapots keep deals under wraps sanction worries have driven some independent refiners known as teapots once a dynamic group of customers consuming about a third of china s russian oil imports to fly under the radar espo trading was really slow and secretive some deals are being done but details are kept under wraps no one wants to be seen buying russian oil in public a regular espo dealer said to keep oil flowing these nimble refiners are deploying alternative payment mechanisms such as cash transfer paying after cargo is delivered and using chinese currency russian suppliers rosneft surgutneftegaz and gazprom neft and independent producers represented by swiss trader paramount energy are expected to ship a record 3 3 million tonnes of espo from kozmino port in may source reuters reporting by

members of organised crime gangs ocgs are more likely to violently turn on each other if they ve previously offended together a new study has revealed researchers from the university of cambridge studied 16 years of data from thames valley police in the hopes of understanding any patterns of violence within uk ocgs their analysis revealed cycles of escalating violence with members who harass other members far more likely to become victims of violence themselves our work shows the importance of taking relationships into account when developing policing risk factors and red flags said dr paolo campana who led the study members of organised crime gangs are more likely to violently turn on each other if they ve previously offended together a new study has revealed stock image dna spray can be used to identify moped thieves a dna spray which clings to fleeing moped raiders is being trialled to clampdown on soaring street crime the chemical spray can stick to skin and clothes for months allowing police to arrest moped enabled thieves weeks after a crime each batch of the chemical which cops spray onto suspects who can t be chased for safety reasons has a unique dna code which can link them to the crime read more advertisement network analyses have previously been used to help police in cities across the us including in chicago and boston however until now the technique has not been applied to ocgs in the uk in the study the team analysed anonymised records from thames valley police from 2000 to 2016 across a population of just over two million including oxford and reading more than 6 200 people were involved in crime during that time including 833 longstanding ocg members 93 per cent male seven per cent female most had been active in drug dealing while 51 per cent had been involved in a violent act including murder attempted murder manslaughter assault and actual and grievous bodily harm with and without intent meanwhile 26 per cent had been a victim of violence with female members twice as likely than males to be victims ocg members who had co offended or been suspected of co offending with another ocg member were 56 times more likely to become a victim of violence themselves typically from their former partner in crime members who harassed another member were 243 times more likely to be victimised while those who had attacked another member were a whopping 479 times more likely to be a victim of violence however simply having a rap sheet of criminal violence or hard drugs offences had no significant effect on the potential for future violence according to the team it often comes down to tit for tat retaliation that generates circuits of violence explained dr campana in the thames valley data we can see how prior co offending relationships turn sour and become a mechanism for further violence harassment within criminal networks also dramatically increases the potential for violence in the study the team studied anonymised records from thames valley police from 2000 to 2016 across a population of just over two million pictured the catchment areas 1 cherwell and west oxfordshire 2 aylesbury vale 3 milton keynes 4 oxford 5 south oxfordshire and vale of white horse 6 wycombe 7 chiltern and south buckinghamshire 8 slough 9 windsor and maidenhead 10 bracknell and wokingham 11 reading 12 west berkshire ocg members who had co offended or been suspected of co offending with another ocg member were 56 times more likely to become a victim of violence themselves typically from their former partner in crime stock image violence is like a virus it spreads through proximity and familiarity those within certain social bubbles are most at risk in some us cities co offending bubbles account for over 80 per cent of the violence as we collect more data we can expect to identify more of the chains and feedback loops that sustain violence and render it endemic within groups and locations the researchers hope the findings could help police in the future these techniques could help police identify at an earlier stage the social networks set to spiral into violence dr campana added
triblive s daily and weekly email newsletters deliver the news you want and information you need right to your inbox washington president joe biden on monday took fresh aim at ghost guns the privately made firearms without serial numbers that are increasingly cropping up in violent crimes as he struggles to break past gun control opposition to address firearm deaths speaking at the white house biden highlighted the justice department s work to finalize new regulations to crack down on ghost guns and announced the nomination of steve dettelbach who served as a u s attorney in ohio from 2009 to 2016 to run the bureau of alcohol tobacco firearms and explosives law enforcement is sounding the alarm biden said of ghost guns briefly holding one up for cameras to see in the rose garden our communities are paying the price he promised the new regulations would save lives still the announcement on guns highlights the limits of biden s influence to push a sweeping congressional overhaul of the nation s firearm laws in response to both a recent surge in violent crime and continued mass shootings congress has deadlocked on legislative proposals to reform gun laws for a decade and executive actions have faced stiff headwinds in federal courts even as the democratic base has grown more vocal in calling on biden to take more consequential action while announcing new actions to fight gun crime president biden calls on congress to pass universal background checks and to ban assault weapons and high capacity magazines makes a pretty funny joke about deer hunting shouts that assault weapons are a weapon of war pic twitter com hoeftfe7mq the recount therecount april 11 2022 dettelbach s confirmation too is likely to be an uphill battle biden had to withdraw the nomination of his first atf nominee gun control advocate david chipman after it stalled for months because of opposition from republicans and some democrats in the senate both republican and democratic administrations have failed to get nominees for the atf position through the politically fraught process since the director s position was made confirmable in 2006 since then only one nominee former u s attorney b todd jones has been confirmed jones made it through the senate in 2013 but only after a six month struggle jones was acting director when president barack obama nominated him in january 2013 the biden administration s plan on guns was first reported by politico for nearly a year the ghost gun rule has been making its way through the federal regulation process gun safety groups and democrats in congress have been pushing for the justice department to finish the rule for months it will probably be met with heavy resistance from gun groups and draw litigation in the coming weeks gun owners of america vowed that it would immediately fight the rule just as we opposed the trump administration s arbitrary ban on bump stocks goa will also sue biden s atf to halt the implementation of this rule aidan johnston the group s director of federal affairs said in a statement the group believes the rule violates the u s constitution and several federal laws but gun safety advocacy groups like everytown for gun safety which pushed the federal government for years to take action on ghost guns applauded biden s moves and insisted that both dettelbach s appointment and the finalized rule will help combat gun violence ghost guns look like a gun they shoot like a gun and they kill like a gun but up until now they haven t been regulated like a gun said john feinblatt everytown s president christian heyne the vice president of policy at brady another gun control group said dettelbach was an unimpeachable public servant who has spent a career using the levers of government to hold negligent or nefarious actors accountable justice department statistics show that nearly 24 000 ghost guns were recovered by law enforcement at crime scenes and reported to the government from 2016 to 2020 it is hard to say how many are circulating on the streets in part because in many cases police departments don t contact the government about the guns because they can t be traced the new rule changes the current definition of a firearm under federal law to include unfinished parts like the frame of a handgun or the receiver of a long gun it says those parts must be licensed and include serial numbers manufacturers must also run background checks before a sale as they do with other commercially made firearms the requirement applies regardless of how the firearm was made meaning it includes ghost guns made from individual parts kits or by 3d printers federally licensed firearms dealers must retain key records until they shut down their business or licensed activity and then transfer the records to atf as they are currently required to do at the end of licensed activity previously these dealers were permitted to destroy most records after 20 years making it harder for law enforcement to trace firearms found at crime scenes a year ago this week standing here with many of you i instructed the attorney general to write a regulation that would rein in the proliferation of ghost guns because i was having trouble getting anything passed in the congress biden said the rule goes into effect 120 days from the date of publication in the federal register for years federal officials have been sounding the alarm about an increasing black market for homemade military style semi automatic rifles and handguns as well as turning up more frequently at crime scenes ghost guns have been increasingly encountered when federal agents buy guns in undercover operations from gang members and other criminals some states like california have enacted laws in recent years to require serial numbers to be stamped on ghost guns pennsylvania attorney general josh shapiro who was attending monday s event at the white house applauded the move and pointed to a serious uptick in ghost guns being found by police police in philadelphia have seen nearly a 500 increase in the number of ghost guns recovered in the past two years shapiro said and just last week a police officer there was shot by a ghost gun wielding 18 year old who police said had also shot three others this loophole has caused our nation countless lives shapiro said in an interview today is a critically important step to close that loophole he said the move is likely to help drive down violence and aid both police and prosecutors in bringing their cases the rule is also likely to help bring down the number of people who shouldn t be purchasing firearms before a gun lands in their hand he said there are two challenges one criminals can easily buy them without going through a background check and two they are unserialized and untraceable the critical component in building an untraceable gun is what is known as the lower receiver a part typically made of metal or polymer an unfinished receiver sometimes referred to as an 80 percent receiver can be legally bought online with no serial numbers or other markings on it no license required police across the country have been reporting spikes in ghost guns being recovered by officers the new york police department for example said officers found 131 firearms without serial numbers since january a gunman who killed his wife and four others in northern california in 2017 had been prohibited from owning firearms but he built his own to skirt the court order before his rampage and in 2019 a teenager used a homemade handgun to fatally shoot two classmates and wound three others at a school in suburban los angeles
