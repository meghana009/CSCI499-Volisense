definitive guide series maruchan ramen noodle soup samyang buldak nongshim shin ramyun indomie mi goreng before i started reviewing instant noodles on a regular basis i fell in love with a product that was cheap exotic and relatively easy to access that product was indomie mi goreng i remember when we would venture out of the small town of anacortes washington in the northwest of the united states i would hope that i would get the chance to visit an asian grocery store in search of something new to try i remember after i discovered indomie mi goreng products being just head over heels about their satay variety i would get tons of it 20 or 30 packs my parents didn t mind it was inexpensive i would share with my friends who hadn t tried this is one seriously popular product around the world and just perfection with a fried egg in this guide i m going to go over the history of indomie s flagship mi goreng how i prepare it and some little known facts about it sit back put on your reading glasses watch me make some and prepare to learn a little about one of the wonders of the instant noodle world the definitive guide to indomie mi goreng history trivia history indofood was founded in 1971 as panganjaya intikusuma indomie was established in 1972 one of the first instant noodle brands in indonesia in 1994 indofood was established by consolidating several companies among them panganjaya intikusuma in the same year indofood became a public company on the jakarta stock exchange over the years indofood expanded its business in indonesia and became a company known for its quality products not only in instant noodles but also dairy food seasoning snack foods nutrition special foods however it is indomie that is always synonymous with indofood according to nielsen indomie is a brand with one of the highest brand equity in indonesia in 1994 indofood was established by consolidating several companies among them panganjaya intikusuma in the same year indofood became a public company on the jakarta stock exchange over the years indofood expanded its business in indonesia and became a company known for its quality products not only in instant noodles but also dairy food seasoning snack foods nutrition special foods however it is indomie that is always synonymous with indofood according to nielsen indomie is a brand with one of the highest brand equity in indonesia indomie wasn t immediately available for export outside of indonesia but something happened from an interview i conducted a few years ago indonesian students and workers also inadvertently introduced indomie mi goreng to their local friends or colleagues we have many stories of students cooking indomie noodles in their dorms and their foreign friends would all come to their room because of the enticing aroma and joined in that is how indomie goreng was first introduced to foreigners it seems i wasn t the only one to evangelize the qualities of indomie with my friends and family trivia indomie comes in a lot of varieties from the flagship mi goreng products for kids called my noodlez to varieties with real meat and extra crunchy bits what s in a name well indo comes from indonesia and mie is how you say noodles over there basically indonesian noodles children in the us have been selling things to raise money for schools for a long time walkathons cookies for girl scouts etc in indonesia kids sell indomie to friends and family to raise money for schools interestingly in malaysia both ibumie and indomie were made by the same manufacturer the indomie brand is indonesian while the ibumie brand is a malaysian brand that came out later due to a change in business direction by indomie s indonesia brand owner which created a vacuum when indomie exited temporarily from the local noodle market some years back you will notice that ibumie s packaging has similarities to indomies and they in fact were the same company at one point january 27th 2021 was a sad day for the noodle world the inventor of the indomie spice recipe nunuk nuraini died at age 59 she was a food technologist who had her hand in the development of every variety of indomie s flavor bases for instant noodles from an interview i conducted with indomie indonesians love to abbreviate and one of the most well known is internet which is the abbreviation of indomie telur kornet indomie with fried egg and corned beef there are variations such as interjunet which is indomie telur keju kornet indomie with fried egg cheese and corned beef and intersay which is indomie telur sayur indomie with fried egg and vegetables who is this man this little guy was on the sachets for years however no longer i asked the company what his name is but never got an answer he just kind of hangs out looking at that chili pepper going whoa but that s all we know about him how i prepare it i ve made it in a myriad of ways including but not limited to with fried egg with soft boiled egg with coriander or spring onion with cheese had to try it i ve also made bread using indomie and prison style burritos today however i am going to recreate the celebrated internet indomie telur kornet which is garnished primarily with corned beef and a fried egg the teardown here s what i could easily get my hands on an export package of indomie these are relatively easy to find in stores near where i live a case of them are relatively inexpensive as well at our grocery store near where i live indomie costs 99 cents however if you go a bit farther you can find a case of 30 packs for around 11 99 which is considerably more economical as this is the export version there is information on the package in different languages also this might be a slightly different version than found in indonesia locally sometimes i ve seen a sachet of chili powder sometimes it isn t present the standard compliment are three sachets of sauce two dry sachets and a block of fried instant noodles detail of the packaging click to enlarge looks to be meat free but check for yourself to prepare boil 400ml water and cook noodles for 3 minutes drain add sachet contents to a plate i generally cook the noodles in the pot drain return to a pot and add sachets to it finally stir and combine and enjoy the noodle block this is a fried noodle a dual sachet of bumbu seasoning and bawang goreng fried onion look you re learning a little indonesian aren t you finally we have the wet sachets it should be noted that these can be quite messy but one way to make it slightly easier is to cut them finished click to enlarge added fried egg corned beef fried with curry garlic powder and scallion fried garlic line slices and coriander indomie is definitely something you ll understand once you ve tried it when it comes to how good it is i don t think i ve met anyone who doesn t find it just wonderful stuff and i ve met a lot of instant noodle afficionados the noodles marry so well with the seasonings and imparts a oily mouthfeel with a light but sturdy fried noodle the flavor is just pure mastery by nunuk nuraini basically a sweet spicy savory and salty element combination that sings a song of an exotic land full of radiant cultural traditions music and flavor a real juggernaut this one i ve loved it for decades and still do 5 0 out of 5 0 stars where can i get indomie mi goreng pretty much any asian grocery store will have at least the original mi goreng however they may have other varieties as well it should be noted that not all varieties of indomie are soupless some do indeed have soup so it s important to read the directions on the packaging i ve had conversations with numerous individuals that decided the correct way to prepare their mi goreng was as a soup this is not the case that would be like making a bowl of spaghetti and marinara sauce and dumping a cup of boiling water in it and stirring it up no good here are a couple options from amazon a big box of the variety mentioned as the subject of this post indomie mi goreng instant stir fry noodles parting thoughts it s been really nice delving into a variety that has been a true favorite over the years it s the second variety i really became a fanatic over it should be said that indonesians are particularly proud of this stuff every time i come out with a top ten list they demand to know why it s not on there they ask if i ve ever tried it they demand some form of explanation what i tell them is that i ve tried over 4000 varieties of instant noodles and of them indomie is definitely one of my favorites if i made a top fifty list it d definitely be in there but i don t this generally isn t good enough for them but it s all i ve got i ve tried some spectacular instant noodle varieties over the years and many of those can t fit into the top tens anyways let me just finish by saying this i would most certainly not complain if i were on a deserted island and the only thing i had was a chicken coop full of eggs and an endless supply of indomie

the portland city council will consider whether to bring back emergency hazard pay for workers while the city s mask mandate remains in effect it s not a perfect solution it s not a permanent solution said councilor victoria pelletier who is sponsoring a hazard pay amendment to the mask ordinance but it s at least something so that we can have hazard pay for individuals we expect to show up to work while we work on raising the minimum wage she expects her proposal to be presented to the council monday and to be the subject of a workshop feb 14 before it is voted on feb 28 pelletier was the only councilor who voted jan 3 against lifting the state of emergency in portland that had allowed a new hazard pay ordinance to kick in the ordinance approved by voters in a 2020 referendum vote requires portland employers to pay staff who come to work at least 50 percent more than the minimum wage during any declared state or city emergency pelletier said she didn t think enough time was devoted to discussing hazard pay at the jan 3 meeting and she believes it should come back to the council i m not sure how it will be voted on pelletier said but if we have a mask mandate we need to be talking about hazard pay and if we re asking individuals to show up and overexpose themselves to the pandemic we need to make sure we re providing them that level of pay and investing in them advertisement on tuesday she joined hazard pay supporters for a rally at city hall we have to prioritize the health and safety of workers over profits said matt beck a member of the southern maine workers center which organized the rally many of the dangerous decisions are made under frameworks that deny the truth that we have enough resources to take care of each other without leaving anyone out supporting workers doesn t have to mean throwing businesses under the bus beck said hazard pay doesn t just help individual workers it also advances equity and helps stem the spread of covid 19 for teachers nurses and line cooks hazard pay enables the worker to stay home and get well when they re sick beck said when workers fear being fired or evicted if they miss a shift they re left with no choice but to come to work when they re sick with covid 19 related portland city council repeals covid emergency order and approves indoor mask mandate jake gamache who stocks shelves at hannaford for 15 an hour was one of about 40 people who attended the rally he called on the council to support essential workers the pandemic is raging said gamache 23 every week we have a covid scare someone has to call out and get tested which means calling me and asking me if i ve been in contact with them and then i have to get tested the whole thing is just a nightmare advertisement hannaford was one of the portland businesses that implemented hazard pay in nov 2020 before a legal challenge delayed the date it took effect to jan 1 2022 gamache said his pay temporarily increased to 18 per hour for about six months it was really nice to be secure in my rent especially at a time when i got vaccinated but it was still up in the air about how effective vaccines are he said i was like at least i m financially secure if i do get sick being more financially secure was nice the hazard pay ordinance went into effect jan 1 but expired jan 13 after the council voted to end the city s state of emergency councilors at the jan 3 meeting said they sympathized with workers but were also moved by feedback from business owners who said paying it would be a challenge councilors also said the emergency order enacted in august was never intended to last so long and that its primary purpose had been to allow for remote council meetings the council now has a separate policy that allows remote meetings to continue at its next meeting monday the council will consider whether to extend the mask mandate for another month to march 7 it will also consider a companion order that would have councilors vote on whether to extend the mandate during the first meeting of every month instead of every 30 days the mandate went into effect on jan 5 but will remain in place over the weekend even though monday s vote will take place after more than 30 days said jessica grondin a city spokesperson she said the mandate can only be lifted through a council vote pelletier said her mask mandate amendment would mirror the provisions of the current hazard pay ordinance and would be revisited regularly by the council advertisement it would just be an amendment to the mask mandate to include a hazard wage so as long as a mask mandate is enacted the hazard wage would be enacted she said portland has implemented various forms of hazard pay for city employees during the pandemic using state and federal funds including a temporary pay increase a year ago for workers at the barron center nursing home during a covid 19 outbreak but the city did not offer extra pay from jan 1 13 for its employees who earn less than 19 50 per hour because city code bars citizens initiatives from affecting the wages of city employees any council action to initiate hazard pay outside the hazard pay ordinance however would apply to city workers grondin said she said the city is preparing a fiscal impact statement for the council workshop councilor tae chong who was among the majority voting jan 3 to remove the state of emergency said tuesday he supports increases to the minimum wage but is concerned about the impact hazard pay would have on nonprofits social service agencies that rely on state reimbursements and small businesses hazard pay is going to benefit large businesses because they know they can pay more and eliminate some of the competition chong said i get the intent but the world doesn t work that way to me it s very short sighted and it s going to hurt the most vulnerable among us in social services and the business world the portland regional chamber of commerce while still awaiting the full details of the hazard pay proposal will not support it being passed as an ordinance said president and chief executive officer quincy hentzel on tuesday she said in an email that while the chamber supports a gradual increase to a 15 minimum wage in 2024 a hazard pay wage of 19 50 an hour would present enormous challenges to small businesses nonprofits childcare providers and social service agencies the council voted to lift the state of emergency in january on an 8 1 vote thereby ending hazard pay hentzel said any attempt to reverse this action will bring uncertainty among our members and would be a failure of leadership from the council who owe it to their constituents to remain consistent and clear in their policymaking send questions comments to the editors previous next filed under

accordance with or an alternative for generally accepted accounting principles and may be different from non gaap financial measures used by other companies in addition these non gaap financial measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles amdocs believes that non gaap financial measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with amdocsâ results of operations as determined in accordance with gaap and that these measures should only be used to evaluate amdocsâ results of operations in conjunction with the corresponding gaap measures amdocs believes that the presentation of non gaap diluted earnings per share and other financial measures including free cash flow and normalized free cash flow non gaap

recurring and unusual charges or benefits equity based compensation expense other and related tax effects amdocsâ management also uses the foregoing non gaap financial measures in addition to the corresponding gaap measures in reviewing the financial results of amdocs in addition amdocs believes that significant groups of investors exclude these items in reviewing its results and those of its competitors because the amounts of the items between companies can vary greatly depending on the assumptions used by an individual company in determining the amounts of the items amdocs further believes that where the adjustments used in calculating non gaap diluted earnings per share are based on specific identified amounts that impact different line items in the consolidated statements of income including cost of revenue research and development selling general and administrative operating income interest and other expenses net income taxes and net income it is useful to investors to understand how these specific line items in the consolidated statements of income are affected by these adjustments please refer to the reconciliation of selected financial metrics from gaap to non

overall manufacturing pmi improves slightly on expectation new orders miss forecast employment surpasses estimate pmi marks time nonfarm payrolls on friday are crucial to fed policy market response is limited with job report ahead the six weeks between the january promise of a rate hike and its march delivery will be a time of statistical trial for the federal reserve the fed s prospective tightening policy is predicated on inflation but it needs a healthy and recovering us economy for completion steady if not robust employment and an accepting if not ebullient us consumer are prerequisites if the us slides into a weak expansion with declining or contracting employment and hesitant consumer spending the ability of the fed to carry out its 2022 program of three or four rate hikes could be constrained or blocked even if it fulfills its march intention further increases and the reduction of its 9 trillion balance sheet might vanish in the gloom of an economic slowdown january s purchasing managers indexes pmi from the institute for supply management were the first important statistics on the road to the march 16 federal open market committee fomc meeting manufacturing pmi was as expected 57 6 on a 57 5 forecast and a mildly revised to 58 8 from 58 7 december result the slight improvement on the prediction belies its position as the weakest reading in 16 months and markedly below the 2021 average of 60 66 manufacturing pmi fxstreet the new order index was a straight miss at 57 9 it was substantially weaker than the 61 consensus estimate the lowest score in 19 months june 2020 56 7 and far beneath the 64 3 average for last year the upward revision for december to 61 from 60 4 is not compensation new orders pmi fxstreet oddly the best of the three indexes was employment january rose to 54 3 from 53 9 in november and was well ahead of the 53 8 forecast it was the best measurement since last april and the only one above its 2021 average of 52 8 the manufacturing sector has long been considered a leading indicator for the performance of the us economy despite its decline in size relative to the dominant service sector manufacturing requires long range planning factory managers must estimate consumer demand months and years ahead and negotiate turbulent global resources and labor markets making them the most practical of forecasters retail sales nonfarm payrolls and consumer sentiment the us holiday season was poor retail sales fell 1 9 in december much worse than forecast and rose only 0 1 for the three months from october perhaps the 1 8 gain in october s promotions will be duplicated in january s traditional white sales which might rescue the season for retailers demand is still expected to be plentiful after 18 months of varying restrictions and scarcity but soaring 7 inflation much higher for many necessities may be draining family budgets and reducing consumption employment has been disappointing established american companies enrolled just 488 000 workers in the november and december nonfarm payroll lists this was barely half the 950 000 expected january estimates are even worse with 153 000 forecast and the margin over a loss uncomfortably small nonfarm payrolls fxstreet the economic logic for a negative january nfp is present initial jobless claims have been rising 24 higher in a month though still low by historical levels the four week moving average for claims has climbed from 199 750 on december 24 to 247 000 on january 21 the claims estimate for the week of january 28 is 245 000 the us job force is still several million short of the number of employed workers in january 2020 consumers are unhappy the michigan consumer sentiment index dropped to 67 2 in january the worst score since november 2011 the index has averaged 70 over the last six months lower even than the shock reading of 71 8 in april 2020 michigan consumer sentiment fxstreet markets equities have had a terrible january and it would have taken much more than even an excellent ism report to spark a good reaction there is also rising dread of the january nfp repost on friday hiring is expected to fall to 153 000 but the fears are very much for a poorer or even negative number the extant pmi report evoked a negative but transitory reaction from stocks the dow and the s p 500 dropped to their intraday lows after the 10 00 am new york time release though both had recovered to small gains by mid day the nasdaq composite was falling before the release touched bottom shortly thereafter and then rebound with the market the pmi figures show a relatively strong rate of us economic expansion and though orders and the overall were less than anticipated they are not close to contraction credit market traders had a different response the indexes all of which were solidly positive depict an economy sufficiently strong to support higher interest rates treasury yields in the 2 year 10 year and 30 year securities rose post issue and retained their gains to mid day currencies evinced little immediate response though by early afternoon the dollar had weakened in all the major pairs conclusion the january pmi numbers had something for everyone and interpretation depended on where one looked overall the indexes indicate a continuing expansion and the rise in employment is promising in the context of the last two years and the still unrecovered us economy and labor market the headline and orders indexes are causes for concern the overall index was the weakest in 16 months and what is worse at 57 6 is well below the 2021 average of 60 66 new orders were the lowest in 19 months and they are far beneath last year s average of 64 3 the trends are moving in the wrong direction employment was the sole improvement scoring its highest level since april 2021 do the problems in manufacturing stem from the myriad unresolved supply chain and labor issues or are they evidence of a general economic slowdown the pmi results did not provide an answer but they certainly will keep worry at high levels not the least in the federal reserve offices in the eccles building in dc

according to the harvard t h chan school of public health another study found that even milk chocolate could aid in weight loss by boosting metabolism and curbing appetite however the participant group was small just 19 women which means further research is needed to corroborate those claims and it s important to note that chocolate especially milk chocolate is high in calories so should be consumed in moderation eating more won t benefit you more 5 it fights free radicals and may play a role in cancer prevention evidence that dark chocolate possesses properties that could help protect against certain types of cancer is limited but growing antioxidants protect our cells from damage caused by free radicals which are unstable oxygen molecules thought to be responsible for aging and disease per research when you have too many free radicals in your body they start to attack your cells and that can lead over time to low grade inflammation and to some diseases cancer heart disease and alzheimer s dr dubost says according to the american cancer society eating a diet rich in flavonoids which chocolate is full of can help prevent cell damage that is often the precursor to many cancers research has found that of the many flavonoids in chocolate one known as epicatechin is believed to be responsible for its cancer fighting properties chocolate also tends to be a good source of magnesium per usda data and one study found that the body s immune cells can target abnormal or infected cells only in a magnesium rich environment still most research is limited by using only animals or cell cultures and the amount of chocolate needed to potentially yield preventative action against cancers is much higher than the daily recommended dose for humans related how to build an anti cancer diet 6 it s good for your skin in more ways than one the harvard t h chan school of public health lists vitamins and minerals that dark chocolate is packed full of like copper iron magnesium and manganese to name a few and that are also beneficial to your skin manganese for example supports the production of collagen a protein that helps keep skin looking young and healthy research has also found the high levels of antioxidants in dark chocolate may protect skin from the powerful ultraviolet uv rays emitted by the sun other research failed to show any significant protective effects of antioxidant rich chocolate against uv rays but did show improvements in the elasticity of skin exposed to the sun although the exact mechanism of this isn t known 7 dark chocolate may send good cholesterol up bad cholesterol down dark chocolate is also touted as a cholesterol lowering food which explains why in one study a handful of almonds dark chocolate and unsweetened cocoa resulted in a significant drop in overweight and obese participants low density lipoproteins ldl also known as bad cholesterol dubost says the cocoa butter in dark chocolate may also play a part in raising high density lipoproteins hdl or good cholesterol cocoa butter contains oleic acid which is a monounsaturated fat the same fat you find in heart healthy olive oil notes medlineplus but per the u s department of agriculture usda cocoa butter unlike olive oil is also high in saturated fat which in excess can be harmful to the heart further emphasizing the need for portion control not to mention many of the studies on chocolate and good cholesterol are short term so it s premature to say that chocolate is a cholesterol cure all dubost adds related the best and worst foods for people with high cholesterol 8 dark chocolate is nutritious and delicious on top of all the other potential benefits one thing is for sure dark chocolate contains a ton of nutrients of course the darker the chocolate the better but any 70 percent dark chocolate or higher contains antioxidants fiber potassium calcium copper and magnesium according to a research article it also contains a good chunk of calories and fat so be mindful of your daily intake each brand of chocolate is also processed differently amidor says going organic is always best because it s grown without the use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides look for rainforest alliance certified products she also recommends always checking the ingredients list to make sure you re consuming chocolate with fewer and more natural ingredients

ford motor co is planning a major reorganization to prepare for the electric future using tesla inc s success as a road map and accelerating ev spending by as much 20 billion the effort led by a former apple inc and tesla executive calls for ford to spend an additional 10 billion to 20 billion over the next five to 10 years converting factories worldwide to electric vehicle production from making gasoline powered cars according to people familiar with the plan that would be on top of the 30 billion ford already has committed to evs through 2025 the move is part of chief executive officer jim farley s initiative to challenge tesla s dominance in evs even as he takes pages from the playbook of the electric vehicle pioneer now the world s most valuable automaker investors have bought into farley s vision for ford briefly lifting the company s market value above 100 billion in january ford shares rose in afternoon trading climbing as much as 2 7 they traded up 1 3 to 20 56 as of 1 48 p m in new york the new plan also envisions a reworked ford organizational chart including the hiring of an unspecified number of engineers specializing in disciplines relatively new to the company such as battery chemistry artificial intelligence and ev software as part of the reorganization the company has evaluated spinning off a small portion of its ev business to capture some of the immense value investors are giving electric startups said one of the people who asked not to be identified because the deliberations aren t public the potential move would involve lower volume models allowing the company to focus its efforts on mass market evs the person said ford declined to comment on the planned reorganization and potential spinoff we are executing our ford plus plan to

company also is spending 11 4 billion with south korea s sk innovation to build three battery factories and an ev truck plant in tennessee and kentucky poached from apple ford poached field from apple in september to disrupt the 118 year old company he s working closely with farley to make the legacy automaker more nimble like tesla by adjusting ford s operational and manufacturing structure the people said the restructuring is a work in progress and some elements may be changed or dropped including the ev spinoff idea the people said the ford family which controls the automaker through a special class of supervoting stock would have to be convinced a spinoff is worthwhile farley has expressed admiration for tesla ceo elon musk and acknowledged ford is rethinking its mission as the company prepares to manufacture 600 000 evs a year by 2024 the dearborn michigan based automaker wants to generate as much as half of its global sales from electric vehicles by the end of the decade to drive home his desire to emulate tesla farley has taken to sharing news articles about the electric vehicle maker with others internally according to one person farley who did not comment for this story has said he s learned a lot from watching musk transform his company from a struggling startup to a high profit global ev leader that investors value at more than 1 trillion i really admire frankly the difficulties they had and the way they managed those difficulties into the success they had ford s ceo said in an interview last week with bloomberg tv s emily chang they are now making more than 10 000 a vehicle because of their scale i like that kind of business it s unclear which tesla practices farley plans to adopt as ford builds out its own ev manufacturing capacity and accelerates its shift from a mechanical engineer led workforce to one that increasingly is made up of software engineers keeping ice business unlike tesla ford also must manage the slow decline of vehicles powered by internal combustion engines which now generate all of the profit necessary to fund the company s ev aspirations that s an area ford also is intensely focused on as it reinvents itself farley sees gasoline fueled vehicles as a core part of the company for many years to come and still intends to invest enough to keep it competitive with rivals he said in a seperate interview last week one way is to boost the services ford sells to car owners a business that could generate 20 billion a year in revenue that could include selling drivers software to upgrade their car s performance or enhance dashboard touchscreens or it may involve getting more business in the service bays at ford s dealers which see 90 of owners go elsewhere for maintenance after their warranties expire farley said ultimately farley wants even more of ford s customers driving electric vehicles and that s the future he and field are preparing for ford hopes to eventually overtake tesla but for now is trying to solidify its standing as america s no 2 seller of evs what it takes to succeed in this digital connected electric product are talents and know how and a way of managing the business that s different than what we ve done in 118 years farley said last week it s kinda like snowboarding and skiing we both share the lift but as soon as you get off the lift the intuitions are wrong between both businesses you have to really relearn to how to get down the slope

asx200 swung between down 26 and up 51 before deciding to settle near 7000 by 2 30pm on the release the index shot up to be up 72 but by the close had settled back to near 7000 again thanks for playing the board is prepared to be patient as it monitors how the various factors affecting inflation in australia evolve in other words we re not going to go barrelling in with rate hikes a la fed the rba left the cash rate at 0 1 for now but will this month end further bond purchases qe the board still needs to see inflation not just between 2 3 but sustainably between 2 3 there are uncertainties about how persistent the pick up in inflation will be as supply side problems are resolved as expected preventing the rba from being more bullish is wages growth wages growth also remains modest and it is likely to be some time yet before aggregate wages growth is at a rate consistent with inflation being sustainably at target the conclusion probably no rate hike until september economists assume unless the december quarter wage price index and gdp numbers come in hotter than expected in which case maybe kick off will be in june so for now the market can rest easy every sector closed in the green yesterday bar one however a 1 2 fall in materials is misleading as due to argy bargy going on around bhp group s bhp solo listing bhp s 3 1 drop was enough to top the index losers list with rio tinto rio taking bronze on 2 4 as fund managers adjusted their weightings over in the bond market the response to the rba was muted the ten year yield rose one point to 1 90 it was different for the aussie it jumped another 0 8 to us 0 7127 having been under 70c only two sessions ago yet there was nothing hawkish about the rba statement largely ignored on the day were the december retail sales numbers sales fell 4 4 in the month when 2 0 was expected apart from the rba distraction gains of 4 9 in october and 7 3 in november indicate a shift to early christmas shopping in the face of possible supply shortages as was the warning at the time so nothing to be concerned about another day another rally on wall street our futures are up 55 do we now wave 7000 goodbye back to normal it is unclear as to why us exchanges bother opening at 9 30am they might as well just wait until 3 30pm that s when it all happens so it was last night when having opened a bit lower it looked for all the world like the major indices would close flat on the first day of february as an exhausted market reflected on a wild ride in january but no the indices all jumped up around 0 7 in the last half hour this suggests the bounce back from the january lows may perhaps not be dead cat but it s early days the end result in january was dow down 3 3 s p500 5 3 and nasdaq 9 0 there is an old adage in the market that how goes january so goes the rest of the year in terms of reliability it s right up there with sell in may ie not there was distinct focus last night on the us manufacturing pmi for january and particularly the numbers therein the pace of manufacturing growth slipped to a 14 month low of 57 6 due to covid impacts but 57 6 is still a healthy pace the component index of prices paid rose to 76 1 up from 68 2 in december which is concerning and reflective of stubborn inflation but backlogs were down in five of the past six months delivery times declined for a third straight month and new orders fell for a second consecutive month these could be signs supply side constraints are easing either way the fed now seems pretty well set on its new

one of the lesser known functions in google sheets is googlefinance which allows you to track current or historical financial securities data on the stock market here s how to use it what is google finance finance is google s real time tool that displays current market information and aggregates business news it s currently integrated with google search so if you look up the ticker symbol of a specific corporation on google such as wmt for walmart or aapl for apple you will immediately see the current stock quote and historical data for that security you can click one of these stocks to go to a company s google finance page which shows the company s financials related news and allows you to compare it with other commodities while there are other more robust tools you can use to track securities google finance is the only one that can effectively integrate with google sheets whether you re a novice to stocks or an experienced trader this integration is the easiest way to import and monitor stock data in a spreadsheet by the way google finance s sheets integration is only available in english and doesn t include most international exchanges yet so if you want to transact on asian or european exchanges this may not be the best option for you the google finance function the function that pulls stock data is called googlefinance the syntax of the function is quite simple and uses five arguments four of which are optional the first argument is the ticker symbol these are codes that companies have when they re listed on the stock market such as goog for google or bac for bank of america you can also specify the stock exchange that your chosen stock is listed in to avoid discrepancies since bank of america is listed on the new york stock exchange you d type nyse bac to get the ticker codes and exchanges of your desired stocks you ll have to do some research you can look for them on google finance or your chosen portfolio management tool the second argument is the attribute you d like to display by default it s set to price if you leave it blank here are a few of the attributes you can pull out using the function price the price of the specific stock in real time the price of the specific stock in real time volume the current trading volume the current trading volume high the current or chosen day s high price the current or chosen day s high price low the current or chosen day s low price the current or chosen day s low price volumeavg the average trading daily trading volume the average trading daily trading volume pe the price to earnings ratio the price to earnings ratio eps the earnings per share take note that the attributes you can display vary on whether you re using current or historical data here s a full list of attributes that you can use for the argument it s important to remember that current data refreshes every 15 minutes so it s not completely real time the third argument is the start date which only applies if you re using historical data you can type today or leave it blank to display real time data the fourth argument specifies either the end date or the number of days from the start date if left blank the function will return the data from a single day the last argument is the interval which allows you to specify the frequency of the data you can set it to daily or weekly one thing to note is that google sheets processes the ticker symbol and attribute arguments as text so make sure to place quotation marks around them or you will get an error stock tracking in action for this example let s say you want to look up the current price of a stock of facebook facebook is listed on nasdaq with the ticker code fb in this case you ll type down the first argument as nasdaq fb along with price as the attribute so the formula for this would be googlefinance nasdaq fb price if you want to view the daily closing prices for a particular week such as the week of october 15 2018 you will specify that date range in the third and fourth arguments the code for that becomes googlefinance nasdaq fb price date 2018 10 15 date 2018 10 20 take note that viewing historical data expands the generated information into array data which takes up nearby cells you can also use the function to generate data for a list of stocks automatically just type out the tickers in a column then use the cells in your first argument since our ticker code is in cell c4 you d type out googlefinance c4 price below is a list of stocks with their corresponding current prices if you want to track a list of attributes you can type them out in separate cells like in the above image then you can link the second argument to the cell with the attribute s name for the price cell for nyse ibm in the example below the formula would be googlefinance c 2 b5 maximizing google sheets the best part of having your stocks on google sheets is that you can use various data manipulation tools on them for example let s say you want to use google sheets to keep track of the value of all of your financial assets such as your stocks savings accounts time deposits and more using finance the price of your stocks will update in real time so you get a full picture of your position at any given time converting currency with sheets another great function of google sheets is that it can convert currencies in real time you can do this by typing the stock ticker currency followed by the codes of the two currencies you want to convert such as usdgbp or eurjpy you can also display historical currency data by specifying a date for example if you re living in europe and you want to convert some usd into the euro you d type googlefinance currency usdeur and multiply that number with the amount of usd you re converting this has a lot of great use cases besides foreign exchange trading for example if your line of work involves getting paid in a different currency you can set up an invoice that automatically converts the payments you receive to your home currency
the pentagon wants more time to weigh its options before it complies with an order from the hawaii state government to drain the fuel out of a strategically important resupply hub at red hill department officials said this week the hawaii department of health issued an emergency order in december to drain the tanks of the world war ii era fuel depot that can hold about 250 million gallons of fuel after a 14 000 gallon fuel leak contaminated drinking water used by military and civilian families the navy initially said it would comply with the order usni news reported last month however the navy has decided to appeal the decision from state officials in order to give it more time to make evidence based and transparent decisions deputy secretary of defense kathleen hicks said in a monday statement despite these legal process requirements we hope to collaborate with the state of hawaii in a way that would allow the parties the time and space needed to reach solutions together hicks said in the statement we proposed options for how this might work in an effort to find a mutually agreeable path forward and we look forward to continuing our dialogue with the governor the attorney general and the hawaii department of health the decision to appeal the health department order has angered some local hawaiian officials as well as congressional delegates put simply the department of defense s decision to appeal the state s emergency order is a betrayal to the people of hawai i rep kai kahele d hawaii said in a statement on twitter there is no more precious resource than our water sen mazie hirono d hawaii told honolulu civil beat she will oppose any dod appeal i urge all parties to continue working together to reach our shared goals of protecting oahu s drinking water well remediation returning families to their homes and developing and implementing a plan for the future of the strategic fuel reserve for our national security hirono told the news site while the navy plans to appeal it will be submitting a work plan and schedule to the hawaiian health department that will lay out how a third party commercial firm will assess red hill s system integrity and operations in order to either operate the fuel facility or defuel it according to hicks statement the assessment s deadline is april 30 in the meantime the operations at the facility have been suspended which dates back to a november spill into the local aquifer under the tanks we know the importance of getting this right for the people of hawaii our service members and our military families hicks said in the statement we are taking this seriously and the secretary has prioritized resources from across the department to effectively and efficiently take the steps required to address this problem the department of defense takes the red hill leak very seriously pentagon press secretary john kirby said during a tuesday press conference number one priority is to make sure we re looking after the military personnel and their families as well as residents civilian residents affected by this contamination and navy s working on that very very hard kirby said but one thing is for sure we are going to have security commitments in the indo pacific long term he said and those security commitments are gonna require fuel and sustainment and so we got to think about that seriously the red hill fuel facility is one of the military s largest hardened underground fuel stores timothy walton a fellow at the hudson institute told usni news red hill provides critical war reserves stocks for the indo pacific command and globally for defense logistics agency energy walton said and it s an essential store of fuels gaps in fuel can have operational effects he said citing examples of planes not having enough fuel to get to their destination without needing to stop in oahu or ships that would normally collect fuel in red hill to distribute to other areas being unable to do so if the fuel at red hill is drained the department of defense will likely try to save it as it is an expensive commodity walton said that will be done by transferring it to pearl harbor or through the use of commercial fuel storage tanks he said back in 2018 the department of defense looked at upgrade options for red hill s tanks which would have resulted in a drop of more than a million barrel storage walton said the red hill leak has caused the dod to now face a drop of more than 5 million barrels in terms of storage capacity and so they re gonna have to figure out a creative approach to tackle this challenge he said

far gone unheeded by government mr stride said ministers needed to look very seriously at creating a new role of minister for economic crime who everybody will be able to point to as holding the rein he admitted this could be a hospital pass for whoever ends up in the position given the scale of the problem and the issues which needed to be tackled the report also recommended pulling together the bewildering number of anti fraud agencies into one institution the daily mail has been campaigning to stamp out investment fraud by including financial harm in the online safety bill which would put a duty on internet platforms to check the validity of the adverts they host pictured google hq in california and it called for reform to the rules around registering new companies to deter internet scammers rocio concha of consumer champion which said there is now an overwhelming consensus that the government must force the biggest tech companies to finally take responsibility for fraud carried out using their platforms a spokesman for uk finance said given the scale of the challenge fraud poses we fully agree with the treasury committee that other sectors including online firms need to do more to help protect the public a government spokesman said ministers were taking firm and coordinated action to crack down on economic crime alex brummer make them pay and scams will vanish overnight comment by alexander brummer city editor for the daily mail the relentless campaign by britain s high street banks to make customers go paperless is having dire financial economic and social consequences together with the grasping and largely unregulated big tech companies the banks by forcing consumers and businesses online have made it much easier for fraudsters and scammers to rob them of billions of pounds a year moreover the closure of thousands of branches has denied millions of customers access to a local bank undermining the social fabric of towns and villages up and down the country it has left pensioners the infirm and small businesses without the facilities which are an essential part of local infrastructure contributed to the decline of our high streets and left many consumers dependent on already overcrowded and often dismal post offices this has led to an epidemic of what has become known as authorised push payment fraud under which scammers deceive individuals and businesses into sending online payments to bank accounts they control alex brummer of one thing we can be sure if the government did force the banks to repay its customers every penny lost to fraud they would revamp their security measures in very short order and scammers would soon be a thing of the past stock image these are emptied almost instantaneously with the ill gotten gains shipped overseas using lightly regulated cash transfer firms which bypass money laundering rules in spite of the spiralling cost of push payment fraud which reached 753billion in the first half of 2021 the banks with the exception of tsb and some of the smaller institutions remain adamant that the phenomenon which has seen many elderly customers stripped of their life savings is not their responsibility and the government has consistently refused to do anything about it the treasury select committee of mps is rightly outraged by this flat footed response and yesterday called on ministers to force the banks to refund fraud victims in full their intervention could not come at a better time as there have never been more people vulnerable to the scammers the vast expansion of online banking during the pandemic when lockdowns barred people from leaving their homes and accessing their cash gave the banks the excuse to speed up their closure programme and make big savings on property and staff costs the banks argue that the fraud warnings they issue and the security precautions they have in place such as requiring customers to confirm transactions by entering a pin number sent to their mobile phone absolve them of responsibility they also seek to avert the blame pointing out that search engines such as google and other big tech firms accept advertising or allow scammers to use their exchanges for payment without sufficient scrutiny and there is some truth in this almost all of us will at one time or another have been a victim of push payment fraud and i am no exception having been tricked out of 70 by a bogus dvla website the banks argue that until the big tech companies tighten their procedures they should not be expected to pick up the bill alone but attempts to tame the tech giants by bringing them under the umbrella of regulation and the law all too often end in stalemate the result is britain s approach to fighting online financial crime and its procedures for compensating victims are currently hopelessly unfit for purpose but of one thing we can be sure if the government did force the banks to repay its customers every penny lost to fraud they would revamp their security measures in very short order and scammers would soon be a thing of the past

it s hard to miss inflated prices and the sticker shock at the grocery store particularly the price of beef professor eric belasco who focuses on agriculture economics at montana state university has been researching the livestock industry for over a decade and calls this an unprecedented time of inflation trying to pinpoint where that inflation is coming from in the beef sector belasco said most of the inflation is for at home products not restaurant products essentially beef products go from the ranch to processing plants to the store or restaurant in between the plant and the final destination is where most of the cost lies according to belasco fuel for trucks driving through passes a shortage in labor logistics and the cost of trucking all are factors that hike up the price on the shelves during the pandemic many people elected to cook at home more cooking at home meant stores needed to have a larger stock of beef ranchers in montana also are having to pay premium prices but not for the animals for the feed worst drought i ve experienced since being here and really you look back historically so that has an impact can you find enough feed forage to keep those cows in montana belasco said one proposed way to keep montana cows in montana is by building more small meat processing plants in the state when a large plant needs to quarantine or shut down that puts a bottleneck in the producers small plants would be able to consistently move product to the shelves according to belasco

market intel afbf rising prices strong worldwide demand and more than 27 2 billion in government payments drove net farm income in the u s to 117 billion in 2021 its highest level in eight years the outlook for 2022 depends on a range of market issues including those outlined below remember though we continue to live in interesting times so any projections should be viewed with caution the pandemic continues as new variants emerge constantly redefining the crisis and shifting the shape of supply and demand and its impact on the farm economy whether the tentative reopening of the service economy continues in 2022 will depend on the course of the pandemic in response to the pandemic and its economic fallout the federal reserve bank undertook unprecedented bond buying and lending to banks to support the economy directly and to support trillions of dollars of extra government spending this massive expansion of the money supply has led as it had to to the highest rates of inflation in nearly 40 years the 1970s and 80s should remind us how destructive inflation and its eventual correction can be if it is not nipped in the bud u s agricultural trade hit new records in fiscal year 2021 whether there are new records in fiscal year 2022 will depend somewhat on market forces but more perhaps on geopolitics the end of 2021 means the end of chinese purchase commitments for u s farm products under the so called phase one agreement but benefits and impediments remain including a list of resolved structural barriers to u s china trade as well as higher tariffs whether the u s elevated agricultural trade with china continues beyond their phase one commitments remains to be seen with no biotech approvals since 2018 a rejection in 2021 and a presidential decree that bans imports of biotech corn by 2024 mexico s increasingly uncertain policy toward biotechnology is another u s export geopolitical wildcard in 2022 finally imported agricultural inputs have become much more expensive as china has limited fertilizer exports to support its agriculture sector and sanctions against belarus have practically cut off a major world source of potash closer to home the unemployment rate at 4 2 is down considerably from the april 2020 high of 14 8 but remains above pre pandemic levels a rebounding economy has resulted in an increased number of job openings but also an explosion in business applications workers changed by the covid experience are demanding and holding out for more as a result the entire economy is facing the sort of labor difficulties farmers have long endured and that s unlikely to change in 2022 no part of the transportation sector has been spared supply chain disruptions with higher rates and shipping delays often hitting farmers and ranchers particularly hard a continuing shortage of truck drivers has driven freight rates back above their pre pandemic highs rail rates for bulk farm commodities have in part been driven up by limited rail terminal capacity agricultural exports though at record levels were held back from even greater heights by a shortage of containers leading many foreign shippers to retrieve empty containers rather than allowing them to collect american loads for export imports of critical agricultural inputs were also constrained by maxed out port capacity thanks to the massive covid driven shift in u s consumer demand from experiences to stuff with much of the stuff coming from maxed out asian factories and delivered on maxed out ships through maxed out west coast ports the number of vessels waiting at anchor offshore from los angeles terminals for example was near zero daily on average before 2020 but jumped to an average of 32 in november 2021 with 53 vessels inbound as of january 27th the newly enacted bipartisan infrastructure law includes 550 billion in new investments in surface transportation port and rail modernization and universal broadband expansion which could address some of these capacity shortfalls natural disasters have been frequent and costly in recent years from drought to wildfires to tornadoes hurricanes and freezes disasters like these and the pandemic have fallen outside of the scope of traditional risk management programs which are designed to provide targeted risk support under more normal conditions and drive popular and political demand for ad hoc disaster assistance programs like the wildfire and hurricane indemnity program whip ad hoc disaster assistance payments have gone from 1 or 2 of net farm income through 2019 to 48 in 2020 and 24 forecasted in 2021 primarily linked to pandemic related programs this will force a conversation about how the 2023 farm bill can encourage good risk management without leaving farmers and ranchers at the mercy of mother nature in a post pandemic world private climate markets like carbon sequestration and ecosystem services credit markets provide new challenges and opportunities for farmers in 2022 to address climate emissions standard definitions for carbon and ecosystem service credits remain undetermined usda s climate smart agriculture and forestry partnership initiative was announced in september but it will take time to define the farming and forestry practices and outcomes that usda values and to begin supporting pilot projects that could expand opportunities for climate smart practices on working lands these decisions will provide critical context for the conservation provisions of the 2023 farm bill strong export purchases at the end of 2020 drove much of the increase in crop prices into and throughout 2021 which many farmers were able to take advantage of however drought related yield dips in many parts of the country particularly for wheat lowered some potential 2021 revenue despite weather and disaster impacts many u s farmers are aiming to plant just as much corn soybeans and wheat in 2022 compared to 2021 which was a record planting year and a record year in soybean production early analysts expectations peg corn planted acres at 91 5 million acres down about 2 compared to 2021 while soybean planted acres are estimated to reach 88 8 million acres up 1 8 from 2021 combined corn and soybean acres would reach 180 3 million acres which would be down slightly from the combined 180 6 million acres in 2021 what factors may change those early projections rising input costs high fertilizer prices increasing more than 300 in some areas and increased prices of other inputs like crop protection chemicals and land values which increased 7 in 2021 compared to 2020 are tightening what could have been above breakeven profit margins figure 5 displays the historic average cost for six common fertilizer products with the market corn price for comparison note the variation in fertilizer prices does not always parallel changes in corn prices especially in the past six months looking into 2022 grain prices are expected to begin to pull back from their highs as global supply catches up to surging demand but they are likely to remain above prices received before 2021 after hitting its highest peak in over 20 years the national dairy milking herd has dropped under 2017 and 2020 levels and with the drop comes a dampening in total and per cow milk production cold storage butter stocks are down 27 from 2020 fueled by high demand pushing class iv futures prices upward continued tightening of milk supply bodes well for overall prices though the knee jerk reaction to add cows during signals of higher prices could counteract short run supply trends red meat supplies also remain below 2020 levels by 6 low producer received cattle prices sustained by a covid induced era of higher carcass weights and high supply are expected to wane as lighter weight animals head to market though feedlot placements were up 6 in december 2021 over december 2020 this is likely a result of a last ditch option to get feeders to market given abysmal winter forage conditions and high hay prices sustained domestic and export demand for livestock and poultry products underpins a likely climb in producer received prices into 2022 in the end the net market return for commodities across the board may exceed that of 2021 but without the massive pandemic linked government payments of the last two years net farm income will likely be down in
