sohui kim wants to rewind time the wry fast talking quick thinking brooklyn based chef and owner of three restaurants the good fork insa and gage tollner has deep memories of the sights sounds and scents of a buddhist temple she visited as a child growing up in south korea and more specifically the grandmother who took her there for seven day stretches during summer vacations kim remembers feeling surly while plodding along on long foraging hikes to gather wild mountain edibles with the monks and worshippers like her halmoni the rough feel of weeds in her hands on the bamboo tatami mats back at the temple gave her no joy nor did the sight of the meju drying on the roof eaves or the taste of the funky doenjang and gochujang fermenting from the season before but she now fondly recalls the rhythmic chopping as the monks processed those foraged weeds and remembers picking the pigeon peas out of the japgok bap a hearty multigrain rice of millet black beans and red beans in brooklyn chefs jenny kwak and sohui kim carry on the legacy of south korean cuisine watch this episode brooklyn korean food it s the strongest regret in my memory kim says i often think to myself holy shit if i could be my grown up self and transport myself back there and replace that seven year old surly bored child what would i ask my grandmother and the monks about the way that koreans survive by being fastidious foraging pickling and making things with patience for years and years until the doenjang and soy sauce are just right to me that s korean food and the way i aspire to be cooking kim says she s proud to store that history in the deep emotional recesses of her brain along with her identity as an immigrant i m not second generation or 1 5 i consider myself an immigrant in that i was 10 when i came to this country a lot of my ideas tastes and perceptions of who i am as a korean are rooted in those first 10 years although it s what she s now known for kim didn t intend to cook korean food professionally in fact she didn t intend to enter the restaurant industry at all influenced by what she calls the korean american ivy league dream of her father who passed away when she was 15 she studied at bowdoin and barnard sohui kim is the brooklyn based chef behind the good fork insa and gage tollner her inspirations for these restaurants reflect the arc of her life and her relationship to her culture jon vachon i was coming into my own in my early twenties and i had to decide if i was going to chase a dead man s dream of who he wanted me to be or forge ahead and follow my own dream kim says enrolling in culinary school she learned french techniques and found the key to unlock her obsession with food beyond consumption and into culinary fascination she worked for talented michelin star winning chefs like anita lo who fused global ingredients with french techniques but after shifts the young chef found herself wandering off to 32nd street in koreatown where all she wanted to do was bury her face in a deeply comforting richly aromatic bowl of kimchi jjigae the good fork still kim thought of korean cuisine as food with which to nurture herself in her off hours not the high end dishes she was destined to cook on the line it was her husband and business partner ben schneider who encouraged her to meld her sense for technique and flavor driven cuisine her korean and french expertise and her passion for gathering people around food together in 2006 they opened the good fork in the then remote neighborhood of red hook helping usher in the new brooklyn cuisine movement by employing refined hospitality think casually hip yet totally professional servers you would see biking to work a cozy upscale environment and a borderless menu featuring everything from dumplings to handmade italian pasta in wild boar ragu the latter a recipe kim learned from italian chefs i wanted to look at each ingredient from whatever part of the world and then pay respect to it in a way that s culturally appropriate sohui kim chef we had a lot of pushback from family and friends about why we were doing american italian french and korean food on the same menu with fish and other dishes kim says we said why not they go perfectly together i wanted to look at each ingredient from whatever part of the world and then pay respect to it in a way that s culturally appropriate in the mid aughts fusion was a buzz word in new york which kim says she hated don t confuse what i do with fusion she says her skirt steak and eggs a dish visualized as wholeheartedly american is elevated by a slightly spicy kalbi marinade that clearly telegraphs its smoky sweet gochujang flavor but it isn t fusion so much as a reflection of what america truly is and always has been the dish illustrates kim s ethos of taking something affordable and abundant then elevating it with intense flavors while remaining humble the dish is kim says what she always makes as a breakfast for friends but coming from her ever versatile hands her steak is also easily convertible to dinner with a bed of kimchi fried rice and a perfectly fried egg on top with the freedom to explore flavors and experiment with recipes at her own restaurant kim thrived she played with the notion of what a dumpling is swapping out fillings and making the wrapper thinner i had a ton of fun because it was my own personal project and i just made what i wanted people were really embracing it she says in 2015 after operating the good fork for almost a decade kim had another revelation with two young children under seven years old she was cooking prolifically at home making korean classics like jeon and bibimbap twice a day after regularly hauling her children to queens koreatown to learn their ancestral dishes she realized brooklyn needed its own culturally korean restaurant and her career needed its own reckoning with her personal history it didn t surprise me that i was craving korean food constantly and wanted to share it with my little babies at the time kim says that s how insa was born a pork beef and chive dumpling dish from insa called gogi mandu jon vachon insa while motherhood s desire to pass on cultural wealth was the brilliant inspiration for insa her korean restaurant in gowanus that opened in 2015 kim was determined to experiment and pushed her menu s boundaries with fun dishes like a seafood corn dog topped with mayo and gochujang ketchup and despite her protests to her husband that she didn t love karaoke nor did all koreans contrary to stereotypes she realized the value of installing machines at the restaurant to continue the party after dinner diners booked rooms to belt out pop music and quaff housemade soju in uncorking the pressures of life in new york with its long benches convivial atmosphere and all night long vibe insa invited its reputation as the epitome of modern brooklyn cool kim was stunned at insa s instantaneous popularity since america s acceptance of korean flavors has happened so rapidly she says it wasn t so long ago that she was in college and brought kimchi to her dorm room her roommates were repulsed by the scent were like what is that smell funking up the kitchen she says i guess you can t keep that kimchi a secret forever how great tasting and amazing it is while the good fork was a chance to prove her mettle insa was a true reckoning of her soul identity and history opening an unapologetically korean restaurant helped kim examine her identity as she turned 45 i took inventory and stock of my own personal life and what it means to be korean with a lot of reflection on my personal history as a child and an immigrant the way our family struggled how food played such a strong role and what kind of glue that food provided kim says during the period of creating insa s menu kim was excited by the professional challenge of cooking and innovating upon her childhood foods she went into the kitchen and started cooking from memory when her memory failed she called her mother my mother didn t cook with recipes but i kept telling her i needed a recipe she d say just throw in a little of this kim laughs on the evolution of korean food kim says that at insa she wanted to use cooking methods to bring more history to the cuisine while innovating and defying ideas of authenticity as korean food gained mainstream popularity in the united states in the 80s and 90s she found barbecue or tteokbokki at korean american restaurants overly sweet as a political science major in college who wrote a thesis on the potential reunification of north korea and south korea she knew that scarcity due to wars meant most korean cuisine did not contain that level of sugar or sweeteners my life couldn t have been any other way than it is right now this notion of home this notion of feeding ourselves my pride in my korean food sohui kim chef instead of leaning on overly easy and cloying solutions like sugar or even 7 up a popularized korean cooking ingredient she used rice syrup or asian pears in recreating yukgaejang one of her father s favorite recipes she brunoised and seasoned raw beef with white soy and sesame oil brunoised asian pear and added deep fried capers for tartness and salt it was sacrilege for some people but it tasted great and i fully stand by that dish whenever people criticize me for using fried capers in a yukgaejang kim says when you talk about authenticity what is really authentic when kim and schneider s good friend st john frizell also a red hook resident and the owner of nearby acclaimed cocktail bar fort defiance asked the couple to consult on a cocktail bar concept they were happy to help kim would assist with a food menu and schneider would help frizell design and build his new concept entitled sunken harbor club schneider went with him to look at a few small potential spaces in frizell s target area of downtown brooklyn but they didn t like any of the spaces they saw out of desperation their real estate agent showed them the landmarked gage tollner space which had been closed since february 14 2004 their jaws dropped kim says and the rest is history gage tollner that is quite literally history as kim and schneider began to examine gage tollner s illustrious history from its landmarked status as a beautiful example of victorian design to its culinary fame as the spot where chef edna lewis led the kitchen in the late 80s they found themselves intrigued ideas started bubbling up between the pair who reveled in historical spaces the trio signed a lease and began a deep dive into the archival gage tollner menus dating back 125 years the challenge of bringing back an old oyster and chop house from the dead and into the 21st century was really enticing to me kim says schneider decided to oversee infrastructure design and renovation as well as building out frizell s sunken harbor club cocktail bar upstairs kim dedicated herself to the opening team of creatives as well as the menu and vision but as fate would have it their opening date was march 15 2020 the day before gage tollner was set to open it was forced to close due to covid with over 50 000 of food in the walk in for over a year they clung to their opening crew managing to keep all their team members in tow for their reopening on april 15 2021 the restaurant has found a fine balance between old and new brooklyn paying respect to the ingredients and tradition of its historical food the restaurant serves classic recipes like clams on the half shell parker rolls crab cakes and sirloin and ribeye steaks it also adds some of kim s signature korean style to the menu including her clams kimsino in bacon kimchi butter and the kale and kimchi slaw that accompanies fried chicken when asked about how she wrangled yet another new menu kim is modest i cook the food i want to eat she says i just want them to say she has really good sohn mat ojingeo twigim is a fried squid salad with sweet spicy chili dressing and peanuts served at insa jon vachon the korean word means hand taste and can be compared to a gardening green thumb the term connotes the ability to massage ingredients with a magic touch producing soulful food from one s hands according to conventional wisdom some people have sohn mat and others don t the monks at kim s grandmother s temple had it teaching worshippers to patiently cultivate fermenting doenjang kim s mother had it and kim hopes she has it too my life couldn t have been any other way than it is right now this notion of home this notion of feeding ourselves my pride in my korean food the celebrated chef says kim says she s proud to be amongst celebrated colleagues as korean cuisine has soared in america becoming a mainstay with the evolution of korean food in terms of all these other amazing chefs who are korean and korean american there is so much of what we all bring to the table as she builds her small empire it s hard not to wonder if kim will expand beyond brooklyn but for now she feels hyper locally rooted in brooklyn which she calls the smallest big city ever of 10 million people although the bronx is her hometown brooklyn is her home i always said the good fork can t exist anywhere outside of red hook brooklyn insa can t exist anywhere except in gowanus and gage tollner has been in downtown brooklyn for over 120 years she affirms exuberantly our community our family is not just myself and my husband and our two kids it s our extended restaurant families the cooks porters and servers who work at all three of our places as our family keeps getting bigger and bigger i love it

a major data leak linked to thousands of accounts from one of the world s biggest private banks credit suisse allegedly exposed the hidden wealth of clients involved in drug trafficking money laundering corruption and other serious crimes credit suisse released a statement on 20 february in which it strongly rejects the allegations and insinuations about the bank s purported business practices photo epa efe ennio leanza often the role of international banks in what south africans would call state capture slides under the radar because banking transactions tend to take place by mutual agreement in secret so it s a rare treat to see the role of a bank exposed so thoroughly even if the events are now seriously dated but the question is are they really that dated did the events of 2008 set zimbabwe on a path that has proved hard to change much in the way that bad habits tend to become common practice or as the bank suggests should it all be consigned to history the more you compare zimbabwe circa 2008 to zimbabwe circa 2022 the more the changes in leadership and approach that have taken place in the interim seem cosmetic and in that case credit suisse is at least partly responsible for much more than a single stolen election 12 years ago it s responsible for a pattern of rule that has impoverished a nation for more than a decade much of what happened in zimbabwe in 2008 is now common knowledge thanks to wikileaks publication in 2010 of us diplomatic cables which revealed that a bogus platinum deal took place that year in the context of what was perhaps zimbabwe s most crucial modern election this was the election in which then opposition leader morgan tsvangirai surprised everyone by winning the highest proportion of votes in the presidential election forcing a second round run off in which only he and former president robert mugabe would participate mugabe and zanu pf were obviously desperate at this point and concocted a dubious deal to sell platinum rights to fund the party literally days before the main election was held on 29 march 2008 zanu pf forced anglo american to give up part of its rights to the unki prospect these were handed over to a company called todal mining a company called camec listed on london s aim market then bought part of todal camec s major investor was wealthy mining magnate billy rautenbach an investor of ill repute as the cable describes him who was central to the negotiations that followed a set of transactions then took place also involving now collapsed hedge fund och ziff capital management when the dust settled rautenbach had sold his stake for reputedly 5 million and camec had handed over 100 million to mugabe s government the entire process took three weeks that funding allowed zanu pf to launch operation makavhoterapapi where did you put your vote in which about 100 people were killed and hundreds more attacked the campaign was typical of zanu pf s tactics part bribe part threat lots of intimidation with bits of violence thrown in tsvangirai was outraged by this turn of events and in an unsuccessful attempt to draw international attention to the crisis withdrew from the second round which mugabe then won what the organised crime and corruption reporting project occrp reported this week fills in some of the details of how these deals were banked and it s a real eyeful according to the occrp credit suisse did just about everything a bank can do to make a deal happen it lent 60 million to camec it actually invested in camec itself and it somehow contrived to get its analysts to pump the company in broker notes and press briefings in one report the credit suisse analyst described camec as a new major in the making and a possible rival to mining behemoth xstrata three days after the platinum deal closed and as zimbabwe descended into violence a credit suisse research paper lauded camec as one of its african 20 stock picks this is despite the fact that camec had never actually mined platinum before it was essentially a drc based copper and cobalt miner and anyway as the occrp report points out no mine was ever built the part of the unki prospect that anglo retained is now an impressive mine but the portion of the mining rights sold to camec is veld as far as rautenbach is concerned he was clearly a big client of credit suisse the accounts which were leaked to occrp show rautenbach had circa 2008 about 20 million and potentially as much as 38 million in the accounts occrp said it could not assess whether these funds were tied directly to the platinum deal but you know timing the accounts were finally closed in april 2009 after uk authorities froze rautenbach s holdings in camec the article quotes zimbabwean politician roy bennett saying on local radio in 2012 that money totally brought about all the heartache pain gerrymandering violence intimidation repression that took place at the 2008 election is directly linked to that 100 million occrp says there is no evidence that credit suisse knew about the planned corruption involved in the deal and the bank has put out the usual blah blah about how it is deeply aware of its responsibility to clients and the financial system as a whole to ensure that the highest standards of conduct are upheld clearly the conduct wasn t always the highest this is the bank that paid a 475 million fine in 2018 to settle the mozambican tuna bond scandal following the now notorious 2 billion loan of which about 500 million was at one stage reported missing it s also the bank that spied on one of its senior executives iqbal khan which led to the resignation of its chief executive tidjane thiam this is all very sad but what does it mean today the short answer is more than you might imagine there is supposedly an election taking place in zimbabwe next year and shock horror rautenbach is still an integral part of the funding process the business is different it has to do with the fuel industry but the methodology is identical recent confidential reports on the situation in zimbabwe suggest rautenbach who has an ethanol company called green fuel is alleged to be paying the salaries of zanu pf members ethanol is a touchy subject in zimbabwe at the moment due to a rule that all petrol must be 20 diluted with ethanol this diluted petrol called e20 is in fact more expensive than it would be if it was undiluted particularly after a hefty increase in 2020 the allegation is obvious the increase was designed to allow zanu pf to fund its members via an effective tax on the population routed as usual through a corporate structure designed by rautenbach the fact is that zimbabwe has changed little from 2008 and those in charge still have no idea how to run a clean government this administration continues to decimate the population in order to squeeze what little cash remains which is then subsumed by the party and its apparatchiks this pattern of rule a kind of kleptocracy via oligarchs is now thoroughly ingrained in zimbabwe s political culture and is spreading through the region south africans think they have seen how state capture works clearly they ain t seen nothing yet bm dm at 6 30pm on wednesday 23 february 2022 business maverick s tim cohen and ray mahlaka together with the ceo of pan african investment research services dr iraj abedian will

went from this intense athlete to gaining 40 pounds and crawling around my room crying when i had to put clothes on i was so tired the doctors told me i just had to accept my new normal and i thought well i m not really ok with that she says michelle friedmann was a 29 year old teacher in steamboat springs when she was diagnosed with thyroid cancer the surgeries and radiation were brutal it was just too easy for me to isolate and hide away i lost a lot of confidence and self esteem and i wondered if i would ever get those back she says conor hall was sure he was going to die doctors found hodgkin s lymphoma all over his chest he was 21 huge tumors malignant and growing rapidly he says i told everyone i was going to be ok but i really felt like that was it the trio s stories from the

young adults waging war with dark intruders today more than 10 years after their diagnoses they are among thousands who count outdoor adventure and first descents as a critical tool in their recovery i remember riding that first wave in the outer banks and this incredible feeling that i can still do cool things i m still who i was my body still works even though it s taken a beating says hall his snowboard dangling from the chairlift at silverton mountain it was such a powerful thing ever since i ve wanted to help first descents in every way i mentor young people going through similar cancer experiences i speak on behalf of first descents i know it works because it worked for me look at me i m out living it out living it that s the double entendre mantra of first descents which was created by professional kayaker brad ludden in 2001 with a single camp of 15 young adults kayaking on the colorado river today first descents offers as many as 100 programs a year shepherding an overlooked demographic of cancer fighters into wild waters and mountains thousands of cancer warriors in their 20s and 30s have paddled surfed climbed and pedaled through first descents since 2001 every year the group takes over silverton mountain ski area sharing stories and raising money to support the mission to introduce the healing power of outdoor adventure to young adults earlier this month in silverton the group raised about 150 000 for weeklong adventures last fall the group raised nearly 800 000 at its 14th annual first descents ball with alumni sharing their battle scars stories of redemption and friendships born on roiling rivers it doesn t take much for supporters to sign on to the first descents mission especially when survivors share how an adventure charged a dimming light in their lives supporters last week paid to ride in the silverton mountain helicopter and ski with guides they bid huge for custom artwork byartist pat milbery someone even paid 3 500 for a pack of bacon auctioneer and entrepreneur dave bacon pulled from his back pocket jason blevins the colorado sun ryan o donoghue welcomes more than 120 supporters of first descents to a fundraising takeover of silverton mountain ski area on feb 8 2022 where else can you take over both a mountain and a town says mike arzt a denver entrepreneur who created the silverton mountain fundraising event for first descents and you know everything we felt out on the mountain today is what first descents does for people who need it much more than us last year covid torpedoed our organization says first descents director ryan o donoghue who was forced to cancel dozens of planned gatherings for participants whose health was already threatened so first descents started taking healthcare workers on outdoor adventures we were just checking in on our friends in the healthcare community and seeing how they were doing and obviously they were overworked and stressed and experiencing a lot of the same things our community faces so we thought if we could be of service during this strange times it was a our duty to do so says o donoghue who piloted a shift in 2018 that opened programs to young adults battling other life threatening illnesses beyond cancer first descents also last year launched one of the world s first cause corporations the group sstoke brokers tip use quotes when googling unless you want financial help with the stock market offers customized one of a kind adventures for individuals and groups with all profits supporting first descents it s so cool when people recognize and celebrate the healing power of adventure says o donoghue we see it so often everyone who gets involved in supporting first descents they end up getting out more than they put in healing with adventure collins had never kayaked when she went to hood river oregon with first descents in 2017 she had grown up playing outside but her fondest memories of that week aren t her own experiences but watching other cancer survivors enjoy first ever outdoor adventures first descents puts you out there in nature and really challenges you says collins who regularly guides kids with cancer on climbing skiing and biking trips so many participants have never done this stuff they are outside in unpredictable elements and things they can t really control and they are uncomfortable and challenged and doing something for the first time it kind of mirrors their cancer journey you know we get into these situations where we feel fear and out of control and those are the same things you feel when you get diagnosed but you face that fear and you get through it that is so empowering says friedmann an accomplished skier who regained lost confidence and found friends for life during her stand up paddling trip on the colorado river a decade ago overcoming physical challenges helps you overcome mental challenges says friedmann who works with collins bringing kids with cancer on skiing climbing and mountain biking trips when you can get outside and overcome something and go beyond your boundaries and open up and kind of push yourself it will really help with other aspects in your life every participant in first descents gets a nickname it helps to shed identities tied to a disease and allows participants to maybe more quickly open up collins goes by dahl it has something to do with a lentil wrap she was eating when she first joined her paddling team in oregon friedmann is leadfoot i have a lot of tickets she says ian fohrman special to the colorado sun conor hall at silverton mountain ski area on feb 9 2022 hall goes by prez because he s a leader a former advisor to gov john hickenlooper and recent head of conservation policy for the trust for public land hall soon will take over as executive director of the colorado outdoor recreation industry office hall says his last decade working with first descents is really some of the most rewarding work i have ever done his story he says helps other young men open up about the isolation and emotional impacts that come with a cancer diagnosis we need to talk about that and build connections with other people who are going through cancer he says embracing his fellow first descents alumni atop a windswept ridge at silverton mountain that s what gets us through being able to connect and understand and share

useful to investors as key supplemental measures of its performance ffo noi affo ebitdare and adjusted ebitdare these non gaap financial measures should be considered along with but not as alternatives to net income or loss as a measure of the company s operating performance ffo noi affo ebitdare and adjusted ebitdare as calculated by the company may not be comparable to other companies that do not define such terms exactly as the company ffo the company calculates ffo in accordance with the standards established by the national association of real estate investment trusts or nareit nareit defines ffo as net income loss calculated in accordance with gaap excluding gains or losses from sales of depreciable operating property plus real estate related depreciation depletion and amortization excluding amortization of deferred financing costs and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures management presents ffo as a supplemental performance measure because it believes that ffo is beneficial to investors as a starting point in measuring the company s operational performance specifically in excluding real estate related depreciation and amortization and gains and losses from sales of depreciable operating properties which do not relate to or are not indicative of operating performance ffo provides a performance measure that when compared year over year captures trends in occupancy rates rental rates and operating costs the company also believes that as a widely recognized measure of the performance of reits ffo will be used by investors as a basis to compare the company s operating performance with that of other reits however other equity reits may not calculate ffo in accordance with the nareit definition as the company does and accordingly the company s ffo may not be comparable to such other reits ffo affo the company calculates affo by adjusting ffo to exclude the income and expenses that the company believes are not reflective of the sustainability of the company s ongoing operating performance including but not limited to real estate related acquisition and due diligence costs stock based compensation deferred impact of interest rate swap terminations and distributions on the company s series a preferred units for the avoidance of doubt 5 7 million non cash redemption of series b participating preferred stock is not included in affo changes in gaap accounting and reporting rules that were put in effect after the establishment of nareit s definition of ffo in 1999 result in the inclusion of a number of items in ffo that do not correlate with the sustainability of the company s operating performance therefore in addition to ffo the company presents affo and affo per share fully diluted both of which are non gaap measures management considers affo a useful supplemental performance metric for investors as it is more indicative of the company s operational performance than ffo affo is not intended to represent cash flow or liquidity for the period and is only intended to provide an additional measure of the company s operating performance even affo however does not properly capture the timing of cash receipts especially in connection with full year rent payments under lease agreements entered into in connection with newly acquired farms management considers affo per share fully diluted to be a supplemental metric to gaap earnings per share affo per share fully diluted provides additional insight into how the company s operating performance could be allocated to potential shares outstanding at a specific point in time management believes that affo is a widely recognized measure of the operations of reits and presenting affo will enable investors to assess the company s performance in comparison to other reits however other reits may use different methodologies for calculating affo and affo per share fully diluted and accordingly the company s affo and affo per share fully diluted may not always be comparable to affo and affo per share amounts calculated by other reits affo and affo per share fully diluted should not be considered as an alternative to net income loss or earnings per share determined in accordance with gaap as an indication of financial performance or as an alternative to net income loss earnings per share determined in accordance with gaap as a measure of the company s liquidity nor are they indicative of funds available to fund the company s cash needs including its ability to make distributions ebitdare and adjusted ebitdare the company calculates earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization for real estate ebitdare in accordance with the standards established by nareit in its september 2017 white paper nareit defines ebitdare as net income calculated in accordance with gaap excluding interest expense income tax depreciation and amortization gains or losses on disposition of depreciated property including gains or losses on change of control impairment write downs of depreciated property and of investments in unconsolidated affiliates caused by a decrease in value of depreciated property in the affiliate and adjustments to reflect the entity s pro rata share of ebitdare of unconsolidated affiliates ebitdare is a key financial measure used to evaluate the company s operating performance but should not be construed as an alternative to operating income cash flows from operating activities or net income in each case as determined in accordance with gaap the company believes that ebitdare is a useful performance measure commonly reported and will be widely used by analysts and investors in the company s industry however while ebitdare is a performance measure widely used across the company s industry the company does not believe that it correctly captures the company s business operating performance because it includes non cash expenses and recurring adjustments that are necessary to better understand the company s business operating performance therefore in addition to ebitdare management uses adjusted ebitdare a non gaap measure the company calculates adjusted ebitdare by adjusting ebitdare for certain items such as stock based compensation and real estate related acquisition and due diligence costs that the company considers necessary to understand its operating performance the company believes that adjusted ebitdare provides useful supplemental information to investors regarding the company s ongoing operating performance that when considered with net income and ebitdare is beneficial to an investor s understanding of the company s operating performance however ebitdare and adjusted ebitdare have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of the company s results as reported under gaap in prior periods the company has presented ebitda and adjusted ebitda in accordance with nareit s recommendation beginning with the company s reported results for the three months ended march 31 2018 the company is reporting ebitdare and adjusted ebitdare in place of ebitda and adjusted ebitda net operating income noi the company calculates net operating income noi as total operating revenues rental income tenant reimbursements crop sales and other revenue less property operating expenses

income and losses and extraordinary items it provides a performance measure that when compared year over year reflects the revenues and expenses directly associated with owning and leasing farmland real estate providing a perspective not immediately apparent from net income however net operating income should not be viewed as an alternative measure of the company s financial performance since it does not reflect general and administrative expenses interest expense depreciation and amortization costs other income and losses source farmland partners inc

group inc and subsidiaries definition of consolidated non gaap financial measures exhibit f page 1 of 2 use of non gaap financial measures in addition to the traditional gaap financial measures we have presented adjusted pretax operating income loss adjusted diluted net operating income loss per share and adjusted net operating return on equity which are non gaap financial measures for the consolidated company among our key performance indicators to evaluate our fundamental financial performance these non gaap financial measures align with the way the company s business performance is evaluated by both management and the board of directors these measures have been established in order to increase transparency for the purposes of evaluating our operating trends and enabling more meaningful comparisons with our peers although on a consolidated basis adjusted pretax operating income loss adjusted diluted net operating income loss per share and adjusted net operating return on equity are non gaap financial measures we believe these measures aid in understanding the underlying performance of our operations our senior management including our chief executive officer radian s chief operating decision maker uses adjusted pretax operating income loss as our primary measure to evaluate the fundamental financial performance of the company s business segments and to allocate resources to the segments adjusted pretax operating income loss is defined as gaap consolidated pretax income loss excluding the effects of i net gains losses on investments and other financial instruments except for certain investments attributable to our reportable segments ii loss on extinguishment of debt iii amortization and impairment of goodwill and other acquired intangible assets and iv impairment of other long lived assets and other non operating items such as impairment of internal use software gains losses from the sale of lines of business and acquisition related income and expenses adjusted diluted net operating income loss per share is calculated by dividing i adjusted pretax operating income loss attributable to common stockholders net of taxes computed using the company s statutory tax rate by ii the sum of the weighted average number of common shares outstanding and all dilutive potential common shares outstanding adjusted net operating return on equity is calculated by dividing annualized adjusted pretax operating income loss net of taxes computed using the company s statutory tax rate by average stockholders equity based on the average of the beginning and ending balances for each period presented although adjusted pretax operating income loss excludes certain items that have occurred in the past and are expected to occur in the future the excluded items represent those that are i not viewed as part of the operating performance of our primary activities or ii not expected to result in an economic impact equal to the amount reflected in pretax income loss these adjustments along with the reasons for their treatment are described below 1 net gains losses on investments and other financial instruments the recognition of realized investment gains or losses can vary significantly across periods as the activity is highly discretionary based on the timing of individual securities sales due to such factors as market opportunities our tax and capital profile and overall market cycles unrealized gains and losses arise primarily from changes in the market value of our investments that are classified as trading or equity securities these valuation adjustments may not necessarily result in realized economic gains or losses trends in the profitability of our fundamental operating activities can be more clearly identified without the fluctuations of these realized and unrealized gains or losses and changes in fair value of other financial instruments except for certain investments attributable to our reportable segments we do not view them to be indicative of our fundamental operating activities 2 loss on extinguishment of debt gains or losses on early extinguishment of debt and losses incurred to purchase our debt prior to maturity are discretionary activities that are undertaken in order to take advantage of market opportunities to strengthen our financial and capital positions therefore we do not view these activities as part of our operating performance such transactions do not reflect expected future operations and do not provide meaningful insight regarding our current or past operating trends 3 amortization and impairment of goodwill and other acquired intangible assets amortization of acquired intangible assets represents the periodic expense required to amortize the cost of acquired intangible assets over their estimated useful lives acquired intangible assets are also periodically reviewed for potential impairment and impairment adjustments are made whenever appropriate we do not view these charges as part of the operating performance of our primary activities 4 impairment of other long lived assets and other non operating items includes activities that we do not view to be indicative of our fundamental operating activities such as i impairment of internal use software and other long lived assets ii gains losses from the sale of lines of business and iii acquisition related income and expenses radian group inc and subsidiaries definition of consolidated non gaap financial measures exhibit f page 2 of 2 in addition to the above non gaap measures for the consolidated company we also have presented as supplemental information non gaap measures for our homegenius segment of adjusted pretax operating income loss before allocated corporate operating expenses and adjusted gross profit adjusted pretax operating income loss before allocated corporate operating expenses is calculated as adjusted pretax operating income loss as described above which is the segment s asc 280 gaap measure of operating performance adjusted to remove the impact of corporate allocations of other operating expenses for the homegenius segment adjusted gross profit is further adjusted to remove other operating expenses in addition homegenius adjusted pretax operating margin before allocated corporate operating expenses and adjusted gross profit margin are calculated by dividing homegenius adjusted pretax operating margin before allocated corporate operating expenses and adjusted gross profit respectively by gaap total revenue for the homegenius segment for the homegenius segment adjusted pretax operating income loss before allocated corporate operating expenses adjusted gross profit and the related profit margins are used to facilitate comparisons

brussels ap responding swiftly to russian president vladimir putin s order sending troops to separatist regions of ukraine world leaders hit back with non military actions tuesday in hopes of averting a full blown war in europe thanks to our sponsors view all sponsors germany made the first big move taking steps to halt certification of the nord stream 2 gas pipeline from russia a massive lucrative deal long sought by moscow but criticized by the u s for increasing europe s reliance on russian energy supplies and in washington u s president joe biden announced financial sanctions as punishment for what he called the beginning of a russian invasion of ukraine the sanctions will hit russian financial institutions and oligarchs he said the u s would impose full blocking on two large russian financial institutions and comprehensive sanctions on russian debt that means we ve cut off russia s government from western finance biden said it can no longer raise money from the west and cannot trade in its new debt on our markets or european markets either biden promised that more sanctions would be coming if putin proceeds further the european union announced sanctions taking aim at the 351 duma legislators who voted in favor of recognizing separatist regions in ukraine as well as 27 other russian officials and institutions from the defense and banking world they also sought to limit moscow s access to eu capital and financial markets this package of sanctions will hurt russia and it will hurt a lot eu foreign policy chief josep borrell said after chairing a meeting of eu foreign ministers in paris we will make it as difficult as possible for the kremlin to pursue its aggressive policies said eu commission president ursula von der leyen outside the eu british prime minister boris johnson named five russian banks and three wealthy individuals whom the uk hit with sanctions on tuesday and if putin pushes further into ukraine nato chief jens stoltenberg insisted there will be even stronger sanctions even a higher price to pay western leaders said putin s moves in ukraine violated countless international agreements and since diplomacy had failed it was time for action western powers have long made clear the fate of ukraine wasn t worth a direct military confrontation with russia and the potential of a world war so sanctions were the limited option no lows too low no lies too blatant no red lines too red to cross lithuanian prime minister ingrida simonyte said in summing up the political disgust for putin s actions felt by nations from europe to north america and the democracies hugging russia s borders in asia such as japan and south korea however putin continued to knock the world off kilter with a strategy in which confusion about the true extent of an invasion worked to his advantage russia said it was sending what it called peacekeepers into eastern ukraine but eu foreign policy chief borrell stressed they were troops on sovereign ukrainian territory i wouldn t say that s a fully fledged invasion but russian troops are on ukrainian soil borrell said british defense secretary ben wallace didn t mince words russia has already invaded ukraine they did it in 2014 occupied illegally crimea and donbas this is a further invasion of their sovereign territory wallace said whatever the description the latest developments were enough to push the 27 nation bloc into a mode of high alert and the eu s foreign ministers stressed the sanctions announced tuesday were done in close consultation with the united states and other western allies they stopped short of the massive package threatened by the eu and washington for a full military invasion into national territory that kyiv still controls the way we respond will define us for the generations to come simonyte said too much too soon though could hurt the international response said britain s johnson this the first tranche the first barrage of what we are prepared to do and we hold further sanctions at readiness to be deployed he told british lawmakers this is a first step agreed french foreign minister jean yves le drian we have more ammunition biden s announcement appeared to hold in reserve some of the broadest and toughest of the penalties considered by the united states those include an export ban that would deny russia u s high technology for its industries and military and more sweeping financial bans that could cripple russia s ability to do business with the rest of the world we still believe that russia is poised to go much further in launching a massive military attack against ukraine biden said the two major russian banks targeted by the u s sanctions are vnesheconombank veb and promsvyazbank public joint stock company psb veb is crucial to russia s ability to raise funds and psb is critical to russia s defense sector among the oligarchs and others close to putin cited for sanctions are denis bortnikov a deputy president of russian state owned vtb bank and petr fradkov chairman and ceo of psb the vtb official s father aleksandr bortnikov director of the federal security service and a permanent member of the security council of the

a woman and a boy react tuesday next to the body of ukrainian army captain anton sydorov 35 who was killed in eastern ukraine during his funeral in kyiv ukraine western leaders said tuesday that russian troops have moved into rebel held areas in eastern ukraine after president vladimir putin s recognized their independence but some indicated it was not yet the long feared full fledged invasion as confusion reigned in the region associated press moscow the east west faceoff over ukraine escalated dramatically tuesday with russian lawmakers authorizing president vladimir putin to use military force outside his country and u s president joe biden and european leaders responding by slapping sanctions on russian oligarchs and banks both leaders signaled that an even bigger confrontation could lie ahead putin has yet to unleash the force of the 150 000 troops massed on three sides of ukraine while biden held back on the toughest sanctions that could cause economic turmoil for russia but said they would go ahead if there is further aggression the measures accompanied by the repositioning of additional u s troops to the baltic nations on nato s eastern flank bordering russia came as russian forces rolled into rebel held areas in eastern ukraine after putin said he was recognizing the independence of the separatist region in defiance of u s and european demands speaking at the white house biden said the kremlin had flagrantly violated international law in what he called the beginning of a russian invasion of ukraine he warned of more sanctions if putin went further we are united in our support of ukraine biden said we are united in our opposition to russian aggression when it comes to russian claims of a justification or pretext for an invasion biden said none of us should be fooled none of us will be fooled there is no justification hopes for a diplomatic resolution to the threat of invasion which u s officials have for weeks portrayed as all but inevitable appeared to evaporate u s secretary of state antony blinken canceled plans for a thursday meeting in geneva with his russian counterpart saying it would not be productive and that russia s actions indicated moscow was not serious about a peaceful path to resolving the crisis western nations sought to present a united front with more than two dozen european union members unanimously agreeing to levy their own initial set of sanctions against russian officials germany also said it was halting the process of certifying the nord stream 2 gas pipeline from russia a lucrative deal long sought by moscow but criticized by the u s for increasing europe s reliance on russian energy the u s meanwhile moved to cut off russia s government from western finance sanctioning two of its banks and blocking it from trading in its debt on american and european markets the administration s actions hit civilian leaders in russia s leadership hierarchy and two russian banks considered especially close to the kremlin and russia s military with more than 80 billion in assets that includes freezing all of those bank s assets under u s jurisdictions biden though did hold back some of the broadest and toughest of the financial penalties contemplated by the u s including sanctions that would reinforce the hold that germany put on any startup of the nord stream 2 pipeline an export ban that would deny russia u s high tech for its industries and military and sweeping bans that could cripple russia s ability to do business with the rest of the world biden said he was moving additional u s troops to the baltics though he described the actions as purely defensive asserting we have no intention of fighting russia the u s is sending about 800 infantry troops and 40 attack aircraft to the baltics and nato s eastern flank from other locations within europe according to a senior defense official in addition a contingent of f 35 strike

outside the country effectively formalizing a russian military deployment to the rebel regions where an eight year conflict has killed nearly 14 000 people shortly afterward putin laid out three conditions to end the crisis that has threatened to plunge europe back into war raising the specter of massive casualties energy shortages across the continent and global economic chaos putin said the crisis could be resolved if kyiv recognizes russia s sovereignty over crimea the black sea peninsula that moscow annexed from ukraine in 2014 renounces its bid to join nato and partially demilitarizes the west has decried the annexation of crimea as a violation of international law and has previously flatly rejected permanently barring ukraine from nato asked whether he has sent any russian troops into ukraine and how far they could go putin responded i haven t said that the troops will go there right now he added that it s impossible to forecast a specific pattern of action it will depend on a concrete situation as it takes shape on the ground the eu announced initial sanctions aimed at the 351 russian lawmakers who voted for recognizing separatist regions in ukraine as well as 27 other russian officials and institutions from the defense and banking sectors they also sought to limit moscow s access to eu capital and financial markets with tensions rising and a broader conflict looking more likely the white house began referring to the russian deployments in the region known as the donbas as an invasion after initially hesitating to use the term a red line that biden had said would result in severe sanctions we think this is yes the beginning of an invasion russia s latest invasion into ukraine said jon finer principal deputy national security adviser said on cnn an invasion is an invasion and that is what is underway the white house announced limited sanctions targeting the rebel region monday evening soon after putin said he was sending troops to eastern ukraine a senior biden administration official who briefed reporters about the sanctions targeting the breakaway region noted that russia has occupied these regions since 2014 and that russian troops moving into donbas would not itself be a new step western leaders have long warned moscow would look for cover to invade and just such a pretext appeared to come monday when putin recognized as independent two separatist regions in eastern ukraine where government troops have fought russia backed rebels the kremlin then raised the stakes further by saying that recognition extends even to the large parts now held by ukrainian forces putin said russia has recognized the rebel regions independence in the borders that existed when they made their declaration in 2014 broad territories that extend far beyond the areas now under separatist control and that include the major azov sea port of mariupol he added however that the rebels should eventually negotiate with ukraine condemnation

russia decides once again to use force against ukraine there will be even stronger sanctions even a higher price to pay he said british prime minister boris johnson said the u k would slap sanctions on five russian banks and three wealthy individuals he warned a full scale offensive would bring further powerful sanctions zelenskyy said he was calling up some of the country s military reservists

nearly 24 hours after russian president vladimir putin invaded ukraine under the guise of recognizing the autonomy of parts of the donbas region us president joe biden finally mustered a response showing up almost two hours late for what was supposed to be an incredibly urgent address they even moved the start time up only for him to miss his mark by a mile the president stumbled and slurred his way through his remarks outlining a series of incredibly weak sanctions and previewing more pain in the wallet for the average american advertisement biden wasn t done for the day though he immediately entered a meeting about green energy initiatives attended by california gov gavin newsom among others as an aside what genius in the administration thought it was a good idea to go ahead with such an event during a time like this regardless some of the worst optics i ve ever seen for a president unfolded with an international crisis still playing out in real time biden decided now was a good time to laugh about russia s invasion hawk green energy voodoo and mock reporters who were asking him questions the lack of self control was astonishing biden jokes about russia invading ukraine we don t have much going on other than russia and ukraine pic twitter com a4s3i0ekho rnc research rncresearch february 22 2022 joe biden your economy in california is bigger than about the size of russia s for real no yeah gavin newsom twice the size biden twice yeah i know pic twitter com uspgpzsh3x rnc research rncresearch february 22 2022 russia is invading europe as i type this and joe biden thinks he s got putin right where he wants him by joking about the size of his economy it d be one thing if russia had not just thoroughly outmaneuvered the united states and nato on the world stage but given that s what has occurred these shots come across as desperate and pathetic advertisement they also show a profound lack of understanding regarding putin s motivations he does not care whether russia s economy is smaller than california s what he cares about is expanding his influence and keeping his domestic affairs in line the foreign policy establishment s insistence on looking at everything through a westernized purely economic frame is part of why putin has been able to take advantage to such an extent over the last decade when you fundamentally underestimate and misunderstand your enemy you open the door to get punched in the mouth and biden is in no condition to bob and weave past that the president once again forgot who one of his cabinet members is calling energy secretary jennifer granholm governor then senator and then saying she was my governor for the record granholm was the governor of michigan she was never biden s governor but these kinds of mental breakdowns are expected at this point that s why i ve asked the secretary of energy governor granholm senator granholm senator secretary granholm but you re my governor former governor pic twitter com mjjb0r76fc rnc research rncresearch february 22 2022 advertisement things got even weirder at the end of the roundtable though biden gets asked an obvious question about putin and instead of answering it the president starts smirking and picking at his teeth while staring blankly for over 20 seconds it was an incredibly odd scene reporter do you think you may have underestimated putin biden stares blankly picks at his teeth pic twitter com trvewzbwfc rnc research rncresearch february 22 2022 who gave this guy edibles before he went on stage but jokes aside i don t actually think biden was blanking out mentally in that clip instead he appeared to be purposely mocking the reporters in the room think about how bad that looks the president decided to behave this way on a day in which he essentially acknowledged putin had completely pantsed him i m not pointing that out because i m offended by biden mocking reporters i m pointing it out because it s incredible how bad he is at his job this is the time to be stoic and at least pretend to care about the situation at hand not just because of what it means for europe but because of what it means for americans the stock market collapsed today wiping out almost a year s worth of gains for retirements and investments gas prices are continuing to skyrocket and home energy prices aren t far behind these are huge real world issues that are slamming the middle class and biden is laughing it up while conducting some ridiculous green energy summit that completely ignores those concerns does this man not have advisors or does he just not listen to them
raf casert aamer madhani and zeke miller the associated press brussels ap responding swiftly to russian president vladimir putin s order sending troops to separatist regions of ukraine world leaders hit back with non military actions tuesday in hopes of averting a full blown war in europe germany made the first big move taking steps to halt certification of the nord stream 2 gas pipeline from russia a massive lucrative deal long sought by moscow but criticized by the u s for increasing europe s reliance on russian energy supplies and in washington u s president joe biden announced financial sanctions on banks and oligarchs as punishment for what he called the beginning of a russian invasion of ukraine he said the u s would impose full blocking on two large russian financial institutions and comprehensive sanctions on russian debt that means we ve cut off russia s government from western finance biden said it can no longer raise money from the west and cannot trade in its new debt on our markets or european markets either biden promised that more sanctions would be coming if putin proceeds further the european union announced sanctions taking aim at the 351 duma legislators who voted in favor of recognizing separatist regions in ukraine as well as 27 other russian officials and institutions from the defense and banking world they also sought to limit moscow s access to eu capital and financial markets this package of sanctions â will hurt russia and it will hurt a lot eu foreign policy chief josep borrell said after chairing a meeting of eu foreign ministers in paris we will make it as difficult as possible for the kremlin to pursue its aggressive policies said eu commission president ursula von der leyen outside the eu british prime minister boris johnson named five russian banks and three wealthy individuals whom the uk hit with sanctions on tuesday and if putin pushes further into ukraine nato chief jens stoltenberg insisted there will be even stronger sanctions even a higher price to pay the u s and other western nations have pressed daily for diplomatic efforts to head off a dangerous military confrontation but the failure of that effort was underscored tuesday as secretary of state antony blinken canceled plans for a thursday meeting in geneva with his russian counterpart saying russia s actions showed there was no point western powers have long made clear the fate of ukraine must not lead to a direct military confrontation with russia and the potential of a world war so sanctions were the limited option no lows too low no lies too blatant no red lines too red to cross lithuanian prime minister ingrida simonyte said in summing up the political disgust for putin s actions felt by nations from europe to north america and the democracies hugging russia s borders in asia such as japan and south korea however putin continued to knock the world off kilter with a strategy that has led to confusion about his plans and possible actions russia said it was sending what it called peacekeepers into eastern ukraine but eu foreign policy chief borrell stressed they were troops on sovereign ukrainian territory i wouldn t say that s a fully fledged invasion but russian troops are on ukrainian soil borrell said british defense secretary ben wallace didn t mince words russia has already invaded ukraine they did it in 2014 occupied illegally crimea and donbas this is a further invasion of their sovereign territory wallace said whatever the description the latest developments were enough to push the 27 nation bloc into a mode of high alert and the eu s foreign ministers stressed the sanctions announced tuesday were done in close consultation with the united states and other western allies they stopped short of the massive package threatened by the eu and washington for a full military invasion into national territory that kyiv still controls the way we respond will define us for the generations to come simonyte said too much too soon though could hurt the international response said britain s johnson this the first tranche the first barrage of what we are prepared to do and we hold further sanctions at readiness to be deployed he told british lawmakers this is a first step agreed french foreign minister jean yves le drian we have more ammunition biden s announcement appeared to hold in reserve some of the broadest and toughest of the penalties considered by the united states those include an export ban that would deny russia u s high technology for its industries and military and more sweeping financial bans that could cripple russia s ability to do business with the rest of the world still u s secretary of state blinken said the sanctions announced are in line with start high stay high approach white house deputy national security adviser daleep singh added that the initial sanctions send the message that no russian financial institution is safe if the invasion proceeds no one should think that it s our goal to max out on sanctions singh said sanctions are not an end of themselves they serve a higher purpose and that purpose is to deter and prevent the two major russian banks targeted by the u s sanctions are vnesheconombank veb and promsvyazbank public joint stock company psb veb is crucial to russia s ability to raise funds and psb is critical to russia s defense sector the two hold more than 80 billion in assets combined and will be cut off from carrying out transactions in the u s and european banking systems ukraine foreign minister dymtro kuleba said after a meeting with blinken in washington tuesday that u s and western sanctions against russia in escalating waves can work but he urged allies to be aggressive kuleba argued that putin should not have a single moment when he feels sanctions have reached a ceiling among the oligarchs and others close to putin cited for sanctions are denis bortnikov a deputy president of russian state owned vtb bank and petr fradkov chairman and ceo of psb the vtb official s father aleksandr bortnikov director of the federal security service and a permanent member of the security council of the russian federation was also cited in the sanction lists fradkov is the son of mikhail fradkov a former russian prime minister and former director of russia s foreign intelligence service sergei kiriyenko putin s first deputy chief of staff and his son vladimir kiriyenko who is the ceo of the parent company of russia s top social media platform vkontakte were also designated hopes are dwindling that a major conflict can be averted putin s directive came hours after he recognized the two ukrainian separatist regions as independent setting up russian military support and antagonizing western leaders who regard his actions as a breach of world order putin has blamed nato for the current crisis and called the u s led alliance a threat to russia the global condemnation came amid rising skirmishes in the eastern regions of ukraine that western powers believe russia could use as a pretext for an attack on the europe leaning democracy that has defied moscow s attempts to pull it back into its orbit with an estimated 150 000 russian troops massed on three sides of ukraine the u s has warned that moscow has already decided to invade still biden and putin tentatively agreed to a possible meeting brokered by french president emmanuel macron in a last ditch effort to avoid war ap writers aamer madhani and zeke miller reported from washington ap reporters from around the world contributed
associated press woodland calif for a few frenzied weeks beekeepers from around the united states truck billions of honeybees to california to rent them to almond growers who need the insects to pollinate the state s most valuable crop but as almond trees start to bloom blanketing entire valleys in white and pink flowers so begin beehive thefts that have become so prevalent that beekeepers are now turning to gps tracking devices surveillance cameras and other anti theft technology to protect their precious colonies hive thefts have been reported elsewhere in the country most recently three hives containing about 60 000 bees taken from a grocery chain s garden in central pennsylvania they happen at a larger scale and uniquely in california this time of year because bees are most in demand during the largest pollination event in the world in the past few weeks 1 036 beehives worth hundreds of thousands of dollars were reported stolen from orchards statewide authorities said the largest heist involved 384 beehives that were taken from a field in mendocino county prompting the state beekeepers association to offer a 10 000 reward for information leading to their recovery it s hard to articulate how it feels to care for your hives all year only to have them stolen from you claire tauzer wrote on facebook to spread the word about the reward a day later an anonymous tipster led authorities to recover most of the boxes and a forklift stolen from tauzer s family business some 55 miles away at a rural property in yolo county one suspect was arrested investigators also found frames the kinds used to hold the honeycomb belonging to helio medina another beekeeper who lost 282 hives a year ago medina said the theft devastated his apiary so this year he placed gps trackers inside the boxes he also strapped cable locks around them and installed cameras nearby as the almond bloom approached and the hives became most valuable he drove around patrolling the orchards in the dark we have to do what we can to protect ourselves nobody can help us medina said thefts usually happen at night when no one is in the orchard and the bees are back in their hives the rustler is usually a beekeeper or someone familiar with the transportation of bees more often than not they steal to make money and leave the bees to die said rowdy jay freeman a butte county sheriff s detective who has been keeping track of hive thefts since 2013 a tightening supply of bees and soaring pollination fees jumping from less than 50 to rent a hive two decades ago to as much as 230 per hive this year are likely motivating beekeepers to go rogue the demand for bees has steadily risen over the last 20 years as popularity of the healthy crunchy nut turned california into the world s biggest almond producer accordingly the amount of land used to grow almonds has more than doubled to an estimated 1 3 million acres 526 000 hectares beekeepers have been keeping up with that growth by providing an ever increasing proportion of the nation s available stock of hives this year a survey of commercial beekeepers estimated it will take 90 of honeybee colonies in the u s to pollinate all the almond orchards what that means is that beekeepers are coming from as far as new york and florida and to get them to come all that way pollinator fees have to rise said brittney goodrich an agriculture economist at the university of california at davis but bee populations are notoriously unstable due to a host of problems including disease loss of habitat and insecticides the drought that gripped western states last summer also weakened colonies the lack of rain ravaged wildflowers that provide the nectar that bees turn into honey beekeepers had to artificially supplement their diet with sugar solutions and pollen substitutes and incur more costs for beekeepers the loss of a hive means the loss of income from honey production and future pollination not to mention the expense of managing the hive throughout the year they say they hardly break even for every 210 paid to rent a beehive we put close to that much into it the whole year feeding the bees because of drought we do all the health checks which is labor intensive and we pay our workers full benefits tauzer said denise qualls a pollination broker who connects beekeepers with growers suspects the thefts are happening because beekeepers can t provide the strong colonies they promised so they can get the money from the grower and then they leave the hives the grower is just as responsible when they accept them she said to help her clients track their investments qualls merged her business with tech startup bee hero to equip hive boxes with a gps enabled sensor freeman who got into beekeeping after investigating his first hive theft said he advises beekeepers to use security cameras and put their names and phone numbers on the boxes he said some beekeepers have tried tagging their boxes with smartwater csi a forensic tool used to help police trace recovered stolen property the clear liquid is visible only under uv light even through layers of paint so police can ascertain the rightful owner even when thieves try to disguise boxes to raise the crime s severity freeman worked with prosecutors in 2016 to charge a man accused of stealing 64 beehives with theft of livestock under california law theft of property worth 950 or less is classified as a misdemeanor but the theft of any agricultural product worth at least 250 is considered a felony stealing one or 10 or 100 hives would result in the same charge he said the man pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 90 days in jail and three years probation the california state beekeepers association urges beekeepers to communicate regularly with growers about where their hives are placed and encourages growers to hire reputable beekeepers who can show proof of ownership of their hives the almond industry meanwhile is trying to reduce its dependence on bees by growing self fertile almond varieties that require fewer bees for pollination and by investing in research and other initiatives aimed at improving their health the almond board of california also joined a coalition of agricultural environmental and government groups to create habitat for wild bees butterflies and other pollinators on privately owned working lands such as cattle ranches and orchards the state government is funding 15 million toward the effort calling it an investment in climate smart agriculture

pay dirt is slate s money advice column have a question send it to athena and elizabeth here it s anonymous dear pay dirt my parents did not save any money for my education and they seem to blow any money they have saved on plastic surgery and designer bags my country s education system is extremely poor and i have dreams of going abroad to escape the poverty stricken lifestyle here i have had that plan since i was 10 and i keep bugging my parents about my college funds they always told me that there was no need and that they had enough money to shell out when the time comes i m graduating in under a year and time is shrinking i realize now that the plan i ve been manifesting since such a young age is impossible the education system i have does not provide examinations like sats igcses or a levels unless paid for separately from the school fees i don t know what to do because i haven t prepared for this situation due to the constant reassurance of everything will be fine i don t even know how i m going to get into university in my country because i have never set my sights there and so i don t know what s required i m stuck between a rock and a hard place and truly i m way in over my head so disappointed and rethinking everything dear disappointed advertisement i am sorry your parents have promised you one thing and have in reality done another our parents are human and sometimes they make selfish choices without thinking of how they affect their children i think you may have to put your justified anger at them aside in order to move forward with this plan at this point you figured out a little late in the day that they truly won t help you but you still have time especially if you re willing to work for a while in between high school and college advertisement advertisement advertisement it s a little hard for me to say how you can finance your education and come to the us since i do not know where your home country is but we have a few options you can look into first you must apply and be accepted to a school that is a part of the student and exchange visitor program otherwise known as sevp the u s department of homeland security created the sevp to allow students based outside of the u s a way to ensure they are receiving a quality education from an accredited school once a student has been accepted they can then file for a student visa most

private loans and any other type of funding your country or sevp approved school may have educationusa is also an important resource with over 430 advising organizations in over 175 countries educationusa is a network provided by the us department of state that offers step by step guidance to make your dream a reality organizations in this network can also help pay for fees for tests like the ones you mentioned above good luck dear pay dirt for years i ve been looking for a house to move into as my current apartment is too small and has suffered from multiple infestations mice roaches etc in my area renting gets expensive and it probably would be cheaper or at least about the same to pay mortgage and utilities for a house i d own advertisement however with the prices of a house being what they are i ve found that when i talked to someone about pre certification they were talking about a mortgage loan that wouldn t buy a house in this area a condo might be doable but also still has some of the same issues as renting neighbors infestations and so on advertisement enter my mother years and years ago she talked about helping me get a mortgage she is retired and has a great credit score she also isn t hurting for money even retired she makes as much or more than i do we got as far as talking to a financial planner who said that it wasn t really a good idea because if my mom dies she is over 70 i would lose the home and the mortgage would revert to the bank if it isn t paid off advertisement advertisement advertisement since then we ve found that the planner was maybe not the sharpest person my mother changed planners when he retired and the new person found massive issues with her portfolios and i ve gotten to know two other people in these kinds of relationships both of those have said that they don t foresee any issues if their parents were to die but also their parents are younger than my mother is this actually something viable is there are a way to write something into a will or a trust or something to make it so i ll be able to keep whatever house comes from this is this even a good idea or should i wait to see if the market goes back down just want out of this apartment dear want out advertisement sometimes financial planners aren t the brightest bulbs in the box apologies to any financial planners reading this i definitely don t mean you so kudos for doing your research your best course of action before you move any further is to consult with a real estate attorney every state has different laws when it comes to inheriting property realistically if you are both on the deed and mortgage as cosigners you should be okay however if your mom has other children besides you or family members who would benefit should something happen to her you need to make sure you are protected with a will or trust death doesn t always bring out the best in others and the last thing you need to do is worry about what to do with a house when grieving so make sure you go to an attorney who explain how to best protect yourselves when you re ready to buy advertisement advertisement as a reminder as you are deciding what to do there is more to buying a home than a mortgage payment while it may seem cheaper to own than rent that s not always the case houses require expensive repairs or end up being money pits property taxes can rise quickly and without warning so when looking for a place to call your own remember the rest of the picture and don t put yourself in a financial bind should something happen dear pay dirt my siblings and i are about to inherit some money that our late aunt had at a well known brokerage instead of just sending us checks as we d prefer though the brokerage has told us they re going to set up accounts in each of our names with our respective amounts can they do this make us their clients without our consent this seems odd dear odd advertisement first of all i wanted to say i m sorry for the loss of your aunt it sounds like she cared about you and your siblings and wanted to set you up for financial success which is great the brokerage is doing the usual thing in setting up accounts for you and your siblings for your respective amount instead of cutting you a check by law the brokerage cannot sell trade or do anything else with your aunt s investments because she is legally deceased after proper documentation has been received which it sounds like it has been they transfer the investments to you and your siblings transferring her stocks and other assets is a lot different than liquidating which is what you and your siblings want advertisement advertisement advertisement the good news is that you don t have to keep the accounts very long think of this as a transitional step once you ve sold off your shares you can thank your aunt for the money close the accounts and be done advertisement dear pay dirt a friend of my partners recently died unexpectedly and also unexpectedly left him a house we re both in our mid twenties with no savings okay but not good credit student loan debt minimum wage jobs and a rented apartment neither of us has inherited anything worth anything before basically he wasn t prepared for this and i m no help the house is a few hours from where we live so we re definitely not going to move in but we don t know where to go from there a lawyer some kind of financial advisor probably but what kind if he sells it he d have more money than either of us thought we d ever have renting it out would give him mortgage payments and basically double his current income either way it s financially life changing advertisement i m primarily concerned with supporting him in making the best choice for himself but we re planning to get married in the next year or two so i also wonder how whatever he chooses could impact me individually or our life together how do you even start making a decision like this and what do you do after you decide we really want to get this right dear want to get this right i am so sorry for the loss of your partner s friend a house is definitely a major item to be gifted through an inheritance especially without advance notice so it s great that you and your partner are thinking it through first i would make sure you had all of the proper financial and legal documentation that is needed when owning a home in the information you provided it sounds like the property is owned free and clear but if not make sure the mortgage has been properly transferred along with the deed you ll also need to make sure that your partner has updated the house s information with the county treasurer s office so that property taxes are taken care of advertisement advertisement next encourage your partner to purchase home insurance he should also hire a home inspector to see if there are any issues with the foundation roofing and any plumbing houses require upkeep and catching costly issues now will determine what he may choose to do with the property if the property needs substantial repairs he may choose to not take them on and sell as is if the property is in good shape he may have more incentive to become a landlord since the cash flow would cover his own living expenses as for what may or may not impact you you ll need to see an attorney on that one laws vary from state to state so

vladimir isachenkov yuras karmanau aamer madhani and eric tucker the associated press moscow ap the east west faceoff over ukraine escalated dramatically tuesday with russian lawmakers authorizing president vladimir putin to use military force outside his country and u s president joe biden and european leaders responding by slapping sanctions on russian oligarchs and banks both leaders signaled that an even bigger confrontation could lie ahead putin has yet to unleash the force of the 150 000 troops massed on three sides of ukraine while biden held back on even tougher sanctions that could cause economic turmoil for russia but said they would go ahead if there is further aggression the measures accompanied by the repositioning of additional u s troops to the baltic nations on nato s eastern flank bordering russia came as russian forces rolled into rebel held areas in eastern ukraine after putin said he was recognizing the independence of the separatist regions in defiance of u s and european demands speaking at the white house biden said the kremlin had flagrantly violated international law in what he called the beginning of a russian invasion of ukraine he warned of more sanctions if putin went further we are united in our support of ukraine biden said we are united in our opposition to russian aggression when it comes to russian claims of a justification or pretext for an invasion biden said none of us should be fooled none of us will be fooled there is no justification hopes for a diplomatic resolution to the threat of invasion which u s officials have for weeks portrayed as all but inevitable appeared to evaporate u s secretary of state antony blinken canceled plans for a thursday meeting in geneva with his russian counterpart saying it would not be productive and that russia s actions indicated moscow was not serious about a peaceful path to resolving the crisis western nations sought to present a united front with more than two dozen european union members unanimously agreeing to levy their own initial set of sanctions against russian officials germany also said it was halting the process of certifying the nord stream 2 gas pipeline from russia a lucrative deal long sought by moscow but criticized by the u s for increasing europe s reliance on russian energy the u s meanwhile moved to cut off russia s government from western finance sanctioning two of its banks and blocking it from trading in its debt on american and european markets the administration s actions hit civilian leaders in russia s leadership hierarchy and two russian banks considered especially close to the kremlin and russia s military with more than 80 billion in assets that includes freezing all of those banks assets under u s jurisdictions biden though did hold back some of the broadest and toughest of the financial penalties contemplated by the u s including sanctions that would reinforce the hold that germany put on any startup of the nord stream 2 pipeline an export ban that would deny russia u s high tech for its industries and military and sweeping bans that could cripple russia s ability to do business with the rest of the world biden said he was moving additional u s troops to the baltics though he described the deployments as purely defensive asserting we have no intention of fighting russia the u s is sending about 800 infantry troops and 40 attack aircraft to nato s eastern flank from other locations within europe according to a senior defense official in addition a contingent of f 35 strike fighters and ah 64 apache attack helicopters will also be relocated earlier tuesday members of russia s upper house the federation council voted unanimously to allow putin to use military force outside the country effectively formalizing a russian military deployment to the rebel regions where an eight year conflict has killed nearly 14 000 people shortly afterward putin laid out three conditions to end the crisis that has threatened to plunge europe back into war raising the specter of massive casualties energy shortages across the continent and global economic chaos putin said the crisis could be resolved if kyiv recognizes russia s sovereignty over crimea the black sea peninsula that moscow annexed after seizing it from ukraine in 2014 renounces its bid to join nato and partially demilitarizes the west has decried the annexation of crimea as a violation of international law and has previously flatly rejected permanently barring ukraine from nato asked whether he has sent any russian troops into ukraine and how far they could go putin responded i haven t said that the troops will go there right now he added that it s impossible to forecast a specific pattern of action it will depend on a concrete situation as it takes shape on the ground the eu announced initial sanctions aimed at the 351 russian lawmakers who voted for recognizing the two separatist regions

adviser said on cnn an invasion is an invasion and that is what is underway the white house announced limited sanctions targeting the rebel regions on monday evening soon after putin said he was sending in troops a senior biden administration official who briefed reporters about those sanctions noted that russia has occupied these regions since 2014 and that russian troops moving into donbas would not itself be a new step western leaders have long warned moscow would look for cover to invade and just such a pretext appeared to come monday when putin recognized the independence of the donetsk and luhansk separatist regions the kremlin then raised the stakes further by saying that recognition extends even to the large parts of those two regions now held by ukrainian forces including the major azov sea port of mariupol he added however that the rebels should eventually negotiate with ukraine condemnation from around the world was quick in washington lawmakers from both parties in congress vowed continued u s support for ukraine even as some pushed for swifter and even more severe sanctions on russia senators had been considering a sanctions package but held off as the white house pursued its strategy ukrainian president volodymyr zelenskyy said he would consider breaking diplomatic ties with russia and kyiv recalled its ambassador in moscow if putin pushes farther into ukraine nato chief jens stoltenberg insisted the west would move in lockstep if russia decides once again to use force against ukraine there will be even stronger sanctions even a higher price to pay he said british prime minister boris johnson said the u k would slap sanctions on five russian banks and three wealthy individuals he warned a full scale offensive would bring further powerful sanctions zelenskyy said he was calling up some of the country s military reservists but added there was no need for a full military mobilization in an address to the nation zelenskyy said his decree applied only to those assigned to the so called operational reserve which is typically activated during ongoing hostilities and covers a special period of time without clarifying what that means today there is no need for a full mobilization we need to quickly add additional staff to the ukrainian army and other military formations he said the head of the national security and defense council

said on cnn an invasion is an invasion and that is what is underway the biden administration s rhetoric hardened considerably in less than 24 hours the white house announced limited sanctions targeting the rebel region monday evening soon after putin said he was sending troops to eastern ukraine a senior biden administration official who briefed reporters about the sanctions targeting the breakaway region noted that russia has occupied these regions since 2014 and that russian troops moving into donbas would not itself be a new step the administration initially resisted calling the deployment an invasion because the white house wanted to see what russia was actually going to do after assessing russian troop movements it became clear it was a new invasion according to a u s official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations biden on tuesday said he was authorizing the redeployment of some u s troops who are already stationed in europe to bolster the security of nato s baltic allies particularly in light of russia s troop build up in belarus biden said these are totally defensive moves on our part and the u s has no intention of deploying its forces in non nato member ukraine but biden also said the u s and its allies will defend every inch of nato territory and abide by the commitments we made to nato the organization s mutual defense pact considers an attack on one member to be an attack against all for weeks western powers have been bracing as russia massed an estimated 150 000 troops on three sides of neighboring ukraine western leaders have long warned moscow would look for cover to invade and just such a pretext appeared to come monday when putin recognized as independent two separatist regions in eastern ukraine where government troops have fought russia backed rebels the kremlin then raised the stakes further tuesday by saying that recognition extends even to the large parts now held by ukrainian forces putin said russia has recognized the rebel regions independence in the borders that existed when they declared their independence in 2014 broad territories that extend far beyond the areas now under separatist control and that include the major azov sea port of mariupol he added however that the rebels should eventually negotiate with ukraine condemnation from around the world was quick ukrainian president volodymyr zelenskyy said he would consider breaking diplomatic ties with russia and kyiv recalled its ambassador in moscow but confusion over what exactly was happening in eastern ukraine threatened to hobble a western response while washington clearly called it an invasion some other allies hedged russian troops have entered in donbas eu foreign policy chief josep borrell said in paris we consider donbas part of ukraine but he added i wouldn t say that it is a fully fledged invasion but russian troops are on ukrainian soil poland s defense ministry and british health

situation vladislav brig a member of the separatist local council in donetsk told reporters the russian troops already had moved in but more senior rebel leaders didn t confirm that late monday convoys of armored vehicles were seen rolling across the separatist controlled territories it wasn t immediately clear if they were russian the white house issued an executive order to prohibit u s investment and trade in the separatist regions and additional measures likely sanctions were to be announced tuesday those sanctions are independent of what washington has prepared in the event of a russian invasion according to a senior administration official who briefed reporters on the condition of anonymity the russian moves pushed germany to suspend the certification process for nord stream 2 pipeline that was to bring natural gas from russia the pipeline was built to help germany meet its energy needs particularly as it switches off its last three nuclear power plants and phases out the use of coal and it has resisted calls by the u s and others to halt the project if putin pushes further into ukraine nato chief jens stoltenberg insisted the west would move in lockstep if russia

a sign in english posted by the justice ministry in november on its site promotes the companies law amid growing criticism that u s social media operators do not formally register themselves under the law rendering it difficult for the victims of online slander to rectify the damage asahi shimbun file photo victims of slanderous comments on social media in japan find that tangled legal procedures and foreign operators ignorance of japanese laws make it a near herculean task to track down the perpetrators trying to take their cases to court defamed individuals soon find making preparations for trial takes much time labor and money due to various hurdles for a start many operators of social networking platforms such as twitter facebook instagram and youtube are based in the united states in addition the popular video sharing site tiktok is run by bytedance in china for that reason people victimized by insulting and discriminatory messages as well as offensive images and videos through such sites need to file suits against the operators headquarters in the united states and china to seek justice required for the trials are the original and translated qualification certificates or corporate registers of the platform providers obtaining the documents in person takes time so communications records for derogatory remarks could be deleted during the process although japanese brokers have certificates in stock to enable people to quickly purchase ones their translation and other fees often total no less than 50 000 yen 432 to 60 000 yen registers copies from some lawyers are available for several thousands of yen and the mercari e commerce marketplace sells them cheaper as well still it is not convenient to have certificates in hand certificates on occasion run out of stock although procedures need to be carried forward as soon as possible leaving people with no other choice but to buy them at higher rates said an attorney in the kanto region around tokyo if alterations are made to corporate specifications such as facebook s changing its name to meta and twitter s ceo being replaced updated documents reflecting modifications must be submitted forcing plaintiffs to take additional steps simply securing the necessary documents does not mean everything is complete complaints must be sent via the foreign ministry to take legal action against social media operators outside japan and the first trial typically starts six or more months afterward a lawyer in tokyo who sued twitter in january 2021 on behalf of a woman damaged by an insulting post said her first legal session started as late as near the end of september that year ignorance of the law satoshi fukazawa an attorney who has been engaged in many legal instances to demand the identities of slur posters be disclosed pointed out service providers ignorance of the companies law is behind the issue many individuals have just given up without doing anything because much time and money were needed or as telecommunications logs were erased said fukazawa if the operators adhered to the companies law this would never happen the companies law stipulates that overseas operators that conduct business in japan continuously should register themselves as foreign corporations in the nation and appoint local representatives responsible for all the operations in the state a problem is that when violations of the legislation are confirmed by japanese courts enterprises will face a paltry administrative fine of up to 1 million yen this does not compare with the hundreds of millions of euros imposed as punishment on the u s information technology giants including so called gafa google apple facebook and amazon for various reasons in europe as a result many foreign companies have yet to formally register themselves in japan rendering the law a dead letter according to masahiro sogabe a legal professor at kyoto university s graduate school asked about the issue through inquiries made by the asahi shimbun in 2021 the japanese subsidiaries of google bytedance and meta operator of facebook and instagram said they have not been officially included in the list of foreign corporations in japan the japanese headquarters of facebook explained that it does not do business continuously in japan the japanese office of google declined to comment while no response came from bytedance twitter s japanese subsidiary declined to comment on any details including whether our company is registered or not moves in politics government tetsuo morishita an international trade law professor at sophia university s faculty of law described the current circumstance as likely inappropriate the provision in the companies law is designed to protect trade partners service users in japan said morishita whether enterprises offer japanese patrons their services in a well organized manner is a deciding factor and social media providers are already doing a significant

yahoo finance live there are three different buckets of economic impact of what s ongoing right now between russia and ukraine the first is the direct impact of a potential russian invasion and the disruption of commerce and economic activity on the back of that invasion the second is sanctions and the third is if we do put on sanctions what the retaliatory measures might be that russia might impose on the u s and europe the conflict creates an added headwind for investors already holding their breath in anticipation of the federal reserve s next move as the central bank looks to tighten monetary conditions to mitigate surging inflationary pressures a war between russia and ukraine could exacerbate inflation and spur other economic disruptions robert schein chief investment officer of blanke schein wealth management argued while the markets have been sensitive to headline risk from russia ukraine tensions central bank policies remain the most critical concern for investors right now we believe the risk of a russian invasion of ukraine is overstated as war invasions are not typically telegraphed in advance and there is usually an element of surprise which is clearly not the case with russia ukraine schein said in a note federal reserve policy remains the market s biggest risk and investors are hoping that the fed can engineer a soft landing which would involve tightening policy just enough to calm rising inflation the market is in wait and see mode as investors brace for the federal reserve s next move he added 4 00 p m et stocks fall sharply into close following us

result of new information future events or other circumstances and with that i will now turn over the call to you aaron aaron ravenscroft president and chief executive officer thank you ion and good morning everyone please turn to slide 3 a year ago on this call i shared my concerns regarding the unintended consequences of the aggressive fiscal policies being used by governments around the world to accelerate the covid recovery which we expected to create inflation and lead to a choppy recovery clearly in retrospect the economic dislocations created by our return to normal were far greater than anyone anticipated that being said 2021 was a year of transition for manitowoc on multiple fronts while we bounced back operationally from the covid shutdowns we also made significant changes in our strategic orientation as we laid out a year ago we continued to build out our tower crane business and the regions launching two locally designed cranes we accelerated our all terrain new product development which will bear fruit at the upcoming bauma trade show this october we invested 15 million in our tower crane rental fleet in europe which helped us increase our market share in germany and win some strategic orders with key accounts and finally we completed two acquisitions in north america which lays the groundwork for us to grow our aftermarket presence in the local mobile cranes market and currently we continue to make progress on our esg journey and more traditional safety terms the team doubled our hazard observations that we call slams and our recordable injury rate excluding acquisitions was 1 39 for the year while our rir was up slightly year over year it is still well below the industry benchmark and i am very pleased with our performance in the face of the previous year on the sustainability front we implemented a tracking system to help us account for our environmental footprint and we are utilizing the manitowoc way to drive continuous improvement for example we assembled a global team to collaborate on paint booth emission reductions and have already begun to realize benefits as for diversity we ve been leaning and hard on this initiative to help offset our labor shortages namely in shady grove we implemented our first esl program to help attract spanish speaking members of our community and we have begun to offer relocation incentives to nearby cities such as philadelphia to attract employees to our internal welding and machining schools with respect to our balance sheet we continue to position the company for long term growth after investing 40 million in capex and 186 million on two acquisitions we closed the year with 75 million of cash on hand and 250 million of liquidity considering the difficulties of managing working capital in the current environment i m comfortable with where we ended 2021 for sure the economic dislocations created by the return to normal were far greater than we anticipated a year ago and i am extremely appreciative of all hard work by our team to minimize inflation as best as we could implement price increases and manage parts shortages while executing our long term strategy a big thank you to the team specifically i would like to recognize jim glenwright and sebastian maleigh who recently won the ceo award for the manitowoc way in the midst of all of the economic chaos of 2021 manitowoc encountered a cyberattack in june jim led our effort to restore our it system all at the same time continue to implement a new erp system for mgx equipment services meanwhile across the pond sebastian earned his award for his contributions to the continuous improvement of our manufacturing processes and our tower factories he led projects to implement an automated tube cutting machine and move on while kicking off another significant machining project in our factory i m very proud of the commitment and passion of our employees at manitowoc and these two leaders truly represent the spirit of the manitowoc way finally i am pleased to announce that our changes on the factory won our annual manitowoc way lessons learned competition for 2021 the welding value stream and services support teams developed a homemade robot for welding mass rod bars through ingenuity the team built a robotic for less than 10 000 to buy the same machine when it costs 10 times as much and it would not have been specifically designed for the job at hand thank you to everyone that participated in the competition and i look forward to more innovative solutions in 2022 turning to the financials i would like to add a little color to our recent performance generally the story on demand remains consistent with the last couple of quarters every region and every product category is doing well except for the china market orders for the quarter totaled 615 million and our backlog ended the year just over 1 billion our highest level in over 10 years this was driven by continued solid activity in our end markets rebounding customer sentiment and improved dealer stocking levels looking at the p l i have to admit i was very surprised by how we ended the year inflation part shortages and logistical problems have been a serious issue for us for over six months and unfortunately they are creating a really volatile situation when it comes to predicting short term results on the back of third soft third quarter shipments during october and november periods were 75 million lower than our internal forecasts and as we entered december vessels continued to be postponed while at the same time omicron was spreading around the world much to our surprise we were fortunate in the last couple of weeks of the year and received several key parts shipments which enabled us to complete several cranes in fact we cut back over 25 million of shipments during december which was nothing short of the heroic effort by our operations team this combined with tighter cost management and payroll mix helped us deliver a healthy ebitda of 34 million in the fourth quarter finally as i indicated in our press release last night we have announced a formal cfo succession plan as dave prepares to retire dave will officially step down as the cfo on may 2nd at which time brian regan will assume the cfo role dave will however remain with manitowoc way advisory role until january 2 2023 dave has played an integral role in manitowoc s evolution since 2016 he led us through the difficult times after the foodservice business spin off he renegotiated our debt in 2019 and finally he shepherded our recent acquisitions dave it s been my pleasure working alongside of you for the last six years on behalf of the manitowoc family thank you for your contributions and dedication to the success of manitowoc we wish you the absolute best in the next phase of your life with that dave the team wanted you to end on a high note please provide color on the fourth quarter financial results dave antoniuk executive vice president and chief financial officer thanks aaron it s been an honor and a privilege to work with you over the past six years i also want to thank the global manitowoc team for their tremendous support to me over the years without their relentless efforts we would not be where we are today lastly i would like to thank the investment community and analysts with whom i have interacted over the years the many thought provoking questions and comments surely challenged my thinking for the betterment of manitowoc a big thank you to everyone now moving to our results for the quarter which ended the year on a considerable high note please move to slide 4 our fourth quarter orders totaled 650 million of the book to bill of 1 24 and an increase of 21 compared to 509 million of orders last year the increase in orders was primarily due to higher global demand orders were unfavorably impacted by approximately 13 million from changes in foreign currency exchange rates our 2021 ending backlog of 1 billion was up 86 over the prior year and is at its highest level in over 10 years the increase in backlog was across all segments and primarily due to higher global demand and lower than expected shipments in the fourth quarter due to supply chain challenges and logistic constraints backlog was unfavorably impacted by approximately 40 million from changes in foreign currency exchange rates net sales in the fourth quarter of 498 million increased 68 million or 16 from a year ago the incremental net sales from acquisitions in the quarter were 24 million slightly below the 30 million we communicated in the prior quarter net sales were unfavorably impacted by approximately 9 million from changes in foreign currency exchange rates sg a costs are up 24 million as outlined in our press release on friday february 18 we recorded approximately 14 million for a legal matter with the us environmental protection agency due to confidential negotiations with the epa we are unable to provide any further updates at this time our acquisitions increased sg a costs by 8 million in the quarter and the remainder of the increases were primarily inflation related our adjusted ebitda for the fourth quarter was 34 million flat year over year the acquisitions accounted for approximately 3 million during the quarter which was in line with our expectations as i discussed last quarter the q4 adjusted ebitda from the acquisitions was impacted by the elimination of intercompany profit and ending inventory we expect the impact of the elimination of intercompany profits to be nominal going forward and target approximately 30 million on an annual basis from the acquisitions as a percentage of sales the adjusted ebitda margin decreased to 6 9 a reduction of 100 basis points over the prior year the decrease in margin was primarily due to the price cost dynamic in the quarter income tax expenses in the quarter were 1 2 million this was primarily driven by the jurisdictional mix of earnings partially offset by a one time tax benefit our gaap diluted loss per share in the quarter was 0 10 a decline of 0 15 over the prior year on an adjusted basis diluted earnings per share increased 0 8 from the prior year to 0 27 per diluted share primarily driven by lower income tax expense in the quarter now i will recap the full year financial results orders total roughly 2 2 billion up to 655 billion dollars or 43 from the prior year foreign currency exchange rates impacted 2021 orders favorably by approximately 32 million net sales for the year totaled approximately 1 7 billion a 19 increase from 2020 and were positively impacted by 31 million due to favorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates the year over year increase was primarily due to higher global demand as 2020 was significantly impacted by the covid 19 pandemic our adjusted ebitda improved by 33 million or 40 from the prior year moreover our adjusted ebitda margins improved by 90 basis points to 6 7 our full year 2021 adjusted net income was 31 million compared to a net loss of 12 million in 2020 we generated 76 million of cash flows from operating activities in the year an increase of 111 million year over year we spent 40 million in capital expenditures which resulted in 36 million of free cash flows and an improvement of 97 million year over year and ahead of our expectations we ended the year with a cash balance of 75 million a decline of approximately 64 million year over year as a reminder we paid 186 million for the acquisitions using available cash along with borrowing 100 million from our abl credit facility our total liquidity on december 31 2021 remained strong at 254 million as most of you know our current notes are callable on or after april 1 2022 at a price of 104 5 as i mentioned at our investor day on december 13 we continue to opportunistically look at our debt as the debt markets for new sources of capital or to reduce our total cost of capital our 2022 guidance assumes that our current capital structure will remain in place for the full year please turn to slide 5 as we look ahead to 2022 we expect continuing global supply chain and logistic challenges moderation in inflationary pressure and an unstable labor market throughout the first half of the year in the second half of the year we anticipate an improved price cost dynamic and a stabilizing supply chain logistics and labor market based on this outlook our 2022 guidance is as follows net sales are approximately 2 billion to 2 2 billion with regard to sg a it is important to note that our adjusted sg a expenses for the year are expected to increase approximately 21 of which approximately 32 million is from acquisitions our adjusted ebitda guidance is approximately 130 million to 160 million depreciation and amortization of approximately 65 million interest expense is approximately 28 million to 30 million provision for income tax expense approximately 13 million to 17 million adjusted diluted earnings per share approximately 0 65 to 1 35 and capital expenditures of approximately 85 million with our recent acquisitions and growing rental fleets i think it s worth taking a moment to discuss how these initiatives will impact our capital expenditure investments as we have discussed before oftentimes a crane is rented for two years and then sold after the acquisition value has decreased as such there is always a certain level of churn in a rental fleet as we sell use machines we will replenish the rental fleet with the proceeds we expect this to be approximately 35 million in 2022 in addition we are still growing our rental fleets strategically to support rpos and market share growth and target markets such as the german tower crane market this capex investment will approximate 25 million in 2022 the remaining 25 million of capex will be for a normal factory capex please keep in mind that the management of our rental fleet and the related capex is far more dynamic than the traditional manufacturing capex it is heavily dependent upon opportunistic sales transactions in certain instances capex could be generated by an unexpected sale of a crane that is on rent which will likely need to need to be replaced in other instances capex can be generated by an rpo opportunity which can be multi crane deals with that i ll now turn the call back to aaron aaron ravenscroft president and chief executive officer thank you dave let s move to slide 6 as we begin in 2022 our strategy remains unchanged and underpinned by our four strategic initiatives we will continue to look for attractive acquisitions to help accelerate these initiatives and we will opportunistically evaluate our capital and debt structure to help ensure that we have the necessary flexibility as the us economy faces increasing interest rates adding a little more clarity and focus to our strategy i am pleased to announce our vision for aftermarket which we call cranes plus 50 our goal is to increase our aftermarket or non new machine sales by 50 over the next five years historically our business model has been highly product focus our objective is to grow beyond machines and products and to sell more aftermarket parts field service lifting solutions rpos rentals for fleet management used sales remanufactured cranes and digital solutions that provide greater customer connectivity as a jumping off point we ended 2021 with 449 million in non new machine sales which will be outlined in our 10 k filing in closing manitowoc continues to strive to get closer to our customers and to grow our less cyclical and higher margin revenue streams we continue to reposition the company for long term growth while we weather the near term economic storm we are confident that our investment in our four growth initiatives will allow us to deliver on our cranes plus 50 strategies and increase our non new machine sales by 50 over the next five years which we believe will fuel greater long term returns for our shareholders with that operator please open the lines for questions questions answers operator we ll take our first question from tami zakaria with jp morgan tami zakaria j p morgan analyst hi good morning thank you so much for taking my questions so my first aaron ravenscroft president and chief executive officer good morning tami tami zakaria j p morgan analyst good morning how are you so my first question is i think you mentioned about 75 million of shortfall in orders in october and november did you recover all of that in december or do you expect all of it to come back in the first quarter i m trying to understand like when does this shortfall sort of getting delivered and delivered and whether you re going to recoup the entirety of it is there s some lost demand there aaron ravenscroft president and chief executive officer ok so yeah there were 75 million that we missed in october and november we were making our shipments but we were able to plow back 25 million of that during december so there s a 50 million miss i think that s off the high point of our range that we gave back in december i think the better way of looking at it is it will recover those shipments in january and maybe some in february if we if they went out that far but the reality is everything continues to shift right as we continue to fight through all these shortages so i wouldn t say it s lost in demand and we ve not had any demand cancelations or cancelations anything like that it s just the business right now remains very fluid in terms of shipments because of part shortages tami zakaria j p morgan analyst understood that s helpful and then one quick follow up on the backlog can you remind us whether the backlog represents everything you expect to ship within the next 12 months and are these backlog price protected aaron ravenscroft president and chief executive officer so the backlog will the majority of the backlog is scheduled to ship in in 2022 and all the pricing is fixed in the backlog tami zakaria j p morgan analyst understood all right thank you so much operator and we ll take our next question from stanley elliott with stifel aaron ravenscroft president and chief executive officer good morning stanley stanley elliott stifel financial corp analyst good morning everyone nice way to finish up the quarter in a tough environment and in dave best of luck to you we will certainly miss having you on the call dave antoniuk executive vice president and chief financial officer thanks stanley stanley elliott stifel financial corp analyst can you talk a little bit more about the plus 50 increasing that by 50 is this all organic what level of m a or acquisitions will be needed for you to hit those targets aaron ravenscroft president and chief executive officer yeah so it ll come through a combination of the acquisitions as well as more organic and i d remind you that whenever we close the books on h e we had a lot of the we had to eliminate the intercompany transactions so that sort of sometimes outweighs what you see in terms of the organic just in terms of the mathematics of it but we definitely will rely on acquisitions to get there but even from our recent acquisitions we ve gotten good synergies and there are more opportunities one of the things i d like to just talk about on this subject is used so if you look at the business typically there s a lot of use business that s generated through trade ins in europe with all terrain cranes historically we haven t really done that proactively or i d say strategically we did it reactively in terms of what our customer wants and the order we would like to get so now that the acquisitions and owning h e and their crane business in aspen it create a real strategic opportunity where we can go chase business that we wouldn t otherwise chase back in europe so we would do a trade in europe bring the crane to the united states and sell it into the us market that s just one example of the sort of organic opportunities we have stanley elliott stifel financial corp analyst interesting could you comment a little bit about your outlook from a regional perspective you mentioned all the markets doing fairly well with the exception of china just see kind of what the puts and takes might be as we re thinking about the 22 guide aaron ravenscroft president and chief executive officer yeah i mean across the board it s pretty strong almost in all regions i m just thinking even in russia with all of the uncertainty there the business continues to remain robust so i don t really see a change europe has been in good shape for us it continues strong whether it would be towers or all terrain us still is robust asia pac i mean there s throughout asia pac as certain markets reopen again things look good but yeah i generally say just take china out of it all regions look pretty solid stanley elliott stifel financial corp analyst great guys thank you very much and best of luck operator and we ll go to our next question from jamie cook with credit suisse aaron ravenscroft president and chief executive officer good morning jamie chigusa katoku credit suisse analyst hi this is chigusa katoku on for jamie thanks for taking my questions so we were wondering so for your guided sales up 22 at the midpoint for 2022 and i was wondering if you could help us understand how much is m a versus price versus volume aaron ravenscroft president and chief executive officer yeah so i would say that when we look at the incremental impact we said that between 100 million and 120 million will be m a related on a net basis on a year over year basis and then generally speaking there is going to be price included in there because we ve raised our prices to more or less cover our increase in costs but we haven t spoken about a 1 impact on that at this time yet chigusa katoku credit suisse analyst ok thanks and then you re 2022 incremental is implied below your typical 25 range but we are wondering what you re assuming for price cost for the first half versus the second half aaron ravenscroft president and chief executive officer yeah so i mean if you look at the full year combination of where the volume set but the biggest issue really comes back to this dislocation between our pricing and our costs and as if things shift right so for instance the 50 million that moved out of the fourth quarter and into the first quarter in the first half we ve got some headwinds in terms of where our pricing sits relative to where our cost is chigusa katoku credit suisse analyst ok thank you aaron ravenscroft president and chief executive officer so that s the majority of the issue with the contribution margins it ll start to sort out as we get toward the end of the year chigusa katoku credit suisse analyst ok thanks aaron ravenscroft president and chief executive officer thank you operator and we ll go to our next question from cliff ransom with ransom research cliff ransom ransom research analyst good morning aaron ravenscroft president and chief executive officer good morning cliff cliff ransom ransom research analyst hi good morning guys all of you because i m a big fan of stanley i will just say that dave we won t miss you on the calls but we ll miss you in the office we really admire you dave antoniuk executive vice president and chief financial officer thank you very much cliff cliff ransom ransom research analyst as a quick comment before two very quick questions aaron the real test of a ceo is ensuring orderly succession and thank you for handling your first big test so well this is obviously very well organized thank you do you believe that the recouping of shipment effectiveness in the fourth quarter was an individual event or was it do you believe the of something to come aaron ravenscroft president and chief executive officer yeah i have to admit now that we re through january i d definitely say it was a one time event in december in december we had some pull back and things went our way in terms of i think everybody trying to get their shipments out at the end of the year but in january we sort of went back to where we were in october and november in terms of shortages and the logistical issues cliff ransom ransom research analyst got it and then the last question is in my mind this lean transformation that you have undertaken in manitowoc is the most important thing that manitowoc has done since it was founded can you give us one or two or three examples of stuff that you re really proud of and then maybe one or two examples of stuff that didn t work out as well as you had hoped and what you re going to do about it aaron ravenscroft president and chief executive officer yeah i mean i think one of the coolest examples we have this year is the heat exchangers we ve got in so as part of our esg program our maintenance team they re started to implement heat exchanges around our paint booth and in fact now all the men s and gals showers in the facility are heated by the water that comes after the paint booth so i thought that was a great opportunity and it started to moved be moved around the company so yeah i think there s there s plenty of those sort of i call small but they re big at a local level of ideas that keep going but i mean in terms of our mistakes we make mistakes i hope we make mistakes every single day because we re not making mistakes and we re not making progress so we still have a lot of progress to go on and we made some good gains on tpm in the last 18 months we started to really push hard on understanding the work which is a never ending journey so yeah i think there s still a lot of opportunity for us cliff ransom ransom research analyst thank you very much for that comment on mistakes i appreciate it good day aaron ravenscroft president and chief executive officer thanks cliff operator and we ll take our next question from jerry revich with goldman sachs aaron ravenscroft president and chief executive officer good morning jerry jerry revich goldman sachs analyst hi good morning everyone aaron ravenscroft president and chief executive officer good morning jerry revich goldman sachs analyst hi and dave congratulations dave antoniuk executive vice president and chief financial officer thank you very much jerry jerry revich goldman sachs analyst i wonder if we could just talk about the margin bridge in the fourth quarter really impressive margin performance sequentially in year over year and in the challenging environment can you just quantify for us dave what was the price cost in the quarter and maybe just to quantify some of the qualitative factors that you spoke about aaron in terms of getting parts etc what impact did that have sequentially on improving absorption because the results really stood out versus what we re seeing from other manufacturers thanks dave antoniuk executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah so jerry i would i d have to say that the biggest item in there is pure product mix right i mean we obviously focused on products that deliver what i say is the best returns for us and we were able to get those out the door so that was without a doubt the number one driver in that in addition to that you have to give credit to all the manufacturing facilities around the world i mean we really did well in execution in q4 and it came out much better than what we anticipated and those were probably the two main drivers that generated the biggest gains for us in q4 jerry revich goldman sachs analyst got it and obviously a strong bookings year for you folks in 21 as you look at the prospect list maybe through the first six months of 22 or however far visibility you have can you talk about which regions you expect to drive growth in the backlog for you folks over the course of this year based on the visibility we have now aaron ravenscroft president and chief executive officer yeah i think regionally it probably means pretty even across the businesses relative to their size when i look out at 2022 i mean the first thing i d say is 1q still looks good not as strong as the fourth quarter but fourth quarter typically is pretty strong for us and we had a great fourth quarter this year the other thing is that we ve been working really really hard at getting the pricing that we need to offset the inflation and so we ve definitely lost some orders here in the first quarter just being super disciplined relative to pricing but i think that the general outlook looks good the other thing i d add too is because of the pricing situation we re pretty concerned about taking orders in 2023 i mean we want to manage our backlog as closely as we can so don t get too far ahead of ourselves jerry revich goldman sachs analyst appreciate the discussion thanks aaron ravenscroft president and chief executive officer thank you dave antoniuk executive vice president and chief financial officer thank you jerry operator we ll take a follow up from cliff ransom cliff ransom ransom research analyst thanks again gentlemen one last question very important in this equation are new product development and satisfying end users can you talk a little bit about how you ve used lean thinking to enhance that process aaron ravenscroft president and chief executive officer yeah i mean we ve used it on multiple fronts one is just around the toll gate process we use for product development and how we move cranes i mean i tell you outright we ve got a 6400 1 that we ve been looking to launch now it s been delayed six months in total so i mean we go through all the toll gates and everyone stands in a room and says not ready to go and we say ok keep working on it so i mean i think that shows the level of discipline that we have and then the other side of this is just the voice of the customer in the field follows what we do to really make sure that the way we design in the cranes is what the customers want we have a lot of dialog with folks around what are the real needs and the true specifications of the cranes we need to develop cliff ransom ransom research analyst thank you again good day aaron ravenscroft president and chief executive officer thanks cliff operator and it appears there are no further questions at this time mr warner i ll turn the conference back to you for any additional or closing remarks ion warner vice president marketing and investor relations thank you before we

moscow ap president joe biden ordered heavy u s financial sanctions against russian banks and oligarchs on tuesday stepping up the west s confrontation with moscow even as russian lawmakers authorized president vladimir putin to use military force outside their country biden in a brief address from the white house accused putin of flagrantly violating international law in what he called the beginning of a russian invasion of ukraine and promised that more sanctions would be coming if putin proceeds further the president joined the 27 european union members who unanimously agreed on tuesday to levy their own initial set of sanctions targeting russian officials over their actions in ukraine germany also announced it was halting the process of certifying the nord stream 2 gas pipeline from russia a lucrative deal long sought by moscow but criticized by the u s for increasing europe s reliance on russian energy none of us will be fooled by putin s claims about ukraine the u s president said biden said he was also moving additional u s troops to the baltic states on nato s eastern flank bordering russia the prime minster of estonia and presidents of latvia and lithuania on friday had made a direct plea to vice president kamala harris for the u s to step up its presence in the baltics biden said the u s would impose full blocking on two large russian financial institutions and comprehensive sanctions on russian debt that means we ve cut off russia s government from western finance biden said it can no longer raise money from the west and cannot trade in its new debt on our markets or european markets either the president announced what he called a first tranche of sanctions as russian troops rolled into rebel held areas in eastern ukraine after putin said he was recognizing the areas independence on monday it was unclear how large the russian deployment was and ukraine and its western allies have long said russian troops were already fighting in the region allegations that moscow always denied members of russia s upper house the federation council voted unanimously to allow putin to use military force outside the country effectively formalizing a russian military deployment to the rebel regions where an eight year conflict has killed nearly 14 000 people shortly after putin laid out three conditions to end the crisis that has threatened to plunge europe back into war raising the specter of massive casualties energy shortages across the continent and economic chaos around the globe putin said the crisis could be resolved if kyiv recognizes russia s sovereignty over crimea the black sea peninsula that moscow annexed from ukraine in 2014 renounces its bid to join nato and partially demilitarizes the west has decried the annexation of crimea as a violation of international law and has previously flatly rejected permanently barring ukraine from nato asked whether he has sent any russian troops into ukraine and how far they could go putin responded i haven t said that the troops will go there right now he added that it s impossible to forecast a specific pattern of action it will depend on a concrete situation as it takes shape on the ground the european union soon followed with a first set of sanctions aimed at the 351 russian lawmakers who voted for recognizing separatist regions in ukraine as well as 27 other russian officials and institutions from the defense and banking world they also sought to limit moscow s access to eu capital and financial markets with tensions rising and a broader conflict looking more likely the white house began referring to the russian deployments in the region known as the donbas as an invasion after initially hesitating to use the term a red line that president biden had said would result in severe sanctions against moscow we think this is yes the beginning of an invasion russia s latest invasion into ukraine said jon finer principal deputy national security adviser said on cnn an invasion is an invasion and that is what is underway the biden administration s rhetoric hardened considerably in less than 24 hours the white house announced limited sanctions targeting the rebel region monday evening soon after putin said he was sending troops to eastern ukraine a senior biden administration official who briefed reporters about the sanctions targeting the breakaway region noted that russia has occupied these regions since 2014 and that russian troops moving into donbas would not itself be a new step the administration initially resisted calling the deployment an invasion because the white house wanted to see what russia was actually going to do after assessing russian troop movements it became clear it was a new invasion according to a u s official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations biden on tuesday said he was authorizing the redeployment of some u s troops who are already stationed in europe to bolster the security of nato s baltic allies particularly in light of russia s troop build up in belarus biden said these are totally defensive moves on our part and the u s has no intention of deploying its forces in non nato member ukraine but biden also said the u s and its allies will defend every inch of nato territory and abide by the commitments we made to nato the organization s mutual defense pact considers an attack on one member to be an attack against all for weeks western powers have been bracing as russia massed an estimated 150 000 troops on three sides of neighboring ukraine western leaders have long warned moscow would look for cover to invade and just such a pretext appeared to come monday when putin recognized as independent two separatist regions in eastern ukraine where government troops have fought russia backed rebels the kremlin then raised the stakes further tuesday by saying that recognition extends even to the large parts now held by ukrainian forces putin said russia has recognized the rebel regions independence in the borders that existed when they declared their independence in 2014 broad territories that extend far beyond the areas now under separatist control and that include the major azov sea port of mariupol he added however that the rebels should eventually negotiate with ukraine condemnation from around the world was quick ukrainian president volodymyr zelenskyy said he would consider breaking diplomatic ties with russia and kyiv recalled its ambassador in moscow but confusion over what exactly was happening in eastern ukraine threatened to hobble a western response while washington clearly called it an invasion some other allies hedged russian troops have entered in donbas eu foreign policy chief josep borrell said in paris we consider donbas part of ukraine but he added i wouldn t say that it is a fully fledged invasion but russian troops are on ukrainian soil poland s defense ministry and british health secretary sajid javid also said russian forces had entered eastern ukraine with javid telling sky news that the invasion of ukraine has begun not all in europe saw it that way spanish foreign minister josé manuel albares noted if russia uses force against ukraine sanctions will be massive the kremlin hasn t confirmed any troop deployments to the rebel east saying it will depend on the security situation vladislav brig a member of the separatist local council in donetsk told reporters the russian troops already had moved in but more senior rebel leaders didn t confirm that late monday convoys of armored vehicles were seen rolling across the separatist controlled territories it wasn t immediately clear if they were russian the white house issued an executive order to prohibit u s investment and trade in the separatist regions and additional measures likely sanctions were to be announced tuesday those sanctions are independent of what washington has prepared in the event of a russian invasion according to a senior administration official who briefed reporters on the condition of anonymity the russian moves pushed germany to suspend the certification process for nord stream 2 pipeline that was to bring natural gas from russia the pipeline was built to help germany meet its energy needs particularly as it switches off its last three nuclear power plants and phases out the use of coal and it has resisted calls by the u s and others to halt the project if putin pushes further into ukraine nato chief jens stoltenberg insisted the west would move in lockstep if russia decides once again to use force against ukraine there will be even stronger sanctions even a higher price to pay he said british prime minister boris johnson said the u k would slap sanctions on five russian banks and three wealthy individuals he warned a full scale offensive would bring further powerful sanctions even as alarm spread across the globe zelenskyy sought to project calm saying in an address overnight we are not afraid of anyone or anything we don t owe anyone anything and we won t give anything to anyone his foreign minister dmytro kuleba is in washington to meet with secretary of state antony blinken the state department said russia has long denied it has any plans to invade ukraine instead blaming the u s and its allies for the crisis and describing ukraine s bid to join nato as an existential challenge to russia putin reiterated those accusations in an hourlong televised speech on monday when he announced that russia would recognize the rebels ukraine s membership in nato poses a direct threat to russia s security he said
western leaders said tuesday that russian troops have moved into rebel held areas in eastern ukraine after president vladimir putin s recognised their independence but some indicated it was not yet the long feared full fledged invasion for weeks western powers have been bracing for an invasion as russia massed an estimated 150 000 troops on three sides of neighbouring ukraine they warned an attack would cause massive casualties energy shortages in europe and economic chaos around the globe and promised swift and severe sanctions if it materialised the european union and britain announced

in borders that existed when they proclaimed their independence in 2014 broad territories that extend far beyond the areas now under the rebel control and that include the major black sea port of

troops have been fighting there for years moscow denies those allegations condemnation from around the world was quick ukrainian president volodymyr zelenskyy said he would consider breaking diplomatic ties with russia and kyiv recalled its ambassador in moscow but confusion over what exactly was happening in eastern ukraine threatened to hobble a western response russian troops have entered in donbas the name for the area where the two separatist regions are located eu foreign policy chief josep borrell said in paris we consider donbas part of ukraine but in a distinction that

bloc was prepared to impose sanctions on several russian officials and banks financing the russian armed forces and move to limit moscow s access to eu capital and financial markets they gave few details eu foreign ministers are meeting later tuesday to discuss the measures but they did not appear to include the massive punishment repeatedly promised in case of a full fledged invasion british prime minister boris johnson also said the uk would slap sanctions on five russian banks and three wealthy individuals while he said that russian tanks have already rolled into eastern ukraine he

ukraine s membership in nato poses a direct threat to russia s security he said russia says it wants western guarantees that nato won t allow ukraine and other former soviet countries to join as members moscow has also demanded the alliance halt weapons deployments to ukraine and roll back its forces from eastern europe demands flatly rejected by the west putin warned monday that the western rejection of moscow s demands gives russia the right to take other steps to protect its security sweeping through more than a century of history putin painted today s ukraine as a modern construct used by the west to contain russia despite the neighbour s inextricable links in a stark warning to ukraine the russian leader charged that it has unfairly inherited russia s historic land granted to it by the communist rulers of the soviet union and mocked its effort to shed the communist past in a so called decommunization campaign we are ready to show you what the real decommunization would mean for ukraine putin added ominously in an apparent signal of his readiness to raise new land claims amid the soaring tensions us president joe biden and putin tentatively agreed to a meeting in a

photo credit virrage images shutterstock the covid 19 pandemic has been challenging for travel and tourism businesses the leisure and hospitality and travel and transportation industries have consistently been reported among the sectors hardest hit by the effects of the coronavirus between shifting public health restrictions travelers concerns about the spread of the virus and ongoing challenges filling jobs it has been difficult for businesses in these fields to return to full capacity and stay there according to the u s travel association major metrics like travel spending and hotel bookings only approached pre pandemic levels this past december nearly two years after the pandemic first reached the u s despite this some forms of travel have remained resilient and even grown in popularity as a result of covid 19 among these are road trips defined here as trips between 100 and 500 miles made in a personal vehicle during the pandemic road trippers have found that they can still take vacations while avoiding other concerns like greater potential exposure to the virus or the high volume of flight cancellations due to the omicron surge at the end of 2021 in 2019 the number of long distance road trips averaged around 60 million per week according to data from the u s bureau of transportation statistics during the last two years however that figure exceeded 72 million per week on average in 2020 interest in road trips appeared to be heavily impacted by the pandemic weekly long distance trips dropped below 2019 levels during initial lockdowns before eventually climbing upwards and topping 100 million per week again in mid august as restrictions were rolled back last year travelers sustained a greater number of road trips with the number of trips each week exceeding the corresponding week from 2019 in all but 12 weeks and interestingly road trips in 2021 showed less of the seasonal swings of previous years hovering around 75 million trips per week for most of the year but like other aspects of the pandemic the road trip trend has played out differently in different parts of the country eleven states have actually seen a decline in road trips from 2019 to 2021 led by northeastern states like new hampshire 39 6 vermont 33 2 and connecticut 31 8 in contrast the biggest jumps have been in southern states like arkansas 70 2 louisiana 62 6 and north carolina 54 6 and at the metro level most of the top cities where people are taking more road trips are also found in southern states these regional differences may be in part due to differences in government policy or guidance on the pandemic states and localities in the northeast have been more likely to maintain travel restrictions vaccine mandates or other policies that could deter travel while southern states have been more permissive in encouraging travel the data used in this analysis is from the u s bureau of transportation statistics to determine the locations with the most people taking road trips compared to pre pandemic levels researchers at outdoorsy calculated the change in 100 500 mile trips from 2019 to 2021 in the event of a tie the location with the

brussels responding swiftly to russian president vladimir putin s order sending troops to separatist regions of ukraine world leaders hit back with non military actions tuesday in hopes of averting a full blown war in europe germany made the first big move taking steps to halt certification of the nord stream 2 gas pipeline from russia a massive lucrative deal long sought by moscow but criticized by the u s for increasing europe s reliance on russian energy supplies and in washington u s president joe biden announced financial sanctions as punishment for what he called the beginning of a russian invasion of ukraine the sanctions will hit russian financial institutions and oligarchs he said the u s would impose full blocking on two large russian financial institutions and comprehensive sanctions on russian debt that means we ve cut off russia s government from western finance biden said it can no longer raise money from the west and cannot trade in its new debt on our markets or european markets either biden promised that more sanctions would be coming if putin proceeds further the european union announced sanctions taking aim at the 351 duma legislators who voted in favor of recognizing separatist regions in ukraine as well as 27 other russian officials and institutions from the defense and banking world they also sought to limit moscow s access to eu capital and financial markets this package of sanctions will hurt russia and it will hurt a lot eu foreign policy chief josep borrell said after chairing a meeting of eu foreign ministers in paris we will make it as difficult as possible for the kremlin to pursue its aggressive policies said eu commission president ursula von der leyen outside the eu british prime minister boris johnson named five russian banks and three wealthy individuals whom the uk hit with sanctions on tuesday and if putin pushes further into ukraine nato chief jens stoltenberg insisted there will be even stronger sanctions even a higher price to pay western leaders said putin s moves in ukraine violated countless international agreements and since diplomacy had failed it was time for action western powers have long made clear the fate of ukraine wasn t worth a direct military confrontation with russia and the potential of a world war so sanctions were the limited option no lows too low no lies too blatant no red lines too red to cross lithuanian prime minister ingrida simonyte said in summing up the political disgust for putin s actions felt by nations from europe to north america and the democracies hugging russia s borders in asia such as japan and south korea however putin continued to knock the world off kilter with a strategy that has led to confusion about his plans and possible actions russia said it was sending what it called peacekeepers into eastern ukraine but eu foreign policy chief borrell stressed they were troops on sovereign ukrainian territory i wouldn t say that s a fully fledged invasion but russian troops are on ukrainian soil borrell said british defense secretary ben wallace didn t mince words russia has already invaded ukraine they did it in 2014 occupied illegally crimea and donbas this is a further invasion of their sovereign territory wallace said whatever the description the latest developments were enough to push the 27 nation bloc into a mode of high alert and the eu s foreign ministers stressed the sanctions announced tuesday were done in close consultation with the united states and other western allies they stopped short of the massive package threatened by the eu and washington for a full military invasion into national territory that kyiv still controls the way we respond will define us for the generations to come simonyte said too much too soon though could hurt the international response said britain s johnson this the first tranche the first barrage of what we are prepared to do and we hold further sanctions at readiness to be deployed he told british lawmakers this is a first step agreed french foreign minister jean yves le drian we have more ammunition biden s announcement appeared to hold in reserve some of the broadest and toughest of the penalties considered by the united states those include an export ban that would deny russia u s high technology for its industries and military and more sweeping financial bans that could cripple russia s ability to do business with the rest of the world we still believe that russia is poised to go much further in launching a massive military attack against ukraine biden said the two major russian banks targeted by the u s sanctions are vnesheconombank veb and promsvyazbank public joint stock company psb veb is crucial to russia s ability to raise funds and psb is critical to russia s defense sector among the oligarchs and others close to putin cited for sanctions are denis bortnikov a deputy president of russian state owned vtb bank and petr fradkov chairman and ceo of psb the vtb official s father aleksandr bortnikov director of the federal security service and a permanent member of the security council of the russian federation was also cited in the sanction lists fradkov is the son of mikhail fradkov a former russian prime minister and former director of russia s foreign intelligence service sergei kiriyenko putin s first deputy chief of staff and his son vladimir kiriyenko who is the ceo of the parent company of russia s top social media platform vkontakte were also designated hopes are dwindling that a major conflict can be averted putin s directive came hours after he recognized the two ukrainian separatist regions as independent setting up russian military support and antagonizing western leaders who regard his actions as a breach of world order putin has blamed nato for the current crisis and called the u s led alliance a threat to russia the global condemnation came amid rising skirmishes in the eastern regions of ukraine that western powers believe russia could use as a pretext for an attack on the europe leaning democracy that has defied moscow s attempts to pull it back into its orbit with an estimated 150 000 russian troops massed on three sides of ukraine the u s has warned that moscow has already decided to invade still biden and putin tentatively agreed to a possible meeting brokered by french president emmanuel macron in a last ditch effort to avoid war

as one of the world s top suppliers of key energy commodities russia s exports are a vital piece of the global economy it s official russian troops are now entering two eastern ukraine breakaway regions donetsk and luhansk oil prices are surging while markets are on edge on expectations of imminent widespread sanctions from the west russia is one of the world s largest suppliers of key energy commodities including oil and natural gas as well as in demand industrial metals such as aluminum copper cobalt and nickel with u s lawmakers promising the mother of all sanctions that would be crippling to economy in the event of an invasion the markets are bracing themselves for a series of supply shocks that could trigger another round of price spikes other than geopolitical tensions investors have been flocking to oil and other commodities as inflation in the u s continues its northerly trajectory economic data showed that u s inflation has surged to a four decade high of 7 5 prompting the federal reserve bank of st louis president james bullard to advocate for a supersized rate hike while equities declined on the day oil is viewed as a safer bet amid rising cost pressures here are five energy exchange traded funds etfs to hedge against inflation and geopolitical uncertainty 1 energy select sector spdr etf aum 34 7b expense ratio 0 10 dividend yield fwd 4 1 ytd returns 22 6 with nearly 35b in assets under management aum the energy select sector spdr etf nysearca xle is the largest dedicated energy fund it s also the most liquid and among the cheapest with an expense ratio of just 0 10 xle tracks the price and yield performance of companies in the energy select sector index the index offers investors broad exposure to companies in the oil gas and energy equipment industries another key attraction the etf has a respectable 4 09 dividend yield fwd related oil prices temporarily break 99 as russian troops move into ukraine one of its shortcomings though is that the etf holds just 24 stocks in its portfolio with exxonmobil nyse xom and chevron corp nyse cvx over represented accounting for nearly 44 of the entire portfolio value 2 vanguard energy etf aum 6 63b expense ratio 0 10 dividend yield fwd 4 0 ytd returns 20 9 vanguard funds are traditionally known for undercutting the competition on costs and the vanguard energy etf nysearca vde has remained true to this ethos by offering the lowest pricing in the sector with 106 stocks albeit with significantly less aum than xle vde is much better diversified than xle though xom and cvx still play outsized roles with weightings of 21 3 and 16 9 respectively vde tracks the performance of the msci us investable market index imi energy 25 50 an index consisting of stocks of large and mid cap us energy companies 3 united states oil etf lp aum 2 50b expense ratio 0 83 dividend yield fwd n a ytd returns 19 1 the united states oil etf lp nysearca uso seeks to track the daily changes in percentage terms of the spot price of light sweet crude oil delivered to cushing oklahoma uso invests primarily in futures contracts for light sweet crude oil other types of crude oil diesel heating oil gasoline natural gas and other petroleum based fuels back in april 2020 uso gained notoriety last year after becoming the focus of the worst oil price crash in history wti futures contract sunk an agonizing 310 to minus 38 45 barrel marking the first time that a futures contract for u s crude prices went negative and made all those seemingly improbable negative oil prognostications suddenly appear prescient negative oil prices are an absurd notion that essentially means that producers would pay traders to take the oil off their hands uso the country s largest long only crude oil exchange traded fund etf was to blame for the debacle as it owned 25 of the outstanding volume of may wti oil futures contracts thankfully a repeat of that kind of mayhem is unlikely after uso moved 20 of the wti contracts it holds into later months in a bid to lower volatility 4 direxion daily s p oil gas exp prod bull 2x shares etf aum 874 9m expense ratio 1 14 dividend yield fwd n a ytd returns 24 9 the

dividend yield fwd n a ytd returns 17 1 the ipath series b bloomberg aluminum subindex total return etn nysearca jju is an exchange traded note launched by barclays bank plc in 2018 the note seeks to track the performance of the bloomberg aluminum subindex total return the index represents the commodity markets and comprises futures contracts on aluminum exchange traded notes etns are close cousins to exchange traded funds etfs but with some key structural differences etns different from etfs in that they are unsecured debt securities that track an underlying index of securities whereas etfs provide investments into a fund that holds the assets it tracks like stocks bonds or gold a big advantage that etns have over etfs is that they come with no tracking error and also receive more favorable tax treatment on the flip side an etn like jju comes with a credit risk because investors might lose their money in the unlikely event that barclays goes under whereas etfs come with virtually no credit risk there s a solid reason to buy an aluminum etn like jju russia accounts for 6 of global aluminum supply and an escalation of tensions between russia and ukraine raises the likelihood of a supply shock in an already tight aluminum market according to the u s geological survey russia made roughly 3 7 million metric tons of aluminum in 2021 with world production of the metal amounting to about 68 million metric tons data by cia world factbook shows that china is the world s biggest aluminum producer making about 39 million metric tons in 2021 but russia is also a large exporter of the commodity aluminum prices have risen about 15 year to date with prices near multiyear highs but could still rise further jefferies analyst christopher lafemini says that even if geopolitical risks in europe subside aluminum prices probably will decline at first before rising again as the market deficit likely would persist meanwhile shares of one of the world s largest aluminum producers alcoa corp nyse aa have jumped 270 over the past year and 31 3 ytd lafemina has raised his aa price target to a street high 90 from 75 good for 15 upside while reiterating his buy

metrics the company s strategies the company s plans to benefit the environment or communities in which it operates and the company s operations including planned operations and oil production statements relating to reserves are also deemed to be forward looking statements as they involve the implied assessment based on certain estimates and assumptions including that the reserves described can be profitably produced in the future the forward looking statements contained in this press release reflect several material factors and expectations and assumptions of gran tierra including without limitation that gran tierra will continue to conduct its operations in a manner consistent with its current expectations the accuracy of testing and production results and seismic data pricing and cost estimates including with respect to commodity pricing and exchange rates rig availability the risk profile of planned exploration activities the effects of drilling down dip the 5 year weighted average brent forecast the effects of waterflood and multi stage fracture stimulation operations the extent and effect of delivery disruptions and the general continuance of current or where applicable assumed operational regulatory and industry conditions including in areas of potential expansion and the ability of gran tierra to execute its current business and operational plans in the manner currently planned gran tierra believes the material factors expectations and assumptions reflected in the forward looking statements are reasonable at this time but no assurance can be given that these factors expectations and assumptions will prove to be correct among the important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated by the forward looking statements in this press release are the unprecedented impact of the covid 19 pandemic and the actions of opec and non opec countries and the procedures imposed by governments in response thereto disruptions to local operations the decline and volatility in oil and gas industry conditions and commodity prices the severe imbalance in supply and demand for oil and natural gas prices and markets for oil and natural gas are unpredictable and volatile the accuracy of productive capacity of any particular field the timing and impact of any resumption of operations gran tierra s operations are located in south america and unexpected problems can arise due to guerilla activity or local blockades or protests technical difficulties and operational difficulties may arise which impact the production transport or sale of our products geographic political and weather conditions can impact the production transport or sale of our products the ability of gran tierra to execute its business plan and realize expected benefits from current initiatives including a reduction of the capital program the risk that unexpected delays and difficulties in developing currently owned properties may occur the ability to replace reserves and production and develop and manage reserves on an economically viable basis the accuracy of testing and production results and seismic data pricing and cost estimates including with respect to commodity pricing and exchange rates the risk profile of planned exploration activities the effects of drilling down dip the effects of waterflood and multi stage fracture stimulation operations the extent and effect of delivery disruptions equipment performance and costs actions by third parties the timely receipt of regulatory or other required approvals for our operating activities the failure of exploratory drilling to result in commercial wells unexpected delays due to the limited availability of drilling equipment and personnel the risk that current global economic and credit market conditions may impact oil prices and oil consumption more than gran tierra currently predicts which could cause gran tierra to further modify its strategy and capital spending program volatility or declines in the trading price of our common stock or bonds the risk that gran tierra does not receive the anticipated benefits of government programs including government tax refunds gran tierra s ability to comply with financial covenants in its credit agreement and indentures and make borrowings under its credit agreement or find other capital at economic costs to fund our operating expenses and the risk factors detailed from time to time in gran tierra s periodic reports filed with the securities and exchange commission including without limitation under the caption risk factors in gran tierra s annual report on form 10 k for the year ended december 31 2021 filed february 22 2022 and its other filings with the sec these filings are available on the sec website at and on sedar at www sedar com although the current guidance capital spending program and long term strategy of gran tierra are based upon the current expectations of the management of gran tierra should any one of a number of issues arise gran tierra may find it necessary to alter its business strategy and or capital spending program and there can be no assurance as at the date of this press release as to how those funds may be reallocated or strategy changed and how that would impact gran tierra s results of operations and financial position forecasts and expectations that cover multi year time horizons or are associated with 2p reserves inherently involve increased risks and actual results may differ materially the forward looking statements contained in this press release are based on certain assumptions made by gran tierra based on management s experience and other factors believed to be appropriate gran tierra believes these assumptions to be reasonable at this time but the forward looking statements are subject to risk and uncertainties many of which are beyond gran tierra s control which may cause actual results to differ materially from those implied or expressed by the forward looking statements the risk that the assumptions on which the 2022 outlook are based prove incorrect may increase the later the period to which the outlook relates in particular the unprecedented nature of the pandemic and industry volatility may make it particularly difficult to identify risks or predict the degree to which identified risks will impact gran tierra s business and financial condition all forward looking statements are made as of the date of this press release and the fact that this press release remains available does not constitute a representation by gran tierra that gran tierra believes these forward looking statements continue to be true as of any subsequent date actual results may vary materially from the expected results expressed in forward looking statements gran tierra disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward looking statements whether as a result of new information future events or otherwise except as expressly required by applicable law the estimates of future production ebitda net cash provided by operating activities described in this press release as cash flow free cash flow operating netback total capital net debt and certain expenses or costs set forth in this press release may be considered to be future oriented financial information or a financial outlook for the purposes of applicable canadian securities laws financial outlook and future oriented financial information contained in this press release about prospective financial performance financial position or cash flows are provided to give the reader a better understanding of the potential future performance of the company in certain areas and are based on assumptions about future events including economic conditions and proposed courses of action based on management s assessment of the relevant information currently available and to become available in the future in particular this press release contains projected operational and financial information for 2022 and the next five years these projections contain forward looking statements and are based on a number of material assumptions and factors set out above actual results may differ significantly from the projections presented herein these projections may also be considered to contain future oriented financial information or a financial outlook the actual results of gran tierra s operations for any period will likely vary from the amounts set forth in these projections and such variations may be material see above for a discussion of the risks that could cause actual results to vary the future oriented financial information and financial outlooks contained in this press release have been approved by management as of the date of this press release readers are cautioned that any such financial outlook and future oriented financial information contained herein should not be used for purposes other than those for which it is disclosed herein the company and its management believe that the prospective operational and financial information has been prepared on a reasonable basis reflecting management s best estimates and judgments and represent to the best of management s knowledge and opinion the company s expected course of action however because this information is highly subjective it should not be relied on as necessarily indicative of future results non gaap measures this press release includes non gaap financial measures as further described herein these non gaap measures do not have a standardized meaning under gaap investors are cautioned that these measures should not be construed as alternatives to net loss or other measures of financial performance as determined in accordance with gaap gran tierra s method of calculating these measures may differ from other companies and accordingly they may not be comparable to similar measures used by other companies each non gaap financial measure is presented along with the corresponding gaap measure so as not to imply that more emphasis should be placed on the non gaap measure before tax and after tax free cash flow are non gaap terms and are called before tax and after tax net revenue in the gte mcdaniel reserves report respectively the non gaap term of before tax free cash flow and free cash flow after development expenditures and taxes over the next five years reconciles to the nearest gaap term of oil sales which is called sales revenue in the gte mcdaniel reserves report before tax net revenue is calculated by mcdaniel by subtracting total royalties operating costs future development capital and abandonment and reclamation costs from sales revenue after tax free cash flow is calculated by mcdaniel by subtracting future taxes from before tax net revenue refer to future net revenue in this press release for the applicable reconciliation gran tierra is unable to provide a quantitative reconciliation of free cash flow after development expenditures taxes interest and g a costs over the next five years to its most directly comparable forward looking gaap measure because management cannot reliably predict certain of the necessary components of such forward looking gaap measure gran tierra is unable to provide forward looking net income the gaap measure most directly comparable to forward looking ebitda or a quantitative reconciliation of forward looking ebitda because management cannot reliably predict certain of the necessary components of the forward looking gaap measure gran tierra is also unable to provide forward looking oil sales the gaap measure most directly comparable to such measures of free cash flow and operating netback due to the impracticality of quantifying certain components required by gaap as a result of the inherent volatility in the value of certain financial instruments held by the company and the inability to quantify the effectiveness of commodity price derivatives used to manage the variability in cash flows associated with the forecast sale of its oil production and changes in commodity prices refer to oil and gas metrics in this press release for a description of how this non gaap measure is calculated management uses free cash flow as a measure of the company s ability to fund its exploration program net debt as presented is defined as projected senior notes and borrowings under the credit facility less projected cash management believes that net debt is a useful supplemental measure for management and investors to in order to evaluate the financial sustainability of the company s business and leverage the most directly comparable gaap measure is total debt gran tierra is unable to provide a quantitative reconciliation of

sedar at www sedar com estimates of net present value and future net revenue contained herein do not necessarily represent fair market value of reserves estimates of reserves and future net revenue for individual properties may not reflect the same level of confidence as estimates of reserves and future net revenue for all properties due to the effect of aggregation there is no assurance that the forecast price and cost assumptions applied by mcdaniel in evaluating gran tierra s reserves and future net revenue will be attained and variances could be material see gran tierra s press release dated january 25 2022 for a summary of the price forecasts employed by mcdaniel in the gte mcdaniel reserves report and other information regarding the disclosed future net revenue all evaluations of future net revenue contained in the gte mcdaniel reserves report are after the deduction of royalties operating costs development costs production costs and abandonment and reclamation costs but before consideration of indirect costs such as administrative overhead and other miscellaneous expenses it should not be assumed that the estimates of future net revenue presented in this press release represent the fair market value of the reserves there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of crude oil and natural gas reserves and the future cash flows attributed to such reserves the reserve and associated cash flow information set forth in the gte mcdaniel reserves report are estimates only and there is no guarantee that the estimated reserves will be recovered actual reserves may be greater than or less than the estimates provided therein all reserves assigned in the gte mcdaniel reserves report are located in colombia and ecuador and presented on a consolidated basis boes have been converted on the basis of six thousand cubic feet mcf natural gas to 1 bbl of oil boes may be misleading particularly if used in isolation a boe conversion ratio of 6 mcf 1 bbl is based on an energy equivalency conversion method primarily applicable at the burner tip and does not represent a value equivalency at the wellhead in addition given that the value ratio based on the current price of oil as compared with natural gas is significantly different from the energy equivalent of six to one utilizing a boe conversion ratio of 6 mcf 1 bbl would be misleading as an indication of value references to a formation where evidence of hydrocarbons has been encountered is not necessarily an indicator that hydrocarbons will be recoverable in commercial quantities or in any estimated volume gran tierra s reported production is a mix of light crude oil and medium and heavy crude oil for which there is not a precise breakdown since the company s oil sales volumes typically represent blends of more than one type of crude oil well test results should be considered as preliminary and not necessarily indicative of long term performance or of ultimate recovery well log interpretations indicating oil and gas accumulations are not necessarily indicative of future production or ultimate recovery if it is indicated that a pressure transient analysis or well test interpretation has not been carried out any data disclosed in that respect should be considered preliminary until such analysis has been completed references to thickness of oil pay or of a formation where evidence of hydrocarbons has been encountered is not necessarily an indicator that hydrocarbons will be recoverable in commercial quantities or in any estimated volume future net revenue future

properties reflects the tax burden on the properties on a stand alone basis it does not consider the corporate tax situation or tax planning it does not provide an estimate of the value at the company level which may be significantly different the company s financial statements should be consulted for information at the company level definitions proved reserves are those reserves that can be estimated with a high degree of certainty to be recoverable it is likely that the actual remaining quantities recovered will exceed the estimated proved reserves probable reserves are those additional reserves that are less certain to be recovered than proved reserves it is equally likely that the actual remaining quantities recovered will be greater or less than the sum of the estimated proved plus probable reserves possible reserves are those additional reserves that are less certain to be recovered than probable reserves there is a 10 probability that the quantities actually recovered will equal or exceed the sum of proved plus probable plus possible reserves proved developed producing reserves are those reserves that are expected to be recovered from completion intervals open at the time of the estimate these reserves may be currently producing or if shut in they must have previously been on production and the date of resumption of production must be known with reasonable certainty undeveloped reserves are those reserves expected to be recovered from known accumulations where a significant expenditure e g when compared to the cost of drilling a well is required to render them capable of production they must fully meet the requirements of the reserves category proved probable possible to which they are assigned certain terms used in this press release but not defined are defined in ni 51 101 csa staff notice 51 324 revised glossary to ni 51 101 standards of disclosure for oil and gas activities csa staff notice 51 324 and or the cogeh and unless the context otherwise requires shall have the same meanings herein as in ni 51 101 csa staff notice 51 324 and the cogeh as the case may be oil and gas metrics this press release contains a number of oil and gas metrics including free cash flow nav per share f d costs operating netback cash netback and reserves replacement which do not have standardized meanings or standard methods of calculation and therefore such measures may not be comparable to similar measures used by other companies and should not be used to make comparisons such metrics have been included herein to provide readers with additional measures to evaluate the company s performance however such measures are not reliable indicators of the future performance of the company and future performance may not compare to the performance in previous periods before tax and after tax free cash flow are non gaap terms and are called before tax and after tax net revenue in the gte mcdaniel reserves report respectively the non gaap term of before tax free cash flow reconciles to the nearest gaap term of oil sales which is called sales revenue in the gte mcdaniel reserves report before tax net revenue is calculated by mcdaniel by subtracting total royalties operating costs future development capital abandonment and reclamation costs from sales revenue after tax free cash flow is calculated by mcdaniel by subtracting future taxes from before tax net revenue refer to future net revenue in this press release for the applicable reconciliation management uses free cash flow as a measure of the company s ability to fund its exploration program nav per share is calculated as the applicable npv10 before or after tax as applicable minus estimated net debt divided by the number of shares of gran tierra s common stock issued and outstanding management uses nav per share as a measure of the relative change of gran tierra s net asset value over its outstanding common stock over a period of time f d costs are calculated as estimated exploration and development capital expenditures excluding acquisitions and dispositions divided by the applicable reserves additions both before and after changes in future development costs the calculation of f d costs incorporates the change in future development costs required to bring proved undeveloped and developed reserves into production the aggregate of the exploration and development costs incurred in the financial year and the changes during that year in estimated future development costs may not reflect the total f d costs related to reserves additions for that year management uses f d costs per boe as a measure of its ability to execute its capital program and of its asset quality operating netback and cash netback are calculated as described in this press release management believes that operating netback and cash netback are useful supplemental measures for the reasons described in this press release reserves replacement is calculated as reserves in the referenced category divided by estimated referenced production management uses this measure to determine the relative change of its reserves base over a period of time disclosure of reserve information and cautionary note to u s investors unless expressly stated otherwise all estimates of proved developed producing proved probable and possible reserves and related future net revenue disclosed in this press release have been prepared in accordance with ni 51 101 estimates of reserves and future net revenue made in accordance with ni 51 101 will differ from corresponding gaap standardized measure prepared in accordance with applicable sec rules and disclosure requirements of the u s financial accounting standards board fasb and those differences may be material ni 51 101 for example requires disclosure of reserves and related future net revenue estimates based on forecast prices and costs whereas sec and fasb standards require that reserves and related future net revenue be estimated using average prices for the previous 12 months and that the standardized measure reflect discounted future net income taxes related to the company s operations in addition ni 51 101 permits the presentation of reserves estimates on a company gross basis representing gran tierra s working interest share before deduction of royalties whereas sec and fasb standards require the presentation of net reserve estimates after the deduction of royalties and similar payments there are also differences in the technical reserves estimation standards applicable under ni 51 101 and pursuant thereto the cogeh and those applicable under sec and fasb requirements in addition to being a reporting issuer in certain canadian jurisdictions gran tierra is a registrant with the sec and subject to domestic issuer reporting requirements under u s federal securities law including with respect to the disclosure of reserves and other oil and gas information in accordance with u s federal securities law and applicable sec rules and regulations collectively sec requirements disclosure of such information in accordance with sec requirements is included in the company s annual report on form 10 k and in other reports and materials filed with or furnished to the sec and as applicable canadian securities regulatory authorities the sec permits oil and gas companies that are subject to domestic issuer reporting requirements under u s federal securities law in their filings with the sec to disclose only estimated proved probable and possible reserves that meet the sec s definitions of such terms gran tierra has disclosed estimated proved probable and possible reserves in its filings with the sec in addition gran tierra prepares its financial statements in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles which require that the notes to its annual financial statements include supplementary disclosure in respect of the company s oil and gas activities including estimates of its proved oil and gas reserves and a standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows relating to proved oil and gas reserve quantities this supplementary financial statement disclosure is presented in accordance with fasb requirements which align with corresponding sec requirements concerning reserves estimation and reporting the company believes that the presentation of npv10 is useful to investors because it presents i relative monetary significance of its oil and natural gas properties regardless of tax structure and ii relative size and value of its reserves to other companies the company also uses this measure when assessing the potential return on investment related to its oil and natural gas properties npv10 and

courts around the country continue to approach the enforceability of class action waivers and arbitration provisions in erisa plan documents differently this alert discusses recent decisions addressing these issues in erisa litigation as district courts evaluate the enforceability of arbitration provisions and class action waivers against plan participants finding a mandatory class action waiver and arbitration provision unenforceable in smith v brd of dirs of triad mfg inc 13 f 4th 613 615 7th cir 2021 the seventh circuit evaluated whether an arbitration and class action waiver provision that provides ll covered claims must be brought solely in the claimant s individual capacity and not in a representative capacity or on a class collective or group basis and that the claimant may not seek or receive any remedy which has the purpose or effect of providing additional benefits or monetary or other relief to any eligible employee participant or beneficiary other than claimant is enforceable against a participant asserting erisa 502 a 2 claims id emphasis added in rendering its decision that this specific provision is problematic the seventh circuit observed that individual arbitration is not incompatible with erisa because smith participated in a defined contribution plan larue governs and the court made clear in larue that authorize recovery for fiduciary breaches that impair the value of plan assets in a participant s individual account id at 622 citing larue 552 u s at 256 therefore the narrow issue in smith was whether the specific arbitration provision at issue conflicted with erisa the court found that the clause claimant may not seek or receive any remedy which has the purpose or effect of providing additional benefits or monetary or other relief to any eligible employee participant or beneficiary other than claimant was problematic as it could arguably bar the award of any injunctive relief i e removal of a fiduciary that is specifically allowed under erisa even in a single plaintiff case based on the seventh circuit s reasoning it appears the arbitration clause would have been fully enforceable had the highlighted phrase or other relief been left out of the arbitration provision on sept 10 2021 the same day as the smith decision the u s district court for the district of delaware denied the defendants motion to dismiss and compel arbitration because the court found that the plaintiff participant had not consented to the plan s arbitration provision henry v wilmington tr n a 2021 u s dist lexis 171927 2021 wl 4133622 d del sept 10 2021 in henry the plan was amended after the initial esop formation transaction to add a section titled erisa arbitration and class action waiver despite that mandatory arbitration provision the plaintiff filed suit in federal court alleging the defendant trustee caused the plan to buy shares of the company s stock for more than fair market value in response the defendants moved to dismiss the complaint and compel individual arbitration the plaintiff argued that the arbitration provision was invalid because he never gave voluntary and knowing consent to the provision the defendants asserted that the plan was governed by virginia state law and thus virginia state law governed whether the parties had a valid arbitration agreement relying on the ninth circuit s decision in dorman v charles schwab the defendants argued that plan participant agrees to be bound by a provision in the plan document when he participates in the plan while the provision in in effect 780 f app x 510 512 9th cir 2019 the district court declined to follow dorman because in the district court s opinion the ninth circuit provided no reasoning for its decision instead the district court looked to virginia state law to determine whether the arbitration provision was valid because at this stage of the proceedings the plaintiff could plausibly support his assertion that he did not have notice of the arbitration provision and did not give consent the district court denied the motion without prejudice because the court did not compel arbitration it held that the class action waiver which was part of the arbitration provision could not be enforced at that time however in a footnote the court cited to epic sys corp v lewis 138 s ct 1612 1614 1628 2018 to suggest that very little will satisfy burden except a clear and express command by congress that an arbitration provision requiring a class action waiver is void the court could not see that erisa 409 a and 410 a clear this hurdle the henry court applied virginia state contract law in analyzing whether to enforce the arbitration and class action waiver at issue the defendants may have had greater success if they had argued that federal common law not state law governs and or that doctrines such as direct benefits estoppel avoid the necessity of establishing a participant had the requisite knowledge of and gave consent to the addition of the arbitration and class action waiver provision to the plan on nov 2 2021 the u s district court for the southern district of new york also denied a motion to compel individual arbitration holding that the plaintiff had the right under erisa 409 a and 502 a 2 to recover remedies for the plan as a whole and that this right could not be waived cedeno v argent trust co 2021 u s dist lexis 212926 2021 wl 5087898 s d n y nov 2 2021 in cedeno the plan document adopted in 2017 included a section titled mandatory and binding arbitration and set forth a procedure for resolving disputes the plaintiff brought his complaint alleging that the defendants breached their fiduciary duties under erisa thereby causing the plan to suffer losses and sought relief on behalf of the plan as a whole defendants filed a motion to compel arbitration the plaintiff opposed the motion on the following ground the subsection of the arbitration procedure limiting an arbitration to provide a remedy solely with respect to a participant s individual account and to prevent the arbitrator from awarding any relief for the benefit of the plan that goes beyond a benefit for the individual participant s account is void and because that subsection is not severable from the arbitration procedure the entire arbitration procedure must fail and defendants motion to compel arbitration must therefore be denied the defendants argued that a participant in a defined contribution plan did not have the statutory right to seek plan wide relief and was limited to relief for that participant s individual account the defendants also argued that the plan document s arbitration section included language preventing the plaintiff from recovering losses to the entire plan the district court found the defendants arguments unconvincing the cedeno decision relied on the u s supreme court s decision in larue v dewolff boberg associates inc 552 u s 248 2008 and the limited nature of the seventh circuit court of appeals decision in smith as support the district court concluded that the plan s arbitration provision was unenforceable and clearly contrary to law because it attempts to limit remedies that erisa expressly provides stated differently the district court concluded that a class action waiver that prohibits a participant from recovering any remedy under erisa 409 a on behalf of all other participants plan accounts is necessarily invalid the cedeno decision appears to have misapplied larue and smith to reach this result enforcing a mandatory class action waiver and arbitration provision on jan 20 2022 the u s district court for the southern district of florida granted the defendants motion to compel individual arbitration of the plaintiffs erisa claims thus preventing the plaintiffs from bringing the action on behalf of a putative class of similarly situated individuals holmes v baptist health s fla inc no 21 22986 civ scola 2022 u s dist lexis 10834 2022 wl 180638 jan 20 2022 in holmes the employer sponsored a defined contribution plan to facilitate employee retirement savings in which each participant has a separate account based on the amounts individually contributed the plaintiffs alleged defendants breached their fiduciary duties by failing to review and contain costs and by investing in high cost investment funds despite the availability of similar funds with lower costs or better performance histories the plan was amended in 2020 pursuant to the plan sponsor s unilateral ability to amend the plan to include an arbitration provision and class action waiver the arbitration provision also precludes individuals that bring an arbitration claim from receiving remedial or equitable relief that provides additional benefits or monetary relief to any person other than the claimant in response to the defendants motion to compel arbitration the plaintiffs argued the arbitration agreement was not enforceable because 1 the arbitration agreement and its waiver of certain plan wide remedies violated the effective vindication doctrine and 2 the arbitration agreement was not binding since it was added to the plan by a unilateral amendment in 2020 the district court addressed both arguments the plaintiffs first asserted that the plan s arbitration agreement triggered the effective vindication doctrine a judge made exception to the federal arbitration act faa that seeks to balance the competing federal policies in enforcing arbitration agreements and in vindicating the plaintiffs rights to pursue statutory remedies because it prevented the effective vindication of rights guaranteed in erisa 409 a and 502 a 2 the plaintiffs relied on the seventh circuit s decision in smith to support their argument where the seventh circuit held that an arbitration clause which precluded relief that provided additional benefits or monetary or other relief to any other individual was unenforceable under the effective vindication doctrine as the clause prohibited plan wide relief that erisa expressly permitted however the defendants countered that such plan wide relief as sought by the plaintiffs was available only to those who brought a class action on behalf of the plan and further that any waiver of a remedy unique to a representative or class action is permissible the district court declined to follow the smith rationale and held that the arbitration agreement at issue was valid and enforceable given the faa s pro arbitration policy and the rarity with which courts apply the effective vindication doctrine moreover the arbitration clause at issue was narrower than the one in smith hus while the arbitration clause in smith completely denied some types of statute authorized relief to the plan the clause here does not as individual claimants can each recover the harm to their defined contribution accounts and they can recover plan wide relief that does not provide additional benefits or monetary relief to others next the plaintiffs contended that the arbitration agreement was not binding on them because they did not knowingly or personally agree to it when it was unilaterally adopted by the 2020 amendment the district court dismissed this argument because under erisa 409 a the claims belong to the plan not the individual participants and herefore the relevant inquiry is not whether individual participants agreed to the arbitration but whether the plan agreed to arbitrate because the plan expressly provided for unilateral amendment by the plan sponsor and the plan consented to the 2020 amendment which included the arbitration agreement and class action waiver the district court found that those bringing claims on the plan s behalf must arbitrate lastly plaintiffs argued that the arbitration agreement was binding only on those who were participating in the plan at the time the arbitration agreement was added the district court restated its previous conclusion that because the plan agreed to arbitration any claims on behalf of the plan must be brought in arbitration regardless of the individual participant s status at the time of the amendment in summary the district court held that the plan consented to arbitrate and that the plaintiffs who bring claims on behalf of the plan must arbitrate their claims on an individual basis conclusion and considerations as the law continues to develop on the enforceability of erisa plan arbitration provisions and class action waivers we should receive additional guidance from the circuit courts of appeal so that plan sponsors who want to include arbitration provisions and class action waivers in their plan document can do so knowing they will be enforced

more rumbles from northland fishing tackle category article feb 22nd 2022 by keith worrall modified feb 22nd 2022 at 5 03 pm more rumbles from northland fishing tackle new rumble shad shakes up the water for spring walleye action bemidji mn february 21 2022 northland fishing tackle has made a splash in the premium hardbait category with the rumble balsawood crankbait series designed by northland chief bait designer jarmo rapala and fishing is better with balsa looking forward to the spring walleye bite northland is proud to offer anglers the rumble shad a mid running crankbait available in three sizes with varying diving depths you ll quickly discover walleyes and other species find the lure s unique roll and tight action simply irresistible the 5 dives 5 to 12 the 7 dives 8 to 16 and the 8 dives 14 to 21 all are formed of balsa wood through the unique heat compression molding hcm process and feature a welded through wire construction from the tie eye to the tail designed to imitate shad perch and bluegills the bait features a tight action whether cast and retrieved or trolled behind the boat the rumble shad is available in 15 custom artisan colors from match the hatch patterns to vibrant custom paint themes the rumble shad also features premium short shank treble hooks and an oval split ring on the line tie northland pro nick lindner comments for me the rumble shad has been a key bait in the springtime period the 5 the smallest rumble shad in the lineup is a good choice and it s great for casting or trolling it s so good in the spring because of the classic balsa shad configuration that matches the size of the predominant walleye forage in the spring the rumble shad has a subtle action the wiggle is tight my favorite applications are right after the walleye opener lindner continues you can cast it up onto shallow rocks or sand flats or alternately during the first week or two of the season when everybody s just dragging jigs and minnows on the bottom with the rumble shad you can cover water faster and find active walleye pods it s really a great tool in that situation speaking to the vast array of 15 color options lindner sticks with more natural patterns on clear bodies of water on darker stained waters like in reservoirs and river systems he says in contrast i gravitate to any of the color options with pink in them that s been a go to for me the color sneeze too has been a real producer lindner continues i watch the size of the predominant walleye forage throughout the season starting with the diminutive 5 and moving bigger as the young of the year forage grows in size which will signal moving bigger in the rumble shad lineup northland team pro jason mitchell adds it s been an absolute phenomenon in cold water both pitching and trolling the rumble shad has a nice stall and flutter when you work the rod and stop it it has a better dive curve than similar sized and shaped baits due to its thinner bill for me it s been a great slower cold water bait that just catches walleyes i think it s going to be a great bait this spring for pitching especially early season river walleye fishing around wingdams current breaks rocks and rip rap mitchell continues the rumble shad just has a nice tight and delicate action that tempts walleyes to bite on the troll pull it 1 2 1 3 1 5 mph and it just comes alive and when you stop it the bait backs up and flutters nicely and then doesn t take much to get it going northland pro joel nelson chimes in in the spring i will troll the bait earlier than most walleye fishermen tend to like the smaller 5 that dives 5 to 12 i remember opening up the season on minnesota s red lake when everybody was jigging the action was slow and the water was cold people are slip bobbering and we re trolling figure 8 s around them catching fish on the rumble shad just smoking the walleyes these people could not get bit for whatever reason but pulling a smaller shad shaped crankbait was just incredible and we had a three man limit of fish in twenty minutes so my recommendation is to fish rumble shads early in the season then you ve got the mid to late summer period trolling the quintessential last hour of light before dark pulling them along the weedline and you re going to catch everything walleyes pike bass and even big slab crappies in the fall the big sizes are what i turn with big wind patterns on a bunch of lakes if the wind starts howling you go out on that second or third day and cast the bigger size rumble shads out on top of the structure and you crank them down into the rocks and if you get wedged just pop the bait out and give it some line and big walleyes will take it northland pro brian bro brosdahl adds the rumble shad has a unique tight wobble that fish rush in to eat in testing i did a lot of pitching and retrieving and had everything follow and strike there are great match the hatch colors and wicked colorful patterns i personally think the rumble shad is going to be the hottest new walleye bait this spring you can troll it on a flat line or lead core personally i like pitching them a simple pitch and reel or with a few twitches thrown in it s a big walleye bait too i caught some really big eyes on it during testing ultimately the rumble shad is a fantastic weapon for every angler to take to their favorite walleye hole it casts well and you can feel the bait thumping while you re reeling for the quartet of walleye specialists spring can t come soon enough to break out the rumble shad on their favorite waters visit your favorite

financial measures the company considers the following non gaap measures as useful to investors as key supplemental measures of its performance ffo noi affo ebitdare and adjusted ebitdare these non gaap financial measures should be considered along with but not as alternatives to net income or loss as a measure of the company s operating performance ffo noi affo ebitdare and adjusted ebitdare as calculated by the company may not be comparable to other companies that do not define such terms exactly as the company ffo the company calculates ffo in accordance with the standards established by the national association of real estate investment trusts or nareit nareit defines ffo as net income loss calculated in accordance with gaap excluding gains or losses from sales of depreciable operating property plus real estate related depreciation depletion and amortization excluding amortization of deferred financing costs and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures management presents ffo as a supplemental performance measure because it believes that ffo is beneficial to investors as a starting point in measuring the company s operational performance specifically in excluding real estate related depreciation and amortization and gains and losses from sales of depreciable operating properties which do not relate to or are not indicative of operating performance ffo provides a performance measure that when compared year over year captures trends in occupancy rates rental rates and operating costs the company also believes that as a widely recognized measure of the performance of reits ffo will be used by investors as a basis to compare the company s operating performance with that of other reits however other equity reits may not calculate ffo in accordance with the nareit definition as the company does and accordingly the company s ffo may not be comparable to such other reits ffo affo the company calculates affo by adjusting ffo to exclude the income and expenses that the company believes are not reflective of the sustainability of the company s ongoing operating performance including but not limited to real estate related acquisition and due diligence costs stock based compensation deferred impact of interest rate swap terminations and distributions on the company s series a preferred units for the avoidance of doubt 5 7 million non cash redemption of series b participating preferred stock is not included in affo changes in gaap accounting and reporting rules that were put in effect after the establishment of nareit s definition of ffo in 1999 result in the inclusion of a number of items in ffo that do not correlate with the sustainability of the company s operating performance therefore in addition to ffo the company presents affo and affo per share fully diluted both of which are non gaap measures management considers affo a useful supplemental performance metric for investors as it is more indicative of the company s operational performance than ffo affo is not intended to represent cash flow or liquidity for the period and is only intended to provide an additional measure of the company s operating performance even affo however does not properly capture the timing of cash receipts especially in connection with full year rent payments under lease agreements entered into in connection with newly acquired farms management considers affo per share fully diluted to be a supplemental metric to gaap earnings per share affo per share fully diluted provides additional insight into how the company s operating performance could be allocated to potential shares outstanding at a specific point in time management believes that affo is a widely recognized measure of the operations of reits and presenting affo will enable investors to assess the company s performance in comparison to other reits however other reits may use different methodologies for calculating affo and affo per share fully diluted and accordingly the company s affo and affo per share fully diluted may not always be comparable to affo and affo per share amounts calculated by other reits affo and affo per share fully diluted should not be considered as an alternative to net income loss or earnings per share determined in accordance with gaap as an indication of financial performance or as an alternative to net income loss earnings per share determined in accordance with gaap as a measure of the company s liquidity nor are they indicative of funds available to fund the company s cash needs including its ability to make distributions ebitdare and adjusted ebitdare the company calculates earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization for real estate ebitdare in accordance with the standards established by nareit in its september 2017 white paper nareit defines ebitdare as net income calculated in accordance with gaap excluding interest expense income tax depreciation and amortization gains or losses on disposition of depreciated property including gains or losses on change of control impairment write downs of depreciated property and of investments in unconsolidated affiliates caused by a decrease in value of depreciated property in the affiliate and adjustments to reflect the entity s pro rata share of ebitdare of unconsolidated affiliates ebitdare is a key financial measure used to evaluate the company s operating performance but should not be construed as an alternative to operating income cash flows from operating activities or net income in each case as determined in accordance with gaap the company believes that ebitdare is a useful performance measure commonly reported and will be widely used by analysts and investors in the company s industry however while ebitdare is a performance measure widely used across the company s industry the company does not believe that it correctly captures the company s business operating performance because it includes non cash expenses and recurring adjustments that are necessary to better understand the company s business operating performance therefore in addition to ebitdare management uses adjusted ebitdare a non gaap measure the company calculates adjusted ebitdare by adjusting ebitdare for certain items such as stock based compensation and real estate related acquisition and due diligence costs that the company considers necessary to understand its operating performance the company believes that adjusted ebitdare provides useful supplemental information to investors regarding the company s ongoing operating performance that when considered with net income and ebitdare is beneficial to an investor s understanding of the company s operating performance however ebitdare and adjusted ebitdare have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of the company s results as reported under gaap in prior periods the company has presented ebitda and adjusted ebitda in accordance with nareit s recommendation beginning with the company s reported results for the three months ended march 31 2018 the company is reporting ebitdare and adjusted ebitdare in place of ebitda and adjusted ebitda net operating income noi the company calculates net operating income noi as total operating revenues rental income tenant reimbursements crop sales and other revenue less property operating expenses direct property expenses and real estate taxes since net operating income excludes general and administrative expenses interest expense depreciation and amortization acquisition related expenses other income and losses and extraordinary items it provides a performance measure that when compared year over year reflects the revenues and expenses directly associated with owning and leasing farmland real estate providing a perspective not immediately apparent from net income however net operating income should

acknowledging that russia carved out a big chunk of ukraine president biden this afternoon announced a very weak low level set of sanctions on russia so these were not exactly the swift and severe consequences that he had been bragging about for so many weeks the russian stock market rose 6 5 after biden s sanctions announcement what does that tell you in the prior several days it had been collapsing biden did follow germany in not certifying nord stream 2 but that s just a temporary paper contract issue it s not a long term or permanent shutdown he basically hit a couple of banks tied to the donbas region gop house leaders say biden s policies enabled russia s invasion of ukraine the gdp for the whole of ukraine is about 160 billion maybe and the gdp of donbas is under 6 billion the gdp of lugansk is a billion also maybe delaware s gdp just to pick a random comparison is 76 billion so to call biden s sanctions small beer is understating it remember if russia invaded ukraine our president was going to impose swift and severe consequences but he didn t i m particularly interested in mr biden s statement about protecting america from rising gasoline prices president biden my administration is using every tool at our disposal to protect american businesses and consumers from rising prices at the pump as i said last week defending freedom will have cost for us as well and here at home we need to be honest about that so mr biden you need to be honest about the damage you re doing to the american energy industry in fact you ve done everything you can to drive up prices and you know it because you re dancing to the radical green tune your jihad against fossil fuels has held down production in the face of rising demand and that has been a key factor in driving up world oil prices towards 100 a barrel in effect biden s jihad against fossil fuels is financing vladimir putin s military adventures because if we were producing at 13 million bpd as we did pre pandemic except for 11 million bpd oil prices would be substantially lower and putin would be significantly poorer mr biden s energy policies have been utterly self destructive to america and have directly empowered vladimir putin and all of putin s crazy ahistorical romanticized inaccurate vision of history russian is a nothing heimer economy roughly 1 5 trillion worth of gdp the u s is 23 trillion lt gen keith kellogg welcome to cold war ii as the late senator john mccain put it years ago russia s like an old gas station masquerading as a country and biden s anti oil policies are enabling putin to raise gas station prices while mr biden has the audacity to tell us how he wants to protect american businesses and consumers from rising prices at the pump the new york times headline for february 20 that s right the new york times was biden administration halts new drilling in legal fight over climate costs it went on to say that the interior department is indefinitely freezing decisions about new federal oil and gas drilling the bidens are also at war with several judges who disagree with the idea of the social cost of carbon which is a phony metric drummed up by extreme greenies their idea is that pipeline analysis should include carbon emissions from upstream production and downstream consumption even though there is no reliable way to measure either according to a wall street journal editorial the louisiana attorney general jeff landry has called the social costs of carbon voodoo economics ags from alabama florida georgia kentucky mississippi south dakota texas west virginia and wyoming are suing the federal government last week biden s federal energy regulatory commission ferc revised its policy for natural gas pipelines and export terminals using this phony metric to stop new pipelines of course we all recall that in the first hour of his presidency biden vetoed the keystone xl pipeline later he banned drilling in alaska raised drilling fees on public lands and on and on if mr biden were a smart president and really wanted to go after putin he would simply tell american fossil fuel companies to turn the spigots back on and he would lift all the tax and regulatory barriers that he has erected turning the spigots back on would provide all the spare capacity necessary to stabilize oil and natural gas prices and to continue american dominance in lng exports to europe and the rest of the globe turning the spigots back on would really stick it to vladimir putin but mr biden is not a smart president click here to get the fox news app he is a weak president and a weak man with only a paper thin understanding of all the natural forces involved in climate change a smart president would pursue an all the above energy policy because we need all the energy we can get from every possible source in order to spur prosperity at home and national security abroad save america the cavalry is coming this article is adapted

reckless behavior following the strike saying tehran s response to retaliation would be decisive and much stronger iran s military earlier said its strikes had achieved all its objectives and been completed successfully iranian armed forces chief of staff major general mohammad bagheri speaking on state television warned israel not to retaliate saying tehran s response will be much larger than tonight s military action he also said u s assets would be targeted if washington assisted israeli in any retaliation our operations are over and we have no intention to continue them bagheri said the

on april 14 the official declined to provide details on the contact saying only that washington and iran had a series of direct communications through the swiss channel asked about comments by iran s foreign minister that tehran had given regional countries 72 hours notice of the attacks the official said that was not true they did not give a notification the official said iran informed turkey in advance of its planned operation against israel a turkish diplomatic source told reuters on april 14 adding that washington conveyed to iran via ankara that its operation must be within certain limits earlier iranian foreign minister hossein amir abdollahian said tehran s regional allies were informed about its aerial attacks on israel in advance we naturally informed our friends in regional countries 72 hours before the operation that iran s response in the form of a legitimate defense is definite and certain he said without specifying which regional allies israel called on the united nations security council to convene an emergency session in new york on april 14 to discuss the attack which israeli un ambassador gilad erdan described in a post on x as a serious threat to global

referred to as their irresponsible stance regarding tehran s strikes on israel the semiofficial iranian labour news agency reported tehran accused the three countries of double standards as they opposed earlier this month a russian drafted un security council statement that would have condemned israel s attack on iran s embassy compound the russian foreign ministry issued a statement calling on all sides to show restraint we are counting on the regional states to solve existing problems with political and diplomatic means it said turkey does not want further escalation of tension in the region after iran s drone and missile attack against israel foreign minister hakan fidan told his iranian counterpart in a phone call on april 14 pope francis speaking to pilgrims on st peter s square

commercial traffic and that airports had resumed operations the intelligence directorate of iran s islamic revolutionary guards corps irgc on april 14 warned citizens against posting pro israeli sentiments on social media iranian state media reported israel and iran have been bitter enemies for decades but this was the first direct attack by one on the other s soil instead of through proxy forces or by targeting each other s assets in third countries so far we ve intercepted the vast majority of incoming missiles hagari said of the attack launched by the irgc in what it said was retaliation for a deadly april 1 drone strike thought to be carried out by israel on iran s consulate in damascus syria the launch came amid heightened tensions between iran and the west over the continuing war in the gaza strip and the strike in syria iran called the attack which tehran named operation honest response on israel a response to the zionist regime s aggression against our diplomatic premises in damascus however iran also appeared to be taking a cautious approach to keep the strikes from broadening conflict in the region with its mission to the united nations saying that the matter can be deemed concluded the iranian attack was immediately condemned by many governments around the world while united nations secretary general antonio guterres said he was deeply alarmed about the very real danger of a devastating region wide escalation the middle east is on the brink now is the time to defuse and de escalate guterres told a security council meeting called on april 14 earlier on april 13 iranian state media reported that irgc forces seized a container ship near the strait of hormuz claiming the vessel was linked to israel following that event israel said

rules gaza and is designated as a terrorist group by the united states and european union on october 7 the raid left 1 200 people dead and hundreds of people were taken hostage the ensuing israeli invasion of the gaza strip aimed at destroying hamas has killed more than 33 000 palestinians according to the palestinian territory s hamas run health ministry since the war began tehran has openly supported militant groups and proxies targeting israel that are part of iran s axis of resistance against israel and the west leading to concerns of a broader middle east conflict involving archenemies iran and israel the security firm ambrey said late on april 13 that yemen s huthi rebels had also launched multiple drones at israel in coordination with iran in addition to strikes launched against israel by iranian proxy lebanese hizballah the iranian backed huthis have attacked israeli territory as well as international and israeli shipping in the red sea on april 14 israeli

montpelier vt on february 22 governor phil scott returned without signature and vetoed s 30 and sent the following letter to the general assembly explaining his decision and outlining a path forward february 22 2022 the honorable john bloomer jr secretary of the senate 115 state house montpelier vt 05633 5401 dear mr bloomer pursuant to chapter ii section 11 of the vermont constitution i m returning s 30 an act relating to prohibiting possession of firearms within hospital buildings without my signature in 2018 i called for and signed the most comprehensive gun safety measures in our state s history we established universal background check requirements authorized extreme risk protection orders i e red flag laws providing tools to prevent someone from having a gun if there is credible evidence they may harm themselves or others strengthened the ability of law enforcement to seize firearms from those accused of domestic violence enhanced age requirements and prohibited the sale and possession of bump stocks and large capacity magazines this was a comprehensive and historic set of policies that take reasonable steps to help keep firearms out of the hands of people who should not have them it s my belief that we need to give these new provisions more time to be fully understood and utilized and that the legislature should focus on educating vermonters on these changes and on addressing vermont s mental health crisis before additional gun laws are passed however as i ve also said i m open to a discussion about improving existing law to address the so called charleston loophole and i m offering a path forward below this refers to a provision in federal law that provides automatic approval to someone who is buying a gun if a federal background check through the national instant criminal background check system also known as nics doesn t produce a red light i e reporting they are ineligible within three business days s 30 increases that timeframe from three days to an unlimited amount of time without acknowledging that an application expires in 30 days so instead of holding the federal government accountable to complete the background check in a timely manner it shifts all the burden away from government where responsibility was intentionally placed in federal law entirely onto the citizen law abiding citizens who become the victims of a government administrative error must themselves gather all applicable law enforcement and court records and try to understand and navigate a complex maze of federal bureaucratic process to try to rectify their yellow status for these reasons i believe going from three to effectively 30 days is excessive and unreasonable for law abiding citizens who wish to purchase a firearm for their own personal safety or for other lawful and constitutionally protected purposes however i m willing to work with the legislature to find a path forward that gives the federal government more time to fulfill its obligations to complete background checks without denying law abiding citizens of their right to a fair and reasonable process a more reasonable standard would be to increase the current three day waiting period to seven business days to allow the federal government additional time to resolve issues and make a final determination given this bill s effective date of july 1 2022 the legislature has ample time to address my concerns and send me a bill i can sign based on the objections outlined above i m returning this legislation without my signature pursuant to chapter ii section 11 of the vermont constitution sincerely philip b scott governor image courtesy of public domain

the mcdonald s corporation board of directors has issued a statement in response to a director notification nomination from carl icahn and the billionaire investor s push to require all u s suppliers to live up to its promise in 2012 to phase out the use of gestational crates in a statement mcdonald s said it can confirm that carl icahn has nominated leslie samuelrich and maisie ganzler to stand for election at the 2022 annual meeting there is no shareholder action required at this time the board will evaluate the nominees as it would any other candidates proposed to it the board utilizes director selection process guidelines to evaluate nominees which were updated in 2020 to more closely align with the company s values and the strategic drivers of its business strategy mr icahn s stated focus in making this nomination relates to a narrow issue regarding the company s pork commitment which the humane society u s has already introduced through a shareholder proposal this is an issue on which mcdonald s has been a leader the company sources only approximately 1 of u s pork production and does not own any sows or produce or package pork in the united states nevertheless in 2012 it became the first major brand to make a commitment to source from producers who do not use gestational crates for pregnant sows since making this commitment mcdonald s has led the industry and today an estimated 30 to 35 of u s pork production has moved to group housing systems mcdonald s pioneering commitment was shaped with the industry and the american association of swine veterinarians and builds on the company s decades long commitment to animal health and welfare and its overall esg strategy by the end of 2022 the company expects to source 85 to 90 of its u s pork volumes from sows not housed in gestation crates during pregnancy despite industry wide challenges for farmer and producers such as the covid 19 pandemic and global swine disease outbreaks the company expects 100 of its u s pork will come from sows housed in groups during pregnancy by the end of 2024 mcdonald s also said mr icahn who states that he holds 200 shares of mcdonald s stock is the majority owner of viskase a company that produces and supplies packaging for the pork and poultry industry mr icahn s ownership provides him with unique exposure to the industry wide challenges and opportunities in migrating away from gestation crates thus it s noteworthy that mr icahn has not publicly called on viskase to adopt commitments similar to those of mcdonald s 2012 commitment

nato secretary general jens stoltenberg speaks during a media conference after a meeting of the nato ukraine commission at nato headquarters in brussels tuesday feb 22 2022 world leaders are getting over the shock of russian president vladimir putin ordering his forces into separatist regions of ukraine and they are focusing on producing as forceful a reaction as possible germany made the first big move tuesday and took steps to halt the process of certifying the nord stream 2 gas pipeline from russia ap photo olivier matthys brussels responding swiftly to russian president vladimir putin s order sending troops to separatist regions of ukraine world leaders hit back with non military actions tuesday in hopes of averting a full blown war in europe germany made the first big move taking steps to halt certification of the nord stream 2 gas pipeline from russia a massive lucrative deal long sought by moscow but criticized by the u s for increasing europe s reliance on russian energy supplies and in washington u s president joe biden announced financial sanctions on banks and oligarchs as punishment for what he called the beginning of a russian invasion of ukraine he said the u s would impose full blocking on two large russian financial institutions and comprehensive sanctions on russian debt that means we ve cut off russia s government from western finance biden said it can no longer raise money from the west and cannot trade in its new debt on our markets or european markets either biden promised that more sanctions would be coming if putin proceeds further the european union announced sanctions taking aim at the 351 duma legislators who voted in favor of recognizing separatist regions in ukraine as well as 27 other russian officials and institutions from the defense and banking world they also sought to limit moscow s access to eu capital and financial markets this package of sanctions will hurt russia and it will hurt a lot eu foreign policy chief josep borrell said after chairing a meeting of eu foreign ministers in paris we will make it as difficult as possible for the kremlin to pursue its aggressive policies said eu commission president ursula von der leyen outside the eu british prime minister boris johnson named five russian banks and three wealthy individuals whom the uk hit with sanctions on tuesday and if putin pushes further into ukraine nato chief jens stoltenberg insisted there will be even stronger sanctions even a higher price to pay the u s and other western nations have pressed daily for diplomatic efforts to head off a dangerous military confrontation but the failure of that effort was underscored tuesday as secretary of state antony blinken canceled plans for a thursday meeting in geneva with his russian counterpart saying russia s actions showed there was no point western powers have long made clear the fate of ukraine must not lead to a direct military confrontation with russia and the potential of a world war so sanctions were the limited option no lows too low no lies too blatant no red lines too red to cross lithuanian prime minister ingrida simonyte said in summing up the political disgust for putin s actions felt by nations from europe to north america and the democracies hugging russia s borders in asia such as japan and south korea however putin continued to knock the world off kilter with a strategy that has led to confusion about his plans and possible actions russia said it was sending what it called peacekeepers into eastern ukraine but eu foreign policy chief borrell stressed they were troops on sovereign ukrainian territory i wouldn t say that s a fully fledged invasion but russian troops are on ukrainian soil borrell said british defense secretary ben wallace didn t mince words russia has already invaded ukraine they did it in 2014 occupied illegally crimea and donbas this is a further invasion of their sovereign territory wallace said whatever the description the latest developments were enough to push the 27 nation bloc into a mode of high alert and the eu s foreign ministers stressed the sanctions announced tuesday were done in close consultation with the united states and other western allies they stopped short of the massive package threatened by the eu and washington for a full military invasion into national territory that kyiv still controls the way we respond will define us for the generations to come simonyte said too much too soon though could hurt the international response said britain s johnson this the first tranche the first barrage of what we are prepared to do and we hold further sanctions at readiness to be deployed he told british lawmakers this is a first step agreed french foreign minister jean yves le drian we have more ammunition biden s announcement appeared to hold in reserve some of the broadest and toughest of the penalties considered by the united states those include an export ban that would deny russia u s high technology for its industries and military and more sweeping financial bans that could cripple russia s ability to do business with the rest of the world still u s secretary of state blinken said the sanctions announced are in line with start high stay high approach white house deputy national security adviser daleep singh added that the initial sanctions send the message that no russian financial institution is safe if the invasion proceeds no one should think that it s our goal to max out on sanctions singh said sanctions are not an end of themselves they serve a higher purpose and that purpose is to deter and prevent the two major russian banks targeted by the u s sanctions are vnesheconombank veb and promsvyazbank public joint stock company psb veb is crucial to russia s ability to raise funds and psb is critical to russia s defense sector the two hold more than 80 billion in assets combined and will be cut off from carrying out transactions in the u s and european banking systems ukraine foreign minister dymtro kuleba said after a meeting with blinken in washington tuesday that u s and western sanctions against russia in escalating waves can work but he urged allies to be aggressive kuleba argued that putin should not have a single moment when he feels sanctions have reached a ceiling among the oligarchs and others close to putin cited for sanctions are denis bortnikov a deputy president of russian state owned vtb bank and petr fradkov chairman and ceo of psb the vtb official s father aleksandr bortnikov director of the federal security service and a permanent member of the security council of the russian federation was also cited in the sanction lists fradkov is the son of mikhail fradkov a former russian prime minister and former director of russia s foreign intelligence service sergei kiriyenko putin s first deputy chief of staff and his son vladimir kiriyenko who is the ceo of the parent company of russia s top social media platform vkontakte were also designated hopes are dwindling that a major conflict can be averted putin s directive came hours after he recognized the two ukrainian separatist regions as independent setting up russian military support and antagonizing western leaders who regard his actions as a breach of world order putin has blamed nato for the current crisis and called the u s led alliance a threat to russia the global condemnation came amid rising skirmishes in the eastern regions of ukraine that western powers believe russia could use as a pretext for an attack on the europe leaning democracy that has defied moscow s attempts to pull it back into its orbit with an estimated 150 000 russian troops massed on three sides of ukraine the u s has warned that moscow has already decided to invade

that do not define such terms exactly as the company ffo the company calculates ffo in accordance with the standards established by the national association of real estate investment trusts or nareit nareit defines ffo as net income loss calculated in accordance with gaap excluding gains or losses from sales of depreciable operating property plus real estate related depreciation depletion and amortization excluding amortization of deferred financing costs and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures management presents ffo as a supplemental performance measure because it believes that ffo is beneficial to investors as a starting point in measuring the company s operational performance specifically in excluding real estate related depreciation and amortization and gains and losses from sales of depreciable operating properties which do not relate to or are not indicative of operating performance ffo provides a performance measure that when compared year over year captures trends in occupancy rates rental rates and operating costs the company also believes that as a widely recognized measure of the performance of reits ffo will be used by investors as a basis to compare the company s operating performance with that of other reits however other equity reits may not calculate ffo in accordance with the nareit definition as the company does and accordingly the company s ffo may not be comparable to such other reits ffo affo the company calculates affo by adjusting ffo to exclude the income and expenses that the company believes are not reflective of the sustainability of the company s ongoing operating performance including but not limited to real estate related acquisition and due diligence costs stock based compensation deferred impact of interest rate swap terminations and distributions on the company s series a preferred units for the avoidance of doubt 5 7 million non cash redemption of series b participating preferred stock is not included in affo changes in gaap accounting and reporting rules that were put in effect after the establishment of nareit s definition of ffo in 1999 result in the inclusion of a number of items in ffo that do not correlate with the sustainability of the company s operating performance therefore in addition to ffo the company presents affo and affo per share fully diluted both of which are non gaap measures management considers affo a useful supplemental performance metric for investors as it is more indicative of the company s operational performance than ffo affo is not intended to represent cash flow or liquidity for the period and is only intended to provide an additional measure of the company s operating performance even affo however does not properly capture the timing of cash receipts especially in connection with full year rent payments under lease agreements entered into in connection with newly acquired farms management considers affo per share fully diluted to be a supplemental metric to gaap earnings per share affo per share fully diluted provides additional insight into how the company s operating performance could be allocated to potential shares outstanding at a specific point in time management believes that affo is a widely recognized measure of the operations of reits and presenting affo will enable investors to assess the company s performance in comparison to other reits however other reits may use different methodologies for calculating affo and affo per share fully diluted and accordingly the company s affo and affo per share fully diluted may not always be comparable to affo and affo per share amounts calculated by other reits affo and affo per share fully diluted should not be considered as an alternative to net income loss or earnings per share determined in accordance with gaap as an indication of financial performance or as an alternative to net income loss earnings per share determined in accordance with gaap as a measure of the company s liquidity nor are they indicative of funds available to fund the company s cash needs including its ability to make distributions ebitdare and adjusted ebitdare the company calculates earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization for real estate ebitdare in accordance with the standards established by nareit in its september 2017 white paper nareit defines ebitdare as net income calculated in accordance with gaap excluding interest expense income tax depreciation and amortization gains or losses on disposition of depreciated property including gains or losses on change of control impairment write downs of depreciated property and of investments in unconsolidated affiliates caused by a decrease in value of depreciated property in the affiliate and adjustments to reflect the entity s pro rata share of ebitdare of unconsolidated affiliates ebitdare is a key financial measure used to evaluate the company s operating performance but should not be construed as an alternative to operating income cash flows from operating activities or net income in each case as determined in accordance with gaap the company believes that ebitdare is a useful performance measure commonly reported and will be widely used by analysts and investors in the company s industry however while ebitdare is a performance measure widely used across the company s industry the company does not believe that it correctly captures the company s business operating performance because it includes non cash expenses and recurring adjustments that are necessary to better understand the company s business operating performance therefore in addition to ebitdare management uses adjusted ebitdare a non gaap measure the company calculates adjusted ebitdare by adjusting ebitdare for certain items such as stock based compensation and real estate related acquisition and due diligence costs that the company considers necessary to understand its operating performance the company believes that adjusted ebitdare provides useful supplemental information to investors regarding the company s ongoing operating performance that when considered with net income and ebitdare is beneficial to an investor s understanding of the company s operating performance however ebitdare and adjusted ebitdare have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of the company s results as reported under gaap in prior periods the company has presented ebitda and adjusted ebitda in accordance with nareit s recommendation beginning with the company s reported results for the three months ended march 31 2018 the company is reporting ebitdare and adjusted ebitdare in place of ebitda and adjusted ebitda net operating income noi the company calculates net operating income noi as total operating revenues rental income tenant reimbursements crop sales and other revenue less property operating expenses direct property expenses and real estate taxes since net operating income excludes general and administrative expenses interest expense depreciation and amortization acquisition related expenses other income and losses and extraordinary items it provides a performance measure that when compared year over year reflects the revenues and expenses directly associated with owning and leasing farmland real estate providing a perspective not immediately apparent from net income however net operating income should not be viewed as an alternative measure of the company s financial performance since it does not reflect general and administrative expenses interest expense depreciation and amortization costs other income and losses source farmland partners inc

russia s decision to order military forces into eastern ukraine as well as the west s swift condemnation of the move on tuesday weighed on financial markets added to inflationary pressures and pushed oil and natural gas prices higher deepening an energy crisis that has gripped europe since last year natural gas prices in asia europe and the united states ticked upward tuesday while brent crude climbed toward 100 bbl for the first time since 2014 european natural gas stocks were already poised to exit the winter heating season at historical lows analysts at barclays said in a note on tuesday prices are likely to stay high as a result they said adding that tensions in ukraine could push them higher russia provides about one third of europe s natural gas imports nearly one quarter of the 168 7 billion cubic meters russia sent to europe last year went through ukraine according to the oxford institute for energy studies the european gas benchmark title transfer facility ttf gained across the curve tuesday with the march contract adding more than 2 mmbtu to finish above 26 the west had already imposed what leaders said was a first round of sanctions on russia for its decision to order troops into the breakaway regions of donetsk and luhansk president biden late tuesday called the move a flagrant violation of international law and said the united states is blocking two large russian financial institutions and would impose sanctions on russian debt the move in natural gas prices however was somewhat muted given the risk of war armed forces moved into areas that are about 100 miles from the lines that move russia s natural gas through ukraine a major line moving russian oil to europe is more than 400 miles away russia has also diversified its natural gas transit routes in recent years and can move gas to europe via belarus the baltic sea poland and turkey if a broader conflict were to impact pipelines in ukraine the russians have an economic dependency on lucrative gas sales to europe said analysts at evercore isi led by sean morgan europe s depleted storage and heavy reliance on russian supplies mean that short of a complete ukrainian military conflagration the continent s imports of gas are unlikely to be stopped due to economic necessity for all parties involved evercore added german chancellor olaf scholz said tuesday his country would suspend certification of the nord stream 2 pipeline in response to russia s move into ukraine the system is complete and waiting for regulatory approval to move more natural gas from russia to germany it is seen as a vital link to alleviate european supply shortages russian president vladimir putin said in response to scholz s announcement that the country would continue to move pipeline gas and lng exports to international markets despite growing tensions we would not expect him to say otherwise analysts at clearview energy partners llc wrote in a note to clients tuesday if russia uses its energy weapon we still think supply curtailment is likely to be cloaked in plausible deniability e g maintenance a week ago russia said it was pulling back some troops amassed near the ukraine border

kyiv ukraine monday nights in any city even the liveliest can be quiet but on this monday evening kyiv was noticeably more subdued than usual the roads were emptier there were fewer pedestrians about and the bars and restaurants were pretty much abandoned it was as if the season finale of a popular reality tv show was being broadcast in a sense an episode of reality tv was playing but it wasn t clear if this was a finale or the opening of an especially dark new season reports from russia had been circulating from late afternoon that russia s president vladimir putin would be making a big announcement russian president vladimir putin signs a document recognizing the independence of separatist regions in eastern ukraine in the kremlin in moscow feb 21 2022 and when it came all 56 minutes of it people were left open mouthed and afraid about what it might presage they had half expected he would recognize the two breakaway republics in eastern ukraine that moscow had fashioned eight years ago in the wake of the ouster of viktor yanukovych as ukraine s president in a popular uprising that infuriated putin but the bellicosity of the speech the depth of hostility to the west as ukrainians saw it and what they say was a fanciful narrative about the history of ukraine left them reeling i was surprised but maybe it was to be expected 27 year old makeup artist aleksandra told me as i interrupted her conversation with her friend katya 36 a singer near kyiv s independence square or maidan we all started phoning each other all my friends and family and some people said his speech means a much bigger war not just in eastern ukraine she said some people talked about packing their bags and leaving but we calmed them down aleksandra and her husband have talked about what they should do if war creeps nearer we have discussed two options she told me leaving kyiv for my parents village in northwestern ukraine near poland or maybe we will stay here and be useful people will need free hands to help but she added i did think as i listened to putin how does one get a gun a man holds a poster in support of ukraine as he attends a demonstration near the russian embassy to protest against the escalation of the tension between russia and ukraine in berlin germany feb 22 2022 that thought has occurred to others and ukrainians who have guns for sport hunting or self protection have been stocking up on ammunition said andriy who works at a gun store in the affluent historic neighborhood of podil which overlooks the dnieper river his store armelit advertises itself as a hunting boutique and stocks some expensive high end weapons including vintage british double barreled shotguns of the type wielded by aristocrats on the historical tv drama downton abbey his store was low on ammunition he said and he had heard others had none and were scrambling to buy more the buying spree started several weeks ago when u s leaders started to issue ever more dire warnings about the imminence of war people are buying guns and ammunition for self protection national defense and because they worry about looting he said he reels off a list of the most popular calibers of ammunition 233 5 56 7 62 he proudly hands me an english double barreled shotgun made in 1909 and valued at 20 000 he nods approvingly when i check that the barrels are clear of cartridges a woman attends a rally to protest after moscow s decision to formally recognize two russian backed regions of eastern ukraine as independent at the industrial city of mariupol located 20k from the rebel controlled areas in eastern ukraine feb 22 2022 outside in kontraktova square two young boys clamber over a statue of a cossack the square is full of people sitting on benches and talking or reading alone i fall in with two widows both dressed in red quilt coats both silver haired we don t want war 75 year old halyna said she was born in moscow and married a russian army officer her face livens when she tells me how they traveled before settling in kyiv what happens to us doesn t matter we have lived our lives she said but the young our sons and daughters grandsons and granddaughters are who i worry about we will give them to ukraine to help the country but i worry about them then she looks me directly in the eye and says what s happening is a big state is bullying a small state russia is an elephant and we are a rabbit i have friends all over the world in russia america israel and europe i like everyone there s no need for this nearby 20 year old myroslava is reading a book she s a business student and has just got an internship in a company her reaction to putin s speech was firm yes unfortunately i saw it she said i didn t appreciate his thoughts and he was telling russians what they should think she says that ukraine has been at war for eight years and she is not afraid ukraine has a strong army and we can protect ourselves and other countries are supporting us i just have to believe that she said her parents have asked her what she intends to do will she come home they would prefer that but for now she will remain in kyiv a little girl waits along with

feels as though they are in limbo it is a crazy time she said we are certainly living in a period which will be in the history books and we are the people who are witnessing and making history each one of us separately she judges putin s speech as a declaration of war or an intention to wage a bigger war a continuation of aggression against ukraine that goes back to 2014 when russia forcibly annexed crimea and shaped the creation of what she sees as make believe republics in eastern ukraine she isn t happy with ukraine s president volodymyr zelenskyy who she says should have given his response to putin not in the early hours of the morning and on television but in parliament on the podium addressing lawmakers the representatives of the ukrainian people and not a short speech saying i have had so many calls with international leaders it would have had immense impact and meaning to the people of ukraine and could have raised morale and sent a much more powerful message to putin she added
