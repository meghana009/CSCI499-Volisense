canada is under attack as the occupation of our nation s capital by a loose alliance of anti government activists anti vaxxers and hatred tourists enters its second week it s become increasingly clear they re not going to leave without a fight and while the number of people participating in the occupation has steadily dwindled they have attracted a powerful new ally trumpworld whether it s trump himself calling justin trudeau a far left lunatic or his acolytes like marjorie taylor greene tucker carlson and jack posobiec whipping up their own frenzied followers it s clear there s an organized push underway to undermine the canadian government and invade our politics it s time for trudeau to push back yes he s recovering from covid 19 which explains his recent absence in and from ottawa but he needs to take control of this situation before it deteriorates even further he s clearly not going to get any help from the ottawa police department which has effectively surrendered the city to the freedom convoyers and it s unlikely doug ford who faces an election in a few months and the risk of a split in his vote with randy hillier s far right ontario first party is going to ride to the rescue here that leaves the federal government as the last line of defence standing between an emboldened far right fringe and our democratic institutions that fringe is only going to get bolder while the gofundme campaign that raised more than 10 million in their name has been kiboshed a new flood of cash is pouring in from sources both inside and outside our borders as my colleague sandy garossino laid out in a recent piece the volume of money at work here reeks of trumpworld fuckery any canadian fundraiser will tell you this number is impossible to achieve organically within canada this group is not a registered charity non profit or even a trucking organization ottawa police chief peter sloly is on record saying there is significant influence and money pouring in from the united states garossino says if trudeau needs some inspiration here he need only look to his father and how he handled the flq crisis in 1970 when the front de libération du québec kidnapped a british diplomat and quebec s deputy premier from their montreal homes pierre trudeau invoked the war measures act when it became clear the municipal and provincial governments couldn t respond and when reporters asked how far he was willing to go he delivered his famous response just watch me opinion as the occupation of our nation s capital by a loose alliance of anti government activists anti vaxxers and hatred tourists enters its second week it s become clear they re not going to leave without a fight writes columnist maxfawcett we have been fortunate not to see any extreme violence in ottawa yet but that doesn t mean it won t happen invoking the emergencies act the 1988 replacement for the war measures act seems unnecessary at this point but maybe it s time for trudeau to engage more directly with the protesters and show canadians the people occupying downtown ottawa aren t the ones in charge here too he can channel his father and his display of defiant courage at a 1968 st jean baptiste day celebration in montreal while many of the other assembled dignitaries and politicians ran for shelter when separatists started pelting their balcony with rocks and bottles trudeau stood his ground the message was clear i m not going anywhere and you can t intimidate me

that the transaction aligns with its long term goal to be a low cost producer that can generate positive cash flows through the various cycles of the gold market with the near completion of the mining of the tau ore body and the transition to the mining of golden eagle there is a need to restructure operations at the mupane property both operationally and financially upon review by the board it was decided that the company s resources will be better utilised by increasing production at galaxy and restarting operations at the summit mine based on the financial statements of the company as at september 30 2021 mupane represented approximately 5 of the net value of the total assets less the total liabilities of the company the transaction is structured as a sale of all of the issued and

cnn spirit and frontier airlines on monday announced a 6 6 billion merger a combination of low fare carriers that would create america s fifth largest airline the companies have yet to say what brand they ll fly under or who would lead management of the new airline the combined company would offer more than 1 000 daily flights to over 145 destinations the merged carrier would leapfrog jetblue and alaska air in the number of miles flown by paying passengers according to 2021 statistics putting them behind the four major airlines that control about 80 of the nation s air traffic american delta united and southwest airlines this transaction is centered around creating an aggressive ultra low fare competitor to serve our guests even better expand career opportunities for our team members and increase competitive pressure resulting in more consumer friendly fares for the flying public said spirit ceo ted christie there are only 519 routes currently served by both airlines out of 2 832 combined routes according to aviation analytics firm cirium that s equal to just 18 of their routes suggesting a combination will have only limited impact on reducing competition for passengers like most of the us airline industry spirit and frontier have been struggling with losses the last two years as air travel plunged during the pandemic on monday spirit reported a 2021 loss of 440 6 million excluding special items such as federal assistance that went to all us airlines that was an improvement from the 719 6 million it lost on that basis in 2020 frontier reported it lost 299 million on that basis in 2021 roughly the same as in 2020 but the two airlines combined fourth quarter revenue was down only 2 from their combined revenue in the final three months of 2019 that s much closer to pre pandemic levels than at the four major airlines much of that is due to the fact they depend primarily on leisure travelers not business passengers who have been slower to return to flying low fares low approval the combination would bring together two airlines that have very low base fares but charge passengers extra for most things including carry on bags although their passengers might like the low fares many don t like the experience of flying with them spirit had by far the highest number of passenger complaints with 13 25 complaints per 100 000 passengers according to stats from january through september 2021 kept by the us department of transportation jetblue had the second most complaints on that basis with 6 85 while frontier had the third most in the industry with 5 76 frontier had by far the worst rate of complaints in the same period of 2020 when it recorded 60 24 complaints per 100 000 customers frontier and spirit also had the industry s worst customer satisfaction ratings according to the american customer satisfaction index frontier suffered some badly timed service problems monday morning soon after it announced the planned merger a technology issue temporarily resulted in all of its flights being grounded the faa disclosed the statement from the airline said the problem was quickly fixed earlier today we experienced a technology issue which led to some flight delays and cancellations it said in a midday statement the issue was identified and has been resolved we are working to restore our flight schedule for the balance of the day regulatory hurdles whether or not the merger will be approved by federal antitrust regulators remains uncertain the biden administration has taken a much more aggressive approach on antitrust issues it recently blocked an alliance between american and jetblue that fell short of a full merger increasing competition in the airline industry is one of the issues that the biden administration has cited as a priority executives involved in the proposed spirit frontier deal say they believe the merger will bring more competition to the industry this is the type of transaction the administration should in fact support bill franke chair of frontier s board and the managing partner of indigo partners frontier s majority shareholder said in an interview monday on cnbc it s beneficial to the consumers it s beneficial to the employees it s beneficial to the communities that the airlines serve and at the end of the day even in combination these two airlines will control less than 10 of the market but experts aren t sure the regulatory approval will be as easy as the airlines hope in a normal environment we would not expect any regulatory hurdles given the relatively small market share of each airline but given the biden administration s big is bad approach we would expect some objection said savanthi syth airline analyst with raymond james the us airline industry has been greatly reshaped by mergers in the last 25 years the four largest airlines today were formed from a series of mergers of 10 airlines this would be the united states first airline merger since alaska air purchased virgin america in 2016 the 6 6 billion value of the deal includes assumed debt such as aircraft leases the value of the stock and cash being exchanged would be 2 8 billion based on friday s closing price frontier would be the purchasing airline in this deal as spirit shareholders would receive 1 9126 shares of frontier plus 2 13 in cash for each of their shares that would represent about a 20 premium based on friday s closing price but spirit shares are up only 13 in midday trading while frontier shares were little changed suggesting investor uncertainty about the deal being completed

contents turkey and ukraine ramp up defense cooperation gönül tol director of turkey program and senior fellow frontier europe initiative amid western fears that russia is about to attack ukraine turkey and ukraine signed a free trade agreement and announced a deal for ukraine to manufacture turkish armed drones during president recep tayyip erdoğan s recent visit to kyiv on feb 3 the visit is part of erdoğan s plan to deepen turkey s ties to ukraine which is not only an important export market for turkish defense products but is also central to ankara s efforts to mitigate the negative repercussions of u s sanctions on its defense industry one such area where u s sanctions have created a bottleneck for turkey s defense industry is engine technology turkey wants to develop indigenous engine technology and hopes that cooperation with ukraine which designs and manufactures engines that power dozens of types of aircraft in many countries will lead to knowledge transfer turkey s defense partnership with ukraine is a key component of erdoğan s push to create an indigenous defense industry that has helped him to project military might abroad and pitch turkey as a global power independent of the west that is why erdoğan is keen on deepening ties with ukraine despite protests from russia turkish ukrainian defense cooperation has the backing of the west which sees turkey s drone sales to ukraine as part of nato solidarity in the face of russian aggression to ukraine cooperation with turkey is a key component of its strategy to deter russia especially since nato membership remains a distant prospect until now turkey s cooperation with ukraine has not changed the balance of power with russia and ankara has managed to walk a fine between cultivating close defense ties to kyiv and protecting its interests with moscow but there might come a time when the level of defense cooperation between the two countries becomes intolerable for russia making ukraine less secure turkey more vulnerable to russian retaliation and the west more fearful of further russian aggression follow on twitter gonultol the plo central council much ado about nothing khaled elgindy senior fellow director of program on palestine and palestinian israeli affairs the palestine liberation organization s plo central council is set to conclude its proceedings later today the 124 member central council which last convened in 2018 serves as a kind of advisory board for the executive committee the plo s highest decision making body and has largely replaced the palestine national council pnc the plo s long dormant parliament in exile the session was called by mahmoud abbas who heads the palestinian authority pa and the plo simultaneously in order to address a number of external and internal political issues including the stalled diplomatic process israeli settlements expulsions and other israeli actions as well as to fill several vacancies in the plo leadership however palestinian opposition factions including the leftist popular front for the liberation of palestine pflp and the islamist group hamas along with a number of independent political figures have boycotted the meeting on both legal and political grounds although the final communique has not yet been published the outcome is already known on the diplomatic and relations with israel front the central council is not expected to break any new ground and will most likely reiterate previous statements moreover the primary aim of the meeting is to fill a number of vacancies in the plo leadership with abbas loyalists in particular hussein el sheikh the current civil affairs minister will join the executive committee as its secretary general the plo s number two spot after abbas a role previously held by the late saeb erekat el sheikh a fatah apparatchik and close confidant of abbas is well regarded in the diplomatic arena and maintains close ties with israeli american and western officials but has only a limited domestic following another abbas loyalist rouhi fatouh the former speaker of the pa s legislative council will take up the role of speaker of the pnc in addition to consolidating abbas s grip on power this elaborate piece of political theater serves two purposes it is a way to project movement in palestine s otherwise stagnant political environment as well as to enhance abbas s political legitimacy especially since his last minute decision to cancel long delayed national elections last year many also see the new plo appointments as an attempt by the aging abbas who turns 87 later this year to lay the groundwork for a succession process but from within his ever shrinking inner circle such ploys by abbas who remains intensely unpopular are unlikely to impress ordinary palestinians many of whom have come to see the plo central council and executive committee as rubber stamps moreover when a succession process does unfold it is unlikely to go according to abbas s wishes follow on twitter elgindy_ gulf oil exporters look to strengthen their fiscal positions karen e young senior fellow and director of program on economics and energy efforts to secure alternate sources of government revenue away from oil exports are accelerating in the gulf this is especially interesting given that oil prices are over 90 barrel this week we see the announcement from the uae of a federal corporate tax roll out and talks of an additional offering of shares from saudi aramco this time perhaps on the london stock exchange both of these efforts one an official government policy and the other more speculation represent a determined shift in economic policy that is focused on strengthening fiscal positions without new parallel spending allocations for the uae there are still some questions regarding how the new tax will affect companies based in the country but also operating abroad the government announced a corporate income tax at the rate of 9 for businesses starting june 1 2023 the tax would apply on net profits for businesses on income greater than aed 375 000 102 000 those companies operating and paying corporate tax abroad may receive credit for those group taxes paid abroad but may also be liable for their uae operation s profits these questions will be important for uae firms in banking and retail with a regional presence but the overall shift is a new source of federal revenue collected by the central government in abu dhabi and then distributed among the emirates as part of the federal budget more cohesion within federal economic policymaking has been a trend since the uae has only recently begun issuing debt at the federal level the corporate tax comes on the back of the 5 value added tax vat on goods and services sold in the country implemented in january 2018 taxes in the gulf cooperation council are now the norm with little public resistance and we have even seen increases in the vat in both bahrain and saudi arabia after first announcing a 5 levy for saudi arabia aramco continues to be the primary source of government revenue either by its product exports or in the value of the firm itself as a mechanism to borrow against or as an asset to divide and sell as an equity right now oil prices are high and the firm s valuation will look appealing the due diligence process of both the first initial public offering and a series of debt issuances will make a second share offering a bit easier and perhaps more attractive on a larger international exchange the takeaway is that the oil exporters of the gulf see opportunity in their assets at home whether the income of citizens or businesses or in the sale of their government assets and the ability to rebuild nest eggs of reserves and government coffers is strong now for a future that looks less certain in the energy transition follow on twitter professorkaren israel and bahrain sign historic defense agreement kevin donegan distinguished senior fellow on national security israeli defense minister benny gantz and bahraini minister of defense affairs abdullah bin hassan al nuaimi signed a historic memorandum of understanding in bahrain last week officially establishing security ties between the two middle eastern countries the agreement establishes a security framework that formalizes defense relations for increased cooperation in intelligence sharing defense industry collaboration and military to military training after signing the agreement the israeli and bahrain defense minister jointly visited u s 5th fleet commander vice admiral bradley cooper at his bahrain based headquarters for a trilateral meeting followed by a tour of the uss cole clearly signaling iran the signing of this agreement in bahrain less than 180 miles from iran s bushehr nuclear plant occurred just days after the iranian backed houthis conducted their fourth drone or ballistic missile attack on the uae in the past few weeks although the uae was not part of this agreement only one year ago bahrain and the uae normalized relations with israel with the signing of the abraham accords and just last week isaac herzog made the first ever visit of an israeli president to the uae additionally israel bahrain and the uae are participating in a 60 nation u s led middle east naval exercise that for the first time publicly includes saudi arabia and oman one certainty is that iran s malign activity in the region is seen by the gulf nations and israel as a direct threat and together with the abraham accords is serving as a catalyst for the accelerated middle east defense cooperation we are now seeing regardless of the outcome of the nuclear talks with iran we can expect more defense cooperation between the gulf nations and israel that could include such things as shared early warning and the sale of israeli missile and drone defense technology to the uae the only question that now remains is how much of a leadership role the u s will have in helping to achieve the shared middle east regional defense cooperation we have long desired photo by celestino arce nurphoto via getty images

listen to this article listen to this article frontier airlines and spirit airlines are proposing to combine in a 2 9 billion deal that would create a larger discount airline to compete against the nation s dominant carriers and they say promote lower fares both are ultra low cost carriers that tempt travelers with rock bottom prices for no frills service but often generate more than their share of consumer complaints the deal is likely to get a close examination from antitrust regulators in the biden administration which has signaled a tougher line against big corporate mergers consumer advocates criticized the obama administration for allowing a string of major airline mergers that greatly consolidated power in the industry however the frontier spirit combination would rank only fifth among u s airlines in passenger carrying capacity and seventh in revenue frontier and spirit are pitching their merger as a counterbalance to american delta united and southwest which together control about 80 of the u s air travel market the biden administration has made it very clear over the last year that they would like to promote competition in the airline space and this is really an answer to returning balance from a competitive perspective to the big four frontier ceo barry biffle said in an interview savanthi syth an airline analyst for raymond james associates said that because of the relatively small size of frontier and spirit she wouldn t expect antitrust issues in a normal environment but given the biden administration s big is bad approach we would expect some objection the biden administration sued last september to block a partnership between american airlines and jetblue in the northeast saying it would reduce competition and drive up prices the case is pending airlines are struggling to recover as the pandemic stretches into a third year frontier and spirit both reported monday that they suffered fourth quarter losses 87 2 million for spirit 53 million for frontier both also posted full year losses for 2021 the airlines claim that if they are allowed to merge it will create many new routes that aren t currently served by ultra low cost carriers resulting in 1 billion a year in savings for consumers they also say the combined company will grow and create 10 000 new jobs by 2026 ultra low cost airlines have shaken the airline industry in recent years using their lower cost structure including less senior workers to take customers away from entrenched carriers and lure people who balk at paying major airline fares frontier and spirit say their costs are up to 40 lower on a per mile basis which will discourage bigger airlines from matching their prices the budget airlines however lack advantages of the giant carriers they don t fly long international routes they have smaller frequent flyer programs and they tend to operate fewer flights per route which leaves fewer options to rebook passengers if a flight is canceled or delayed frontier and spirit frequently have among the highest complaint rates in the industry they ranked last and next to last in the latest monthly figures from the transportation department many of those complaints are for canceled or delayed flights the airlines say that by combining they will create a more reliable airline with fewer flight disruptions while the airlines were saying that the federal aviation administration ordered the grounding of all frontier flights nationwide because of automation issues by midday frontier had canceled more than 110 flights or more than 20 of its schedule and delayed a similar number frontier spokeswoman jennifer de la cruz said the problem was a technology related issue that was fixed she said the airline was working to restore its flight schedule for the rest of the day between them frontier and spirit have about 280 planes and more than 350 on order spirit ceo ted christie said the combined airline would add new routes across the united states and in latin america and the caribbean the airlines did not announce the combined company s name its ceo or the location of its headquarters frontier chairman bill franke who heads a committee that will make those decisions and serve as chairman of the new company said there is no reason to announce such things until it is clear that the merger will go through right now we need to have regulatory oversight regulatory support for the transaction that could take a matter of months said franke who was once spirit s chairman and whose indigo partners investment firm is now frontier s biggest shareholder according to the deal announcement frontier shareholders will own 51 5 of the new company spirit shareholders will get 1 9126 shares of frontier plus 2 13 in cash for each of their spirit shares which values spirit at 25 83 per share based on frontier s closing stock price of 12 39 on friday the companies expect to close the transaction in the second half of the year it still needs approval from spirit shareholders in trading monday shares of miramar florida based spirit rose 17 2 to close at 25 46 and denver based frontier gained 3 5 david koenig and michelle chapman report for the associated press

spotify ceo daniel ek told employees on sunday that he was disappointed in joe rogan but has no intention of silencing the controversial podcaster in the wake of celebrity boycotts and an alarming stock plunge the streaming giant lost 2 billion in market value in the final days of january after hundreds of doctors accused rogan of promoting covid 19 misinformation on his show the joe rogan experience and superstars neil young and joni mitchell asked for their music to be taken off the platform in 2020 rogan signed a 100 million deal giving spotify exclusive rights to his show over the weekend a video compilation of rogan repeatedly using racial slurs was posted online renewing artists calls to deletespotify spotify has since removed more than 70 episodes rogan has issued an apology and spotify s stock has jumped back up these events have prompted a lively discussion about if and how content on streaming platforms should be moderated going forward cu boulder today spoke with kristelia garcía an associate professor with colorado law who spent nearly a decade working in the music industry in los angeles at napster myspace music and universal music group about this new frontier in content moderation why is spotify such a big deal spotify is arguably a big deal both for music fans and for the music industry it was already a big deal in sweden and europe before it came here around 2008 and began to pick up steam spotify was different from other technological innovations that caused piracy problems in that its whole shtick was they solved piracy problems but from the music industry perspective the problem quickly became you don t pay us much you don t pay us what we re used to making when we sell a cd in that way the music industry and artists have a bit of a love hate relationship with spotify because it s given them this amazing reach and a way to connect with fans and consumers but it has also become a bit of a bottleneck what s the issue in this situation first and foremost this is a content moderation problem people who are immersed in that have been chomping at the bit for years saying facebook needs to be moderated twitter needs to be moderated this is the first time we see that call move from platforms traditionally known as social media to a content delivery platform like spotify and now all of a sudden it s faced with content moderation which we had not thought a music streaming platform before would be faced with but this is different because they re streaming podcasts which it turns out are super profitable what is spotify responsible for part of what makes this whole thing so interesting is we don t know what spotify s responsibilities are content moderation is a bit of a new field music streaming platforms are not companies that we ve applied any sort of rules or regulations to in clear language yet this is new territory what can be done about misinformation on streaming services the challenge with misinformation as a general concept whether it s joe rogan and the vaccine or anything else is that unless it s hate speech it s protected by the first amendment you and i might not just disagree with it we might be able to scientifically show that it s false but all we can do is counter bad speech with good speech spotify said they will be more transparent and when people go to the podcast they will have a little link they can click to get better information and that is better than nothing but it is certainly content moderation lite what might this mean for the future of streaming services i suspect that going forward however this shakes out we ll get some regulatory attention on this because of everything that s happening and the contracts might start to reflect that like you can talk about whatever you want on your show unless and until you talk about something we don t like maybe the contracts will begin to have clauses in them that allow spotify to cancel a show with penalties does any of this threaten freedom of speech free speech restricts the government s ability to control what you say it does not restrict private individuals ability to restrict what you say or prohibit private entities and corporations from controlling what you say or prohibiting you from saying certain things private restriction of speech is not a first amendment issue even if spotify wanted to have joe rogan sign a contract that says you will give us all of your episodes in advance and we reserve pre approval rights they could do that that would not be a first amendment problem it would only be a first amendment issue if government regulators told spotify you can t host people who dispel misinformation what about rogan s use of racial slurs in the case of racial slurs on the other hand legislators could prohibit the dissemination of hate speech by spotify and other private platforms without running afoul of free speech concerns recent revelations about rogan s affinity for racial slurs might also pave the way for spotify to push for an amendment to any existing contract with the podcaster that would tighten their control over the content of his podcasts because all other podcast hosting platforms would be held to the same prohibition on hate speech spotify wouldn t have to worry so much about rogan simply hopping to a competitor where he d face the same restriction does muscians boycotting spotify make a difference neil young wants to pull his music and then we hear of other artists saying i would like to take my music off but i can t that to me as a copyright scholar is the interesting part content owners and content creators are not the same party artists can want to do something with their music or not do something with their music but they don t get to decide in most cases the record labels get to decide if you re neil young you can do that sort of thing but if you re not neil young then you ve got to do whatever warner or sony or universal tells you that they re going to do with your music i don t think we re going to see mass exodus of artists from spotify because that isn t how copyright works if we were to see that it would be because the labels decided to do it but that seems unlikely to me at this point what about subscribers canceling their accounts it depends i think it could but it will only make a difference to spotify which is a company that s running a balance sheet if the number of subscribers who drop off because joni mitchell and neil young aren t there anymore exceeds the number of subscribers who are there to hear joe rogan to my understanding that s not the case as much as i love joni mitchell and neil young from a pr perspective doesn t look good but the bigger picture is that rogan is just one person there will be other rogans and what are they going to do about that

frontier airlines and spirit airlines are proposing to combine in a us 2 9 billion deal that would create a larger discount airline to compete against the nation s dominant carriers and they say promote lower fares both are ultra low cost carriers that tempt travelers with rock bottom prices for no frills service but often generate more than their share of consumer complaints the deal is likely to get a close examination from antitrust regulators in the biden administration which has signaled a tougher line against big corporate mergers consumer advocates criticized the obama administration for allowing a string of major airline mergers that greatly consolidated power in the industry however the frontier spirit combination would rank only fifth among u s airlines in passenger carrying capacity and seventh in revenue frontier and spirit are pitching their merger as a counterbalance to american delta united and southwest which together control about 80 of the u s air travel market the biden administration has made it very clear over the last year that they would like to promote competition in the airline space and this is really an answer to returning balance from a competitive perspective to the big four frontier ceo barry biffle said in an interview savanthi syth an airline analyst for raymond james associates said that because of the relatively small size of frontier and spirit she wouldn t expect antitrust issues in a normal environment but given the biden administration s big is bad approach we would expect some objection airlines are struggling to recover as the pandemic stretches into a third year frontier and spirit both reported monday that they suffered fourth quarter losses 87 2 million for spirit 53 million for frontier both also posted full year losses for 2021 the airlines claim that if they are allowed to merge it will create many new routes that aren t currently served by ultra low cost carriers resulting in 1 billion a year in savings for consumers they also say the combined company will grow and create 10 000 new jobs by 2026 ultra low cost airlines have shaken the airline industry in recent years using their lower cost structure including less senior workers to take customers away from entrenched carriers and lure people who balk at paying major airline fares frontier and spirit say their costs are up to 40 lower on a per mile basis which will discourage bigger airlines from matching their prices the budget airlines however lack advantages of the giant carriers they don t fly long international routes they have smaller frequent flyer programs and they tend to operate fewer flights per route which leaves fewer options to rebook passengers if a flight is canceled or delayed frontier and spirit frequently have among the highest complaint rates in the industry they ranked last and next to last in the latest monthly figures from the transportation department many of those complaints are for canceled or delayed flights the airlines say that by combining they will create a more reliable airline with fewer flight disruptions while the airlines were saying that the federal aviation administration ordered the grounding of all frontier flights nationwide because of automation issues by midday frontier had canceled more than 110 flights or more than 20 of its schedule and delayed a similar number frontier spokeswoman jennifer de la cruz said the problem was a technology related issue that was fixed she said the airline was working to restore its flight schedule for the rest of the day the airlines did not announce the combined company s name its ceo or the location of its headquarters frontier chairman bill franke who heads a committee that will make those decisions and serve as chairman of the new company said there is no reason to announce such things until it is clear that the merger will go through right now we need to have regulatory oversight regulatory support for the transaction that could take a matter of months said franke who was once spirit s chairman and whose indigo partners investment firm is now frontier s biggest shareholder according to the deal announcement frontier shareholders will own 51 5 of the new company spirit shareholders will get 1 9126 shares of frontier plus 2 13 in cash for each of their spirit shares which values spirit at 25 83 per share based on frontier s closing stock price of 12 39 on friday in afternoon trading monday shares of miramar florida based spirit rose nearly 17 to 25 40 denver based frontier gained 3 and the nation s other leading budget airline allegiant was little changed the transaction is expected to close in the second half of the year it still needs approval from spirit shareholders
enjoy complimentary access to top ideas and insights selected by our editors claire g cohen 87 one of the first women professionals in the municipal bond industry whose career in public finance spanned over 49 years died at home on feb 3 she was a pioneer in many ways never shy to express an opinion which was always thoughtful and without rancor said hy grossman who began working with cohen when he was a junior analyst at dun bradstreet a former chairman of the municipal analyst group of new york and member of the national federation of municipal analysts cohen was known to have trained and influenced scores of analysts in the foundational credit approaches she was instrumental in developing during her years at both moody s investors service and fitch ratings she probably had as large an impact on the development of municipal credit analysis as anyone and trained countless analysts including me who were just entering the business bill oliver an independent consultant and retired media liaison for nfma who knew cohen while working for 20 years at alliance bernstein her colleagues at magny said she had a lasting impact in the municipal bond analysis industry a generalist cohen was especially renowned for her work on state credits and was highly respected throughout the municipal bond industry and among state and local government finance professionals according to a magny press release central to her analytical approach was distinguishing and emphasizing structural and longer term credit risks and protections from shorter term factors and temporal issues according to the release throughout her long career she was hands on prolific in her writings and public speaking engagements and actively participated in many industry organizations the release said claire was outspoken and projected an energetic and profound presence in any setting whether a rating committee an issuer meeting or an industry event it continued her career in the municipal industry was long and meaningful according to colleagues this is quite a shock george friedlander chief executive officer and municipal market and policy and credit strategist at george friedlander and associates to me claire was always much more youthful in her mind than in her chronological years said friedlander whose municipal strategist career spans over 40 years her muni knowledge base and presentation skills were world class if you presented her with a hypothetical topic she could turn it into a full blown analysis in a matter of days a graduate of radcliffe college she began her career at dun bradstreet and later moody s after the two firms merged in 1961 we worked together until i joined s p in 1963 but stayed in touch as colleagues in the industry grossman recalled she served in many roles at moody s including as rating committee member and chair until her departure in 1989 when she seized the chance to create something new at fitch which had been recently purchased by russell fraser she lent the start up agency instant credibility at a time when critics accused rating agencies of being too institutional and of lacking integrity and service those who knew her said she joined the newly restructured fitch as vice chairman where she worked to establish the rating agency as a viable competitor to moody s and standard and poor s magny said claire was already a living legend when she came to fitch in 1989 and i had the great fortune to join at that time and work and get close to her over the ensuing years rich raphael now president of verify financial and former managing director and head of u s public finance at fitch soon after joining fitch cohen was recognized by new york magazine as among the 100 smartest new yorkers for her ability to see the flesh and blood community beyond the spreadsheet in addition to winning industry awards including the first team all star municipal analysts team she provided the intellectual discipline to rectify opposing credit philosophies be more responsive to the market and create what was widely regarded then as the most incisive credit reports raphael who succeeded cohen at fitch when she retired in 2004 recalled absolutely no one could keep up with her then or in the years that followed he added despite retiring she continued with the firm for two years as a part time consultant in 2007 she joined public resources advisory group as a part time senior counselor where she worked until her retirement in 2016 in addition to magny and nfma she was also a member of the society of municipal analysts served as a government accounting standards advisory council member and was an educational resource to the national association of state treasurers which presented her with its corporate affiliate award for her contributions her research and analysis of municipal indebtedness from legal statutory and institutional frameworks to debt affordability analysis were recognized by the organization and the municipal bond community at large other industry awards included career achievement awards from the nfma and the municipal forum of new york as she was recognized for her legendary analytical prowess and quest to broaden and deepen her knowledge she was also honored with a trailblazing women in public finance award in 2013 at the bond buyer s deal of the year awards claire was a dynamo in the public finance industry said freda johnson she was well respected for her intelligence and hard work she dedicated her long business career to state and local government finance for those who did not have the good fortune to know or work with claire her knowledge base was vast filled from her deep experience and a prodigious memory the magny release said she was incisive in her analysis and questions as anyone who participated in a rating committee with her would know she would challenge people but in doing so raise standards those close to her knew that there was a lot of compassion underneath the release continued she did not embrace technology however armed with a typewriter or keyboard and data derived from a calculator powered by her enormous intelligence claire would hammer out a full credit report in one sitting a lost art to most these days she stayed informed and current until the end the release added she was one of a kind and we will miss her her legacy will live on for many decades to come in the municipal industry according to her former colleagues she affected so many people in our industry and through her long career helped shape much of the credit approaches that will continue to ripple through our industry for some time to come raphael her longtime colleague at fitch added she is survived by her son jim a sister jean smith one niece and one nephew a memorial service is being planned in new york city
the roads in and around goshen indiana bustle with activity as semi tractors rvs and the occasional buggy go about their daily activities busy at mid day but the thoroughfares get especially crowded around 5 a m when trucks pull out from the docks at genesis products facilities for genesis supplier of laminated panels wood components and custom molded solutions to oems across myriad industries that time of day is considered rush hour founded in 2002 with a single lamination line genesis has grown into one of the leading laminate panel and component suppliers in the united states filling those trucks are goods produced at the four genesis plants in goshen and three plants in elkhart ind only a few miles away overall the company has 9 plants with more than 1 million square feet of production assembly warehousing space across the midwest and east coast it employs 1 200 people those numbers impressive as they might be will grow even greater when plant 10 comes online in goshen later in 2022 plant 11 is already under consideration the facilities seem to be around every street corner and once inside these factories which measure more than 100 000 square feet a retrofitted golf cart is the preferred mode of transportation for visitors traversing the cell based facilities the guided tour announces each cell lamination line solid surfacing vacuum press each cell is a hive of worker activity and filled with towers of wood based raw materials such as mdf particleboard plywood and more as well as the adhesive spray booths edgebanders cnc machines molders essentially any raw material hardware tool or technology that is needed to produce that particular product this year the company is celebrating 20 years in business its growth can be charted in numbers of plants and products as well as its ranking in the fdmc s list of top 300 companies in the industry last year it ranked 38 in fdmc ranking with 218 million in sales and this year hit it climbed to 34 with 346 million in sales two decades of progress jon wenger company president ceo and co founder founded in 2002 with a single lamination line the company s initial focus was to create better solutions for oems of rvs this made sense as genesis is situated in the heart of rv country in fact more than 80 percent of the nation s rvs are produced in this area of northern indiana according to the rv industry association jon wenger company president ceo and co founder of genesis worked as a manager in one of those rv companies in 2000 when he met john helmuth helmuth had previously run a panel lamination facility and the two men spent many conversations discussing laminated panels and the opportunities that they held a meeting with a salesperson serving the rv industry found that some companies were unhappy with their panel suppliers thus an idea began to form we felt we had the knowledge to address some of the complaints the rv customers were having with their panel suppliers said wenger so we found a piece of equipment we found a building we found an interested customer and suppliers willing to work with us the pieces kept coming together and by 2002 the company idea became a reality since then genesis kept adding on product lines and options technological capabilities oem markets the company has moved from a focus on the rv oem to a slew of industries including cabinets and storage furniture healthcare office and education manufactured housing building materials marine transportation to serve these oems the number of options available to them kept growing laminated surfaces and substrates expanded panel processing capabilities became far ranging with cnc expansion presses vacuum and membrane were installed door types grew in construction types ranging from traditional 5 piece to trendy curved euro door styles to increase capacity genesis products has added numerous new technologies including cnc and lamination equipment our customers and their needs are constantly changing and so we re constantly changing said wenger we don t just have one set of products that we can set up a plan to produce we have lots of high volumes we have a lot of skus at the end of the day what we are is a high volume custom job shop to meet these varied production demands the company has expanded outwardly with new facilities and also internally with technology investments design and engineering teams and a soon to be established dedicated product development department despite operating nine facilities capacity is pretty much maxed out at the moment until we get the new plant up and running said wenger most of the equipment we are adding is to increase capacity the company s current roster of equipment is quite impressive the company started with holz her equipment and other the years has added multiple homag edgebanders schelling panel saws c r onsrud cncs wemhoner membrane presses harlan lamination machines 22 profile wrappers with numerous stock door profiles seven thermofoil presses glue options including pur eva and pva to name a few and assuming the roster list is updated growing lamination capacity a door is assembled at one of the company s many production assembly and warehouse facilities as a laminated panel focused company the company had at one count 11 hot and cold lamination lines they have expanded lamination capabilities throughout the network including at its ft wayne ind plant 7 which had been more kitchen cabinet oriented and at plant 4 in keysville virginia which had previously focused more on solid drawer components the current lamination lines can produce pretty much any component said scott flom genesis industrial sales and marketing manager still the company felt it could serve its high volume customers even better this is evident with the recent installation of a new u shaped lamination cell in plant 8 the line is one of the fastest laminators available and it s the only one in the united states said flom while not sharing certain key descriptors the laminator has many features it can do double sided lamination and can be autoloaded from the back it can run as a hot or cold press and can use different glue types specific to the application panels can be trimmed vertically and turned automatically for horizontal trimming panels can be customized such as flipping them face to face or adhering labels and barcodes so that the panels are ready for sale once they reach the customer each panel goes through an in situ quality check using sensors if the sensors see a wrinkle it ll kick out the panel but volume is its biggest attribute flom declined to give specific figures but for some of its biggest customers such as large home improvement stores the company will run thousands and thousands of panels banding the sides stacks of raw material wait to be processed into components as sales grew the need for edgebanding grew too wenger said that edgebanding is a big growth area especially in banding cabinet doors in its vast variety of styles and colors to meet increased demand the company invested in homag edgebanders and now has eight in its arsenal one of the challenges the edgebanding cells faced is the diversity of options offered i bet every machine might do 20 setups a day because of the part diversity said wenger an order might be 100 different sizes of product and then they re going to run three or four different colors in a day so every machine is going to have that type of setup dynamic when the company looked to expand its edgeband capabilities it looked for ways to more quickly change out colors and band types that is a strength of the homags most of the machines have six banding options and changeovers are achieved through a touch of the button change setups are relatively automated as far as the plcs are concerned he said you are not in the machine making changes growing acceptance laminate acceptance is growing and with an eye toward the multi family residential markets the company is marketing a fully assemble solid door there is a growing acceptance of laminates across the consumer base he said there s an opportunity to take this type of door into multifamily residential applications manufacturing these products is an example of how the company uses technology and labor that best suits the job in one small flexible cell workers assemble multi component doors producing as many as 30 different style doors in a day with each door made up of 10 to 100 parts wenger said they do so with simpler technology and processes that work laminated panels are cut to size and rails are cut molded and wrapped and all components are delivered to the cell to be assembled using simple tools such as pneumatic drills and drivers the showroom at genesis product s headquarters in goshen indiana next year the company might automate this cell with robotic technology but not at the moment at some point we ll get to a point where we re fixing things that aren t broken but this process is not broken said wenger we re getting the output we need at the cost we need and the customer is happy making customers happy is also a focus when it comes to new materials while laminates are its core business the company has not stood still on this front its weliformed division for instance uses high content recycled post consumer plastics and custom composite materials to form sturdy and mold resistant products its premium rock product digitally imprints a textured image onto the stone to capture detailed patterns and dimensions the company also offers solid surface countertops as the newest addition to its line that included thermoformed and lightweight countertops the company also offers non woven composite panels for privacy panels and acoustic damping we re expanding our material skill sets said wenger we want to be known as much of a materials company as we are a manufacturing company continuing growth genesis product s plant 10 under construction in goshen despite its growth wenger said there are still more opportunities out there especially as oems grow more comfortable with buying components and outsourcing services such as the company s supply chain management and custom product development options we re focused on being a great supplier to oems so they can differentiate themselves and we can be part of their story as a resource for them to improve their product lines with this in mind the town of goshen and surrounding communities may want to upgrade its roadways for the early morning traffic bottleneck as genesis haulers begin their early morning runs

frontier airlines and spirit airlines are proposing to combine in a 2 9 billion deal that would create a larger discount airline to compete against the nation s dominant carriers and they say promote lower fares both are ultra low cost carriers that tempt travelers with rock bottom prices for no frills service but often generate more than their share of consumer complaints the deal is likely to get a close examination from antitrust regulators in the biden administration which has signaled a tougher line against big corporate mergers consumer advocates criticized the obama administration for allowing a string of major airline mergers that greatly consolidated power in the industry however the frontier spirit combination would rank only fifth among u s airlines in passenger carrying capacity and seventh in revenue frontier and spirit are pitching their merger as a counterbalance to american delta united and southwest which together control about 80 of the u s air travel market â the biden administration has made it very clear over the last year that they would like to promote competition in the airline space and this is really an answer to returning balance from a competitive perspective to the big four frontier ceo barry biffle said in an interview savanthi syth an airline analyst for raymond james associates said that because of the relatively small size of frontier and spirit she wouldn t expect antitrust issues â in a normal environment but given the biden administrationâ s â big is badâ approach we would expect some objection â the biden administration sued last september to block a partnership between american airlines and jetblue in the northeast saying it would reduce competition and drive up prices the case is pending in antitrust circles airlines are â certainly an industry where there is a perception that a bunch of mergers got through that maybe should not have â said daniel crane a university of michigan law professor and antitrust expert with the justice department already challenging the american jetblue deal â there is a real focus on being more aggressive on mergers â he said airlines are struggling to recover as the pandemic stretches into a third year frontier and spirit both reported monday that they suffered fourth quarter losses â 87 2 million for spirit 53 million for frontier both also posted full year losses for 2021 the airlines claim that if they are allowed to merge it will create many new routes that arenâ t currently served by ultra low cost carriers resulting in 1 billion a year in savings for consumers they also say the combined company will grow and create 10 000 new jobs by 2026 ultra low cost airlines have shaken the airline industry in recent years using their lower cost structure â including less senior workers â to take customers away from entrenched carriers and lure people who balk at paying major airline fares frontier and spirit say their costs are up to 40 lower on a per mile basis which will discourage bigger airlines from matching their prices the budget airlines however lack advantages of the giant carriers they don t fly long international routes they have smaller frequent flyer programs and they tend to operate fewer flights per route which leaves fewer options to rebook passengers if a flight is canceled or delayed frontier and spirit frequently have among the highest complaint rates in the industry â they ranked last and next to last in the latest monthly figures from the transportation department many of those complaints are for canceled or delayed flights the airlines say that by combining they will create a more reliable airline with fewer flight disruptions while the airlines were saying that the federal aviation administration ordered the grounding of all frontier flights nationwide because of â automation issues â by midday frontier had canceled more than 110 flights or more than 20 of its schedule and delayed a similar number frontier spokeswoman jennifer de la cruz said the problem was a technology related issue that was fixed she said the airline was working to restore its flight schedule for the rest of the day between them frontier and spirit have about 280 planes and more than 350 on order spirit ceo ted christie said the combined airline would add new routes across the united states and in latin america and the caribbean the airlines did not announce the combined companyâ s name its ceo or the location of its headquarters frontier chairman bill franke who heads a committee that will make those decisions and serve as chairman of the new company said there is no reason to announce such things until it is clear that the merger will go through â right now we need to have regulatory oversight regulatory support for the transaction that could take a matter of months â said franke who was once spirit s chairman and whose indigo partners investment firm is now frontier s biggest shareholder according to the deal announcement frontier shareholders will own 51 5 of the new company spirit shareholders will get 1 9126 shares of frontier plus 2 13 in cash for each of their spirit shares which values spirit at 25 83 per share based on frontierâ s closing stock price of 12 39 on friday the companies expect to close the transaction in the second half of the year it still needs approval from spirit shareholders in trading monday shares of miramar florida based spirit rose 17 2 to close at 25 46 and denver based frontier gained 3 5 copyright 2022 the associated press all rights reserved this material may not

metrics for both periods was primarily attributable to increased rental rates and decreased operating expenses particularly real estate taxes as well as the expiration of abatements at certain properties these increases were partially offset by an approximately 1 overall reduction in portfolio occupancy during 2021 due to slower new tenant touring and leasing activity in 2020 as a result of

example video title will go here for this video example video title will go here for this video there is currently no guidance in the united states on a fourth dose atlanta as covid 19 remains a concern in georgia many are wondering if a fourth dose of the vaccine will keep you and your family safe would a fourth dose offer even more protection and is it legal to get one before it is approved our verify team asked the experts the question is it medically safe to get a fourth dose of the covid 19 vaccine is it legal to receive a fourth dose before it s approved our sources the answer more research is needed to know if the shot is medically safe right now meanwhile it is legal for you to get it but you won t have an easy time finding a provider to give it to you what we found right now israel is giving out a fourth dose of the covid vaccine to adults age 60 and up early studies from the country s sheba medical center find the fourth shot or 2nd booster to be highly effective according to the reports the extra dose tripled people s resistance to getting seriously sick researchers there said the boost in antibodies was high but not enough to prevent you from catching omicron however there is currently no guidance in the united states on a fourth dose dr carlos del rio an infectious disease expert with emory university said you don t need one yet i am not convinced a fourth dose is needed at this point he explained at the end of the day what we need to get is more people vaccinated globally a new study from the cdc found a third dose of the covid vaccine was 90 effective at keeping you out of the hospital with the omicron variant yet dr del rio also warned there could be risks with getting another booster so soon there s some data that the more you boost you may be actually decreasing your immunity against the virus he said so it may actually be working in a counterproductive way at some point in time while more research is needed dr del rio said he predicts a different type of booster shot might be best i think a fourth shot with a different vaccine more directed to viruses that are currently circulating would actually be needed he said as for the legalities of getting a fourth dose that s a different story legal analyst page pate said there is no law that prohibits you from getting an additional dose you won t break the law by getting an additional booster shot he said but at the same time you re not going to find it widely available from health departments your primary doctor or anyone else until the cdc makes that recommendation previously cdc leaders warned that if health care providers give out shots before they are approved they may not be legally protected if something goes wrong with the vaccination the only way you could get in trouble for getting an extra dose pate said is if you lie about your vaccine card

by aline jaeckel quentin hanich harriet harden davies judith van leeuwen holly niner katherine l seto and michelle voyer seabed mining in the pacific can affect fisheries and the flow on social equity issues need to be addressed what is currently hundreds of metres down below the ocean floor could soon be found in our electronics and on construction sites the desire to explore the deep ocean for minerals such as copper cobalt and manganese is not new but only now are companies pushing for commercial scale mining the regulatory body for deep sea mining the seabed authority isa is under pressure to finalise international regulations by mid 2023 after the pacific island nation of nauru pulled a so called two year trigger last year the trigger means it intends to submit a mining plan and the isa must have the necessary regulations in place to assess it by the time frame numerous issues must still be addressed before mining can get the green light seabed mining will likely create noise heavy metal contamination and large sediment plumes which can cause significant risks not only to seafloor ecosystems but also mid water ecosystems including fish stocks many pacific island countries and other developing states where most seabed mineral explorations are underway are dependent on fisheries for government revenue nutrition and livelihoods photo 360info food security is a particularly pressing issue for many fish dependent low income countries where tuna is essential for the nutritional needs of local people the pacific region holds the world s largest tuna fishery and any decrease in tuna stocks can have deleterious effects on the health economies and livelihoods of ocean dependent communities tuna accounts for an average of 37 percent of gdp for tuna dependent small pacific island states and as high as 84 percent for some seabed mining can potentially put these economies at risk tuna stocks are already threatened by climate change and scientific models predict a significant decline in fish catch for 10 tuna dependent pacific island countries a decline in fish stock could lead to insecure food supply decreasing revenue from fishing licences a loss of employment in fishing and fish processing and community tension the un convention on the law of the sea unclos legally classifies minerals on the international seabed as the common heritage of humankind meaning they should be managed for the benefit of all but this definition raises questions on equity who shoulders the burden and who will reap the benefits of resource extraction remains unclear a portion of economic benefits from seabed mining must also be shared with the international community under the unclos but how much and for what purposes are yet to be defined the isa regulates all seabed mining on the international seabed referred to as the area and state sponsorship is required to obtain a mining contract states may receive royalties and financial benefits from mining operators in return for acting as a sponsor but social and economic risks are unlikely to be offset by potential benefits to local communities deep seabed mining relies on high technology and robotics to conduct much of its operations and does not foster a local workforce that provides alternative employment as a new industry the technology used to mine remains unproven at scale and significant environmental concerns persist photo willyam nauru tonga and kiribati currently sponsor an exploration contract for the metals company based in canada previously known as deepgreen the company has links to the now insolvent nautilus minerals which sought to mine seabed minerals in waters off papua new guinea the endeavour failed leaving papua new guinea us 120 million in debt while mining arrangements between small island developing states and a mining company from the global north may create some benefits for those involved it can also undermine the collective interests of developing states the relationship can create legal and financial risks if serious environmental harm occurs for example sponsoring states can be held liable under international law for the damages as nauru stated over a decade ago these liabilities or costs could in some circumstances far exceed the financial capacities of nauru as well as those of many other developing states unlike terrestrial mining in which a state generally only risks losing that which it already has for example its natural environment if a developing state can be held liable for activities in the area the state may potentially face losing more than it actually has seabed mining is a long way from obtaining a social license to operate with major brands rejecting minerals taken from the ocean floor due to environmental concerns as the clock ticks down until 2023 we may see increasing pressure on industry and governments to rule out using minerals sourced from the oceans a social license will depend not only on environmental factors but also on social ones social equity should be considered by states when making policy decisions about seabed mining by mining companies in their social impact statement and by the isa when assessing mining plans transparent engagement with fish dependent communities and industries can help to avoid conflict states and the isa will need to ensure social and

jasper in accesswire february 7 2022 svb t corporation otcqx svbt parent company of springs valley bank trust company today announced 2021 fourth quarter unaudited earnings of 1 22 million or 2 20 earnings per share eps an 8 71 decrease over the same prior year period earnings on a per share basis this fourth quarter 2021 performance translates to a return on average assets roaa of 0 98 compared to the same prior year period of 1 10 net interest income before provision expense for the fourth quarter ended december 31 2021 was 4 73 million compared to 4 73 million for the same period in 2020 interest income decreased compared to the prior year fourth quarter due to repricing of assets in this low rate environment as well as a reduction in ppp loan origination income however interest expense decreased to the same degree primarily due to repricing of retail cd s and reduced balances in public funds brokered cd s and fhlb advances as elevated core deposit levels allowed these funding sources to be replaced at a lower cost these results helped support the corporation s net interest margin which did not materially change from 4 02 in the fourth quarter of 2020 to 4 01 for the fourth quarter of 2021 provision expense decreased 888 000 over the prior year fourth quarter as springs valley made substantial provisions to the allowance in the fourth quarter of 2020 as the covid 19 pandemic was in full swing additionally compared to the prior year fourth quarter noninterest income decreased approximately 214 000 to 1 98 million from 2 19 million increased income from servicing fees on sold loans electronic banking e banking services and the financial advisory group were exceeded by a decrease in sold mortgage income as this low mortgage rate cycle is waning and housing inventories remain low although sold mortgage volume has decreased to maintain perspective springs valley is on pace to record the second best year in the company s history in terms of sold mortgage income second only to 2020 mortgage origination continues to be a strategic focus of springs valley s as it is a vital component of both serving the communities in which we operate and continuing to generate the superb financial performance highlighted in this earnings release noninterest expense increased 870 000 to 4 98 million from 4 11 million attributable to increases in general operating expenses the largest of which being increased salary and employee benefits expenses quarter over trailing quarter earnings decreased approximately 692 000 or 36 14 the earnings reduction was driven by higher noninterest expense primarily due to adjustments to discretionary pay in the form of bonus and incentives and profit sharing for employees as svb t corporation had a record year with earnings of 7 38 million fourth quarter net interest income and noninterest income were relatively in line with 2021 third quarter results svb t corporation book value has risen from 91 87 per share as of december 31 2020 to 103 07 as of december 31 2021 a 12 19 increase svb t corporation stock closed at 99 30 per share on the otcqx exchange on december 31 2021 in february of 2021 the corporation s board of directors authorized a share repurchase program through december 31 2022 under the program the corporation is authorized to repurchase from time to time as the corporation deems appropriate shares of svb t corporation s common stock with an aggregate purchase price of up to 2 00 million as of december 31 2021 svb t has repurchased 10 700 shares with an average purchase price of 79 31 under the program total assets decreased 6 02 to 490 10 million on december 31 2021 compared to december 31 2020 assets of 496 12 million total loans before allowance increased 12 07 million to 387 22 million on december 31 2021 from 375 15 million on december 31 2020 the loan growth was primarily generated through commercial and agriculture real estate lending although national loan demand levels are low from a historical standpoint springs valley saw an uptick in loan demand in the fourth quarter and has a healthy pipeline heading into 2022 additionally springs valley was an active participant in small business lending via the sba s paycheck protection program springs valley bank trust made 445 ppp loans during round 2 in 2021 for approximately 12 94 million ppp lending was a benefit to local small businesses and therefore was a primary focus for springs valley while funds were available through the sba s paycheck protection program as of the end of december 2021 springs valley has 62 ppp loans for approximately 1 08 million still on the balance sheet essentially 100 of the 2020 round 1 ppp loans have been forgiven and over 83 of round 2 ppp loans have been forgiven as of the end of december allowance as a percent of total loans was 1 88 as of december 31 2021 compared to 1 60 as of december 31 2020 springs valley has continued to conservatively reserve out of an abundance of caution for potential future credit concerns that could result from the economic impact of the ongoing covid 19 pandemic total deposits decreased 10 08 million to 386 91 million on december 31 2021 from 396 99 million on december 31 2020 noninterest bearing deposits increased by approximately 9 82 million due to growth in both business and consumer accounts interest bearing deposits have decreased by approximately 19 90 million the decrease was driven by reductions in cash held by the financial advisory group and reductions in both retail and brokered cd s springs valley has strategically utilized excess cash to let higher cost brokered cd s mature without being replaced in order to reduce the institution s cost of funds year to date ytd unaudited earnings for the twelve months ended december 31 2021 was a record 7 38 million or 13 36 eps a 54 81 increase over the same prior year period earnings on a per share basis this ytd performance translates to a roaa of 1 48 compared to the same prior year period of 1 00 net interest income before provision expense for the twelve months ended december 31 2021 was 18 76 million compared to 16 60 million for the same period in 2020 an increase of 2 16 million interest income increased approximately 298 000 compared to the same prior year period largely due to the amortization of a greater amount of ppp loan origination fees and higher commercial real estate loan balances additionally interest expense decreased by 1 86 million over the same time frame due to the low rate environment and its impact on deposit and borrowing rates as well as balance sheet management strategies that have involved letting higher cost borrowings mature without being replaced further contributing to the growth in net interest income net interest margin expanded as well from 3 65 to 3 99 for fiscal years 2020 and 2021 respectively ytd provision expense decreased by 1 68 million as springs valley had a large recovery in march of 2021 which allowed the institution to make smaller provision expenses in the second quarter of 2021 coupled with the fact that larger provisions were made in 2020 as the country was still in the initial stages of the covid 19 pandemic total noninterest income increased 797 000 to 8 59 million ytd december 2021 from 7 79 million for the same period in 2020 the largest contributing factors to the positive variance were increased financial advisory group income and e banking income growing noninterest income to reduce margin dependence continues to be a strategic focus of springs valley bank trust noninterest expense increased 1 46 million to 17 28 million ytd december 2021 from 15 82 million for the same period in 2020 this expense increase continues to be largely driven by various overhead components that have been necessary to build out the infrastructure to support the future growth of the bank and serve a growing customer base the largest components of this expense have been increased personnel and staffing expenses including elevated discretionary pay in the form of bonuses and profit sharing contributions due to the record earnings year additional premises and equipment expenses and additional data processing expenses springs valley continues to have a strategic focus in the daviess and gibson county markets as we are relatively new entrants with the addition of our banking centers in washington and princeton respectively while 2021 had its share of turmoil and uncertainty in the economic markets both domestically and globally

the global chip shortage that came with the health crisis in 2020 turned the super exciting adventure of buying a new car into a terrible nightmare that nobody knows how to resolve the lack of semiconductors has caused massive disruptions in the manufacturing operations of carmakers out there and this means that new vehicles are shipped with delays nobody would have ever imagined are possible waiting for at least 6 8 or even 12 months to receive the car you just ordered is something painfully common these days of course unless you re incredibly lucky to find the exact same configuration already in stock because someone else gave up on it at first glance the customers like you and me are most often affected by these huge delays but on the other hand there s another ugly side of the chip shortage police officers out there are also waiting for new patrol cars and in many cases their only option is to stick with the high mileage vehicles they already have the police in south windsor connecticut for example ordered new patrol cars back in may 2021 but the vehicles are yet to be shipped the vernon police department also purchased new cars last year but they are still nowhere to be seen suffield officers too are using high mileage patrol cars simply because the new ones hit the shipping delays we ve told you about a recent report highlights the struggle these police departments are fighting right now more often than not these high mileage cars break down regularly and they require costly fixes that would have been avoided with new and modern fleets unfortunately the end of the chip shortage still isn t on the radar while some analysts and industry experts believe the recovery could start in the second half of the year others think the chip crisis could last well into 2023 due to the current health issue that also doesn t seem to be coming to an end
