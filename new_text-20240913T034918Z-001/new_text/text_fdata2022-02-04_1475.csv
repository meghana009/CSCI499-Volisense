airbnb made cnbc s disruptor 50 list eight times more than any other company in the last decade covid halved its private valuation but it is now five times that size as a public company after completing a 2020 ipo many thought had been indefinitely shelved by the pandemic as the company faces new challenges and recurring political battles ceo and co founder brian chesky says 2022 is back to our roots back to the basics source airbnb in this weekly series cnbc takes a look at companies that made the inaugural disruptor 50 list 10 years later it s hard to think of a more quintessential story in disruption than airbnb the company made cnbc s disruptor 50 list eight times more than any other company in the last decade prior to going public at the end of 2020 get philly local news weather forecasts sports and entertainment stories to your inbox sign up for nbc philadelphia newsletters and years from now it ll be hard to imagine how any company much less a travel company made its market debut at the height of a global pandemic the way airbnb did to get through the crisis the company laid off about 25 of its workforce about 1 900 of its 7 500 employees and raised 2 billion in a combination of equity and debt to shore up its balance sheet the equity portion of the deal valued airbnb at 18 billion nearly half of what the company was worth in 2017 at the time airbnb also decided to pause activities that did not directly support the core of its host community such as transportation and airbnb studios and scaled back its investments in hotels and luxury properties but as sequoia capital partner roelof botha told cnbc s deirdre bosa just months before the ipo after a company that once topped the disruptor 50 list had just fallen to no 41 due in large part to the pandemic like all businesses that involve human interaction the sharing economy took a huge hit when covid emerged and shelter in place was enforced but people are itching to get out of their homes his thesis was validated when airbnb shares ended up 112 on its first day of trading blowing past the market caps of giant travel industry incumbents like booking holdings expedia and hotel chains like marriott and hilton 2022 new challenges for airbnb in 2022 it has been a different story with airbnb shares negative on the year but the stock has held up better than other growth oriented companies and the overall tech heavy nasdaq composite which is down about 12 year to date when we started airbnb it was about belonging and connection this crisis has sharpened our focus to get back to our roots back to the basics back to what is truly special about airbnb everyday people who host their homes and offer experiences said co founder and ceo brian chesky in a letter to his employees on may 5 airbnb implemented measures to keep its guests and hosts happy but the result was a wave of criticism for seemingly every step it took airbnb has also teamed up with rival vrbo owned by expedia to combat the issues problems are recurring for other notable disruptor 50 companies in the gig economy such as uber which has also struggled with user satisfaction as well as supply and demand imbalances amid the pandemic just weeks ago chesky who is now on a nationwide tour of airbnb stays in an effort to improve the experience for customers told cnbc that a post pandemic future of decentralized living will be a boon to the company chesky famously lived exclusively in airbnb rentals for a few months in 2010 when the company s earliest employees were crowding out what little bedroom space was left in his san francisco apartment twelve years later it s an indication that chesky believes his company s next act will largely depend on the same level of devotion to its customers that was required early on in order to win using a gig economy business model that many investors remain skeptical on a history of battles with politicians and regulators another key element that will define airbnb s future will be the regulatory environment in which the company operates despite a number of legal battles that plagued the company s growth story since those early days airbnb has remained largely unscathed when compared to other highly valued tech platforms in 2014 new york threatened to ban short term airbnb rentals and a year later the company spent 8 million to combat a citizen led ballot initiative meant to limit the platform s listings shortly after that there were even louder rumblings about airbnb s impact on the social fabric of wherever it does business in july 2016 sen elizabeth warren urged the federal trade commission to look into how such platforms were exacerbating housing shortages hillary clinton also called out the sharing economy as a potential factor in dampened wage growth last year critics have argued that the gig economy enables landlords to turn permanent apartments into high priced short term stays squeezing housing supply in already expensive markets like san francisco airbnb has maintained that most of its customers are middle class people who boost their income with airbnb s services which for many remains the case staying and paying in crypto next and believe it or not there s opportunity in crypto in fact coinbase ceo brian armstrong was one of the company s first software engineers who chesky applauded in a cnbc interview last year saying brian actually is one of the original architects of our payment platform and our fraud detection system so i m really really proud of what he s doing at the time chesky said he s kept in touch with armstrong asked by cnbc s deirdre bosa whether airbnb has any plans related to cryptocurrency adoption chesky said he did not have anything to announce right now but i can tell you that we ve been certainly looking at this in a more recent twitter thread chesky acknowledged that crypto payments is among airbnb users top suggestion but it s the blockchain technology underpinning crypto that could become airbnb s next act proponents expect blockchain adoption to grow in the coming years with some people comparing its disruptive potential to being akin to the early days of the internet for chesky it s like the revolution in travel the ceo saw decades ago when airbnb was clawing towards ramen profitability as a a darling of start up lore cnbc is now accepting

as it seeks to ward off a hostile takeover bid newspaper chain lee enterprises signaled thursday that its torrid pace of new digital subscribers will slow down this year the davenport based publisher reported 450 000 subscribers as of the end of december a 57 increase over the same period last year the growth puts lee halfway to its goal of 900 000 digital subscribers by 2026 but growth won t continue at the same pace for the rest of the year the company warned in lee s latest quarterly report thursday executives said they expected to have 495 000 digital subscribers by the end of the fiscal year which wraps up in september that would represent a 10 increase over a nine month stretch well below the 46 growth in digital subscribers that lee saw in the nine months leading up to december asked about the slowdown on a call with analysts thursday lee chief financial officer timothy millage hinted that the company will increase the price of some subscriptions we re trying to grow both our units as well as growing our rates he said with an emphasis on new websites and the launch of subscriber only niche publications digital growth is the linchpin of lee s business strategy especially as company leaders try to resist a takeover from hedge fund alden global capital after the investment firm unsuccessfully tried to buy the company for 141 million in november lee s board took several steps to keep alden at bay the company implemented a poison pill strategy in which lee would allow other shareholders to buy stock at a diluted value to lower alden s stake the hedge fund controls 6 3 of lee s shares according to a january regulatory filing lee executives in november also rejected alden s request to nominate three board members prompting alden to sue the newspaper chain in december the case is scheduled to go to trial monday a month ahead of lee s march 10 annual shareholders meeting pending a judge s order alden has nominated two media executives to join the board including 21 year meredith corp general counsel john zieser a west des moines resident zieser retired from meredith after digital publisher dotdash purchased the company in december more top meredith corp executives out after company s sale brings them big payday alden wants to replace veteran lee board members mary junck and herbert moloney iii junck the board s chair joined lee in 1999 and became ceo in 2001 before retiring her work on the board netted her 250 000 in cash and 150 000 in stock options last year moloney a former ad printing executive has been on lee s board since 2001 the company paid him 135 000 in cash and 50 000 in stock options last year in a jan 27 letter to lee shareholders alden executives wrote that the veteran board members are not properly managing the company without providing a specific plan the hedge fund s leaders said they could guide lee s newspapers toward bigger profits and better journalism our sole purpose in this campaign is to elect highly qualified directors who will bring much needed independent perspectives and relevant expertise to the boardroom alden executives wrote in turn lee executives have urged shareholders to resist alden alden is targeting our directors as the next step in their campaign to pressure the company into an unfair transaction that would secure lee s upside for alden alone at your expense the executives wrote in a letter last month more alden hedge fund appeals to investors in news publisher lee enterprises investors reacted negatively to lee s latest financial report with stock prices falling 18 to 32 a share on thursday afternoon the drop occurred even though lee outperformed analysts expectations for the quarter according to the data firm factset lee reported 202 million in revenue up from the expected 200 million the company also reported earnings per share of 2 17 beating the expected rate of 54 cents alden spokesman cameron gurley said in an email thursday lee s disappointing results and 2022 guidance continue to demonstrate the need for a new strategy and new leadership a lee spokesperson declined to comment thursday on what the company charges for digital subscriptions or if leaders expect to increase the price later this year the company s financial reports suggests that lee s revenue per subscriber decreased last year the company reported 7 9 million in revenue on its 450 000 digital subscriptions in the quarter that ended in december about 17 54 per subscriber lee also reported about 6 3 million off 286 000 digital subscribers during the same quarter in 2020 about 21 94 per subscriber overall the company s quarterly operating revenue dropped by 4 5 compared to the same period a year earlier when lee earned 211 8 million the company s

in the wall street aftermarket it was clear wall street and the nasdaq in particular would be in for a rough night and so it was our tech sector fell 5 9 yesterday next worst was healthcare 1 5 but that is currently under the influence of activity in csl csl as the trading period to set the volume weighted average price vwap for the retail part of the big capital raising enters its final days on the flipside materials rose 1 5 and utilities 1 6 and other sector moves were unsubstantial netting out to a modest fall for the asx200 the big fall in tech was not about facebook australia has no facebook it s just that facebook stole the limelight from paypal which fell 23 overnight on its earnings result paypal is a longstanding payment platform but more recently big in bnpl hence yesterday block sq2 fell 9 7 zip co z1p fell 9 6 sezzle szl fell 8 5 and you can keep on going into the smaller names there was nevertheless blind contagion apparent in the general tech sector with the likes of wisetech global wtc down 8 0 and xero xro down 5 0 there was actually one local facebook victim magellan financial mfg is a big holder it fell 7 5 ever get the feeling you re having a bad year strength in materials came from the iron ore miners with the iron ore price jumping a surprise 3 with china absent but also from nufarm nuf it posted an earnings update worth 20 the question now is what happens today wall street has indeed been clobbered overnight led down by all things tech and the sentiment has flowed through to the dow which has only two big tech names in it apple microsoft arguably along with salesforce our futures are down 78 points this morning with minimal tech weighting but just to cloud ahem the issue amazon has reported this morning and as i write its shares are up 17 having been down 7 in the day session in line with everyone else with apologies to kogan kgn we don t have an amazon here either but then sentiment wise that doesn t seem to matter nevertheless block fell another 11 last night about face it should be noted that the bank of england raised its cash rate for the second time post pandemic last night to 0 5 the last time the boe hiked at consecutive meetings was in 2004 the result was a shift in global bond yields with the us ten year up 6 basis points to 1 83 the nasdaq doesn t like higher bond yields but then it s no fan of 26 stock plunges for its largest companies either which is where meta ended up the result was put down to weak advertising revenue in the core facebook business as the company fannied about in the metaverse eyes off the ball even zuckerberg admitted tiktok was winning the video war the impact of meta s fate was felt across all things tech and wall street in general snap fell 23 pinterest fell 10 and twitter fell 5 5 but hold the presses snap has just reported in the aftermarket and is up 57 as has pinterest and it s up 27 twitter is up 10 google fell 2 last night in sympathy but was up 7 the night before on its result looks like meta is the pariah to be fair a weak result from honeywell saw it down 7 6 which weighed on the dow while apple fell 1 7 microsoft 3 9 and salesforce 5 4 on the back of amazon snap and pinterest will it all be different tonight note that our futures closed at 8am ahead of these aftermarket earnings reports commodities spot metals minerals energy futures gold

airbnb made cnbc s disruptor 50 list eight times more than any other company in the last decade covid halved its private valuation but it is now five times that size as a public company after completing a 2020 ipo many thought had been indefinitely shelved by the pandemic as the company faces new challenges and recurring political battles ceo and co founder brian chesky says 2022 is back to our roots back to the basics source airbnb in this weekly series cnbc takes a look at companies that made the inaugural disruptor 50 list 10 years later it s hard to think of a more quintessential story in disruption than airbnb the company made cnbc s disruptor 50 list eight times more than any other company in the last decade prior to going public at the end of 2020 get connecticut local news weather forecasts and entertainment stories to your inbox sign up for nbc connecticut newsletters and years from now it ll be hard to imagine how any company much less a travel company made its market debut at the height of a global pandemic the way airbnb did to get through the crisis the company laid off about 25 of its workforce about 1 900 of its 7 500 employees and raised 2 billion in a combination of equity and debt to shore up its balance sheet the equity portion of the deal valued airbnb at 18 billion nearly half of what the company was worth in 2017 at the time airbnb also decided to pause activities that did not directly support the core of its host community such as transportation and airbnb studios and scaled back its investments in hotels and luxury properties but as sequoia capital partner roelof botha told cnbc s deirdre bosa just months before the ipo after a company that once topped the disruptor 50 list had just fallen to no 41 due in large part to the pandemic like all businesses that involve human interaction the sharing economy took a huge hit when covid emerged and shelter in place was enforced but people are itching to get out of their homes his thesis was validated when airbnb shares ended up 112 on its first day of trading blowing past the market caps of giant travel industry incumbents like booking holdings expedia and hotel chains like marriott and hilton 2022 new challenges for airbnb in 2022 it has been a different story with airbnb shares negative on the year but the stock has held up better than other growth oriented companies and the overall tech heavy nasdaq composite which is down about 12 year to date when we started airbnb it was about belonging and connection this crisis has sharpened our focus to get back to our roots back to the basics back to what is truly special about airbnb everyday people who host their homes and offer experiences said co founder and ceo brian chesky in a letter to his employees on may 5 airbnb implemented measures to keep its guests and hosts happy but the result was a wave of criticism for seemingly every step it took airbnb has also teamed up with rival vrbo owned by expedia to combat the issues problems are recurring for other notable disruptor 50 companies in the gig economy such as uber which has also struggled with user satisfaction as well as supply and demand imbalances amid the pandemic just weeks ago chesky who is now on a nationwide tour of airbnb stays in an effort to improve the experience for customers told cnbc that a post pandemic future of decentralized living will be a boon to the company chesky famously lived exclusively in airbnb rentals for a few months in 2010 when the company s earliest employees were crowding out what little bedroom space was left in his san francisco apartment twelve years later it s an indication that chesky believes his company s next act will largely depend on the same level of devotion to its customers that was required early on in order to win using a gig economy business model that many investors remain skeptical on a history of battles with politicians and regulators another key element that will define airbnb s future will be the regulatory environment in which the company operates despite a number of legal battles that plagued the company s growth story since those early days airbnb has remained largely unscathed when compared to other highly valued tech platforms in 2014 new york threatened to ban short term airbnb rentals and a year later the company spent 8 million to combat a citizen led ballot initiative meant to limit the platform s listings shortly after that there were even louder rumblings about airbnb s impact on the social fabric of wherever it does business in july 2016 sen elizabeth warren urged the federal trade commission to look into how such platforms were exacerbating housing shortages hillary clinton also called out the sharing economy as a potential factor in dampened wage growth last year critics have argued that the gig economy enables landlords to turn permanent apartments into high priced short term stays squeezing housing supply in already expensive markets like san francisco airbnb has maintained that most of its customers are middle class people who boost their income with airbnb s services which for many remains the case staying and paying in crypto next and believe it or not there s opportunity in crypto in fact coinbase ceo brian armstrong was one of the company s first software engineers who chesky applauded in a cnbc interview last year saying brian actually is one of the original architects of our payment platform and our fraud detection system so i m really really proud of what he s doing at the time chesky said he s kept in touch with armstrong asked by cnbc s deirdre bosa whether airbnb has any plans related to cryptocurrency adoption chesky said he did not have anything to announce right now but i can tell you that we ve been certainly looking at this in a more recent twitter thread chesky acknowledged that crypto payments is among airbnb users top suggestion but it s the blockchain technology underpinning crypto that could become airbnb s next act proponents expect blockchain adoption to grow in the coming years with some people comparing its disruptive potential to being akin to the early days of the internet for chesky it s like the revolution in travel the ceo saw decades ago when airbnb was clawing towards ramen profitability as a a darling of start up lore cnbc is now accepting

director of the world health organization s who europe office said on thursday that the region is entering a plausible endgame as covid 19 deaths start to slow down hans kluge said during a news briefing that european countries have a singular opportunity to take control of covid 19 transmission because of several factors according to the associated press 1 high levels of immunization from the vaccines and natural infection 2 the virus tendency to spread less in warmer weather 3 the lower severity of the omicron variant this period of higher protection should be seen as a cease fire that could bring us enduring peace kluge added at the briefing looking ahead kluge said health authorities should be able to control any new variant that may emerge noting that spring leaves us with the possibility for a long period of tranquility and a much higher level of population defense against any resurgence in transmission the ap reported however kluge urged everyone in the region to get

kristi noem s r bill seeking to ban almost all abortions in the state over concerns its language could interfere with another legal challenge against planned parenthood the house state affairs committee in the south dakota legislature declined wednesday to take up noem s proposal which if enacted would ban abortions after a fetal heartbeat is detected which can occur as early as six weeks after pregnancy and place a minimum 10 000 fine on anyone who assists others in getting an abortion according to the associated press the bill which mirrors texas s controversial abortion law that went into effect in september allows private citizens to enforce it it does not call for exceptions for rape or incest though it does say that men who commit said rape or incest are not permitted to sue according to the ap state house speaker spencer gosch r said that while he agreed with noem s overarching objective of banning abortions he could not get behind the language in the legislation

team during this conference call we anticipate making projections and forward looking statements based on our current expectations our actual results could differ materially due to a number of factors including those listed on slide 3 10 stocks we like better than eli lilly and company when our award winning analyst team has a stock tip it can pay to listen after all the newsletter they have run

results to differ materially is contained in our latest form 10 k and subsequent forms 10 q and 8 k filed with the securities and exchange commission the information we provide about our products and pipeline is for the benefit of the investment community it is not intended to be promotional and is not sufficient for prescribing decisions as we transition to our prepared remarks please note that our commentary will focus on non gaap financial measures now i ll turn the call over to dave dave ricks chairman and chief executive officer thanks kevin 2021 was another outstanding year for lilly as we delivered strong top and bottom line growth and positive pivotal readouts for five important assets with the potential to launch in the next two years as we move into 2022 we continue to build on this foundation and are determined to deliver on our long term outlook to drive top tier revenue growth expand operating margins and innovate to develop and launch new medicines for patients that address significant unmet needs unpacking our 2021 performance on slide 4 you can see the progress we ve made on our strategic deliverables q4 revenue growth was 8 and was driven by volume growth of 11 while when excluding revenue from covid 19 antibodies revenue grew 6 for the quarter and 10 for the full year this volume driven performance is attributable to our key growth products which grew by 28 and now account for 61 of our core business in q4 on our non gaap gross margin was 76 1 in q4 a decrease of approximately 250 basis points driven by increased sales of covid 19 antibodies which have a lower gross margin profile our non gaap operating margin was 31 7 representing a decrease of approximately 130 basis points as a result of the lower gross margin percent just mentioned for pipeline milestones we have shared several important updates since our q3 earnings call including additional positive phase 3 readouts for mirikizumab in ulcerative colitis and lebrikizumab in atopic dermatitis the initiation of a rolling submission in the u s for pirtobrutinib in mantle cell lymphoma and our submission of bebtelovimab to the fda for emergency use authorization for the treatment of mild to moderate covid 19 we also continue to put our cash flow to work to create long term value and recently announced our plans to make significant investments in new manufacturing sites in both north carolina and ireland these investments will bolster the resilience and capacity of our supply chain as we launch new products to drive meaningful long term growth in addition this quarter we announced strategic research collaborations with a focus on new modalities as we continue to augment internal discovery capabilities finally on financials we announced a 15 increase to the dividend for the fourth consecutive year and in q4 we distributed nearly 800 million to shareholders via the dividend and completed another 750 million in share repurchases moving to slides 5 and 6 you ll see a list of key events since our q3 earnings call including several important regulatory clinical business development and covid 19 therapy updates we are discussing today or that were part of the discussion during our december 15 investment community meeting so now i ll turn the call over to anat to review our q4 and full year 2021 results anat ashkenazi chief financial officer thanks dave slides 7 and 8 summarize financial performance in the fourth quarter and full year 2021 i ll focus my comments on non gaap performance in q4 revenue grew 8 and revenue excluding covid 19 antibodies increased 6 highlighting solid momentum for our core business full year revenue growth was 10 on that latter basis gross margin as a percent of revenue declined 250 basis points to 76 1 in q4 the decrease in gross margin percent was driven by higher sales of covid 19 antibodies with shipments this quarter of bamlanivimab and etesevimab also having lower gross margin profile compared to bamlanivimab sales in the base period total operating expenses grew 5 this quarter marketing selling and administrative expenses increased 2 while r d expenses increased 7 driven by higher development expenses for late stage pipeline opportunities including donanemab pirtobrutinib and tirzepatide which were partially offset by lower development expenses for covid 19 therapies we invested approximately 40 million in research and development for covid 19 therapies in q4 bringing our total covid 19 r d investment to approximately 400 million for the full year operating income increased 3 compared to q4 2020 and operating income as a percent of revenue was 31 7 for the quarter a decrease of 130 basis points this decrease was driven by lower gross margin percent partially offset by lower marketing selling and administrative expenses as a percent of revenue full year operating margin was 29 9 in line with our expectations other income and expense was an expense of approximately 7 million this quarter compared to an expense of 31 million in q4 2020 our q4 effective tax rate was 10 3 a decrease of 280 basis points driven primarily by net discrete tax benefits at the bottom line we delivered solid growth as earnings per share increased 8 in q4 and 20 for the full year on slide 9 we quantify the effect of price rate and volume on revenue growth and we continue to be encouraged by the growth seen across key geographies this quarter u s revenue grew 13 excluding revenue from covid 19 antibodies revenue grew 11 in the u s this growth driven by volume was led by trulicity taltz jardiance verzenio and olumiant the net price decline of 2 in the u s this quarter was driven by lower realized prices for insulins primarily due to changes to estimates for rebates and discounts for the full year our u s net price decrease of 1 was in line with our expectations moving to europe revenue in q4 declined 3 in constant currency excluding the impact of the loss of exclusivity for alimta revenue grew 11 in constant currency driven primarily by volume growth for trulicity olumiant taltz and verzenio we are encouraged with the momentum of our business in europe and expect continued growth excluding alimta in japan revenue in q4 decreased 14 in constant currency revenue in japan continues to be negatively impacted by decreased demand for several products that have lost market exclusivity including cymbalta and alimta as well as by the covid pandemic with key growth products now representing 56 of total japan revenue we expect to return to growth beginning in 2023 in china revenue grew 13 in constant currency primarily driven by volume from our continued uptake of tyvyt and trulicity as well as the timing of supply for cialis to the third party selling the product q4 revenue growth was negatively affected by the updated 2022 nrdl price reductions on inventory already in the channel especially for tyvyt in 2022 we expect the nrdl price reduction headwind to largely offset volume growth in q1 but we also expect volume growth to accelerate throughout the year and exceed the impact of these price reductions moving forward we re excited about the significant growth we re seeing in china over 40 in constant currency in 2021 with improved access expected to continue to drive future growth revenue in the rest of the world increased 16 in constant currency this quarter driven primarily by sales of neuro medicine we continue to expect a mid single digit net price decline in 2022 for the u s europe and japan in china the expanded nrdl access for our products should lead to significant volume increase but also high double digit decline in price as a result we expect total company net price decline in the high single digit in 2022 at the bottom of the slide is the price rate and volume effect on revenue for all 2021 which shows strong double digit volume driven revenue growth across most major geographies as shown on slide 10 our key growth products continue to drive robust worldwide volume growth these products drove 14 percentage points of growth this quarter and continue to bolster our overall performance and outlook slide 11 further highlights the contribution of our key growth products this quarter these brands generated over 4 2 billion in revenue and made up 61 of our core business revenue in q4 these newer medicines grew by 28 and trulicity jardiance taltz and verzenio all continued to outgrow their respective classes we are particularly pleased with the continued market growth of both the glp 1 and the sglt2 classes where trulicity and jardiance are market leaders we are also encouraged by the strong uptake of verzenio we saw in q4 driven by the approval and launch of the adjuvant indication which has led to an inflection in both new and total prescriptions on slide 12 we provide an update on capital allocation in 2021 we invested 9 3 billion to drive our future growth through a combination of r d expenditures business development outlays and capital investments in addition we returned approximately 3 1 billion to shareholders in dividends and repurchased approximately 1 3 billion in stock our capital allocation priorities remain unchanged as we continue to fund our marketed products and expected launches invest in our pipeline evaluate opportunities for external innovation to augment our future growth prospects and return excess capital to shareholders on slide 13 is our 2022 financial guidance we issued in december as i shared then the financial impact from the loss of exclusivity of alimta in europe and japan will continue in the first half of 2022 while the impact from alimta s u s patent expiry will start with the limited launch from a single generic company in q1 before the full launch of additional generic entrants starting in q2 we expect roughly 375 million of revenue from covid 19 antibodies in q1 from the shipment of the remaining doses attributable to last november s u s government purchase agreement we continue to invest in our bright future advancing promising r d opportunities and preparing for exciting potential launches from our late stage pipeline which we believe will help drive top tier revenue growth through at least 2030 now i ll turn the call over to dan to provide an update on our pipeline dan skovronsky chief scientific and medical officer thank you anat 2021 was a remarkable year for lilly s pipeline we delivered positive data on five molecules tirzepatide donanemab pirtobrutinib mirikizumab and lebrikizumab all of which have the potential to launch in the next two years and we re excited about the potential these molecules hold for patients in addition we launched and submitted several key new indications for in market products including important new indications for verzenio and jardiance and also we advanced our early stage pipeline just a few weeks ago we provided an extensive r d update across our therapeutic areas and shared our excitement about the next wave of innovation coming from lilly as a result today s r d update will be brief and focus on the progress we ve made since our last earnings call slide 14 shows select pipeline opportunities as of january 31 and slides 15 and 16 show a recap of 2021 key events and potential key events for 2022 in diabetes with the recent submission in japan we ve now submitted tirzepatide across all major geographies for the treatment of type 2 diabetes we look forward to potential approvals for this important medicine this year we anticipate u s regulatory action in type 2 diabetes as well as the top line readout from surmount 1 both by midyear in japan we submitted jardiance for heart failure with preserved ejection fraction and received approval for jardiance for treatment of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction moving to oncology we shared encouraging updated data at ash for pirtobrutinib for both chronic lymphocytic leukemia and mantle cell lymphoma we continue to progress this molecule and initiated another phase 3 study in first line cll comparing pirtobrutinib to chemoimmunotherapy during our december meeting we also announced the initiation of a rolling submission for pirtobrutinib for mcl in the u s we plan to complete this submission this year with anticipated regulatory action in early 2023 and we re excited to potentially bring this important medicine to patients on this accelerated time line for verzenio we received approval for high risk early breast cancer in japan for the cohort 1 population study to monarche and are pleased that this approval represents 90 of the intent to treat population we ve also made the difficult decision to terminate further enrollment in the phase 3 study of verzenio for hr her2 early breast cancer in response to the changing treatment landscape and global enrollment challenges importantly this decision does not change our commitment to and investment in breast cancer in addition we began a phase 3 study for selpercatinib for the treatment of adjuvant ret positive non small cell lung cancer and we also dosed the first patient in the u s trial of our bcl 2 inhibitor in immunology we announced positive top line data for our phase 3 maintenance study of mirikizumab in ulcerative colitis we re pleased that the study met all primary and key secondary endpoints and we look forward to submissions in the first half of this year we also announced positive top line phase 3 results for lebrikizumab in combination with topical corticosteroids and we re encouraged that data to date has demonstrated a competitive profile for treatment of atopic dermatitis we await maintenance data for lebrikizumab in the first half of this year in advance of global submissions which are expected by the end of 2022 moving to baricitinib we announced last week that based on top line efficacy results from two phase 3 trials we ve decided to discontinue the phase 3 development program for lupus for atopic dermatitis in the u s we re in ongoing discussions with the fda but do not have alignment with the agency on the indicated population which could possibly lead to a complete response letter we expect regulatory action for this indication very soon finally we have submitted baricitinib for alopecia areata in the u s and hope it will become the first medicine approved for patients living with this disease later this year in our early phase immunology portfolio we started a new phase 1 study for a cd19 antibody and we ve discontinued our oral il 17 inhibitor moving to neurodegeneration in our early phase pipeline we announced that we ve received breakthrough therapy designation for n3pg4 an additional amyloid lowering agent for which we intend to initiate pivotal trials by the end of this year we have evidence that this therapy has completely and rapidly cleared amyloid plaque and we re exploring flexible dosing regimens including subcutaneous dosing for the treatment of alzheimer s disease we also began a phase 2 trial for our o glcnacase inhibitor an oral small molecule targeting tau while donanemab has been a primary focus for investors we re pleased with the continued clinical advancement of the rest of our neurodegeneration pipeline now turning to donanemab in december we initiated two additional phase 3 studies trailblazer alz 3 our prevention study for asymptomatic alzheimer s disease and trailblazer alz 4 our head to head plaque clearance study compared to aduhelm it s been less than one year since we published the positive randomized controlled trailblazer alz study which demonstrated clinically meaningful benefits on endpoints of cognition and function since then we have focused investors on the need for replication from our well designed expanded phase 3 study trailblazer alz 2 which is now fully enrolled and expected to read out in mid 2023 while a lot has happened in this space during this last year and more events are likely before we get top line results next year what hasn t changed for us is the importance of the trailblazer alz 2 readout and our confidence in both donanemab and the unique study design given the impact of this devastating disease we believe that if trailblazer alz 2 provides positive confirmatory data we can t see a scenario where there s not global reimbursement patient access and broad use of donanemab we noted last year that we had low expectations for the use of donanemab during the period between potential accelerated approval and the availability of confirmatory phase 3 data in mid 2023 we re disappointed with the position that centers for medicare and medicaid services has taken in its draft national coverage determination decision and those low expectations could now extend for some months beyond the trailblazer alz 2 readout if reconsideration of cms coverage determination is required given historical time lines for this process while the accelerated approval pathway was instituted by the fda to allow for earlier approval of drugs that treat serious conditions and fill an unmet medical need hence providing valuable access to more patients faster than what is available under clinical trials the ncd as currently written essentially negates that patient benefit in alzheimer s disease still we intend to complete our application for accelerated approval for donanemab yet this year but we now move completion of the accelerated approval submission out of q1 we expect further volatility and expectations as competitor alzheimer s disease trials read out prior to our definitive data we remain confident in the differentiation of donanemab and in our uniquely designed trailblazer alz 2 study and importantly the long term opportunity to help patients with donanemab remains unchanged lastly with respect to our progress with covid 19 therapies earlier this year we submitted a request to the fda for emergency use authorization for bebtelovimab for treatment of mild to moderate covid 19 for patients at high risk for progression to severe covid 19 including hospitalization or death this is the third antibody we have developed for the treatment of covid 19 and authentic virus and pseudovirus assays demonstrate that bebtelovimab retains neutralization activity against omicron as well as all other known variants of concern we ve produced several hundred thousand doses of bebtelovimab and stand ready to supply as needed if this antibody receives eua from the fda in addition we ve also submitted a supplemental nda for baricitinib for treatment of hospitalized patients with covid 19 and expect regulatory action by the middle of this year baricitinib currently has an eua for this indication we re proud of the therapies we ve delivered to help combat the covid 19 pandemic and we ll continue to do our part as public health needs emerge in summary q4 was another productive quarter for r d at lilly capping what was an outstanding year of pipeline progress on behalf of patients now i ll turn the call back to dave dave ricks chairman and chief executive officer thanks dan before we move to q a let me summarize the progress we made during 2021 we delivered strong revenue growth in our core business propelled by our key growth products we continue to invest heavily in our pipeline and made significant progress in 2021 generating positive phase 3 data for five new potential medicines tirzepatide donanemab pirtobrutinib mirikizumab and lebrikizumab that we expect we will launch in the next two years we also delivered positive data and launched important new indications for jardiance and verzenio while we continue to bolster our pipeline through business development with a focus on new modalities finally we returned 4 35 billion to shareholders via the dividend and share repurchases and for the fourth consecutive year announced a 15 dividend increase as we move into 2022 we are excited to continue the progress of turning pipeline value into cash flow starting with the potential launch of tirzepatide and the submissions of donanemab pirtobrutinib mirikizumab and lebrikizumab these opportunities remind us that our purpose has never been more relevant and highlight the promise of turning science into treatments or cures for some of the most challenging human diseases like diabetes obesity alzheimer s cancers and autoimmune disorders we are steadfast in our commitment to improve the lives of millions of patients who rely on us and are confident in our business outlook so now i ll turn the call over to kevin to moderate the q a session kevin hern vice president of investor relations thanks dave we would like to take questions from as many callers as possible lois please provide the instructions for the q a session and then we re ready for the first caller questions answers operator and our first question is from seamus fernandez from guggenheim please go ahead seamus fernandez guggenheim partners analyst so first dan can you just give us a little bit of the thought process for pushing out the accelerated filing for donanemab it certainly makes sense but how much did the ncd actually work into that calculus versus needs or requests from the agency for additional data and then the second question just really wanted to get a better understanding of where you guys think the surmount 1 data sets where the thresholds would be we re seeing 68 week data from wegovy coming in at about 15 to 17 in a nondiabetic patient population just wanted to get a sense of some of the pushes and pulls that we should be thinking about in the context of the surmount 1 data set thanks so much kevin hern vice president of investor relations thanks seamus we ll go to dan for the question on accelerated approval time line and then mike mason on expectations for surmount 1 dan skovronsky chief scientific and medical officer yes thank you seamus it s a good question look i think as i said the purpose of accelerated approval is to try and get medicines to help patients faster without access that benefit is mainly negated unfortunately and clearly a very frustrating period for patients to have approval of a drug and no reimbursement so the cms draft ncd proposal weighed heavily in our considerations around timing and clearly reduces some of the ability to help patients faster that we were hoping for with the accelerated approval with respect to the other part of your question which is how about requests from the fda or new data or anything like that there are none of those factors here we haven t had such requests so it s really about cms and about our own team s ability to just get all of the data together and get the right amount of safety data compiled in a way that the fda can analyze so we ll continue to work toward accelerated approval yet this year but no longer in q1 kevin hern vice president of investor relations thanks dan mike mike mason president of lilly diabetes yeah thanks for the question we are excited to see the surmount 1 data there s good theory on why someone who lives with obesity would have greater weight loss on a product like tirzepatide than those that have type 2 diabetes those theories tend to play out when we looked at the novo semaglutide step program where those who had didn t have type 2 diabetes had 6 or 7 percentage points greater weight loss than those that had type 2 diabetes we don t know what it s going to turn out to be for surmount 1 we do believe that it s gonna be higher in the non type 2 diabetes patient than what we saw in the surpass studies good thing is we don t have to wait too long for those results we expect those in the first half of this year and so we ll be patient and look forward to the results and i think we ll be excited by what we see kevin hern vice president of investor relations thanks mike seamus thanks for your questions next caller please operator and the next caller is ronny gal from bernstein please go ahead ronny gal sanford c bernstein analyst hi good morning and thank you very much for taking my questions the first one is around the n3pg4 in early ad you re starting a second agent fairly quickly can you talk about other distinguishing features for this product versus donanemab is it just that it removes plaque best are there also others for example is it removing preferentially parenchymal plaque versus vascular plaque and the second you kind of mentioned your expectation for the ncd but can you confirm to us that you do not expect the ncd to materially change in its final form versus the draft form and if you can talk a little bit about the process of requesting a change to that entity once we have confirmatory data for the amyloid beta removing drugs kevin hern vice president of investor relations thanks ronny we ll go to dan for the first question on n3pg4 and then anne for the question on the ncd expectations dan skovronsky chief scientific and medical officer yeah thanks ronny on n3pg4 originally we started working on this molecule because of antidrug antibodies that we saw and continue to see against donanemab because of those adas we ve dosed donanemab at pretty high levels and that in combination with the formulation of donanemab have precluded the ability of generating a subcutaneous dosing form so that was an important consideration those two things i would say for development of n3pg4 it binds the same epitope as donanemab so our understanding and data suggests that it clears exactly the same types of plaques that s important to us i think we ve seen compelling efficacy here in trailblazer from donanemab and we want more of the same in the next molecule so no differences here in type of plaque i think speed of plaque removal our expectations are it should be similar to donanemab which is to say quite rapid and the big advantage here is likely to be around dosing and administration kevin hern vice president of investor relations thanks dan anne anne white president of lilly neuroscience yeah well thanks ronny we believe more than likely the final ncd in april may not change very much really what matters most to us is ensuring rapid availability of donanemab for patients with that confirmatory phase 3 data and so that s gonna be our focus with cms we believe that well designed and controlled registration trials like trailblazer alz and alz 2 should certainly provide sufficient evidence of clinical benefit for donanemab and that a cd is not needed or appropriate for donanemab we re also going to see confirmation with cms really to your question once this phase 3 efficacy and safety have been established that donanemab and other medicines with this level of verified evidence would be fully covered by cms and we want that path for this coverage to be clearly laid out as dan mentioned it may take some months after the tb 2 readout to work through that but we ll certainly focus on that we have been and will continue to meet with cms to make our points known and to work through what that process is and i think our i think as dan alluded to what we believe is that with phase 3 confirmatory data and ultimately an fda traditional approval we cannot envision a reason why cms would treat alzheimer s disease differently than any other class of medicines i mean this would really be unprecedented and i believe the pushback from the patient community from their caregivers and from those that advocate for them would be significant and cms would have we believe no choice but to change it so our focus is on that phase 3 data kevin hern vice president of investor relations thanks anne ronny thanks for your questions next caller please operator the next caller is vamil divan from mizuho securities please go ahead vamil divan mizuho securities analyst hi great thanks for taking the question maybe one follow up on donanemab and then one other one unrelated so in terms of yeah obviously i appreciate what you re saying around the accelerated approval and kind of changing your time line there i m just wondering what trailblazer 4 and if there s any reason i m kind of wondering what the rationale for that trial is now given the limited uptake of aduhelm to this point i know we get data later this year but i m just wondering what makes if there s any sort of change in strategy or thinking around the need for that trial and what exactly that might accomplish and then my second question sort of unrelated you mentioned around olumiant the updates from last week but you also have submitted for alopecia areata i m just wondering if you could maybe just talk a little bit about what you see for the potential i guess for the jak class overall in that space but also for olumiant specifically just given obviously the safety concerns we ve seen around that product and the class from before kevin hern vice president of investor relations thanks vamil we ll go to dan for the question on trailblazer 4 and then patrik for your question on alopecia areata dan skovronsky chief scientific and medical officer yeah thanks vamil you raised a good point on trailblazer 4 which is a head to head against aduhelm of course there was a lot of excitement and patient interest and investigator interest in this trial because it s two drugs compared to each other so on the other hand as you point out from a commercial perspective the importance of showing superiority to aduhelm may have dramatically diminished but that s ok we re still committed to doing this trial i think from a scientific perspective there ll be important conclusions we have a hypothesis for example that the more rapid and deep plaque clearance could lead to greater improvements on biomarkers i think those kinds of assessments can only be done in a head to head study so this will still be an important contribution to our overall understanding of alzheimer s disease kevin hern vice president of investor relations thanks dan patrik patrik jonsson president of lilly immunology and lilly usa thank you very much for the question well we submitted olumiant for alopecia areata to the fda late last year and it s now submitted to most of european and the japanese regulatory bodies there are currently no treatments approved for alopecia areata so we have an opportunity here to be first in disease with olumiant and we have been encouraged with the data that we have seen from both brave 1 and brave 2 both based upon physician assessment as well as self assessment by patients and there is truly an unmet need in this space we have currently approximately 360 000 patients diagnosed in the u s and we believe at least 100 000 of those would be eligible for a treatment with jak and based upon the profile that we have seen from other assets we believe that we can launch here with a competitive profile to help patients with alopecia areata kevin hern vice president of investor relations thanks patrik vamil thanks for your questions next caller please operator the next caller is steve scala from cowen please go ahead steve scala cowen and company analyst thank you i assume that you are deep in labeling discussions on tirzepatide what questions is fda asking are you anticipating the label to read that tirzepatide is a first line injectable or for use after other injectables fail and since another very well managed diabetes competitor has had supply issues i m curious where tirzepatide is being manufactured and whether the plant has been inspected kevin hern vice president of investor relations thanks steve we ll go to mike mason for both of those questions mike mason president of lilly diabetes thanks steve for the question the tirzepatide submission in the u s is going quite well no surprises in that we are not getting any unusual questions we re confident in our supply and confident in our supply chain we ll be ready for launch we did comprehensive studies for our surpass 5 pivotal studies for the u s so i think that will give us a broad label and the label we need for success so i think things are progressing quite nicely we re quite confident going into our launch kevin hern vice president of investor relations thanks mike thanks for the questions steve next caller please operator the next caller is chris schott with j p morgan please go ahead chris schott j p morgan analyst great thanks so much maybe just following up on the tirzepatide front can you just help maybe also set some expectations of the launch as we think about 2022 into 2023 so maybe specifically how long should we think about post approval until you d expect broad coverage of tirzepatide and when we maybe compare and contrast i guess the large the last large glp 1 launch of ozempic are there similarities or differences we should think about as we think about kind of the state of the market today the data you ll have etc just to help us i think we all think about this is a great long term opportunity but more just the nearer term dynamics with that and then my second question was just on insulin in 2022 can you just elaborate a bit more about how to think about the magnitude of price erosion we could see for that franchise relative to what we saw in 2021 i m just trying to get a sense of how different is the market dynamic i guess this year versus last kevin hern vice president of investor relations thanks chris we ll go to mike for both of those questions as well mike mason president of lilly diabetes yeah thanks for the questions as we approach the tirzepatide launch we ll be playing for the long term and making sure that we set the foundations up strongly for long term success when you have a retail product like this that goes to nearly 100 000 primary care physicians as well as needing broad access there s little that you can do to really accelerate the launch in the first six months you re also working to get access and having support programs so patients will have a good out of pocket experience at launch and so i wouldn t look for the first six months to see a real accelerated uptake of net revenue versus other glps in that first six months i think that will be a focus for us of just laying the strong foundations being patient focused getting access driving awareness through a broad subset of physicians that will give us that foundation to be successful long term and then on insulin when we look at the q4 results we did have in particular a greater than usual decline in our price and that was really due to kind of a double whammy effect we have significant adjustments from our gross sales to our net sales and so if our estimates are off just a little bit that could have a significant impact on our net revenues and so what we saw actually was that in the comparison period in q4 of 2020 we ve experienced some positive onetime gains and then in this quarter we saw some negative onetime adjustments so that s what led to what looks like a greater than expected net sales decline and i think for our portfolio we have provided guidance that we would be at about mid single digit decline i think we ll see that greater for insulin than our net portfolio but i don t see anything largely unexpected in 22 versus where we ve seen the trends over the last couple of years thank you dave ricks chairman and chief executive officer maybe just to add something there chris a dynamic as well is patient assistance and as you know lilly has led over the last three years with a number of solutions to reduce out of pocket costs given the problems in the insurance markets and those have been in addition to the normal competitive dynamics in terms of gross to net an important solution for patients actually out of pocket costs for correct me mike if i get this wrong for patients in the u s dropped over the last three years from 34 to 21 per month on average for lilly insulins that s quite a bit lower than our competitors but that does hit the price line for us either through the now 70 off insulin lispro product which is available or through the buy downs we do at the point of sale to 35 per month so that s in the background there is sort of a terminal quantity to that but we have seen good adoption and i guess the good news is patients are taking advantage of that and it s showing up and retaining volume it does hit the net price line though kevin hern vice president of investor relations thanks dave and mike chris thanks for your questions next caller please operator the next caller is tim anderson from wolfe research please go ahead alice nettleton wolfe research analyst this is alice nettleton on for tim anderson so a question on donanemab the premise of donanemab is that you only dose to plaque negativity however to determine plaque negativity you need a minimum of two pet scans and quite possibly three maybe even more the cms draft guidance only covers one even if it ultimately gets revised to be more generous if it doesn t also include increased coverage of pet scanning then you could argue lilly is uniquely disadvantaged versus competitors would be curious to hear your thoughts on this kevin hern vice president of investor relations thanks alice we ll go to anne white for that question anne white president of lilly neuroscience well thanks and as you said we re pleased that cms acknowledged that there is an important role for amyloid pet in patient identification we certainly agreed to that as well and using amyloid pet to monitor plaque reduction and then confirm clearance is incredibly important we believe for patients receiving these therapies and incredibly important for the healthcare system because it provides clarity as to when you can essentially stop dosing of medicine once you ve cleared the target we believe that s the time to stop dosing and as you know in our data we ve shown that 40 even clear their plaque in six months so incredibly important we believe that the value that that brings to the healthcare system far outweighs any cost that it might bring and we ve done those analyses so it s very very clear that when you take into account all the costs of these medicines the infusion the safety monitoring you re much better off with clarity of when that plaque is cleared and stopping dosing it s a unique attribute of donanemab that we ve certainly talked to cms and others about and they ve recognized so we believe the value proposition here is quite strong and look forward to working with cms to get the amyloid pet ced revised in the near future kevin hern vice president of investor relations thanks anne alice thanks for your question next caller please operator the next caller is andrew baum with citi please go ahead andrew baum citi analyst thank you a question on lebrikizumab and then one on verzenio so on lebrikizumab part of the premise in terms of differentiation versus dupi given the il 13 mechanism is a lower instance of ocular events particularly conjunctivitis which are frequent with dupi and patient problematic i know you haven t fully shared the data but i wonder whether you could talk to whether the data will support that premise and positioning in the market and then second in relation to verzenio given you re now rolling it out for the adjuvant setting could you talk to what are the key barriers to adoption among oncologists is it tolerability in the adjuvant setting is it screening for the ki 67 patients or some or the financial factors and how can you resolve them kevin hern vice president of investor relations thanks andrew we ll go to patrik for the question on lebrikizumab and then jake for the question on verzenio patrik jonsson president of lilly immunology and lilly usa thank you very much andrew based upon the data that we ve seen so far we believe that we have a competitive asset with the market leader for atopic dermatitis and we were very encouraged with the efficacy results with more than 50 of the patients achieving at least an easi of 75 and also consistent across all the different measures iga easi and pruritus nrs it met all the key secondary endpoints specific to your question on conjunctivitis we need to wait for the 52 week data in the induction data we didn t see any difference to existing biologics but the cases that we saw were all mild to moderate and one third of those had a history of conjunctivitis and only a few of them discontinued treatment so we are looking forward to the database lock of the maintenance treatment during the second first half of this year kevin hern vice president of investor relations thanks patrik jake jake van naarden chief executive officer of loxo oncology at lilly and president of lilly oncology yeah thanks for the question so i think as it relates to the key barriers to adoption i think the biggest one in the overlay and then i ll get more specific is just that this represents really the first new standard of care in this setting in 20 years and so there are just a lot of physicians who have entrenched behavior and comfort with what they re doing and so the first barrier is really around education and getting a comfort level changing behavior and so that we have a lot of tactics in place to do that to make sure that the data on the agent are known and to answer questions that physicians may have more specifically you highlighted a few things that are good things to know which is the ki 67 testing requirement and the interpretation of those results and integrating them into patient selection is a new thing for docs in this setting as well as the diarrhea management which is a real phenomenon with verzenio we have protocols in place that allow it to be managed and it tends to be a short term side effect that can be managed but there are a lot of physicians out there who ve literally never written a prescription of verzenio because they ve been historically large ibrance users and for that segment in particular there s an education component to get them comfortable and ensure they re using the protocols that we think work really well for diarrhea management that all having been said we are happy with what we re seeing so far but it is early days obviously in this launch trajectory kevin hern vice president of investor relations thanks jake andrew thanks for your questions next caller please operator the next caller is geoff meacham from bank of america please go ahead geoff meacham bank of america merrill lynch analyst just have a couple of quick ones for tirzepatide in obesity what investments have to be made to help evolve the payer attitudes toward obesity as more of a medical condition obviously it has a lot to do with benefit risk starting with surmount 1 and you have a competitor leading the charge as well and then the second question is for pirtobrutinib the decision to file in mcl was it based more on unmet need and the opportunity versus regulatory feedback i want to get a little bit more clarity on that and with the phase 3s in cll not completing for at least a few years was there more consideration for those toward an interim look being built in i m just trying to think of the potential lag in commercial availability between the two indications kevin hern vice president of investor relations thanks geoff we ll go to mike for the first question and then jake for the second mike mason president of lilly diabetes yes it s a good question on obesity and what it s going to take to unlock and build that marketplace when you look at historically the agent just had kind of limited weight loss and because of that they didn t really drive good health outcomes and that limited access limited physicians from writing that so we think first of all just having an agent like tirzepatide that could have significant and clinically meaningful weight loss is the first step of the evolution of the marketplace and the interest in that and we ve seen that in market research and then we ve got to begin to build the evidence to show that significant weight loss from tirzepatide will lead to hard outcomes and that s what we re doing in our extended indication focus we ve announced a heart failure hfpef study we announced in december a sleep apnea study as well as an important morbidity mortality study or mmo study that will look at hard outcomes for other potential outcomes like cv and others we ll give you more information on that coming up we also have a chronic kidney disease mechanism of action phase 2 study that will help demonstrate why tirzepatide may work for that patient population and doing work in nash and so i think it s important for us to demonstrate i think we re confident that with the level of weight loss that we ll see with tirzepatide that should lead to hard outcomes that should then lead to earlier use of an agent like tirzepatide to really slow and disrupt the progression of obesity and really turn this into more of a preventive versus waiting for the heart outcomes to show but that s gonna be the evolution of it we ve got an extensive phase 3 program in order to demonstrate the evidence we think we need to in order to unlock and grow access over time kevin hern vice president of investor relations thanks mike jake on pirtobrutinib jake van naarden chief executive officer of loxo oncology at lilly and president of lilly oncology yes so to the first part of your question around the decision to file for mantle cell you framed it as was it unmet need versus regulatory feedback and the answer really is both so we ve had a longitudinal conversation with the agency around this indication showing them our clinical data at various snapshots over time and we got to a point where we had agreement on the key components of what an nda could look like from a clinical package perspective and so that informed our decision to file in other words this was not a sort of unilateral lilly decision this was done very much in concert with fda and i think they and us realized the unmet need of patients in the setting and the potential proposition of pirtobrutinib there obviously the ultimate approval is subject to an fda review so nothing s done until it s done of course as it relates to the potential lag between a mantle cell approval and a cll approval i think it s just too early to really comment because the latter cll is really subject to the enrollment dynamics of the phase 3 program and it s just a little too early days for us to really say exactly which one of those studies will be the first to read out and when because it is so enrollment kinetics contingent so over the course of this year we ll have a lot more information about that i presume and be in a better position to prognosticate about cll timing kevin hern vice president of investor relations thanks jake geoff thanks for your questions next caller please operator the next caller is louise chen from cantor please go ahead louise chen cantor fitzgerald analyst hi thanks for taking my questions so my first question is on lebrikizumab if it s approved do you expect sales to come from share gains from dupixent or new patient starts and then second question is on pirtobrutinib do you see an opportunity for the drug in first line treatment and if so do you think you need to wait for the head to head results before that becomes a meaningful opportunity for you kevin hern vice president of investor relations thanks louise we ll go to patrik for the question on lebrikizumab s source of business and then back to jake on pirtobrutinib patrik jonsson president of lilly immunology and lilly usa thank you very much louise i think first and foremost if we look at the atopic dermatitis space it s pretty much where psoriasis was a decade ago and we see a very low biologic penetration into those patients in need of treatment beyond topicals today so we definitely see an opportunity to significantly grow the market in atopic dermatitis but as i mentioned earlier we also believe that we have an asset here that is very competitive with the market leader so i would foresee that we will see an uptick both in terms of driven by market growth as well as competing very successfully with dupixent kevin hern vice president of investor relations thanks patrik jake jake van naarden chief executive officer of loxo oncology at lilly and president of lilly oncology so the pirtobrutinib opportunity we see primarily and certainly initially is in patients who have been previously treated with a btk inhibitor or more obviously we think there s a potential for the drug in the first line and that s why we re running studies there we have two studies that we re running in first line cll one is as you mentioned a head to head study against ibrutinib the other which will take a long time to read out because of the natural history of the control arm the other is a study we just recently started against chemoimmunotherapy that study will read out much much quicker and therefore allow for the drug to be labeled in the first line setting and i think what we ve learned particularly from other newer entrants in this space is that you really need to generate a differentiating data set in some way shape or form and then have the labeled indications that allow physicians and patients to have choice and i think in particular the calquence acalabrutinib program has shown that you really actually don t necessarily need direct head to head data to suggest differentiation or for at least physicians to perceive differentiation in different drugs so long as you have a labeled indication that allows for on label prescribing and reimbursement so one of the reasons that we initiated the first line chemoimmunotherapy study was to have a path to that first line label more quickly and allow patients and physicians to make choices kevin hern vice president of investor relations thanks jake louise thanks for your questions next caller please operator the next caller is umer raffat with evercore isi please go ahead mike difiore evercore isi analyst this is mike in for umer just two for me one on tirzepatide if tirzepatide is priced at a slight premium over trulicity on a list basis that could theoretically mean a massive increase on a net basis so given where prices are paid in government channels for trulicity can you remind us what percent of trulicity is medicare medicaid and va and how different is that price versus your commercial price and switching gears to donanemab for trailblazer 3 i was wondering if you guys had finalized the stat methodology for assessing the primary endpoint i know a little while back you had a nice poster on trailblazer 2 showing how the primary endpoints were assessed via bayesian analysis versus mmrm just kind of remind us where if anything has been finalized for the methodology for assessing the primary endpoint in trailblazer 3 kevin hern vice president of investor relations thanks mike we ll go to mike mason for the questions around tirzepatide pricing and trulicity segments in the u s and then dan for the question on trailblazer 3 mike mike mason president of lilly diabetes thanks mike for your question obviously i won t be able to talk in too much detail around the list price or net price for tirzepatide maybe the best way to answer your question is that typically for a new product you tend to get commercial access first then part d then followed by medicaid and other channels and yes the commercial net prices are typically higher than part d and part d is typically higher than medicaid so you will see kind of the evolution of any retail product to be a higher net price at the beginning of the life cycle and then as the lower if you reach volume in lower priced segments you ll see that decline like we ve talked about over with trulicity over the last couple of years now we will have extensive patient support programs in the first six months for tirzepatide so again i wouldn t be looking too much at that for tirzepatide in the first six months but overall over the first couple of years i think any product you ll see that dynamic for your specific question on medicaid with trulicity that s currently around 10 of the volume thanks for the question kevin hern vice president of investor relations thanks mike dan dan skovronsky chief scientific and medical officer yeah thanks mike for the question on trailblazer 3 it s a good question you raised because this is a really interesting population these are patients who have amyloid plaque in their brain but they re still cognitively normal so what kind of endpoint is appropriate for a population like that in our view we re looking at progression metrics so do they progress to a cdr rating that indicates that they now have impairment so it s a bit of a binary outcome for each patient did they progress or did they not progress and then you have an event driven study with kaplan meier type analysis so that s how we are thinking about trailblazer 3 right now and probably we haven t published the timetable yet but that may yet be forthcoming and that study is currently enrolling kevin hern vice president of investor relations thanks dan mike thanks for your questions next caller please operator the next caller is carter gould with barclays please go ahead carter gould barclays analyst i guess just first for dan maybe to clarify i mean the language you re using around no longer q1 i noticed i guess you guys weren t explicitly confirming to 2q so just maybe just clarifying then is that sort of time unknown just still some time in 22 or is it just going to kind of spill over by a couple of weeks or months and then maybe for jake on tyvyt when we spoke in december i thought you were pretty balanced if not even maybe negative on the prospects for approval based on some of the commentary around data coming out of china now that you ve got the questions in hand i don t know if your stance has changed or if you have any additional color to add thank you kevin hern vice president of investor relations thanks carter we ll go to dan for the question on donanemab and then jake on sintilimab in the u s dan skovronsky chief scientific and medical officer yeah thanks carter exactly you noted it correctly which is that we re saying no longer q1 and not providing more specificity than that we do anticipate completing the submission yet this year i think importantly here we re trying to take investor focus off of like the exact timing of accelerated approval given our very limited expectations for the impact of that accelerated approval commercially we re still pursuing it we think there s some opportunity to help patients faster through it but i don t think investors should look at that as a big commercial inflection point it s really around our ability to communicate the trailblazer 2 confirmatory phase 3 data and then work with cms hopefully before that or immediately after that to make sure there s access once we have that confirmatory data so that s the timing i think investors should be focused on kevin hern vice president of investor relations thanks dan jake jake van naarden chief executive officer of loxo oncology at lilly and president of lilly oncology thanks for the question on sintilimab so as you know we have the fda advisory committee meeting with innovent a week from today our position on the matter really hasn t changed nor have our expectations we believe that the risk benefit of the agent is demonstrable on the basis of the well conducted study and we believe the results of the study are indeed applicable to a u s population and we ll make our case in that respect a week from today that having been said we understand the stance of the agency may have changed or maybe we may have misinterpreted it a few years ago and so we ll await the fda s presentation on that topic and the feedback from the odac members but we think this product if approved could be meaningful for patients in the united states as a result of our disruptive pricing strategy but we obviously don t know if we ll be able to execute on that kevin hern vice president of investor relations thanks jake carter thanks for your questions next caller please operator the next caller is kerry holford from berenberg please go ahead kerry holford berenberg analyst hi thank you two questions please firstly on olumiant i wonder if you could break out for us the proportion of sales in the quarter that were related to use in covid and what your expectations are here going forward and also whether you can expand on the discussions you ve had with the fda on the atopic dermatitis indication and why you think a crl could be forthcoming if additional studies wouldn t be required would you continue to pursue in this indication and then secondly on the inflammation we obviously have the positive headline data from the phase 3 so i m wondering when you will publish the full data and whether we ll get to see that ahead of your filings kevin hern vice president of investor relations ok thanks kerry we ll go to patrik for those questions patrik jonsson president of lilly immunology and lilly usa ok thank you very much let s start with olumiant in covid 19 if you look at the q4 performance of olumiant i think you should assume that the underlying business in rheumatoid arthritis outside of u s and atopic dermatitis continue to be strong and in the u s the trend hasn t changed either when it comes to rheumatoid arthritis in the u s a significant chunk of sales from olumiant is coming from covid 19 in q4 and a minor chunk outside of the u s as well it s really hard to predict the pandemic but we expect to see continued sales from olumiant also in 2022 for treating hospitalized patients with covid 19 however at an enterprise level we don t foresee it to be material for your second question in terms of atopic dermatitis let me first reinforce that we are very confident when it comes to the risk benefit profile of olumiant across all the indications approved and studied and we conducted eight phase 3 studies for atopic dermatitis in u s and outside of the u s and those were conducted in patients moderate to severely ill patients suffering from atopic dermatitis in need of systemic treatment and that s really where we believe olumiant is bringing the biggest benefits to patients early on in the treatment paradigm while fda currently has a position of saving olumiant for the refractory patients where we see the incremental value of olumiant to be quite limited and if that doesn t change it s likely that we will receive a complete response letter and if so we will continue to focus our efforts on the very successful launches that we have seen outside of the u s for atopic dermatitis as well as a very strong rheumatoid arthritis franchise with as well as preparing for hopefully an approval of alopecia areata in the u s and other markets later on this year moving on to mirikizumab yes we had recently the readout of lucent 2 just prior to the end of last year and we met the primary endpoint and all the secondary endpoints and we didn t only achieve statistical significance but also clinically meaningful difference when it comes to clinical symptomatic histologic and endoscopic measures and we have also conducted the first study ever with an il 23p19 where we have demonstrated reduced bowel urgency which we know is a major concern today for both clinicians but mainly for patients so therefore we are looking forward to submit mirikizumab for ulcerative colitis during the first half of this year and most likely become the first il 23p19 in this very important space with a big unmet need and with a profile that we believe is very competitive versus both currently approved medicines and other biologics and jaks in development kevin hern vice president of investor relations thanks patrik kerry thanks for your questions next caller please operator the next caller is chris shibutani with goldman sachs please go ahead chris shibutani goldman sachs analyst thank you very much a question about the time line plans for filing for dmab it s been an arena of influence from different parties the agency cms where it appears as if there is sort of instruction that have breadth of scope across multiple different antibodies so would you say that since we know that competitor data is upcoming for additional approaches later this year does that impact your view on your approach and timing for filing dmab and then a second question would be on tirzepatide the anticipated transition in type 2 diabetes trulicity has been very strong but can you perhaps give us a better sense about how you expect that transition to play out i think broadly there s confidence in the profile that tirzepatide eventually will succeed in continuing the franchise position in type 2 diabetes but would you expect for the initial tirzepatide launch to come primarily and importantly from the incidence population or will there be patient switching a little insight into how that actual transition could play out in your view would be helpful thank you kevin hern vice president of investor relations thanks chris we ll go to dan for the question around donanemab filing time lines and then mike for the transition with trulicity and tirzepatide franchises dan skovronsky chief scientific and medical officer thanks chris you raised a good point with competitor readouts for amyloid lowering drugs coming yet this year we have to take into account expectations for those readouts i think from our perspective those readouts could be challenging obviously we designed donanemab as a molecule our dosing strategy our clinical trial strategy including who we enrolled and what endpoints we look at in order to maximize the ability to see a positive signal other trials haven t done that so therefore it s obvious that we would think that those trials should have lower probability of success i think if those trials are not successful competitor readouts fail either because cdr sum of boxes is just too noisy an endpoint and that can go both ways it could help or it could hurt we saw that in the two aducanumab readouts or because they have too many patients who are outside the optimal window of tau pathology because they re not doing that or because they lower plaques too slowly if any of those turn out to be correct and those trials turn out to be negative i think that could further solidify cms s reluctance to reimburse these drugs under accelerated approval it doesn t really fundamentally change our thinking though as i said before the key event for us is readout of our phase 3 study i think we ve optimized everything for our chances of success and regardless of competitor readouts if we have a positive phase 3 readout on top of our already first positive randomized controlled trial in trailblazer 1 that is a very good position for donanemab and our expectation is that s a drug that will become globally available to patients and highly used by patients kevin hern vice president of investor relations thanks dan mike mike mason president of lilly diabetes yeah thanks for the question on trulicity and tirzepatide we re blessed to have both products we re gonna be taking again from a long term perspective on tirzepatide and trulicity our goal is to continue to grow the market in type 2 diabetes and then really expand the class into the obesity market within type 2 diabetes our goal not only is to expand the market but continue to expand our share of market within the hypodermic market when you look at the way we promote our products we take a very patient centric approach to identifying those patients who could best benefit from a product like tirzepatide in our market research as we put the profile of tirzepatide up against 16 therapies including trulicity both payers and healthcare professionals and people who live with diabetes see the superior profile of tirzepatide when you compare that to trulicity our phase 3 trials that showed greater weight loss better a1c control and it s an exact same device as trulicity so there is obviously interest in the product and they do see it as a superior product from trulicity now what will what i believe will happen is that we will grow our overall share and you ll get a portion of patients who may have gone on trulicity or may be on trulicity and maybe out of control who needs greater weight loss or greater a1c control and those patients will grow on tirzepatide so we do anticipate that there will be some conversion from trulicity over to tirzepatide but our focus is really gonna be making sure that we grow the overall class and grow the overall share of market for the lilly hypodermic franchise we don t think it s appropriate to necessarily promote conversion of products we are doing well on trulicity so it s not gonna be a kind of

dublin city council has proposed updating the building height limits for the city which could see some buildings reaching 25 storeys or potentially even higher the council has made the proposals in the draft dublin development plan 2022 2028 while there are no specific height limits within the draft plan which means technically some buildings could reach any height in practice the criteria set out by the council ensures that developers would not be given carte blanche to build as high as they want the plan has three separate height categories including a landmark classification which dcc defines as a building that is substantially taller than its surroundings and that makes a significant impact on the skyline dcc city planning officer john o hara told the journal that he expected landmark buildings to be between 20 and 25 storeys in height currently the tallest building in dublin is the capital dock which stands at 79 metres tall with 22 storeys it has the same number of storeys as the flatiron building in new york city but below the flatiron s 86 metre height the flatiron building in new york city alamy stock photo alamy stock photo in a dublin context 20 to 25 storeys would be a reasonable height for a significant building said o hara but added that there is not a hard limit for the size of buildings in the landmark category if it was a wonderfully designed 30 storey of course it would be looked at and analysed against those criteria said o hara however he did couch these figures saying that there would need to be caution with taller buildings particularly around the historic georgian areas of dublin city capital dock the tallest building in dublin sam boal sam boal as well as this considerations for tall buildings would be placed against specific criteria rather than just height said o hara these considerations would include how buildings contribute to making a neighbourhood daylight permeability and respect for local and historical buildings the draft plan says that dcc recognises that dublin is a predominantly low rise city and that these landmark buildings would be located in areas where large scale regeneration is needed as well as centres of employment where the existing character would not be changed by adding a tall building advertisement clustering of tall buildings is likely to only happen in a limited number of areas says the plan primarily within the city centre strategic development regeneration areas sdras like ballymun key urban villages and public transport hubs like hueston station the draft development plan is currently undergoing public consultation with people able to view the plan in full and submit changes to the plan public consultation will remain open until 14 february these submitted changes will then be reviewed by councillors and council staff before a final development plan is agreed upon height classifications the other two classifications for buildings in the city will be prevailing height which will be the average building height in a given area and locally higher buildings the locally higher classification would allow for certain buildings in local areas to be built higher than the prevailing height to act as a landmark or statement for the area the other one is locally higher buildings which are buildings that will be local statements up to up to 12 storeys for commercial and 15 for residential said o hara o hara said that dcc had been criticised in its previous development plan for introducing a blanket approach to building heights and that they opted to change it for the new draft plan under the proposed plan while higher buildings are being considered the plan is further focused on increasing the density of the city the plan states that this does not necessarily mean high rise buildings and that effective densities can be reached through mid rise appropriate higher density schemes can often be achieved by using mid rise typologies and key to the success of such development is high quality design and placemaking reads the draft plan speaking to the journal noel brady architect and lecturer at the school of architecture at technological university dublin tud said that if ireland is serious about sustainability there must be a move to a more compact and dense city inevitably density means to some degree going up said brady it doesn t mean going up in the same direction with the same sort of targets of very high tall buildings but it is a key plank in terms of moving towards a sustainable future brady said while there is a blanket proposal by the council to allow taller buildings due to the criteria set down it will not be a carte blanche for developers to build up as tall as they like he said that not every building can be a landmark and said that in denmark for example there is a policy of only allowing specific cultural buildings to exceed a certain height obviously not every building can be a landmark that would just look like a kind of a disney esque landscape where everybody s competing for attention in copenhagen for instance they have a very very strong view in terms of what they call the discipline under which only certain cultural buildings can exceed a certain height in the city so everybody else has to toe the line read next related reads a more compact city dublin should look at a more european housing model says city planner the copenhagen skyline alamy stock photo alamy stock photo brady said that there can be pragmatic issues with high rise residential in particular saying that after a certain height the housing doesn t work well unless it is for wealthy people he added that people are rethinking living in high rise buildings following the grenfell tower disaster in london in june 2017 where 72 people died after a fire that broke out within the building while he said there are passive solutions being engineered which would enable buildings to resist events like fire these require higher levels of investment he also said that high rises within the city need to be designed with dublin in mind saying that it is important to critically examine plans to ensure they aren t being designed for cities like boston or new york and that they are more in line with dublin s latitude to avoid issues with sunlight european style city brady also said that the focus on one or two bigger landmark buildings misses the bigger problem within dublin and that moving to a more mid rise style model of housing like in other european countries could potentially move to help tackle the housing crisis i think the focus on height particularly in dublin is exacerbated by the fact that predominantly most of the city is two stories said brady when you go into the inner suburbs like crumlin you re into two stories semi detached houses and row houses in some instances whereas if you re in europe most of the inner city and even the inner suburbs would be around about four or five storeys brady said that this should be the area that is targeted and that focusing on landmark buildings misses the bigger issues within dublin city o hara previously told the journal that dublin should seek to move to become a more european style city sustainably increasing the density and moving away from solely providing traditional housing to help reduce urban sprawl while he said that traditional housing still had a role to play there needed to be more upward building within the city i think if we re to pursue the principle of a more compact city of reducing urban sprawl of doing our bit for climate change there s got to be a quality densification of development said o hara that s not to say there isn t a place for a three or four bed semi you must bear in mind right up to the 80s and 90s the three bed semi was the predominant form of development at a very low density in the last 10 to 15 years the apartment developments are simply you know rebalancing that but i have to stress i d have to say that the apartments have to be of good quality o hara said that there needed to be quality apartment accommodation provided and that dcc would seek to ensure that higher quality developments would be approved with particular focus on more storage space common space and larger balconies

the retired investor are you ready for 50 hamburgers fifty dollars may be an exaggeration unless you frequent some high priced restaurants in manhattan but consumers should be prepared beef prices for the foreseeable future will continue to climb some cuts of meat are already up 25 percent from where they were six months ago as the cook in the house i usually buy a prime rib roast for new year s dinner but not this year the cost for said morsel doubled in price since last year i bought australian lamb instead which was much more reasonable but just not the same i assumed that the price of beef like almost every other food product was going up due to supply shortages caused by the pandemic i knew that as the number of covid cases climbed and businesses started to shut down there was a run on everything from toilet paper to steaks in my neighborhood back at the start of the pandemic consumers flocked to the wholesale stores and supermarkets to buy what meat they could and stock up their freezers at one point rationing became a commonplace tool in controlling the consumption of beef pork and chicken in a tight market one of the major bottlenecks was in the slaughtering and processing part of the business more than 59 000 meatpacking workers were infected by coronavirus and 250 lost their lives according to a government investigation since then turnover has been high in this labor tight market where low wages and poor working conditions are prevalent all of these issues have contributed to higher costs climate change has also become a bigger factor in the production of beef drought now a constant companion to ranchers and farmers last year squeezed supplies of feed for cattle in the northern plains it was so bad that some ranchers were forced to sell even breeding stock to slaughterhouses this reduced the overall herd of beef by 2 percent according to the department of agriculture now the southern part of the plains is experiencing a deepening drought it is here that most of the cattle in the u s is raised that is expected to reduce the cattle stock even further marking three straight years of declines and the smallest herd since 2016 you might think that america s ranchers and farmers are in hog heaven as a result of these skyrocketing prices for beef at the supermarket but you would be mistaken cattle ranchers receive about 37 cents on every dollar spent on beef according to federal data as input costs for everything from gasoline to livestock feed keep rising the ranchers portion of profits drop even further the sad fact is that drought is forcing more and more ranchers to reduce their herds which has caused a glut of product at the slaughterhouses that in turn causes the price the processors are willing to pay to plummet but those price declines never show up at the grocery store why it can be summed up in four names tyson foods cargill national beef packing co and jbs together these conglomerates now dominate the meatpacking industry with an 85 percent market share over several decades through mergers and acquisitions and a lax attitude toward competition by regulators the meat packing industry became an oligopoly once that was accomplished these four remaining companies in the name of efficiency cut their capacity to process beef closing slaughterhouses and processing plants across the nation as a result profit margins improved company stock prices improved but ranchers and farmers were increasingly forced to accept whatever prices the processors were willing to pay for their product over time this oligopoly was able to first influence prices and then dictate what they were willing to pay ranchers for their herds it worked the four meat packing companies identified above for example saw their profit margins jump 300 percent last year so you might ask who is making money from these steadily climbing meat prices the government is asking the same question last month the federal trade commission opened an inquiry into how anticompetitive practices by major companies have contributed to supply chain problems as for the meatpackers senior white house economists brian deese sameera fazili and bharat ramamurti in a blog post in december 2021 explained it this way here is the bottom line the meat price increases we are seeing are not just the natural consequences of supply and demand in a free market they are also the result of corporate decisions to take advantage of their market power in an uncompetitive market to the detriment of consumers farmers and ranchers and our economy
don t miss out on the headlines from social followed categories will be added to my news mark zuckerberg has lost billions following meta s spectacular share price crash and now attention is turning to what really went wrong for the social media giant the 37 year old s personal wealth has plummeted by more than a43 billion one of the biggest falls ever recorded after meta shares dropped by a staggering 26 per cent on thursday afternoon us time wiping off more than us250 billion a350 billion in value meta platforms formerly known as facebook recorded the horror result in the wake of a dismal revenue forecast released late on wednesday which revealed the company was facing skyrocketing costs while growth had stalled the news has sent shockwaves across global markets but what exactly caused the bloodbath that has left the tech juggernaut reeling stay up to date with the latest market moves with flash a dedicated news streaming service new to flash try 14 days free now facebook co founder mark zuckerberg has lost billions following meta s shock stock collapse picture nicholas kamm afp losing users for first time in history one of the major reasons for the stock wipe out was the revelation that for the first time since it was founded in 2004 facebook s growth stalled with the platform actually losing users it s the first time this has happened in its 18 year history with more than half a million users deserting the site in the last three months of 2021 that has taken the total number of daily facebook users from 1 93 billion to 1 929 billion in a telling sign the loss was most significant in the previously growing markets of africa and latin america following slowing growth in the us and europe in recent years the fall in these key developing markets indicates that facebook may have reached global saturation levels which would mean the trend was here to stay and not just a temporary blip and growth across the parent company s other platforms such as whatsapp messenger and instagram was also relatively weak the share price of mark zuckerberg s meta plummetted on thursday cost of the metaverse in october 2021 facebook announced its rebrand to meta to much fanfare the name comes from the greek word for beyond and was chosen to reflect facebook s transition away from being a social media platform only instead facebook revealed a new major focus on developing the metaverse by investing heavily in virtual and augmented reality hardware but that transition comes at a mind blowing cost last year meta invested more than us10 billion a13 9 billion in its reality labs division which includes its virtual reality oculus quest headsets and augmented reality technology which contributed to the fall in profit part of that involved growing the team by 23 per cent to a total of 71 940 staff members in the last quarter facebook reality labs lost us3 3 billion a4 6 billion and more than us10 billion a14 billion across the entire 2021 with the metaverse still years away from becoming mainstream most insiders expect that loss making trend to continue for some time facebooks rebrand to meta was announced to much fanfare in october 2021 picture chris delmas afp rise of tiktok zuckerberg also called out competitors such as tiktok and youtube blaming the rise of these rivals for meta s grim results tiktok is so big a competitor already and also continues to grow at quite a fast rate zuckerberg said adding the firm was now investing in its own version of the popular video platform reels people have a lot of choices for how they want to spend their time and apps like tiktok are growing very quickly he continued and this is why our focus on reels is so important over the long term apple stopping apps tracking you zuckerberg also blamed apple for its horror quarter with facebook set to lose a whopping us10 billion a14 billion in 2022 following a significant iphone change in 2021 apple added a new function to iphones that would bar companies from tracking users across apps as a result of apple s ios 14 5 update the overwhelming majority of users opted out of tracking and it has given facebook revenue a hammering the impact of ios overall as a headwind on our business in 2022 is on the order of us10 a14 billion meta cfo david wehner said we re working hard to mitigate those impacts and continue to make ads relevant and effective for users that s because most of meta s revenue comes from advertising as a result of the firm s trove of personal information collected from users but the apple change meant that a sizeable chunk of that valuable data was lost meta also claimed inflation had impacted advertising budgets facebook ceo mark zuckerberg pictured with wife priscilla chan picture josh edelson afp series of scandals meta s gloomy results come after a tumultuous few years for the company which has been plagued by scandal after scandal last year whistleblower and former staff member frances haugen leaked the so called facebook papers to the media and the securities and exchange commission and testified before congress claiming facebook put profits over people s safety in february 2021 facebook s bombshell decision to temporarily ban australian news from the platform also sent shockwaves across the world and sparked a massive boycott push in 2019 nbc news obtained and released thousands of pages of leaked internal documents which revealed facebook s plan to grow ever powerful including an alleged strategy of using users data as a bargaining tool to wield against rivals and help out allies in 2018 it was rocked by the cambridge analytica fiasco which involved the selling of tens of millions of facebook users personal data to political data firm cambridge analytica without their consent with the information later used to influence voter behaviour during the 2016 us election although the breach was not known at the time facebook was ultimately slapped with a 5 billion fine as a result of the largest data scandal in its history in 2018 it emerged the platform had also been used by anti rohingya accounts to incite genocide against the muslim rohingya community in myanmar the platform was also accused of spreading mass misinformation in the lead up to the 2016 us election and in 2017 it was revealed that hundreds of likely russian fake facebook accounts spent around 125 000 on ads during the election campaign in 2016 it also landed in hot water after censoring a number of images and videos including a famous vietnam war picture and clips of the dakota access pipeline protests and in 2014 facebook faced yet another major backlash after it was revealed it had secretly carried out psychological tests on almost 700 000 unwitting users back in 2012 originally published as what really went wrong at facebook s meta after mark zuckerberg s share price bloodbath

takeaways despite a decline in securities class action filings in 2021 we saw a spike in spac related lawsuits and continued activity in event driven suits focused on issues of cybersecurity the pandemic and cryptocurrency trends we expect to continue in 2022 the supreme court ruled last year that defendants can introduce all relevant evidence at the class certification stage showing a lack of price impact imposing new hurdles for plaintiffs who must now address arguments that the alleged misstatements are too generic to have impacted the share price as more state courts uphold federal forum provisions that require shareholders to file their 1933 act claims in federal court corporate defendants could be well positioned to avoid state court forums by including these terms in their charters for the second consecutive year fewer securities class actions were filed in 2021 than in the prior year however we anticipate the pace of securities related litigation to increase in 2022 as plaintiffs securities firms continue to focus on cryptocurrency special purpose acquisition company spac transactions foreign issuers and so called event driven suits private litigation also is likely to get a boost as the securities and exchange commission and department of justice pursue more aggressive regulatory and enforcement policies see doj steps up corporate criminal enforcement looks more broadly at past misconduct and sec expected to introduce host of new rules in 2022 enhance enforcement as we predicted early last year suits involving spacs rose in 2021 with 23 such cases filed through the third quarter more than three times the total for all of 2020 this trend is likely to accelerate given the delaware court of chancery s decision in in re multiplan corp stockholders litigation which upheld claims for breach of fiduciary duty against a spac s sponsor and its directors and held them subject to the entire fairness standard of review where conflicts of interest and misleading disclosures were alleged see delaware courts simplify rules for derivative actions analyze spac fiduciary duty review and clarify books and records obligations the court also allowed the plaintiffs aiding and abetting claim to proceed against the spac s financial advisor considering the volume of spac transactions expected over the next year and the decision s potential to spur additional filings more spac litigation is inevitable in a bullish stock market we expect plaintiffs to rely on short seller reports to assert claims and we predict the continued use of the books and records statutes in delaware and other states to obtain information to lay the groundwork for future securities actions on the other hand as more companies add federal forum provisions to their corporate charters we anticipate a continued decline in the number of parallel state and federal court 1933 act filings below we discuss select significant decisions and their potential impact on securities litigation in 2022 courts may consider all probative evidence at class certification in evaluating price impact in june 2021 the u s supreme court issued a decision that will continue to make class certification a fertile battleground in many securities lawsuits arkansas teacher retirement system held that courts should consider all probative evidence at the class certification stage in assessing whether a defendant has rebutted the presumption of classwide reliance recognized in basic inc v levinson the fact that the evidence may also be relevant to materiality later when the claims are addressed on their merits does not preclude its use in deciding if a class should be certified the court held this includes evidence of the generic or aspirational nature of the alleged misstatements which can be considered when evaluating price impact evidence in arkansas teacher the plaintiffs alleged that the defendant investment bank and its executives made false and misleading statements about its conflict of interest policies the statements allegedly maintained the bank s stock price at an inflated level until purported conflicts came to light in opposing class certification the defendants argued that the alleged misstatements were too generic in nature to have any meaningful effect on the stock s price defeating basic s presumption of classwide reliance the second circuit refused to consider evidence of the generic nature of the statements saying that would really a means for smuggling materiality into rule 23 and affirmed the lower court s class certification order the supreme court reversed and remanded clarifying its decisions in amgen v connecticut ret plans trust funds and halliburton v erica p john fund in 2013 and 2014 respectively the court said that because the inflation maintenance theory asserts that a stock s back end price drop equals front end inflation the generic nature of a misrepresentation often will be important evidence of a lack of price impact for instance it said hen the earlier misrepresentation is generic and the later corrective disclosure is specific it is less likely that the specific disclosure actually corrected the generic misrepresentation which means that there is less reason to infer front end price inflation that is price impact from the back end price drop however the court held that defendants bear not only the burden of production but also the burden of persuasion by a preponderance of the evidence when seeking to rebut the presumption of reliance at the certification stage on remand the second circuit vacated the class certification order and remanded the case to the district court which then certified the class again applying the supreme court s new guidance and weighing the parties opposing expert evidence it concluded that the alleged misstatements were not so generic as to diminish their power to maintain pre existing price inflation and therefore had some impact on the price of the defendant s stock so while the price maintenance theory survives another day and defendants now bear the burden of persuasion the decision affirms an important right for defendants for certification purposes they can present all relevant evidence showing the absence of price impact state courts continue to uphold federal forum provisions last year s decline in filings can be attributed in part to a continued drop off in the number of federal merger objection lawsuits filed as class actions which fell to their lowest level since 2014 they had been a major contributor to overall filings since 2016 as the d o diary author kevin lacroix noted while plaintiffs brought more merger objection suits in federal court in 2021 than in recent years more were cast as individual rather than class actions he suggested that this may be to avoid court scrutiny of mootness fees sums corporate defendants pay to plaintiffs counsel where the company has made supplemental disclosures that moot the plaintiffs claims and the case is voluntarily dismissed meanwhile filings of 1933 act claims in state courts also declined this is in part due to the growing number of state courts that have enforced federal forum provisions ffps in corporate charters requiring shareholders to bring their 1933 act claims in federal court in practice these address the u s supreme court s 2018 decision in cyan inc v beaver county employees retirement fund holding that state courts have jurisdiction to hear class actions under the 1933 act and that defendants cannot remove such cases to federal court last year courts in new york and utah upheld corporate charters containing ffps joining california and delaware because new york and california state courts have been forums for 1933 act claims in recent years corporations could be well positioned to avoid these forums by including ffps in their charters that said changing the charter often requires shareholder approval which may not be appropriate or viable in some cases since ffps have not been universally adopted we expect state court 1933 act litigation to continue albeit at lower levels than in previous years however as a cautionary tale in a january 7 2022 decision the seventh circuit refused to enforce a company s bylaws containing a forum selection clause that required its shareholders to file their federal derivative claims under section 14 a of the exchange act in the delaware court of chancery because the forum bylaw would force plaintiff to raise its claims in a delaware state court which is not authorized to exercise jurisdiction over exchange act claims the court concluded it would foreclose entirely plaintiff s derivative action under section 14 a while acknowledging that delaware law grants corporations considerable leeway in drafting their bylaws the court concluded it does not empower corporations to use such techniques to opt out of the judge frank easterbrook dissented opining that there was no problem with plaintiff litigating its derivative suit alleging section 14 a claims in state court section 14 a does not say one word about enforcement and its judicially created private right of action permits investors not issuers to sue because nothing in the bylaw prevents a plaintiff from filing a direct action in federal court plaintiff has not been deprived of any right to enforce section 14 a regarding the exchange act s supposed exclusivity of jurisdiction congress has told us that derivative suits related to securities matters may begin in state court and stay there since these suits cannot be removed and section 27 a of the act does not change this result because derivative suits arise under state law even if a federal issue may come to the fore and that section s right to exclusive federal jurisdiction is waivable ninth circuit s pirani decision arguably creates split regarding section 11 actions ruling on an issue of first impression the ninth circuit held in september 2021 in pirani v slack technologies inc that shareholders have statutory standing to bring claims under sections 11 and 12 a 2 of the 1933 act arising from a direct listing in its motion to dismiss slack argued that pirani who purchased shares during the company s direct listing lacked standing because he could not prove his shares were traceable to the registration statement in a 2 1 decision the ninth circuit affirmed the lower court s denial of slack s motion to dismiss holding that both the registered and unregistered shares in the direct listing were sufficiently traceable to the registration statement to satisfy the 1933 act s standing requirements the court expressed concern that a contrary reading of section 11 would leave investors without recourse against misrepresentations made in direct listings undermining its remedial purpose but as judge eric d miller s dissent observed other circuit courts and prior ninth circuit precedent have interpreted section 11 narrowly to apply only to securities issued pursuant to a registration statement and directly traceable to that statement slack has filed a petition for rehearing en banc and if unsuccessful we expect it will file a petition for certiorari to the u s supreme court to address the apparent split in the circuits event driven lawsuits focused on issues of cybersecurity and covid 19 keeping with trends from recent years plaintiffs have continued to file event driven securities class actions where the catalyst is the disclosure or occurrence of a significant event that negatively impacts the stock price often unrelated to the company s financial results this year saw more pandemic related suits as well as cases stemming from cybersecurity breaches companies have faced an onslaught of cyberattacks giving rise to suits alleging material misstatements or omissions with respect to the strength of companies cybersecurity systems these suits do not appear to have gained much traction and have tended to end in dismissals or settlements courts have found that companies extensive disclosures about the risks of hacking and data breaches were sufficient warning to investors and that generic statements about the risks were unlikely to be misleading or indicate knowledge of specific ongoing breaches the pandemic continued to drive new filings as well with 11 covid 19 related securities cases through september 30 2021 most of the actions filed in 2020 alleged that companies failed to prepare adequately for the effects of a pandemic or overstated their resilience by contrast last year brought suits alleging that companies like home exercise and networking businesses overstated the sustainability of their growth during the pandemic or that pharmaceutical companies overstated the efficacy of their treatments these cases demonstrate that companies should continue to pay particular attention to their disclosures that could be affected by covid 19 as well as its secondary and tertiary impacts including supply chain employment and other issues in addition 2021 brought more securities class actions involving cryptocurrencies where plaintiffs alleged misrepresentations in initial coin offerings or the sale of unregistered securities by token issuers and asset exchanges esg litigation lastly we note the emerging trend of shareholders using litigation as a tool to further environmental social and corporate governance esg goals securities and exchange commission officials have also made it clear they will make esg disclosures a priority we expect more esg related suits to follow as issuers pay greater attention to these issues and make more statements about their efforts see activism landscape continues to evolve and investors press for progress on esg matters and sec prepares to join the fray download pdf
after a horrible day on wall street after hours news from the e commerce giant has investors feeling more optimistic the stock market returned to its bearish sentiment during the regular trading session on thursday with some high profile financial reports weighing down the mood among investors by the close the dow jones industrial average dji 0 65 nasdaq composite ixic 1 79 and s p 500 gspc 1 20 were all down sharply giving up a portion of their extensive gains from earlier in the week index daily percentage change daily point change dow 1 45 518 s p 500 2 44 112 nasdaq 3 74 539 once again though what happened after the close of the market at 4 p m et made market sentiment reverse course on thursday it was the fourth quarter financial report from amazon com amzn 1 35 that suddenly reminded market participants how the biggest companies in the world keep finding success below we ll take a look at amazon s whirlwind ride on thursday and why it just might have saved the stock market from further losses in the immediate term amazon flexes its muscles shares of amazon com were down almost 8 in the regular session on thursday as investors anticipated that there could be bad news from the pioneering e commerce company however the stock regained all its lost ground and then some after hours climbing 14 as of 6 30 p m et amazon s headline numbers were impressive but they came with some caveats net sales were up 9 year over year to 137 4 billion net income nearly doubled from year ago levels to 14 3 billion working out to 27 75 per share however this year s profit numbers included an 11 8 billion positive pre tax gain attributable to the initial public offering of electric vehicle company rivian automotive rivn 8 00 without which earnings would have been sharply lower for the full year amazon sales were up 22 to nearly 470 billion and net income of 33 4 billion translated into earnings of 64 81 per share on an operating basis amazon faced some challenges in north america sales were up 9 year over year but the company posted an operating loss of 206 million compared to a year earlier operating profit of nearly 3 billion a similar swing sent international segment sales down 1 and cost amazon 1 63 billion in losses however amazon web services once again showed the power of the cloud segment sales jumped 40 from the prior year s quarter and operating income climbed 48 year over year solving a problem 20 at a time what got the most attention from amazon investors though was the company s decision to boost the price of its amazon prime subscription service the annual fee for prime will now be 139 representing a price hike of 20 per subscriber those who prefer monthly subscriptions will pay 14 99 up 2 from the previous monthly charge renewals after march 25 will pay the higher rate as will new subscribers after february 18 that offers some time for customers to sign up at the current lower rate amazon boasts more than 200 million prime members worldwide so if the company can hold onto all of those subscribers the price increase will collect 4 billion in additional cash for amazon that could be important given amazon s swing to negative free cash flow during the fourth quarter largely due to massive investments in expanding prime to offer more video music gaming and reading content along with the unlimited shipping perks from the service growth isn t dead amazon s news proves that even massive companies can still grow especially when they have the pricing power to pass on higher costs to consumers amazon s big turnaround immediately sent futures contracts on stock market indexes higher it s entirely possible that a reversal from thursday s declines could end up providing the boost that growth stock investors need to regain confidence in the market s prospects for 2022
friday s jobs report could be a brutal one the average estimate of wall street economists is for a gain of 150 000 jobs yet some think the labor department data could be as bad or even worse than the 301 000 loss estimated by wednesday s adp employment report but would that kind of big miss really matter for the stock market x a negative economic hit would ordinarily give the federal reserve pause as it makes a swift u turn to tighter monetary policy not so great economic news is sometimes good news for the stock market yet fed chief jerome powell has indicated that the omicron wave like the delta wave could still contribute to elevated inflation by sapping labor force participation that could further strengthen employee bargaining power as powell noted last week workers already are getting very large wage increases slowing covid cases combined with a fed unlikely to be deterred from its mission to raise rates should keep investors from dwelling too long on january s economic data said bruce doty senior portfolio manager at sit investment associates a weak jobs report means a longer runway for inflation until workers come back into the workforce to provide relief to widespread shortages economists expect the average hourly wage to rise 5 2 from a year ago as the unemployment rate holds at 3 9 jobs report coincides with omicron peak the omicron was hitting its peak of about 800 000 cases per day right around the same time the labor department conducted its mid month household and employer surveys the pace has since been cut in half with further declines expected so january weakness should reverse quickly that s what weekly initial jobless claims indicate many more workers were unavailable for work in january either because they were sick and or quarantining or out caring for sick family members or school age children learning remotely wrote daniel zhao senior economist at glassdoor he notes that the census bureau s household pulse survey showed almost 8 8 million americans who said they didn t work in early january due to being covid symptoms or caregiving their ranks grew by 5 8 million over the prior month predicting what that means for friday s jobs report is impossible but any surprise is likely to be on the downside the adp report counts workers as employed even if they re on unpaid sick leave but the labor department excludes such workers from company payrolls stock market implications with omicron already on the wane the fed will be willing to look past a possible drop in labor force participation or even a spike in wage growth in the january data a bigger jump in the average hourly wage wouldn t necessarily set off alarm bells either the data could be distorted by a disproportionate though temporary drop in modest wage service jobs in january so don t expect a major stock market reaction even if there is a major data surprise any negative surprise would be tied to the omicron surge which was already past its peak when the fed met last week and signaled that multiple rate hikes and balance sheet tightening are likely by june still ho hum days for the stock market have been rare lately on thursday the stock market saw broad selling with the nasdaq tumbling 3 7 the s p 500 fell 2 4 and the dow jones 1 7 so friday may be another volatile session yet the jobs report would just be a convenient explanation make sure to read ibd s daily afternoon the big picture column to get the latest on the prevailing stock market trend and what it means for your trading decisions you may also like futures amazon snap skyrocket after facebook bloodbath catch the next big winning stock with marketsmith want to get quick profits and avoid big losses try swingtrader best growth stocks to buy and watch ibd digital unlock ibd s premium stock lists tools and analysis today

all questions introduction cyprus has a very advantageous environment for inward investment providing various incentives to encourage non residents to set up a business in or invest through cyprus in a nutshell no restrictions on foreign share ownership exist there are no withholding taxes on dividends or interest the sale of shares and other titles is exempt from tax and the corporate tax rate is one of the lowest in the european union while non cyprus tax residents or non domiciled enjoy a number of tax exemptions furthermore in october 2021 the cyprus government presented an action plan for attracting companies to operate from or expand their activities in cyprus these and other characteristics of the cyprus tax system shall be further analysed below common forms of business organisation and their tax treatment the most common type of business entity used is the private limited liability company various benefits surround the existence operation and tax treatment of a limited company these will be examined below i corporate businesses usually adopt a corporate form that of a private or public limited liability company with shares a cyprus company is fiscally opaque for tax purposes under cyprus law a company is a legal person with a separate legal personality while its members are not personally liable for its obligations their liability is limited to the share capital contributed a cyprus company is a legal entity distinct from its members and as such it enjoys rights and is subject to duties that are not the same as those of its shareholders the existence of the company does not depend on the existence or continuation of its members as per the principle of perpetual succession all of the above constitute the cyprus company as a flexible corporate form for the purposes of conducting business ii non corporate the establishment of partnerships is possible under cyprus law which allows both for general and limited partnerships a partnership is not treated as a separate taxable person it is a transparent entity and the tax is imposed on the actual partners and not on the partnership partnerships are widely used in joint venture projects and in smaller usually family owned enterprises also cyprus recognises the concept of trusts and in particular cyprus international trusts for settlors and beneficiaries who are non cyprus tax residents during the year preceding the year of the trust settlement a cyprus trust is not a taxable person the income of a trust is assessed in the name of the trustee however because the beneficiaries are the persons entitled to the income they are liable for any tax thereon trustees need to follow a matching approach when making distributions to the beneficiaries so that any cyprus tax is deducted and paid hence a look through approach must be applied direct taxation of businesses i tax on profits determination of taxable profit business profits of a cyprus company adjusted for various disallowances and exemptions are subject to tax at 12 5 per cent cyprus tax residents are taxed on their worldwide income profits are taxed on an accrual basis and the international financial reporting standards are followed generally expenses wholly and exclusively incurred by a company in the production of taxable income are allowable private expenses expenses not matched to taxable income or not validated through proper supporting documentation provisions depreciation amortisation impairment obsolete stock and expenses linked to non taxable assets and exchange differences are considered among others as non deductible expenses however capital allowances balancing allowance computed on the disposal of non current assets notional interest deduction and notional loss in related party transactions are also deductible capital and income the corporation tax rate is 12 5 per cent for individuals the progressive rates for income tax are provided below no capital gains tax exists apart from the taxation of gains from the disposal of immovable property situated in cyprus losses on a company level tax adjusted losses can be carried forward and be set off against tax adjusted profits for the next five subsequent years losses cannot be carried back on a group level subject to the existence of certain criteria and the formation of a tax group group members may surrender losses from one loss making member to another profitable one a direct or indirect holding of at least 75 per cent for the entire tax year is necessary for a company to be considered as forming part of a tax group from 2015 onwards the interception of companies established in the european union in countries with which cyprus has a double tax treaty dtt or countries that have signed the organisation for economic co operation and development oecd terms for exchange of information can be taken into consideration for the calculation of an indirect holding furthermore group relief is available between companies established in an eu member state provided that the eu subsidiary has exhausted all means of surrendering or carrying forward the losses in its own state rates business profits of cyprus tax resident companies adjusted in relation to allowances and exemptions are subject to a flat tax rate of 12 5 per cent income for individuals is subject to progressive tax rates the first 19 500 is tax free the next 8 500 is subject to a tax rate of 20 per cent the next 8 300 is taxed at 25 per cent the next 23 500 at 30 per cent and any amount above 60 000 at 35 per cent a number of deductions and personal allowances are available administration the key tax authority in cyprus is the tax department under the ministry of finance the tax department deals with all matters that relate to direct and indirect taxation local or municipal taxes are paid to the local municipalities as applicable the cyprus tax year is the calendar year both for legal and physical persons for income tax purposes records must be retained for six years after the end of the relevant tax year taxpayers are required to submit tax returns once a year all tax returns can be submitted electronically and taxes can be paid online legal persons are required to prepare audited accounts based on generally accepted audit standards companies should be registered online and submit their annual tax returns electronically the submission deadline of the income tax return for companies for a given tax year is 31 march of the second year following the year end the provisional tax payment for entities is made in two instalments on 31 july and 31 december each year the payment of the final corporation tax under the self assessment method is done by 1 august of the following year this also applies for individuals

return electronically by 30 september of each year employers are required to pay the employee s income tax through the pay as you earn paye system one month after the salary payment salaried individuals must submit their personal income tax return by 31 july while employers are required to submit their return of payments to employees and tax deducted for each tax year no later than 31 july of the following year the cyprus tax process is that of self assessment following the filing of a tax return the cyprus tax authorities have six years from the end of the relevant tax year to raise an enquiry or 12 years in case of fraud or wilful default tax authorities decisions can be challenged by applying to the tax tribunal which is an independent body not forming part of the tax department this application must be filed within 45 days from the notification of the relevant decision of the tax commissioner the tribunal must issue a decision within a year from the submission of the application also taxpayers may submit a petition to the administrative court which has jurisdiction to review at first instance the lawfulness of decisions actions or omissions of any executive or administrative authority and has the power to validate or nullify any such decisions the decisions of the administrative court are subject to appeal before the supreme court tax grouping no rules for tax grouping exist except for the basic rules for group tax relief described above ii other relevant taxes other taxes in cyprus include value added tax vat special defence contribution sdc capital gains tax and stamp duty the standard rate of vat is 19 per cent while reduced rates of 5 per cent and 9 per cent apply to certain supplies sdc is payable by cyprus tax resident companies and individuals that are both tax residents and domiciled in cyprus on passive income namely rents dividends and passive interest income dividends received by individuals resident and domiciled in cyprus are subject to an sdc rate of 17 per cent dividends received by cyprus tax resident companies are not subject to sdc subject to specific exceptions mentioned below the sdc rate for interest for both natural and legal persons is 30 per cent rent received by companies and by tax resident and domiciled individuals is subject to sdc at the effective rate of 2 25 per cent 3 per cent on gross rents less 25 per cent capital gains tax applies only to direct and indirect disposals involving immovable property situated in cyprus it is imposed at the rate of 20 per cent on gains from the disposal of immovable property or gains from the disposal of shares that directly or indirectly own immovable property situated in cyprus stamp duty is payable on any document that concerns any property located in cyprus or on matters to be executed there for contracts the value of which ranges between 5 001 and 170 000 the current rate of stamp duty is 1 50 for each euro or part thereof for contracts the value of which is over 170 000 the current rate of stamp duty is 2 for every 1 000 or part thereof with a ceiling of 20 000 this maximum amount is payable on any document or on any transaction that has several documents in this case the parties may choose which of the transaction documents is the main document and only that main transaction document will be subject to the full stamp duty the other transaction documents may be stamped as secondary documents in the amount of 2 each provided that they are dated the same day or very close as the main transaction document a number of instruments carry a fixed stamped duty as per the provisions of cyprus stamp duty law furthermore individuals are obliged to pay contributions for the general healthcare system ghs on among others emoluments pensions rental interest and dividend income ghs contributions are also applicable to non domiciled individuals these contributions are capped at an annual income of 180 000 tax residence and fiscal domicile i corporate residence the cyprus income tax legislation does not include a clear provision on how an entity becomes a cyprus tax resident general practice looks at the management and control thereof the minimum requirements for an entity to be considered a cyprus tax resident are quite general and include 1 the place of residence of the majority of the directors 2 the place that the meetings of the board of directors are held and 3 the place where the general policy of the entity is formulated therefore it is possible for a non locally incorporated entity to become a cyprus tax resident if the above criteria are met ii branch or permanent establishment a non cyprus entity can have a fiscal presence in cyprus through a branch or a permanent establishment pe the definition of a pe as included in cyprus legislation generally follows that of the oecd model tax treaty therefore for an entity to be deemed to have a cyprus pe a fixed place of business is required to be established there i e branch office etc cyprus also recognises the concept of the agency pe the relevant legislative provisions state that where a person other than an agent of an independent status is acting on behalf of an enterprise and has and habitually exercises in cyprus an authority to conclude contracts in the name of the enterprise that enterprise will be deemed to have a pe in cyprus in respect of any activities that such a person undertakes for the enterprise an enterprise shall not be deemed to have a cyprus pe merely because it carries business there through a broker general commission agent or any other agent of an independent status provided that they are acting in the ordinary course of their business usually an agent is considered to be independent if that person 1 does not act upon detailed instructions of the enterprise 2 is subject to entrepreneurial risk and 3 provides similar services towards other enterprises if a foreign entity has a cyprus pe then such a pe will be subject to tax in cyprus on income accrued or derived from the business activity that is carried through that pe and on income arising from sources therein tax incentives special regimes and relief that may encourage inward investment a number of features of the cyprus tax system can encourage inward investment these include among others the ip regime the tonnage tax system tts the absence of withholding taxes expatriate relief and others mentioned below i holding company regimes no particular regimes exist in relation to cyprus holding companies however a number of tax law provisions identify cyprus as an attractive holding jurisdiction namely dividend income received by a cyprus holding company is generally exempt from any income tax in cyprus subject to the hybrid instrument exception explained below and sdc subject to the passive dividend rule explained below also no withholding tax applies on any outgoing dividend or other profit distributions or interest irrespective of the existence of a dtt furthermore profits arising from the disposal of titles are tax exempt non cyprus tax residents or cyprus tax resident but not domiciled shareholders of a cyprus company are not subject to any sdc also no restrictions on foreign share ownership exist thus a foreign investor can be the sole shareholder of a cyprus entity ii ip regimes the current cyprus ip tax regime is applicable as of 1 july 2016 this follows the nexus approach according to which a direct link between qualifying income and own qualifying expenses is essential for the intellectual property to qualify the level of the qualifying profits is positively correlated to the extent that r d activities are performed by the same entity under the previous ip regime an overall 80 per cent deduction on profits was granted under the current rules 80 per cent of the overall income derived from the qualifying intangible asset is treated as a deductible expense a qualifying intangible asset is an asset that has been acquired developed or exploited by a person within the course of carrying out their business and that is the result of r d activities such assets specifically comprise of 1 patents 2 computer software and 3 other intellectual property that is legally protected and comprises utility models intellectual property assets that provide protection to plants and genetic material orphan drug destinations and extensions of protection for patterns or non obvious useful and novel assets which are certified as such by an appropriate authority where the person utilising such does not generate annual gross revenues in excess of 7 5 million from all intangible assets or 50 million for groups qualifying intangible assets specifically exclude trademarks business names brand image rights and other intellectual property rights used for the marketing of products and services persons that may benefit from the cyprus ip regime include cyprus tax resident taxpayers tax resident pes of non tax resident persons as well as foreign pes that are subject to tax in cyprus iii state aid there are limited approved state aid schemes in cyprus however the majority of these aim to enhance productivity in specific areas such as rural tourism high tech and innovative enterprises iv general there are various tax characteristics rendering the cyprus tax system attractive cyprus tax resident ship owners or ship management companies that qualify under the relevant legislation in relation to qualifying ships as defined therein engaged in qualifying shipping activities as defined therein can fall under the tts the tts refers to flat given rates of tax based on the net tonnage of the ship i e no requirement for a computation of tax adjusted profits exist there is no tax levied on the disposal of qualifying ships and dividends distributed out of companies under the tts are not subject to sdc furthermore various benefits are provided for natural persons individuals that were not cyprus tax residents for any three out of the last five years prior to commencement of employment in cyprus and at the same time were not cyprus tax residents in the previous year and provided that they receive emoluments over 100 000 per year are granted a tax deduction of 50 per cent on emoluments for a period of 10 years also non cyprus tax resident individuals or cyprus tax residents but non domiciled in cyprus are not subject to sdc on dividends interest or rents withholding and taxation of non local source income streams i withholding outward bound payments domestic law cyprus does not apply any withholding tax on dividends or interest paid to non residents regarding the payment of royalties to a non cypriot tax resident a maximum 10 per cent withholding tax applies on the gross amount of this payment if the royalty rights were used in cyprus also in relation to dividends interest and royalties paid to entities incorporated in another eu member state the provisions of the relevant eu directives apply ii domestic law exclusions or exemptions from withholding on outward bound payments cyprus does not apply any withholding taxes on dividends interest or royalties save as mentioned above the eu parent subsidiary directive and the eu parent interest and royalties directive are fully applicable in cyprus iii double tax treaties cyprus enjoys a wide network of dtts as it has entered into these with more than 60 countries the majority of these treaties follow the oecd model convention with the exception of the dtt with the united states which follows the most recent model of us agreements iv taxation on receipt dividends are generally exempt from income or corporation tax in cyprus there is an exception in that dividends received from a foreign company will be subject to corporation tax if paid out from hybrid instruments this applies from 2016 onwards dividends are subject to sdc if received by a natural person who is cyprus tax resident and cyprus domiciled the relevant sdc rate is 17 per cent dividends received by a cyprus tax resident company from a foreign entity are usually not subject to sdc unless the passive dividend rule applies namely that the company distributing the dividend engages directly or indirectly in more than 50 per cent activities leading to investment income and the foreign tax burden on the income of the paying company is substantially lower less than 6 25 per cent than the cyprus tax burden dividends received by a cyprus company from another cyprus company are not subject to sdc subject to the four year non exemption rule a dividend indirectly paid after four years from the end of the year in which the profits were generated is subject to sdc any foreign tax suffered is credited against the equivalent cyprus tax on the foreign tax suffered in no case can the tax credit in respect of the foreign tax exceed the equivalent cyprus tax credit is always granted to cyprus tax residents on foreign tax suffered on foreign income irrespective of the existence of a dtt or not underlying tax relief applies only for cyprus tax resident companies in relation to dividend income received from such companies from foreign sources a number of dtts entered into by cyprus allow for relief from both withholding tax suffered and for underlying tax paid by the foreign paying out entity however because the majority of dividend income received is exempt from any cyprus taxes underlying tax relief is not common taxation of funding structures i thin capitalisation no thin capitalisation rules exist nevertheless interest limitation rules ilr apply as from 2019 as part of the wider implementation of the eu anti tax avoidance directive atad the underlying purpose of the ilr is to limit the provision of financing facilities to companies based in high tax jurisdictions in low tax jurisdictions through subsidiaries belonging to the same group to do so the ilr requires that the excess borrowing cost ebc which is greater than 30 per cent of taxable earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortisation ebitda not be deductible for income tax purposes as such it limits the otherwise deductible ebcs to 30 per cent of taxable ebitda however the ecb is deducted up to a de minimis threshold of 3 million per fiscal year standalone entities not part of a group are excluded from the ilr moreover grandfathering has been provided for loans concluded before 17 june 2016 finally a group equity escape or carve out is provided according to which where the cyprus resident company is part of a consolidated group for financial reporting purposes the taxpayer may be given the right to fully deduct its ebcs provided that the ratio of its equity over its total assets is equal to or even up to 2 per cent lower or higher than the equivalent ratio of the group ii deduction of finance costs in general expenses wholly and exclusively incurred by a cyprus company in the production of taxable income are deductible and allowable interest expense and charges are generally allowable expenses provided they do not specifically match to the acquisition of non taxable assets non taxable assets include private assets saloon cars paintings etc a restriction of interest expense exists if the company has acquired such non taxable assets generally this restriction is calculated by applying the average borrowing rate of the company to the cost of the non taxable assets the result of this calculation is compared with the actual interest and charges appearing in the profit or loss of the relevant company the lower amount between the calculation and the actual expenses is disallowed for tax purposes further specific rules also apply for the calculation of this interest restriction iii restrictions on payments generally there are no restrictions on the distribution of dividends nonetheless the payment of dividends from a cyprus company to its shareholders should only be made out of realised profits iv return of capital the share capital of a cyprus company or the share premium attached to shares can be returned to the shareholders thereof following a reduction of capital or share premium as per the provisions of the cyprus companies law chapter 113 as amended the companies law in order for a cyprus company to reduce its share capital or share premium 1 a shareholders special resolution must be passed at least 75 per cent majority 2 a court order sanctioning the reduction must be issued and 3 the relevant court order along with the special resolution approving the reduction must be filed with the cyprus registrar of companies roc because the reduction will have no effect unless and until it is registered with the roc there is a requirement in relation to the protection of creditors namely a list of creditors needs to be drawn up or published in the official gazette of cyprus giving notice to any creditor or interested party of the hearing date of the court application enabling any such person to file an objection this can be overcome if the consent of all creditors is obtained and produced to the court along with the relevant application return of capital or share premium to the shareholders to the extent that such capital or premium was paid or contributed by the shareholders in exchange for shares is tax neutral acquisition structures restructuring and exit charges i acquisition there is no limitation for foreign investors acquiring shares in cyprus companies they can acquire such shares on their name or use a foreign or a local entity for this purpose profits from the disposal of titles are exempt from any tax in cyprus hence the actual structuring of the payment of the consideration is irrelevant with respect to the sale of shares titles are defined to include shares bonds debentures founders shares and other titles of companies or other legal persons incorporated in cyprus or abroad and rights thereon notional interest deduction nid is available in cyprus nid is granted on new equity as a tax allowable deduction nid can essentially reduce effective corporate tax rate to as low as 2 5 per cent however deduction granted can in no case exceed 80 per cent of tax adjusted profits after the introduction of nid in 2015 it became more appealing for buyers to structure financing through equity financing through loan is also possible the overall transaction structure will need to be considered before investors decide what best suits the needs of the specific acquisition ii reorganisation cyprus allows for the reorganisation of entities both on the local and on the european level reorganisations are attractive from a tax perspective as they result in a total exemption from tax in cyprus provided that they fall within the scope of the cyprus income tax law no 118 i 2002 the income tax law the definition of reorganisations includes a number of types thereof such as mergers by acquisition by the creation of a new company and by way of a holding company absorbing a subsidiary divisions partial divisions transfers of asserts and share exchanges the income tax law classifies all the above types of reorganisations as arrangements all of which are carried out pursuant to sections 198 to 201 of the companies law relating to compromises and reorganisations local reorganisations must also receive court approval before they can be effected an approved reorganisation has a number of tax benefits no balancing statement is required for assets transferred no capital gains or corporation tax on the transfer of cyprus immovable property is applied any losses carried forward of a transferring company can be transferred to the receiving company no transfer fees or stamp duty is applied and there are no taxes whatsoever on the transfer of any assets cross border mergers are possible on the eu level pursuant to the applicable eu directives cross border mergers can be performed between limited liability companies incorporated in accordance with the legislation of an eu member state that has their registered office central administration or principal place of business in the european union provided that at least two of them are governed by the laws of different member states pursuant to cross border mergers all assets and liabilities are transferred without the need for any other action save for any necessary notifications and likewise the company or companies being absorbed cease to exist from a tax perspective an application can be made to the tax authorities accompanied by the reorganisation plan and relevant information on the merging entities for a reorganisation certificate confirming the exemption from taxes the tax authorities retain the discretion to issue a tax exemption certificate if they take the view that the merger or reorganisation was at arm s length and reflected economic reality there is no procedure in relation to the reorganisation of cyprus companies with third country entities i e outside the european union however such third country entities can first be re domiciled into cyprus provided that this is allowed under the laws of their jurisdiction and following their re domiciliation can enter into an arrangement with a cyprus company iii exit in june 2020 a new law was adopted to implement the atad provisions in relation to exit taxation rules a cyprus tax resident company or a pe of a foreign entity will be subject to tax at an amount equal to the market value of the transferred assets at the time of exit of the assets less their value for tax purposes in cases where 1 a cyprus tax resident company transfers assets from its cyprus head office to its pe in another eu member state or a third country insofar as cyprus no longer has the right to tax the transferred assets due to the transfer 2 a pe in cyprus transfers assets to its head office or a pe in an eu member state or a third country insofar as cyprus no longer has the right to tax the transferred assets 3 a cyprus tax resident company transfers its tax residence abroad except for those assets that remain effectively connected with a pe in cyprus and 4 a pe in cyprus transfers its business abroad insofar as cyprus no longer has the right to tax the transferred assets under certain conditions temporary transfers of assets are excluded from the scope of the exit taxation provisions anti avoidance and other relevant legislation i general anti avoidance from 1 january 2019 a general anti abuse rule is applicable introduced as part of the general implementation of the atad cyprus legislation now provides that non genuine arrangements having as a main purpose the procurement of a tax advantage are ignored those arrangements are considered to be non genuine as their mere existence does not reflect valid commercial reasons or economic reality ii controlled foreign corporations the controlled foreign companies cfcs rule applicable from 1 january 2019 results in the re attribution of the income of a low taxed controlled non cyprus subsidiary to its parent company to avoid revenue diversion to a jurisdiction with a more favourable tax regime the cfc rules apply to both cyprus tax resident companies and non cyprus tax resident companies with a pe in cyprus a cfc is a low taxed non cyprus tax resident company or pe in which 1 the cyprus taxpayer alone or together with its associated enterprises holds a direct or indirect interest of more than 50 per cent and 2 the actual corporate tax paid on the profits of the company or pe is lower than the 50 per cent of the tax that would be paid in cyprus the non distributed income of a cfc that is the result of non genuine arrangements is added to the taxable income of the cyprus tax resident controlling company the cfc rule is not applicable when the company or the foreign pe has 1 accounting profits of no more than 750 000 and non trading income of no more than 75 000 or 2 accounting profits of no more than 10 per cent of its operating costs for the tax period it is possible for the cypriot controlling entity to claim credit for any overseas tax imposed on the cfc profits that are included in its tax base iii transfer pricing cyprus has adopted transfer pricing rules only in relation to intra group financing activities such rules are effective as of 1 july 2017 therefore financing transactions between related companies are obliged to follow the arm s length principle as set out in the oecd transfer pricing guidelines the said rules apply to cyprus tax resident entities and pes that are involved in back to back intra group financing transactions such transactions have been defined by the tax authorities as the granting of loans or cash advances to related companies remunerated by interest or should be and are financed by financial means and instruments such as debentures private loans cash advances and bank loans a transfer pricing study should be provided to the cyprus tax authorities evidencing that the conducted intra group financing transaction and the agreed remuneration i e interest complies with the arm s length principle a transfer pricing report should be 1 prepared by a transfer pricing expert and 2 submitted to the tax authorities by a person who has a licence to act as an auditor of a company according to the companies law and is required to carry out an assurance control confirming the quality of the transfer pricing report nevertheless a simplification measure was also introduced if a group financing company pursues a purely intermediary activity intercompany loans receivables and payable and has an actual presence in cyprus economic and physical substance then the transactions are deemed to comply with the arm s length principle and the minimum return accepted is 2 per cent after tax on assets profit after tax which effectively means a minimum taxable profit of 2 2857 per cent on assets it is expected that detailed transfer pricing rules will be introduced during the next few months and will be applicable from 1 january 2020 namely it is expected that the new rules will include a requirement for maintaining master or local files or both including benchmark reports for intercompany transactions exceeding the amount of 750 000 per category also the new legislation will offer the opportunity for companies to apply for advance pricing arrangements iv tax clearances and rulings it is possible to obtain advance tax rulings from the cyprus tax authorities such rulings are issued on the application by or on behalf of a taxpayer on actual or proposed transactions relating to tax years for which the due date for filing a tax return has not yet passed requests for rulings must be in writing and must comprise the information required by the relevant circulars of the tax department rulings will be binding only with regard to the taxpayers specifically mentioned in the ruling request provided that the circumstances described therein continue to be applicable and that there is no subsequent modification in the tax legislation that renders the ruling inapplicable the tax department will express an opinion on the applicable tax treatment of the proposed transaction or scenario presented to it and will not be responsible for verifying the facts and circumstances described in the application in case of any subsequent discrepancy between the scenario presented and the actual transaction the tax authorities can either decline to apply the tax ruling or inform the tax rulings division of the actual facts for the purposes of confirming or altering the initial ruling in any case there is no requirement or obligation for a taxpayer to obtain a tax ruling for the purposes of acquiring a local business or entering into a particular transaction year in review the most important development of the last 12 months in the tax field was the transposition of european council directive 2018 822 known as dac6 into domestic legislation the newly introduced provisions intend to increase transparency in the area of direct taxation with the aim to combat tax avoidance and tax evasion in the european union one of the current hot topics in cyprus is the relocation of the headquarters of international groups or of foreign companies in cyprus for the purposes of becoming cyprus tax residents and obtaining the advantages of the cyprus tax system this as also explained in section xi will be further supported by new incentives to be provided in 2022 by the cyprus government aiming to attract companies operating in specific areas of economic activity including high tech innovation shipping pharmaceutical biogenetics and biotechnology outlook and conclusions it is anticipated that detailed transfer pricing rules will be introduced until the end of 2021 and will be applicable as of 1 january 2020 these will include the requirement for related parties to maintain documentation files when they are involved in intra group transactions the new rules will provide that this requirement will apply when the accumulated intra group transaction per category exceeds 750 000 per tax year also the new legislation will offer the opportunity for companies to apply for advance pricing arrangements as mentioned above in october 2021 the government of cyprus presented an action plan aiming to encourage foreign companies and highly skilled personnel to relocate to cyprus the implementation of this new strategy is expected to commence in january 2022 in summary the key reforms announced include among others the introduction of the digital nomad visa for third country nationals wishing to live in cyprus but work for companies operating from abroad the establishment of a business facilitation unit that will operate as the focal point of contact for companies of foreign interests wishing to relocate in cyprus as well as for businesses operating in specific areas of economic activity including high tech or innovation companies pharmaceutical companies shipping companies and companies operating in the field of biogenetics and biotechnology and the provision of tax exemptions to foreign high skilled employees and incentives to such employees to apply for naturalisation after five years of residence and work in cyprus structures restructuring and exit charges

limit the asx s fall today amazon gained 19 in after hours trading setting us futures up for a big jump the asx is otherwise looking vulnerable as the boe and ecb put renewed upward pressure on global bond yields which magnified the sell off started by meta on amazon etoro analyst josh gilbert said amazon announced its q4 earnings of us 27 75 per share on revenue of us 137 4 billion compared to analysts expectations of us 3 79 per share on revenue of us 137 8 billion amazon s earnings have smashed through initial analyst expectations and demonstrated a significant year over year increase up by 97 the company s sales did however miss the mark slightly gaining only 9 4 year over year the company s net income increased to us 14 3 billion up from us 7 2 billion a year ago thanks to its investment in electric vehicle manufacturer rivian however despite the beat on net income amazon s operating income took a hit down 50 per cent year over year the drop was of course due to supply chain issues globally and the cost of labour soaring in the us the major focus for amazon right now seems to be amazon web services aws and its push into streaming and advertising aws once again delivered robust growth with revenues up 39 5 per cent year over year with remote working continuing to be the new normal and enterprises cloud budgets increasingly swelling it seems that the shift towards cloud technologies is only just getting started and amazon is in the prime position to benefit finally amazon also announced it would be raising its prime membership from us 12 99 to us 14 99 the first price hike since 2018 right now the biggest issue for amazon is its margins and this price hike could potentially address this issue banks raise fixed rates australia s banks aren t waiting

levels with ratecity predicting in the next six months fixed rates may hit 4 there are still a handful of 1 and 2 year fixed rates under 2 per cent but they re becoming increasingly harder to find which makes shopping around all the more important tindall said us markets ford was another that fell sharply as wall st dipped losing more than 3 after its quarterly profit fell short of wall st

in december to foreign students and workers has contributed to the current low 4 2 per cent jobless rate and skills shortages for business but the biggest drivers of the labour market s strength according to lowe and market economists have been the government s massive 300 billion debt funded stimulus and the rba s easy money policies full employment would mean jobs for more than 13 million people increased working hours for part timers and higher incomes for the civic minded rba governor the trifecta of full employment price stability and the prosperity of the australian people would be a big economic and social dividend nevertheless there are big risks for both the governor and prime minister global inflation forces have leaked into australia pushing up the cost of petrol food and home building costs near an election the rba s official 0 1 per cent interest rate is poised to rise plausibly later this year or in 2023 lowe revealed in a backflip this week borrowers who bet big on lowe s earlier 2024 guidance on interest rate rises will face higher interest repayments sooner and other cost of living pressures advertisement rising global interest rates foreshadowed by the us federal reserve and other central banks have already triggered a correction in share markets and crypto prices the heads of the 204 billion future fund chairman peter costello and chief executive raphael arndt warned this week that the possibility of global rampant inflation was a risk facing investors around the world the easy returns of the last decade or so just won t be there arndt said australia s soaring house prices up about 30 per cent during the pandemic are delicately poised entering the first rba rate increasing cycle since 2009 2010 lowe has not delivered a rate increase during his 5½ years as governor and morrison as treasurer and prime minister has only experienced falling interest rates lost advantage moreover the envisaged 3 75 per cent jobless rate by late this year may not appease the critics of the prime minister and governor for morrison the economy remains his best and perhaps only remaining bet for an unloved prime minister to make up ground against a small target labor opposition led by anthony albanese a newspoll this week showed labor had shot to a commanding 56 44 two party preferred lead as morrison copped the blame for the shortage of rapid antigen tests and empty supermarket shelves in the summer omicron outbreak advertisement the coalition lost most of its traditional advantage over labor as the better economic manager with only a narrow 33 31 lead over which side is better placed to create jobs and grow the economy morrison and treasurer josh frydenberg blame this on the summer of frustration of millions of australians affected by omicron in the traditionally relaxing holiday period paradoxically it isn t clear that low unemployment will save the government the last time unemployment touched 4 per cent was 2007 then liberal prime minister john howard lost the election to labor s kevin rudd one school of thought among political strategists is that when unemployment is low voters may be more prepared to give labor a go because the economy appears strong for the independent and non partisan lowe he will try to steer clear of election politics underwhelming performance at the national press club this week lowe diplomatically sidestepped journalists questions about the government s underwhelming performance on economic reform and productivity he politely noted the coalition efforts in infrastructure skills research and development and the cutting of personal income taxes lowe has become gun shy commenting on government policy since morrison and frydenberg a couple of years ago let the rba governor know they did not appreciate his public pressure for economic reform to lift productivity advertisement the governor now has other challenges to deal with he s been forced to untangle himself from previous guidance a best guess not a pledge that interest rates were unlikely to rise until at least 2024 three months after saying interest rate rises in 2022 were extremely unlikely on thursday lowe conceded it was now plausible later this year the good news for lowe and morrison is that any rate rises will almost certainly be after the may election because the bank will want to gather more evidence on inflation and wages it is worth noting that lowe did not raise interest rates during the 2019 election campaign to avoid the rba being caught up in politics instead he chose to cut rates twice immediately after the election some critics argue sitting pat during the election three years ago when weak inflation warranted a rate cut was an inherently political even if unintentional decision in itself because the voting public was not alerted to the sluggish state of the economy lowe insisted this week that the 2022 election will not influence monetary policy wage growth still key advertisement the bank s preferred measure of underlying inflation is 2 6 per cent within its 2 per cent to 3 per cent target band however lowe believes some rising prices are because of temporary factors such as the jump in the global oil price and pandemic related supply chain disruptions pushing up the price of goods for inflation to be sustained around the midpoint of the target band lowe has stuck to his narrative that wages growth must rise from the current modest 2 2 per cent to about 3 per cent or so despite business complaining about skills shortages and unions planning bigger pay demands lowe believes the industrial relations system means it will take time for wages to pick up the inertia in the award system multi year enterprise bargaining agreements and pay caps on public servants make big broad based pay jumps unlikely in the near term despite pressures in sectors such as finance and technology he argues the rba would not only look at the quarterly wage price index but also consider average earnings and real unit labour costs in the national accounts as well as enterprise bargaining agreements public sector pay deals and the bank s liaison with business the rba is what assistant governor luci ellis has likened to watching the invisibles the unemployment point at which wages finally take off because employers are forced to compete harder to hire and retain workers the rba estimates full employment is around the high 3s or low 4s but won t know until it is actually reached and seen moreover the rba is prepared to be patient and tolerate some higher inflation while local price pressures are less severe than the 7 per cent headline inflation in the united states advertisement rba ran rates too high the willingness to stomach some higher inflation is a big change from the inflation bogey lowe experienced in his academic and professional career in the 80s 90s and 2000s it s also a change of tack from lowe after the rba undershot the midpoint of the inflation target for seven years that has led to criticism from the organisation for economic co operation and development oecd former prime minister paul keating and academic economists that the rba ran interest rates too high before 2019 even if the nominal cash rate was around only 1 5 per cent since then responding to the pandemic the rba has unleashed an extraordinary stimulus by slashing the cash rate to 0 1 per cent buying 350 billion of government bonds and issuing 188 billion in super cheap loans to commercial banks the pre and post pandemic actions of the rba have led to calls from the oecd for a review of the rba and its policy tools which frydenberg and shadow treasurer jim chalmers have both committed to do after the election the rba has announced its own internal review limited to the extraordinary policies it resorted to during the pandemic but it is expected to face a separate government imposed review by an independent expert the knowledge of a looming review may pressure the rba to keep rates lower for longer to make amends for undershooting its inflation target pre pandemic advertisement costello howard s former treasurer endorsed a review of the rba the intervention by costello chairman of nine entertainment the publisher of the australian financial review was notable because he first formalised the bank s independence and inflation target agreement with the howard government costello has been critical of lowe s previous lofty 2024 guidance on interest rate rises and the bank s messy exit from its bond yield curve targeting last october it s got to be held accountable in modern society just like all other institutions costello said costello still holds a grudge against the rba for then governor glenn stevens raising rates in the 2007 election campaign and hurting the howard government s re election chances a controversy that as assistant governor lowe no doubt learnt from an rba governor requires a thick hide on the one hand lowe has faced criticism for failing to cut rates sooner to deal with low inflation pre pandemic but he faces criticism from some quarters that he has held rates too low for too long and has blown a bubble in housing prices and now risks inflation breaking out 10b recapitalisation looms a related development that is likely to face growing scrutiny for whoever wins the election is the government budget implications from the rba s extraordinary monetary interventions advertisement bond buying suppressed federal and state government borrowing costs helping fund more than 300 billion in stimulus but the sting in the tail is the rba is on track to lose tens of billions of dollars from its bond buying program and cheap 0 1 per cent fixed three year loans given to commercial banks market analysts warn that no matter which party wins the federal election the government will suffer reduced rba dividends and face a likely large recapitalisation of the central bank of potentially more than 10 billion while the rba s solvency is not in question the call on the government s budget could become a hot political issue for frydenberg or chalmers as treasurer this is at a time when morrison has resumed talk at least rhetorically of fiscal discipline and keeping a lid on election spending to help contain inflation in new zealand this week the oecd warned the ardern government to tighten its budget to contain 30 year high inflation of 5 9 per cent which has surged with low unemployment of 3 2 per cent yet if lowe can help deliver sustained unemployment below 4 per cent without blowing the lid off inflation there will be plenty of goodwill towards the governor and possibly the government

chicago r r donnelley sons company rrd nyse rrd a leading global provider of marketing and business communications helped levain bakery meet a 200 increase in e commerce demand during the pandemic the 26 year old company which started on manhattan s upper west side has transformed from a new york city institution popular amongst locals and tourists to a national brand while improving efficiencies and exceeding consumer expectations with the help of rrd s packaging and warehousing solutions amid the onset of covid 19 levain experienced skyrocketing demand for its assortments of cookies available for purchase online simultaneously the company needed to address an e commerce packaging redesign while scaling up its warehousing capacity to address these challenges the company collaborated with rrd a chicago based company with roots in printing that evolved to offer solutions from creative design and kitting to warehousing and proprietary supply chain management and more we were already a growing brand opening new bakeries scaling our e commerce business and expanding into grocery retailers said andy taylor ceo of levain the challenge was creating a packaging solution that not only ensured our customers would receive our product in pristine condition but also improved our efficiency to better meet demand when covid 19 caused new york and the rest of the world to shut down we saw online orders multiply and we needed a supplier that had the flexibility to meet accelerating demand on a greater scale available in packages of 4 8 or 12 levain s cookies were already packaged in simple shippable self erecting corrugated boxes filled with packing material not only were the boxes in need of a redesign to better reflect the brand inside and out levain strived to improve product protection and operational efficiency of the packaging covid 19 accelerated the urgency for levain to address its evolving package design and warehousing needs said lisa pruett president rrd packaging solutions forms and labels what differentiates rrd is our range of capabilities and expertise from package design and engineering to printing supply chain and marketing we can serve as that single source solutions provider for companies in growth mode collaborating closely with levain s marketing team and designers at the creative pack rrd worked across multiple plants to deliver a vibrant e commerce box that represents a combination of flexo and litho lamination techniques to address product protection rrd designed a lightweight paperboard insert to accommodate all three pack sizes the universal insert and redesigned package ultimately cut an 8 step process down to 4 steps we supplied different iterations of packaging and inserts for the levain team to evaluate they then thoroughly transit tested the prototypes to ensure there would be no tearing or crushing of the packaging so customers would receive their cookies perfectly protected for the best possible brand experience said pruett our focus with clients is around sustainability and efficiency for levain we were able to reduce the use of unnecessary materials per order while significantly cutting down the time it takes to package and ship the product improving efficiency by 50 rrd also helped levain solve its warehousing challenge using a replenishment model this enabled levain to receive partial orders for its rolling shipments of 15 pallets per week at its production facility while the balance remained in close proximity at an rrd warehousing facility in pennsylvania following the

tim graham getty images washington a bipartisan group of senators is within striking distance of a deal on a bill that would impose crippling sanctions on russia for its hostilities against ukraine we are finding the path forward very clearly said sen jim risch top republican on the foreign relations committee indicating that the white house and other key agencies were involved in the negotiations to agree on a deal ahead of any potential invasion by russia which has amassed more than 100 000 troops on ukraine s border asked if a deal could be announced as early as thursday risch said i d have to say that s possible though aides to three senators involved said it was unlikely top biden administration officials briefed members of congress on thursday about the escalating tensions in and around the former soviet republic lawmakers leaving the more than hourlong briefing in the congressional visitor center said the gravity of the message from those top officials including secretary of defense lloyd austin chairman of the joint chiefs of staff gen mark milley secretary of state antony blinken and cia director avril haines added urgency to their efforts collectively what i heard made the case that this is more pressing more timely and that time in this regard if we want to be preventative is of the essence said committee chairman bob menendez d n j menendez who is the chief architect of the sanctions bill along with risch added that he is cautiously optimistic that we are going to get there sen lindsey graham r s c who is involved in the bipartisan senate talks agreed saying the briefing i think will accelerate the bipartisan sanctions package despite the closeness of a deal differences remained among negotiators on the appropriate triggers for sanctions and when and how to penalize those developing the controversial but as yet inoperable russia to germany nord stream 2 pipeline a project that would bypass ukraine taking with it crucial revenue i am hopeful in the next coming days we can introduce a sanctions package that imposes sanctions now for the russian provocation with post invasion sanctions that will destroy the russian economy as we know it said graham who like many republicans after the briefing said he thought a russian invasion of ukraine was now a matter of when not if some democrats and the biden administration want to hold back sanctions arguing that they are more powerful as a deterrent against russian aggression deterrence is the idea that if you do x we will do y if you put penalties in place in advance at least significant penalties you obviously take away the stick of deterrence said sen chris van hollen d md a member of the foreign relations committee i think it s very important that the united states put a very strong sanctions package in place sen tim kaine d va told cnn adding that any sanctions need to be announced in advance to have a deterrent effect house speaker nancy pelosi said sanctions against russia must be much more forceful than they have been but also insisted that any sanctions be imposed after an invasion i think it s really important for us to use the sanctions if the russians strike pelosi d calif told reporters thursday it is important because it s where leverage is at maximum if they do this then we strike pelosi said that thinking is also in line with most u s allies this is deadly serious pelosi said so they have to feel the pain and it has to be felt right up to the richest man in the world vladimir putin nobody knows what he s going to do except for him indeed lawmakers have said the legislation a bill menendez said puts in place the mother of all sanctions would contain a strong recommendation that russia be kicked out of the global financial consortium known as swift or the society for worldwide interbank financial telecommunications based in belgium it connects more than 11 000 financial institutions and is used as a messaging platform for the transfer of funds around the world if that recommendation is included in the bill the biden administration would still have to take action to have russia removed an extreme action lawmakers have said is on the table the white house confirmed thursday that it is in close consultation with senators but stopped short of endorsing any deal we are in very close touch with members of congress about this legislation which i don t think has been formally even proposed yet white house press secretary jen psaki told reporters en route to new york aboard air force one so we are in close contact and in conversations with them psaki however continued to express the administration s support for post invasion sanctions saying that the deterrent approach of the crippling economic sanctions package and noting that the impact is already being felt in the russian financial markets still a number of democrats were moving closer to the gop position that pre invasion sanctions were a must even if the most serious sanctions are reserved in the event of an invasion i think putin and putin s russia have already committed sufficient aggression against ukraine justifying some sanctions said top biden ally chris coons d del i think we should hold back the most aggressive and most punishing sanctions for now as a deterrent because the whole goal here is to keep open some space for diplomacy and to deter aggression menendez and risch have been briefing members of their panel this week one member mitt romney r utah told abc news he met with risch on wednesday night and the smaller group negotiating the package is making good progress the legislation would include a measure authored by sens john cornyn r texas and ben cardin d md modeled on the world war ii era lend lease program which would use existing presidential authorities to allow the administration to provide lethal military equipment to ukraine to protect the population from a russian invasion members hope to move any sanctions deal which according to two aides involved in the matter is still in the legislative drafting stage to the senate floor quickly and sen chris murphy d conn who recently returned from ukraine and is part of the talks told abc news he had spoken earlier in the week with senate majority leader chuck schumer who committed to bringing any bipartisan deal to the floor for a vote quickly and after thursday s high level briefing it is clear that members are ready to act swiftly coons said he s very concerned about the situation on the ground in and around ukraine adding it s really hard to listen to all of that and not conclude that we need to do more abc news mariam khan and ben gittleson contributed to this report copyright 2022 abc audio all rights reserved

offering college course website iim lucknow iiml chief executive officer programme visit indian school of business isb chief digital officer visit iim kozhikode iimk chief product officer programme visit iim lucknow iiml chief operations officer programme visit any correction in global markets as a result of the us federal reserve s monetary policy action should be used as an opportunity to buy into indian equities said christopher wood global head of equity strategy at jefferies in an interview after tuesday s union budget wood spoke on his assessment of the budget cryptocurrencies and foreign selling of stocks among other matters edited excerpts the key point about the budget is that it is a continuation of the trend we saw last year which was the focus on infrastructure and capital spending the capex is the most important point to me the budget looks quite conservative fiscally to me it may prove that the government is too conservative on revenues but that s not a problem it is not surprising to see the indian market correct a bit because of the fed tightening issue but the key point is the big inflation issue is not in india it is in the us and the g7 world all these corrections in india are a positive opportunity for long term investors markets are going to be volatile because of the fed tightening cycle there has been a dramatic u turn change by the fed prompted by the very high inflation data the last cpi print in the us was 7 and the fed was targeting 2 but from an indian standpoint the indian currency is still holding up reasonably well the two risks for the indian market this year are the fed tightening cycle and the higher oil prices the domestic economy in india is supported by evidence of the housing markets in a recovery cycle which is very positive there s domestic demand cyclical momentum in india which will mean that the market will do okay despite the risk of higher interest rates i m more concerned about how the fed will contract the balance sheet we don t know what they re going to do on the balance sheet yet the inflationary pressures are in the g7 world they are much less in other places the rbi will have to tighten policy this year but in my view it is going to be nothing like the tightening that may happen in america the most important point in india is the evidence of cyclical momentum the forecast for the next fiscal year is 8 5 real gdp growth that is a positive particularly because we have had a high base effect modest rate hikes will not derail the economy so my advice is to take advantage of corrections caused by correlation with wall street we will get a rising current account deficit in india because of the higher growth india has much higher foreign exchange reserves than historically so yes i am hoping the indian currency will be more resilient than in the past the biggest external risk apart from the fed is oil the oil price can definitely go significantly higher foreigners will be selling because india looks expensive they have got profits and they re worried about fed tightening it doesn t surprise me if we get more foreign selling that doesn t surprise me people will be wanting to put money back into china so this year china is starting to ease monetary policy whereas india and the us will be tightening i don t think the rate hikes will derail economic recovery in india china just this year is in an easing cycle but the negative on china is that the chinese borders are still closed and they still have a very strict covid suppression policy which is causing economic growth to be slower than it would otherwise be we don t have that issue in india i am happy to own both india and china i don t think one is much better than the other in the short term longer term though i prefer india they have corrected so they should be exactly the areas that should be looking to buy in the short term the property sector will be impacted by rate hike concerns that s a good time to buy because long term we ve just entered a new property cycle in india which should run five seven years cryptocurrency is vulnerable with the fed tightening in the long term they are very interesting but in the short term we have already seen a big correction my core portfolio is in property and financials

advisor returns as of january 10 2022 i will now turn the call over to taylor taylor pickett president and chief executive officer thanks michele good morning and thank you for joining our fourth quarter 2021 earnings conference call today i will discuss our fourth quarter financial results skilled nursing facility industry trends and operator liquidity issues our fourth quarter adjusted ffo is 0 77 per share and funds available for distribution are 0 72 per share we have maintained our quarterly dividend of 0 67 per share dividend payout ratio continues to have cushion at 87 of adjusted ffo and 93 of funds available for distribution turning to skilled nursing facility industry trends the omicron covid area has paused the skilled nursing facility occupancy recovery and created further labor force stress omega snf occupancy has been virtually flat for the three months ended december 31 and the preliminary january occupancy is slightly down one interesting item is that in december 21 of our facilities are at or above pre covid occupancy levels which may indicate that full occupancy recovery is achievable over time unfortunately the already difficult labor shortage grew increasingly worse as staff became infected and were forced to quarantine these staffing shortages have limited many facilities ability to admit new residents which has had the knock on effect of backing patients up in the hospital systems although the impact of omicron appears to be rapid and transitory it is impossible to predict how quickly the industry occupancy recovery will regain traction or how rapidly the current labor force pressures will subside turning to operator liquidity issues and restructuring dan will provide detail regarding specific operator current liquidity and restructuring issues in general these efforts include one or more of the following actions one rent deferrals two asset sales or transitions to a new operator and three in certain cases rent resets with other amended lease provisions examples include elimination of purchase options future upward potential rent resets lease extensions or revisions of renewal rights and collateral enhancements adjustments or usage historically in many of our restructurings one or more of the actions that i have outlined are sufficient to protect the value of our assets and most if not all of the long term cash flow generation from the restructured assets we continue to remain hopeful that the outcome of our covered restructurings will yield a similar result finally i again thank our operating partners and in particular the frontline caregivers and staff who have cared for the tens of thousands of residents within our facilities i will now turn the call over to bob bob stephenson chief financial officer thanks taylor and good morning turning to our financials for the fourth quarter our nareit ffo for the fourth quarter was 124 million or 0 50 per share on a diluted basis as compared to 173 million or 0 73 per diluted share for the fourth quarter of 2020 our adjusted ffo was 190 million or 0 77 per share for the quarter and excludes several items as outlined in our adjusted ffo reconciliation to net income found in our earnings release in our supplemental and also on our website revenue for the fourth quarter was approximately 250 million before adjusting for certain nonrecurring items compared to 264 million for the fourth quarter of 2020 the year over year decrease is primarily the result of 16 million of straight line and lease inducement write offs in the fourth quarter of 2021 related to guardian and one other operator both placed on a cash basis in the fourth quarter of 2021 in our last quarter s earnings call in answer to a question i provided a revenue commentary on gulf coast agemo and guardian i want to provide an updated revenue status and a q1 2022 outlook on those operators dan will be providing operational updates on these tenants in his prepared talking points first regarding gulf coast in q4 we recorded 14 8 million of revenue based on our continued ability to offset any unpaid rent against the balance of the sub debt obligations owed by omega to be consistent with prior quarters only 7 4 million of revenue was included within adjusted ffo and fad at december 31 the sub debt balance was fully exhausted and therefore we will not recognize revenue related to gulf coast in q1 2022 looking at agemo in q4 we applied the remaining security deposit balance of 115 000 in october to partially cover october s rent agemo additionally paid rent and interest in november of approximately 4 6 million q1 2022 contractual rent and interest of 15 million will only be recognized to the extent agemo makes any additional payments as they are on a cash basis turning to guardian in q4 guardian failed to make any rent or interest payments and as a result no revenue was recognized in q4 in q1 2022 we will only record revenue to the extent guardian makes any payments as they were placed on a cash basis in q4 2021 lastly as noted in our earnings press release an additional operator representing 3 5 of contractual annualized rent and mortgage interest revenue did not pay its january contractual amount due under its lease agreement and ask for a short term rental forbearance if the operator does not make any rental payments during the first quarter and remains on a straight line basis for revenue recognition we would include 9 million of revenue for q1 for adjusted ffo purposes only however we will only recognize fad based on cash received moving to cecl in q4 2021 we recorded a 50 million provision for credit losses primarily driven by the funding and reserve of the 20 million gulf coast dip loan and a 38 million reserve related to guardian s mortgage loan moving on to the balance sheet it remains strong thanks to the steps we ve taken during 2021 to further improve liquidity capital stack our maturity ladder and our overall cost of debt on the debt side in march of 2021 we issued 700 million of 3 25 senior notes due april of 2033 our note issuance was leverage neutral as proceeds were used to repurchase to a tender offer 350 million of our 4 375 notes due in 2023 with the balance used to repay libor based borrowings we currently have no bond maturities until august of 2023 in march of 2020 we entered into 400 million of 10 year interest rate swaps at an average swap rate of 0 8675 these swaps expire in 2024 and provide us with significant cost certainty when we refinance our 2023 bond maturity in april of 2021 we closed on a new four year 1 45 billion unsecured credit facility and a 50 million unsecured term loan that both mature in april of 2025 at december 31 we had no outstanding borrowings on our revolving credit facility and we also had approximately 21 million in cash at december 31 over 99 of our 5 3 billion in debt was fixed and our net funded debt to adjusted annualized ebitda was 5 3 times and our fixed charge coverage ratio was 4 2 times it s important to note similar to nareit ffo adjusted ffo and fad ebitda on these liquidity calculations includes our ability to apply collateral and recognize revenue related to our operator nonpayments previously discussed however when the collateral fully exhausted a decrease in ebitda will impact our liquidity ratios on the equity side in may of 2021 we established a new 1 billion atm program throughout 2021 we issued 7 6 million common shares of omega stock generating 282 million in gross cash proceeds primarily through our atm program as previously disclosed in january 2022 our board of directors authorized a repurchase of up to 500 million of omega s outstanding common stock through march of 2025 we believe the actions taken to date provide us with significant liquidity and flexibility to weather the continued impact on our business primarily driven by covid 19 the steps taken over the past 12 months also provide us with the tools we need to continue to evaluate and act upon any additional actions that may be needed to further enhance our liquidity or improve shareholder value i will now turn the call over to dan dan booth chief operating officer thanks bob and good morning everyone as of december 31 2021 omega had an operating asset portfolio of 939 facilities with approximately 96 000 operating beds these facilities were spread across 63 third party operators and located within 42 states in the united kingdom trailing 12 month operator ebitdarm and ebitdar coverage for our core portfolio as of september 30 2021 decreased to 1 52 times and 1 18 times respectively versus 1 63 and 1 28 times respectively for the trailing 12 month period ended june 30 2021 during the third quarter of 2021 our operators cumulatively recorded approximately 26 million in federal stimulus funds as compared to approximately 49 million recorded during the second quarter trailing 12 month operator ebitdarm and ebitdar coverage would have decreased slightly during the third quarter of 2021 to 1 21 and 0 88 times respectively as compared to 1 22 and 0 89 times respectively for the second quarter when excluding the benefit of federal stimulus funds ebitda coverage for the stand alone quarter ended september 30 2021 for our core portfolio was 1 04 times including federal stimulus and 0 92 times excluding the 26 million of federal stimulus funds this compares to the stand alone second quarter of 1 2 times and 0 99 times with and without the 49 million in federal stimulus funds respectively occupancy for our overall core portfolio continue to slowly trend up throughout 2021 reaching a high of 75 8 in december up from a low in january of 2021 of 72 3 january 2022 mid month occupancy actually fell off slightly to 75 4 mainly as a result of the robust omicron variant turning to our senior housing portfolio today our overall senior housing investment comprises 155 assisted living independent living and memory care assets in the united states and the united kingdom this portfolio on a pure play basis had its trailing 12 month ebitdar lease coverage fall 1 basis point to 0 97 times at the end of the third quarter as compared to the end of the second quarter based on what omega has received in terms of mid month occupancy reporting for january to date this portfolio is averaging approximately 86 turning to portfolio matters on october 14 2021 gulf coast and operator representing approximately 30 million or 3 of annual revenue filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy in wilmington delaware as part of that filing the betters and omega agreed upon and entered into a restructuring support agreement since that time on december 1 2021 the management of omega s 23 of the 24 gulf coast facilities were transferred via management and operations transfer agreement to an unrelated third party and inspire healthcare subsequently on december 31 2021 omega entered into a purchase and sale agreement for the sale of 22 of the 24 gulf coast facilities to a separate unrelated third party the sale of the properties along with the change of ownership of the operations is anticipated to close sometime early in the second quarter of 2022 subject to the usual closing conditions as referenced on our previous earnings call omega has two other large operators that have ceased paying all or a material portion of their contractual rent the first agemo representing approximately 53 million or 5 5 of annual revenue stopped paying rent and interest in august of 2021 and with the exception of november every month since accordingly omega drew upon existing security deposits of approximately 9 5 million to pay all rent due for august september and a portion of october thereby exhausting our deposits we are in ongoing discussions with agemo which discussions may involve the releasing or sale of a material portion of their portfolio the other operator guardian representing approximately 37 million or 3 8 of annual revenue has failed to pay its contractual rent and interest since october of 2021 we have been and continue to be in active ongoing discussions with guardian to transition a significant portion of this portfolio to an unrelated third party the exact number of facilities involved and the timing of such transitions is still being finalized turning to new investments in 2021 omega has made new investments totaling 841 million including 164 million for capital expenditures subsequently on january 1 2022 omega completed an 8 million purchase lease transaction for one skilled nursing facility in maryland separately on january 31 2022 omega completed an 8 million purchase lease transaction for one care home in the united kingdom turning to dispositions in 2021 omega divested a total of 48 facilities for approximately 319 million including three facilities for 8 million in the fourth quarter i will now turn the call over to megan megan krull senior vice president of operations thanks dan and good morning everyone the covid case surge over the last month from omicron has resulted in case counts of both residents and staff combined at levels we have not seen since january 2021 however the severity hospitalizations and death rates are nowhere near where they had been pre vaccine so while omicron is not proving to be as much of an issue clinically it is exacerbating the already severely strained staffing environment in the long term care industry which in turn is impacting occupancy recovery while also substantially increasing staffing and staffing related expenses agency expense itself continues to increase and on a per patient day basis for our core portfolio for third quarter 2021 was more than 5 times what it was in 2019 vaccination rates in the industry continue to improve with residents and staff at approximately 87 and 83 respectively according to cms data with the staff percentage seeing meaningful movement given the impending federal mandate for the states that were not a part of preliminary injunction the deadline for full vaccination is late february with the other states with a deadline is mid march cms intends to enforce the mandate via the survey process starting in march with achievement of certain benchmarks and proof of a plan to reach 100 providing the potential to push any enforcement action out up to 90 days of the 25 5 billion release from the provider relief fund that hhs announced in september nearly 7 5 billion of the 8 5 billion american rescue act funds have been paid out starting in november with approximately 96 of applications having been processed and nearly 11 billion in phase 4 payments have been paid out starting in december with approximately 82 of applications having been processed while this additional release from the provider relief fund has been a welcome change from where this administration had been it is certainly not anywhere close to a cure all approaching what will be almost two full years of dealing with this pandemic day in and day out the long term care industry has forever changed as it continues to face new and increased challenges every day governmental support is needed now more than ever to deal with unprecedented staffing shortages and other increased costs and we are hopeful that this latest round of funding will prove to be just a first step in the right direction i will now open the call up for questions questions answers operator our first question is from jonathan hughes with raymond james please go ahead jonathan hughes raymond james analyst hey good morning bob could you please confirm that aggregate income that was booked in the fourth quarter from applying the security deposits that will not be in the first quarter i know you gave the figures i think is like 7 5 million from gulf coast to maybe like 4 6 million from agemo so is that about 12 million total is that right taylor pickett president and chief executive officer no the gulf coast is correct the 7 4 million for gulf coast for agemo it was only 115 000 the second part of the agemo they did pay as dan mentioned and i mentioned they did pay november rent payment in november jonathan hughes raymond james analyst ok and that s the last time taylor pickett president and chief executive officer sorry go on jonathan hughes raymond james analyst ok so that s the last time ok fair enough and then what is the can you share maybe the location of the operator representing that 3 5 of rents who did not pay in january i m just trying to understand if the location is partly to blame for why they re no longer paying and was that operator included in the 15 to 20 of at risk rents that was identified last summer taylor pickett president and chief executive officer so that operator is spread across several states throughout the south and i think it was a common they re all struggling in the south with labor it s the same sort of story still very new development it s very fluid and we re in ongoing discussion with that operator jonathan hughes raymond james analyst ok and was that there s analysis i think done last summer that kind of identified 15 to 20 of that risk rent was this operator in that bucket or is this maybe an incremental one taylor pickett president and chief executive officer i believe it was i d have to go back and double check jonathan hughes raymond james analyst ok bet i can follow up on that i saw that florida is your largest state and just yesterday the senate in tallahassee proposed a 375 million medicaid funding increase which is which reduce funding by almost 550 000 per snf is that figure is that roughly half the amount of contractual annual rent for the 115 or so properties you have in the state taylor pickett president and chief executive officer i haven t done that math to be honest with you but this is a bit of a process just like getting any bill passed it was very hard for me to see the put forth a budget with such a great rate increase i mean next up at the house they re going to push through another one which we hope will also be have high rent increases but sort of time will tell how that shakes out what we start with and what we end up with are not always the same thing but to do that math i would have to go back and look at that the math jonathan hughes raymond james analyst ok yeah hopefully we get some more clarity on that from the house shortly but last one for me what is the expected sale price and maybe the expected yield current or contractual on the 19 properties that are under contract to be sold and maybe that expected timing thanks taylor pickett president and chief executive officer yeah jonathan so there was 41 buildings listed for wholesale the remaining 19 that we didn t give a price it s around approximately 90 million and the timing hopefully will be since they re in held for sale that means there s timing involved but hopefully but in the next quarter or so jonathan hughes raymond james analyst ok and the rent maybe that was currently being booked taylor pickett president and chief executive officer yeah so in the fourth quarter related to those buildings we booked 1 7 million of rent jonathan hughes raymond james analyst ok all right great that s it for me thanks for the time operator the next question is from connor siversky with berenberg please go ahead connor siversky berenberg analyst good morning all thanks for having me on the call maybe a couple for megan here so based on the most recent bls data we re seeing that stiff employment headcount is down call it 15 while the hourly cost of labor is up around 15 so i m wondering within that framework can you give us a sense of what percentage of the snf labor force is currently attributable to agency labor megan krull senior vice president of operations i think that s probably pretty tough to determine we haven t looked at it from that perspective i know certain operators are obviously affected more than others but you have some buildings that hardly have any agency or no agency at all and then you have other buildings where it s a very large percentage of their workforce at any given point in time and obviously with the omicron variant in there agency is being used quite a bit more due to quarantines for the current staff and people being out with covid in general connor siversky berenberg analyst ok then i think in your prepared remarks you had mentioned that the cost was about 5 times that of your standard labor pool or am i mixing a message there megan krull senior vice president of operations it s about 5 times the agency usage that we had in 2019 which was pretty minimal so that s not as a percentage of the total labor it s just how much it s gone up over that time connor siversky berenberg analyst ok and then i mean i know this is a bit of an abstract question but given that we are approaching the time of the year when we could get a sense of what the preliminary ruling looks like i mean what kind of rate basket increase would you view as favorable and then what do you think could come in as draconian given the current operating environment megan krull senior vice president of operations i mean given where costs have gone i think last year was what 2 2 3 something along that line that would be a pretty draconian to me i would think you would need to be quite a bit higher given where costs have gone connor siversky berenberg analyst ok i think we d all agree with you there and then another one on occupancy trends you can see that guardian i believe recently reported a pretty strong increase in referrals i think it was the tune of about 125 do you get the sense that these patterns will reflect an occupancy gains in the coming months or do admissions remain difficult given the labor picture i mean what i mean to ask here are those increases in referrals translating to occupancy at present taylor pickett president and chief executive officer kind of kind of when you say guardian you re talking about what are you talking about connor siversky berenberg analyst yeah it came out of skilled nursing news the other a couple of weeks back taylor pickett president and chief executive officer ok not aware of that go ahead megan megan krull senior vice president of operations yeah i mean the only thing yeah i m not aware about either but the only thing i would say is we have quite a number of operators who have been telling us for quite a while now that the admissions are out there but they can t take them because they don t have the staff right so i don t think it s necessarily translating and it certainly isn t going to be translating in the omicron environment we ll see what happens if some of those staffing issues start to ease up a little bit once the surges go down connor siversky berenberg analyst ok thanks for that and then last question for me just thinking about the potential portfolio sales i mean where do you seek to push the proceeds from these sales i mean would you push them directly to the share buyback given your cost of capital and the risk of acquiring assets in the current environment or perhaps pushing it to the ongoing kind of maintenance capex or capital improvement projects you have taylor pickett president and chief executive officer so connor we still have the pipeline is incredibly active but we still have deals in the pipeline so i think step one is redeploying those that capital into pipeline deals and then if we don t have pipeline deals then i think we just we step back and think about the best way to allocate capital and we have put the tool and the toolkit with the share buyback so it s we have the potential to use that lever but i will tell you that that s something we wouldn t we would only use on a leverage neutral basis so we d be taking out that and equity we go that route but the priority for us is to support our current tenants the last thing we want to do is have a deal in our pipeline where we re not supporting our tenants which have always been the franchise for growth connor siversky berenberg analyst ok i ll leave it there thanks all operator the next question is from nick joseph with citi please go ahead nick joseph citi analyst thank you you mentioned that industry occupancy overall has stalled a bit but i think you said 20 of your portfolio is at or above pre covid occupancy levels so what do you seeing different at those facilities i don t know if it s geography or labor differences versus the other 80 that are still struggling megan krull senior vice president of operations there s a certain larger percentage within that bucket that s non snf so that s a piece of it we ve dug in quite a bit to look at state concentrations to look at size of buildings various other items that had affected covid originally and we haven t really seen much correlation other than how far did they drop originally right so if they were more than a 15 drop originally obviously it takes longer for them to come back but to be in that bucket they had a smaller percentage drop so that s why they re coming back a little bit quicker nick joseph citi analyst thank you and then just on the dividend how are you thinking about it for the remainder of the year obviously there s a lot of uncertainty in terms of rent collections and other noise in the numbers you declared the first quarter dividend already but how are you thinking about the policy just kind of more broadly bob stephenson chief financial officer consistent with how we ve talked about it in the past to the extent we re working through these restructurings but we have a view that long term cash flows are going to not going to be impacted or the impact is minimal then i think we ll be consistent with our dividend policy and i guess the best example of that is gulf coast that we had we have 30 million of rent which in q1 we re not going to collect any rent because they re in bankruptcy but we re going to redeploy those assets by selling them and we ll end up with call it 300 million net that we ll redeploy so the ultimate resolution on the gulf coast situation is a push from a cash flow perspective and i think to the extent that some of these other restructurings end up in that same realm and there s no reason to jump forward and say hey we re going to change our dividend policy but as everybody on this call knows it s an evolving environment we re going to be as transparent as we can what i d say today the policy is the same unless we see a long term impact on our cash flows we re not changing the dividend nick joseph citi analyst thank you very much operator the next question is from daniel bernstein with capital one please go ahead daniel bernstein capital one securities analyst hi good morning i just wanted to go back to agemo and understand have they not paid rent in january and maybe kind of what your expectations are for 1q rent versus 4q taylor pickett president and chief executive officer so they paid the last rent that they paid was in the month of november they did not pay december they did not pay january they have still not been the recipient of any provider relief funds there s kind of two buckets that came out of what i would call the easy buckets that the federal government was able to ascertain the amounts relatively quickly and those monies were distributed and then there will be more complicated applications which are being gone through as we speak so we do expect that there will be a significant amount of provider of lead funds coming to some of our operators including signature who did not get any funds in the first round and that likely will be a source for some rent going forward but that s sort of in the short run in the long run i think that signature portfolio is going to be we re going to probably slice off a fairly significant chunk of that and either release it or sell it much like we re doing in gulf coast daniel bernstein capital one securities analyst ok ok no that s great color and then just trying to go back to the labor environment some and you look at the rpr funds coming in you ve got the i guess jonathan said earlier the a potential increase in medicaid funding in florida maybe in texas is that enough to allow snf operators to better compete for labor i guess maybe the right way to ask it is is the prf funds and other government support just a shortfall relative to the increase in wages out there and can yes so just can snfs compete for nurses i think that s really the bottom line taylor pickett president and chief executive officer the short answer is yes but we don t it still remains to be seen how this all plays out one of the biggest issue in labor we have a permanent increase in the labor cost rate in this industry that is not going to let go the biggest issue is eliminating agency and i think we ll be able to get back into the balance with agency over time but i don t know that six months or 12 months or 18 months and that cost incrementally is pretty rough and i just don t know if you have a lot of sufficient support from the state to overcome that short term daniel bernstein capital one securities analyst ok that s all the questions i have thanks for your time guys operator the next question is from tayo okusanya with credit suisse please go ahead tayo okusanya credit suisse analyst yes good morning everyone in regards to the loan book you actually did take the charges according to fifo but going forward i m assuming those loans are still performing and they re still booking all the interest income associated with it is that a correct assumption or should we be making some adjustment for that in 2022 as well relative to what you received in fourth quarter taylor pickett president and chief executive officer that s correct we re we ve done our cecl work serve related to those and we are booking the interest as it s paid on this tayo okusanya credit suisse analyst ok that s helpful and then also during the quarter i noticed that you did have a severance charge i think on linkedin it looks like steven insoft has kind of moved on could you talk a little bit about that and kind of what that may mean in regards to what the setup for the future management team does it get replaced are those responsibilities being handled by someone else taylor pickett president and chief executive officer sure well first of all steven was a great asset and we really appreciated his time here at omega and we just got to the point in time toward the end of this year where it was time for both parties to separate is very amicable and his responsibilities have been moved into other senior members of the team including megan on the call and vegas gupta our senior vp of acquisitions tayo okusanya credit suisse analyst gotcha thank you operator the next question is from vikram malhotra with mizuho please go ahead vikram malhotra mizuho securities analyst thanks good morning thanks for taking the question so maybe just stepping back i guess can you sort of walk us through what sort of your base case versus maybe their case of sort of a recovery versus pre covid i think at nareit you were talking maybe late third quarter 22 just kind of how are you viewing sort of the recovery path from here on in terms of time line taylor pickett president and chief executive officer yeah so the recovery for us is really a focus on occupancy recoveries into the low 80 and hopefully ultimately back to 45 so if the pace of recovery post omicron is consistent with pre at call it 40 or 50 basis points a month then we have 12 months at least so i think we have to now be thinking about 2023 and hope that we don t have another variant come up that creates a pulse vikram malhotra mizuho securities analyst ok that makes sense and then just going back to the buyback can you maybe just give us a bit more color sort of what s the thought process behind authorizing it now in terms of you ve talked about a lot of funds you have some recovery going on the dividend in your mind is well covered so i m just trying to understand like typically when you ve seen other companies put buybacks in and it s usually when maybe the stocks are well below their nav or perceived nav i m just trying to figure out like what is is there some potential news that you re anticipating or event you re anticipating that would warrant the buyback now versus at some other point taylor pickett president and chief executive officer no it really is just putting a tool in the tool kit given that as dan mentioned we have the potential for additional asset sales and thinking about where that capital would go maybe it s on our balance sheet as cash hopefully we deploy it through the pipeline but it is another tool in the toolkit and we elect to on a leverage neutral basis deploy that cash vikram malhotra mizuho securities analyst is there some sort of level you re looking at in terms of floor or some number you re saying ok because you the last two years if i m correct i think you issued stock at 34 maybe 36 somewhere in that range is there a level which just says hey this doesn t make sense there s a big disconnect between us and where maybe private market is trading taylor pickett president and chief executive officer when you see the stock dip into the 20s that s interesting but we have not established a level now vikram malhotra mizuho securities analyst ok fair enough just two quick numbers question you mentioned looking at new deals today for where new deals are occurring what sort of coverage levels on an ebitda basis are you targeting or is the market focused on taylor pickett president and chief executive officer so a lot of underwriting is taking place based upon 2019 results to be honest with you because with occupancy down and labor costs up it s very difficult to get your arms around what those assets are worth with those type of operating results so a lot of it is based on historical results so the cap rates i don t think have changed much it s just not based upon current run rates it s based on historical and quite frankly we re seeing right now more opportunity in the u k than we are in the u s vikram malhotra mizuho securities analyst ok so i guess from an ebitdar coverage if somebody would enter a new deal a new lease today or you were on you d look at a number that what on an ebitdar basis north of 1 3 taylor pickett president and chief executive officer yeah historical vikram malhotra mizuho securities analyst ok and just the last question on that ebitdar so i know you said in place ebitdar excluding care funds i think it was 0 92 million i m just looking at the chart in your supplement where you break down the ebitdar coverages by ranges i think 36 of rent is between one sorry between one 24 is between 1 2 and 1 8 but the weighted average is 1 19 can you just maybe elaborate on that calculation taylor pickett president and chief executive officer yeah i can tell you that 1 19 is definitely a typo we will have we will go back and fix it vikram malhotra mizuho securities analyst what is the actual number taylor pickett president and chief executive officer i don t know i just we just noticed this like seconds before the call vikram malhotra mizuho securities analyst ok ok no worries i ll follow up thanks so much operator the next question is from andrew rosivach with wolfe research please go ahead andrew rosivach wolfe research analyst hey good morning guys how are you taylor pickett president and chief executive officer ok andrew how are you andrew rosivach wolfe research analyst yeah great so i got stumped on a question from somebody i think often people look at the stuff that isn t paying rent and they kind of assume like the ebitda is zero which isn t necessarily right would you have a sense of what your coverage buckets would look like if you included i think it s 89 that s in there what it would look like if you included the 11 that weren t taylor pickett president and chief executive officer well it will certainly be lower but no i don t have that off the top of my head andrew rosivach wolfe research analyst got it but it would be lower but it wouldn t be zero right there s some capacity to parent taylor pickett president and chief executive officer yeah not even close to zero andrew rosivach wolfe research analyst got it ok and in the 89 i m just trying to back that into the tenants the 11 the tenants that aren t paying now is the 3 5 in the 89 the new tenant that you announced this quarter taylor pickett president and chief executive officer yeah no they re not in that i don t think they are in the 89 you the are core i m sorry andrew rosivach wolfe research analyst they are in the 89 ok great that was it thanks a lot guys operator the next question is from john pawlowski with green street please go ahead john pawlowski green street advisors analyst thanks for taking the time maybe just one question on the capital plan for this year if your cost of capital stays in the same zip code as right now and acknowledging it s taking another leg down or stock taking another leg down this morning but what kind of aggregate disposition volume could we see come through the system this year taylor pickett president and chief executive officer well we ve already talked about the 400 plus million for the 41 held for sale assets so you got that and then the restructurings are still in process there s no doubt in my mind there ll be some sales out of that but taking that number is just impossible john pawlowski green street advisors analyst ok and then apologies if i missed it could you just give some expectations on pricing on the dispositions range of cap rates taylor pickett president and chief executive officer they re incredibly high because most of those assets currently have low cash flow numbers you re looking at multiples like 20 times cash flow very very high but remember it s what dan mentioned that the buyers are looking at how these properties performed pre covid and are looking at a post covid environment with our pricing john pawlowski green street advisors analyst ok all right thanks for the time operator the next question is from joshua dennerlein with bank of america please go ahead joshua dennerlein bank of america merrill lynch analyst yeah hey guys i guess one question i had is maybe what are you guys looking for or like a turn in the snf industry and maybe could you remind us if there s anything else on your watch list taylor pickett president and chief executive officer i mean well the key metric for us is just occupancy but yes some of that s going to be driven from staffing is that is that the question in terms of the term joshua dennerlein bank of america merrill lynch analyst yeah i guess is it just the labor component or i saw on your latest incident report that looks like 75 of your facilities have covid cases so i wasn t sure if like that was kind of impacting it and you got to wait for that to come down taylor pickett president and chief executive officer yeah so you re right it s all the components of that labor covid having that facility count go down and then ultimately occupancy as i think you ve heard a couple of times in this call we think there s more demand out there than the industry can serve because of the underlying labor issues which are partly driven by covid infection so they all run together ultimately for us though it s getting occupancies back and then what was the second half of your question joshua dennerlein bank of america merrill lynch analyst just an update on the watch list that report you put out last summer that study you did last summer where you kind of looked at your top tenants like are there still tenants that you re kind of watching that have been paying rent or we kind of passed all the ones that you were concerned about where there may be more to that taylor pickett president and chief executive officer we re not past tenants that we re concerned about i will tell you that we ve had additional tenants to express some liquidity concerns over the next couple of quarters so i think all of our constituents need to be very careful thinking that the restructuring type scenarios are behind us i m sure we will have more they might be small they might be bigger but it s there s no doubt we re going to be having these discussions for a few more quarters just no doubt in my mind joshua dennerlein bank of america merrill lynch analyst ok appreciate it thank you operator this concludes our question and answer session i would like to turn the conference back over to taylor pickett for any closing remarks taylor pickett president and chief executive officer great thanks everybody for joining us today as always feel free to reach out to the team and we ll be responsive have a good day operator duration 6 minutes call

early in the quarter we hosted a key opinion leader webinar on aro c3 our newest clinical stage investigational therapeutic designed to reduce production of complement component 3 or c3 as a potential therapy for various complement mediated diseases we also filed the cta to begin clinical studies and have been activating sites for first in human studies as with all other drug candidates currently in our pipeline we expect aro c3 to be the first rnai candidate against this target to reach the clinic we see substantial unmet medical need we could address across a variety of indications including pnh autoimmune hemolytic anemia c3 glomerulopathy iga nephropathy and lupus nephritis our preclinical data have been encouraging and given that this will be our eighth hepatocyte directed trim candidate in clinical studies we have a high expectation of success this program is also a good example of our speed we went from idea to initiating clinical studies in approximately 12 months we expect to move at similar speed for future hepatocyte directed candidates and as the extrahepatic platforms mature we have the potential to move at a similar level of efficiency during the quarter we and our partners also presented encouraging clinical data on multiple programs including aro hsd for nash aro aat also called tak 999 for liver disease associated with alpha 1 antitrypsin deficiency aro apoc3 for hypertriglyceridemia and jnj 3989 for hepatitis b virus infection without exception all of those candidates appear to be doing what they are designed to do and have been generally well tolerated we look forward to continued clinical development and learning more about the potential disease modifying capabilities of those agents we also signed a license agreement with glaxosmithkline for aro hsd that just recently closed we are happy to bring on a new partner and look forward to working closely with gsk as they prepare to start a phase 2 study under the terms of the agreement gsk received an exclusive license to develop and commercialize aro hsd in all territories except greater china which was retained by arrowhead arrowhead received an upfront payment of 120 million and is eligible for a 30 million milestone at the start of phase 2 100 million milestone at the start of phase 3 up to 190 million in milestones at launch in the u s and the major markets and up to 590 million for key sales milestones arrowhead is further eligible to receive tiered royalties of mid double digit to 20 on net product sales i expect gsk to be a great partner for this exciting genetically validated candidate they have a clear commitment to genetic medicine and defining an effective treatment for nash which could include a staggering number of patients understanding the complicated biology of this disease and addressing a potentially very large global market are substantial challenges indeed and we believe that gsk will be a powerful partner to complete clinical development and ultimately deliver a potentially important medicine to the tens of millions of patients who need it moving to our cardiometabolic programs we recently initiated arrowhead s first phase 3 study which i see as a key milestone event indicative of a maturing company the palisade study is a phase 3 clinical study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of aro apoc3 in adults with familial chylomicronemia syndrome or fcs aro apoc3 is our investigational rnai therapeutic designed to inhibit the production of apolipoprotein c3 or apoc3 a key regulator of triglyceride metabolism prior studies have been very encouraging where we have seen greater than 90 triglyceride reduction in some patient populations this type of dramatic effect could really move the needle for fcs patients who have very little in the way of therapeutic options at present we also made good progress on patient enrollment for the two aro apoc3 phase 2b studies in severe hypertriglyceridemic patients the shasta ii study and those with mixed dyslipidemia the muir study these are populations that we believe have few therapeutic options and data from our prior study suggests that aro apoc3 could be highly meaningful by lowering triglycerides and raising hdl progress on the aro ang3 phase 2b study in mixed dyslipidemia the arches 2 study has been rapid and i expect enrollment to be complete in the coming months we continue to see a big opportunity to help the millions of patients with elevated triglycerides and ldl cholesterol and we are optimistic that aro ang3 could be an important future medicine given our prior data and exciting work done by others to validate the target as has been our consistent practice at arrowhead of bringing the first rnai compound into the clinic against specific gene targets aro ang3 was the first rnai compound in clinical studies that targets angptl3 further the competitive landscape seems to have shifted even further in our favor with the recent announcement that pfizer has discontinued its partnership with ionis on its antisense approach to angptl3 of course we do not have deep knowledge of data coming out of that program and it is always difficult to compare results across different studies but given what we have seen publicly we continue to be confident in our candidate for instance data from our phase 1 2 study indicated the following aro ang3 has demonstrated very deep and durable activity enabling quarterly or less frequent dosing angptl3 levels were reduced in a dose dependent fashion from 78 to 90 after 100 200 or 300 milligrams of aro ang3 we saw mean triglyceride reductions up to 73 5 and mean non hdl cholesterol reductions up to 50 only two patients had elevated alts and in both cases there were concomitant medications associated with increases in alts and in both cases the elevation was transient and not associated with increases in bilirubin and we have seen no indication that aro ang3 led to any increase in liver fat let s now move to our pulmonary platform james will give a fuller review during this call but i wanted to highlight a few developments first we continue to make progress on the enac target but will likely not continue with aro enac the candidate that we are testing in a phase 1 2 study last year we have two to three next generation compounds that appear to have favorable pharmacologic properties compared to aro enac a step behind this we are also exploring ways to deliver pulmonary targeted drug candidates via subcutaneous administration which we believe would be a true breakthrough and are testing this for enac as well we are likely changing horses in the enac program but we have not yet settled on which new horse we ve also discussed our plans to file two new pulmonary ctas this year but had not previously disclosed the targets or disease areas i m excited to announce these programs formerly as aro rage and aro muc5ac each being developed for various muco obstructive and inflammatory pulmonary conditions we are on track to file ctas for both of these over the next quarter we will be presenting preclinical data at the american thoracic society meeting in may and we also plan to host a kol webinar or pulmonary specific r d day this year at the latter event we intend to go into detail on the biology of the targets present preclinical data introduce the commercial market opportunity explain our plans for the clinical studies and have an outside kol describe the clinical presentation of the disease and unmet medical need we are pleased that we expect to file two new pulmonary ctas in the first half of 2022 and are also on track to file a third by the end of this year that target and disease area remain undisclosed while still on the pulmonary platform we continue to make progress in covid and are currently testing compounds that are leading to substantially decreased lung inflammation in viral expression in animal models this is exciting for what they may mean for the current sars cov 2 but also potentially for other sars based coronaviruses as you may recall we are working to develop antiviral agents by targeting regions that are well conserved across known sars coronaviruses with the hope that we could treat current and future novel infections our progress here has also opened doors for us in other respiratory viruses where we now have active programs we could see that becoming a substantial sub franchise if you will within our pulmonary platform these are exciting opportunities for us and we look forward to updating you on our progress in addition to the two new pulmonary ctas in the first half of this year we are on track with aro dux4 our first skeletal muscle targeted candidate against fshd consistent with our prior guidance we expect to file that cta by the end of the first half of this year this represents a leap forward with the addition of another cell type we can target clinically and more specifically aro dux4 may offer us the ability to help a group of patients with no real therapeutic options recent failures and setbacks in the field have underlined the unmet medical need that currently exists and we are moving as fast as we can for the fshd patients who need us our partner programs have also made good progress j j continues its phase 1 progress in jnj 75220795 our partner nash therapeutic and jnj 3989 our partnered hbv therapeutic the latter is in multiple phase 2b studies that have started to read out and i would expect regular data from them over the next few years as we discussed on our last earnings call jnj 3989 is doing exactly what it was designed to do and we look forward to seeing how it performs over time and in combination with different agents olpasiran the candidate against cardiovascular disease that we licensed to amgen continues in a phase 2 study amgen has said publicly that they expect to complete the phase 2 in the first half of this year data from the phase 1 were impressive and we look forward to seeing phase 2 data and the initiation of a phase 3 aro aat has an ongoing phase 2b study that is currently starting to read out pk data at three different dose levels and will read out biopsy data in the third or fourth quarter we continue to work closely with takeda and expect to continue discussions with regulators this year about our data and plans for a pivotal study our work with horizon continues to move rapidly in the area of chronic gout and i will defer to them to provide guidance and future plans and timing lastly we completed a transaction to purchase 13 acres of land in verona wisconsin which is planned to be the site of a new gmp drug manufacturing facility and an associated laboratory and office facility construction is starting this quarter completion of the lab and office space is anticipated in early to mid 2023 and completion of the manufacturing facility is expected in late 2023 we will continue to operate additional research and development facilities in madison wisconsin and san diego california we also signed a lease to what will allow us to substantially expand our research laboratories and administrative offices in san diego in the first half of 2023 we believe the new arrowhead campuses will allow us to support our growing pipeline and we think positions us well to advance the manufacturing process including our commercial scale of our trim enabled drug candidates we view this as a strong competitive advantage as we approach potential commercialization of our rapidly progressing clinical candidates so in summary our pipeline is expanding and maturing our platform is providing additional opportunities to discover and develop new investigational medicines in areas where arrowhead has unique capabilities and expertise we are using business development selectively to maximize the value of our technology and to bring in non dilutive capital to support our internal development programs and we are investing to expand our r d footprint and take more control of the drug manufacturing process to support clinical and ultimately commercial supply needs we believe all of this puts arrowhead in a very strong competitive position with that overview i d now like to turn the call over to dr javier san martin javier javier san martin chief medical officer thank you chris and good afternoon everyone i will provide status updates on three of our later stage clinical programs aro apoc3 aro ang3 our investigational cardiometabolic medicine and aro aat also called tak 999 our investigational medicine designed to treat alpha 1 liver disease which is being codeveloped with takeda first aro apoc3 is our investigational medicine targeting apolipoprotein c iii being studied in patients with various lipid disorders collectively the mid and late stage clinical study for aro apoc3 are called the summit program we made good progress bringing on new sites for each of the studies and we re very pleased with the pace of patients enrollment i will discuss each study individually shasta 2 is a double blind placebo controlled phase 2b study of aro apoc3 in adults with severe hypertriglyceridemia or shtg this population is defined as having triglycerides greater than 500 milligrams per deciliter the primary objective of the shasta 2 study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of aro apoc3 and to select a dosing regimen for the later stage clinical studies in this patient population approximately 216 patients will be enrolled in this study moving on to the muir study which is a double blind placebo controlled phase 2b study of aro apoc3 in adults with mixed dyslipidemia this population is defined as having triglycerides between 150 and 500 milligrams and non hdl cholesterol greater than 100 milligrams or ldl cholesterol greater than 70 milligrams per deciliter the primary objective of the muir study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of aro apoc3 and to select a dose and dosing regime for later stage clinical studies in patients with mixed dyslipidemia a total of approximately 320 patients will be enrolled in this study the most recent study initiated in the summit program is palisade a phase 3 study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of aro apoc3 in adults with familial chylomicronemia syndrome or fcs these are patients with fasting triglycerides greater than 880 milligrams per deciliter that are refractory to standard lipid lower therapy and have a diagnosis of fcs because they tend to have extremely high triglycerides patients with fcs have an elevated risk of recurrent and painful bouts of pancreatitis these patients currently have very limited treatment options the primary end point of palisade is a percent change from baseline at month 10 in fasting triglycerides additional secondary and exploratory endpoints include the change in other lipid parameters incidence of acute pancreatitis and other measures approximately 60 patients will be enrolled in this study i will now move on to aro ang3 our investigational medicine designed to reduce production of angiopoietin like protein 3 angptl3 as a potential treatment for patients with mixed dyslipidemia the set of mid and late stage studies for aro ang3 is called the vista program the vista program has on active study and one additional planned study that i will describe briefly in a moment the currently active study is arches 2 a double blind placebo controlled phase 2b study of investigational aro ang3 in adults with mixed dyslipidemia this population is defined the same way as in the aro apoc3 muir study this patient had triglycerides between 150 and 500 milligrams per deciliter and non hdl cholesterol greater than 100 milligrams per deciliter or ldl cholesterol greater than 70 milligrams per deciliter the primary objective of the arches 2 study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of aro ang3 in adults with mixed dyslipidemia and select a dosing regimen for later stage clinical studies in this patient population total of approximately 180 patients will be enrolled in this study the next study plan for the vista program is gateway a phase 2 study of aro ang3 in patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia or hofh starting some pcsk9 inhibitors can inhibit cholesterol synthesis and enhance hepatic clearance of ldl cholesterol through up regulation of the hepatocyte ldl receptor patients with hofh can have this functional or absent ldl receptor and thus can be resistant to statins and even resistance to alternatives such as pcsk9 inhibitors patients with hofh are therefore a population with a particularly high need for additional therapies with a mechanism that works outside of the ldl receptor such as angptl3 inhibition gateway is an open label study that will be conducted in subjects with documented hofh based on genotype or clinical criteria up to approximately 16 subjects who meet eligibility criteria will be randomized in a 1 1 ratio to receive two doses of 200 or 300 milligrams of aro ang3 on day one and day 84 and will be evaluated over a 36 week period we re getting up to initiate this study in the first half of 2022 and we ll provide an update when the first patient have been enrolled consistent with the other phase 2 studies in both the vista and the summit programs we want to give arrowhead maximum flexibility to initiate phase 3 studies in multiple patient populations if the data warranted at the end of these phase 2 studies we hope to have a good understanding of the pharmacodynamic effect of both investigational medicine in various patient population with different baseline lipid profiles we believe that this will inform our development strategy and also help shape our commercial strategy in both well defined rare diseases as well as large high prevalence diseases i also want to give a brief update on aro aat also called tak 999 after receiving breakthrough therapy designation we began a productive dialogue with the fda about the program we expect to have data on the reduction of circulating level of aat from sequoia in the first half of this year which will be used to select a dose for phase 3 we should also be collecting the last 12 month biopsy from the last patients enrolled sometime in the summer of 2022 together with takeda we look forward to continuing the dialogue with the fda after one or both of these data readouts i will now turn the call over to dr james hamilton james james hamilton senior vice president of discovery and translational medicine thank you javier there are a lot of exciting new programs in discovery and early stage clinical development our r d organization is operating at an impressive pace and making important progress in multiple areas today i would like to focus on the pulmonary platform the planned expansion of the pulmonary pipeline and provide an update on where we are with aro enac as chris mentioned our newest pulmonary candidates are aro rage and aro muc5ac they are both on schedule to have cta filings during the first half of this year additionally we plan on filing a third pulmonary cta in q4 of this year the target for this third program will remain undisclosed at this time the first program aro muc5ac targets expression of muc5ac in bronchial epithelium muc5ac is a mucin protein with upregulated expression in the asthmatic airway muc5ac is not normally required for bacterial defense or mucociliary clearance in healthy individuals however in asthmatic patients its upregulation and enhanced secretion can lead to a muco obstructive disease state which is not directly addressed by currently available therapies the degree of mucus obstruction in the asthmatic airway is highly correlated with poor asthma control and increased disease severity additionally multiple genomewide association studies have demonstrated a correlation between enhanced muc5ac expression and the development of asthma similarly mice with a genetic deletion of muc5ac are protected from airway hyperreactivity in the setting of allergic stimuli again supporting the concept that mucac driven mucus plugging plays a central role in allergen induced airflow obstruction aro muc5ac is an extremely exciting program in part because it represents a fundamentally new way of treating asthma by targeting the mucus we have a unique and potentially very powerful tool an abstract summarizing preclinical data leading to the nomination of this clinical candidate will be presented at the american thoracic society meeting this spring the second program aro rage targets expression of the receptor for advanced glycation end products or rage which is primarily expressed by alveolar and bronchial epithelium rage is a transmembrane receptor that binds to numerous pathogen associated and cell damage associated ligands to activate various components of the innate immune system rage represents an upstream mediator of the inflammatory cascade in asthma as it is required for allergen induced release of il 33 into the airway and acts upstream of type 2 cytokines including il 4 il 5 and il 13 importantly a soluble component of rage known as s rage can be followed as a serum biomarker of gene target knockdown this is a very important point that i want to highlight the availability of a circulating biomarker will teach us a lot about the candidate and importantly may inform on the pulmonary platform broadly our hepatocyte directed trim system has proven to translate very predictively from preclinical models to human results and over the last few years that predictability has increased the speed of our new programs and our expectation of success we hope to get to the same point with pulmonary directed trim system and the availability of s rage circulating biomarker data informing on depth and duration of gene target knockdown using an inhaled route of administration could get us closer to that point animal data suggests that rage signaling plays a critical role in the pulmonary inflammatory responses to inhaled stimuli rage knockout mice to a markedly attenuated response to allergen exposure in animals rage is necessary for activation of airway inflammatory pathways relevant to both type 2 high and potentially type 2 low asthma phenotypes further studies have indicated that rage knockout mice are protected from allergen provoked increases in il 33 and tslp which represent key upstream drivers of asthmatic type 2 inflammation thus we believe rage inhibition offers the possibility of arresting the most proximal components of airway inflammation in asthma with potentially broad effects on a wide range of downstream inflammatory mediators in rats using a tool trigger targeting rage mrna single inhaled doses of 0 5 milligrams per kilogram induced s rage reduction of over 90 for approximately three months like our muc5ac program an abstract has been accepted for oral presentation at ats this spring which will summarize preclinical data for our rage program inhibition of both the muc5ac and rage targets may have clinical utility in severe asthma copd cystic fibrosis and other muco obstructive or inflammatory pulmonary conditions additional target background data and clinical plans will be discussed in the future as we approach the start of the clinical studies we are also making good progress on two additional pulmonary programs that are being developed to address respiratory viruses one is our covid program that targets highly conserved sequences in essential viral mrnas which may address sars cov 2 and potentially other future coronavirus outbreaks in a hamster sars cov 2 infection model our current lead candidate reduced viral load in the lung by 80 reduced histological indices of pulmonary inflammation by 50 and prevented body weight loss we are currently in the lead optimization stage and we ll provide additional updates when we can the other is a new program for an undisclosed viral infection in a mouse model of infection the current lead compound reduced viral gene expression in the lung by 90 and prevented body weight loss this is an early program but we are seeing what we believe are very promising results moving to aro enac as chris mentioned we have decided to focus our resources on next generation candidates we previously announced that the clinical study was voluntarily paused after findings of local lung inflammation in a rat chronic glp toxicology study we have since seen some local inflammatory findings in chronic glp monkey studies it is certainly possible that we are overdosing the animals and by simply changing the dose level and or dose intervals we would see a cleaner tox profile that could provide a faster path back to the clinic but we decided that the better long term path is to focus on next generation enac candidates we are currently interrogating several next generation enac candidates that appear to be substantially more potent than aro enac it should be noted that the drug exposure levels used in the cta enabling glp studies supporting the new pulmonary programs including the muc5ac and rage programs are significantly lower than those used in support of our first generation enac program thus we expect an ability to use less drug and less frequent dose administration with second generation programs compared to what was used in the aro enac chronic toxicology studies and anticipate overall enhanced toxicology species safety margins with second generation compounds the last update i d like to provide on the pulmonary platform is about future opportunities and the potential to add additional flexibility with regards to route of administration we ve been working on addressing pulmonary tissues via subcutaneous administration these are still early days but we have recently generated some very promising preliminary data with the aro rage program using subcutaneous administration again this is early but we view this as a potential breakthrough if this line of discovery bears fruit we intend to provide some data on these efforts when we go into more detail about the aro rage and aro muc5ac candidates at the appropriate forum this will likely take the form of a kol webinar or an in person and webcast pulmonary r d day in the first half of this year this is all very exciting progress and we look forward to discussing details publicly i will now turn the call over to ken myszkowski ken ken myszkowski chief financial officer thank you james and good afternoon everyone as we reported today our net loss for the quarter ended december 31 2021 was 62 9 million or 0 60 per share based on 104 5 million fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding this compares to a net loss of 20 7 million or 0 20 per share based on 102 8 million fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding for the quarter ended december 31 2020 revenue for the quarter ended december 31 2021 was 27 4 million compared to 21 3 million for the quarter ended december 31 2020 revenue in the current period primarily relates to the recognition of a portion of the 300 million upfront payment received under our collaboration agreement with takeda and the 40 million upfront payment received under our collaboration agreement with horizon revenue for each agreement will be recognized as we complete our performance obligations which include managing the ongoing aat phase 2 clinical trials for takeda and delivering a phase 1 ready candidate to horizon there remains 188 million of revenue to be recognized associated with the takeda collaboration which we anticipate will be recognized over approximately two to three years and there remains 27 million of revenue for horizon which we anticipate will be recognized by the end of calendar 2022 revenue in the prior period primarily related to the recognition of a portion of the milestones received from our license and collaboration agreements with janssen finally our license agreement with gsk for aro hsd resulted in a 120 million upfront payment to arrowhead which was collected in january 2022 we anticipate the majority of this to be recognized as revenue in fiscal second quarter 2022 any additional milestones achieved from our collaboration agreements would be additive to these amounts total operating expenses for the quarter ended december 31 2021 were 90 8 million compared to 45 4 million for the quarter ended december 31 2020 this increase is primarily due to increased clinical candidate costs that our pipeline has expanded and advanced through clinical trial stages as well as increased noncash stock compensation costs net cash used by operating activities during the quarter ended december 31 2021 was 61 3 million compared with net cash used by operating activities of 38 9 million during the quarter ended december 31 2020 key driver of this change was the increased candidate costs we continue to estimate our operating cash burn to be 60 million to 80 million per quarter in fiscal 2022 excluding any incoming milestone payments from our partners in addition we are planning to expand our manufacturing capabilities and expand our r d facilities we continue to estimate these capital projects along with routine capital expenditures will add an incremental cash outlay of 80 million to 90 million for full year fiscal 2022 turning to our balance sheet our cash and investments totaled 547 7 million at december 31 2021 compared to 613 4 million at september 30 2021 the decrease in our cash and investments was primarily due to cash used for operating activities with the collection of the 120 million upfront payment in january 2022 our current cash and investments totaled approximately 650 million our common shares outstanding at december 31 2021 were 104 8 million with that brief overview i will now turn the call back to chris christopher anzalone president and chief executive officer thanks ken and thanks to all of you for joining us today as you ve heard our early pipeline is starting to grow rapidly our mid and later stage pipeline is advancing on schedule and we are working hard to continue to expand the reach of our trim platform to enable more growth in the future these are all critical parts of building a sustainable business and growing shareholder value i want to take a moment to review what we see on the horizon as potential milestones for the business this year there s a lot going on so this list is certainly not exhaustive but include some of the key events that we will be tracking i ll start with our partner programs aro aat also called tak 999 for alpha 1 liver disease with takeda we expect data from the sequoia study on reductions in circulating aat levels and 12 month biopsy data and we will continue discussions with the fda aro hsd for nash with gsk we expect a phase 2 study to begin this year aro xdh for gout with horizon we hope to complete preclinical studies this year jnj 3989 for hbv with janssen we would expect additional clinical readouts from various ongoing studies jn 75220795 for nash with janssen we expect progress on the phase 1 study olpasiran formerly called amg 890 for cardiovascular disease with amgen amgen has guided to a phase 2 study readout this year i ll now talk about potential milestones for our wholly owned programs aro apoc3 for hypertriglyceridemia we expect to fully enroll the shasta 2 and muir phase 2 studies and made progress toward full enrollment on the palisade phase 3 study aro ang3 for mixed dyslipidemia we plan to fully enroll arches 2 phase 2 study and initiate the gateway phase 2 study aro c3 for complement mediated diseases we expect to initiate a phase 1 study and potentially have an initial data readout from the single ascending dose portion of the study in healthy volunteers and initiate the multiple dose portion in various patient populations pulmonary programs we plan to file ctas and initiate clinical studies for aro rage aro muc5ac and file a cta for one additional undisclosed pulmonary program we also have some early clinical data from the aro rage program we also could have some early clinical data from the aro rage program aro hif2 for renal cell carcinoma we intend to report additional phase 1 data at asco gu in february aro dux4 for fshd we plan to file a cta and initiate a phase 1 2 clinical study this is a big year by any measure we plan to push four new drug candidates into clinical studies and possibly a fifth if aro xdh with horizon makes it this year we hope to have some data released from six different programs we hope to fully enroll three phase 2b studies arrowhead has a lot going on and we look forward to numerous opportunities to show progress across the pipeline throughout the coming year thank you for joining us today i would now like to open the call to your questions operator questions answers operator thank you and our first question comes from madhu kumar from goldman sachs your line is now open madhu kumar goldman sachs analyst yeah thank you for taking our question so first one on aro aat maybe we can dig in a little bit on how we should think about the discussions you ve had so far and what potentially regulators need to see from the sequoia circulating aat data and from the liver biopsy follow up data javier san martin chief medical officer so let me first answer the last part of that question with regards to the serum aat values we re looking at that data to really do the dose selection but of course that s not going to be the only parameter we have data from liver z protein and of course fibrosis changes and of course safety as well so the dose selection we re going to make along with takeda over the next few months will come out of all that data set with regard to conversation with regulatory agents i prefer to not get into any details other than we had a very good introduction about 1 5 months ago under the breakthrough therapy designation we have planned a number of interactions this year to again define the phase 3 study or the registration study that will incorporate of course the dose selection christopher anzalone president and chief executive officer and i think it s important to point out that look this division has not considered to our knowledge any other drug candidates against this disease and so our first meeting was really to make sure that we re level set that we re all on the same page and you know what we really are there is broad understanding and appreciation for the unmet medical need of this disease there s broad appreciation i believe for the fact that this appears to be a disease of growing incidents as people are living longer because they re not smoking etc i think that that the world is starting to see that while historically this has been viewed as primarily a pulmonary disease and maybe secondarily as a liver disease as people are living longer as they re not smoking i think we re seeing greater focus on liver a portion of that so i think that we ve been really we ve had a great relationship so far with the fda on this and we look forward to taking the next steps madhu kumar goldman sachs analyst ok so second question relates to the cardiometabolic field for you all so how do you think about the launch of novartis leqvio and how that influences how you think about kind of the larger ambitions for drugs like aro apoc3 and aro ang3 christopher anzalone president and chief executive officer no that s going to be interesting as you know of course those the leqvio markets are sort of orthogonal to the markets we re going after there is overlap of course but it s not the same market i think that what we ve seen there is that i think what we will see is that there is acceptance for a subcutaneously administered cv drug leqvio appears to be a good drug there s clearly continues to be unmet medical need there but that s sort of i think as far as interpretation will go from watching what happens with that launch to what our expectations are we re really focused on the markets that we think we can address here for apoc3 it is fcs it is severe hypertriglyceridemics which we think is several million people the regulatory pathway is clear the markets are clear and then possibly mixed dyslipidemia we ll see for ang3 there is clearly we think an opportunity for treating those patients who still have elevated ldl and elevated triglycerides so we will be watching the leqvio launch but i wouldn t say that we are dependent upon a blockbuster launch there to be confident in the future of these two drugs madhu kumar goldman sachs analyst ok great thank you christopher anzalone president and chief executive officer sure operator and thank you and our next question comes from maury raycroft from jefferies your line is now open maury raycroft jefferies analyst hi thanks for taking my questions i ll do a two part question so for the two new pulmonary programs announced today are you using the same approach as enac with targeting integrin av beta 6 on lung epithelial cells and if so how consistent or variable is this target in the new indications then can you talk more about why the new programs will require less total drug james hamilton senior vice president of discovery and translational medicine yes sure so the answer to the first part is yes we re still using the same targeting ligand approach and there s no reason to believe that that would be any different across those two patient populations across the various populations that we intend to address with aro rage and muc5ac and so the second part of the question was christopher anzalone president and chief executive officer why are we confident that we ll be able to use less drug with the new programs james hamilton senior vice president of discovery and translational medicine yes sure so i think there s two reasons for that one is the availability of readily measurable biomarkers for both of those programs for aro muc5ac and aro rage that will allow us to i think better understand where we are in terms of knockdown that has always been a challenge for enac that there s not a great biomarker to measure i think the other aspect is that as we ve learned more about the pulmonary platform we have continued to gain an understanding of how much drug we can give and not see a tox signal so relative to the dosing regimens we were using in the enac program and if you might remember we were using a day one two three cycle in both the clinical program and the tox program we re confident based on what we ve seen that we can dose at lower levels and lower intervals and achieve the same level or better knockdown from the gene target christopher anzalone president and chief executive officer yes i think that s the big take out message that we expect to use substantially less drug and administer it less often with these two drug candidates and also as james said we ll have a better idea about depth and duration of knockdown we are a bit flying blind with enac and so we are probably in those tox species we re probably pushing too much drug in there and i think we ll have a much better time here titrating that in humans as we can see what knockdown looks like maury raycroft jefferies analyst got it ok thanks for taking my questions christopher anzalone president and chief executive officer welcome operator and thank you and our next question comes from ted tenthoff from piper sandler your line is now open ted tenthoff piper sandler analyst ok great thanks very much and thank you for all the update want i to get a sense for what we should be expecting on hif2 alpha at asco gu coming up james hamilton senior vice president of discovery and translational medicine yes so that study is fully enrolled and all patients are through their second biopsy post dose biopsy so they get a biopsy pre dose and post dose so we will share an update on of course safety and changes in a recist criteria as well as gene target knockdown so that s what we ll be sharing at asco gu vincent anzalone vice president investor relations and the highest dose level i think was double from the dose that we had previously presented and so this was the highest dose that we intended to go to james hamilton senior vice president of discovery and translational medicine yes this will be all three cohorts ted tenthoff piper sandler analyst and what s the total number of patients james hamilton senior vice president of discovery and translational medicine we ended up enrolling the 27 ted tenthoff piper sandler analyst great perfect thanks guys looking forward to the data operator thank you and our next question comes from mayank mamtani from b riley securities your line is now open mayank mamtani b riley securities analyst good afternoon thanks for taking my questions and congrats on the progress so just maybe if i could clarify on the preclinical work on the rodent and monkey studies for rage 2 and muc5ac have you conducted the same sort of studies where you saw the signal for enac did you say that work has already been done james hamilton senior vice president of discovery and translational medicine yes or is ongoing mayank mamtani b riley securities analyst ok and just maybe a follow up there is that information you d have before you get into the clinic james hamilton senior vice president of discovery and translational medicine we would certainly have to have toxicology studies that support the phase 1 dosing regimen so to answer your question yes christopher anzalone president and chief executive officer and on the chronic side mayank we have some ideas about what doses would provide what knockdown and over what period of time but again here with rage and with muc5ac we have the luxury of knowing that in humans and so we have the luxury of waiting to see what the depth and duration look like before we design those chronic tox studies and make sure that we are not administering substantially more drug than we would be in humans mayank mamtani b riley securities analyst and then a financial question i had was about milestones that we could expect this year and specifically from j j and amgen if they do decide to move into a next study like a two part question like how much would be the milestone and then the timing of that if you could remind us that would be great christopher anzalone president and chief executive officer yes we can t remind you because we never told you we are as you can imagine mayank our partners are sensitive about making those or can be sensitive about making those milestones too granular and so we ve not been able to say publicly what various milestone levels are and i apologize but i really i don t feel comfortable giving you guidance on when those could hit because those are j j and amgen s programs at this point mayank mamtani b riley securities analyst understood thanks for taking my question christopher anzalone president and chief executive officer ok operator and thank you and our next question comes from patrick trucchio from h c wainwright your line is now open patrick trucchio h c wainwright analyst hi good afternoon just a follow up on the apoc3 and ang programs i m wondering if there s a possibility of evaluating these compounds in a combination treatment and secondly can you tell us your latest thoughts on the potential for partnering these programs and what form that could take christopher anzalone president and chief executive officer sure we are not currently considering combining the two drug candidates we think that could be done but we haven t done any nonclinical work by combining them and we re just not considering at least right now clinical work combining them with respect to partnering look we think and i don t want to overstate this but these two drug candidates almost be like once in career opportunities these are these really do feel to us like drugs our data from the phase 1 2 studies were quite good the markets that these could help to address are clear the regulatory pathways are clear these are we think important new medicines and so we intend to hold on to these now these will be expensive particularly ang because we do recognize that ang is going to require an outcome study but given where we are now as a company we are comfortable taking that burden on given that we think the likelihood of success is high and these are important so at least right now we are planning on moving on to these and building a commercial force to sell both drugs eventually patrick trucchio h c wainwright analyst that s helpful thank you very much christopher anzalone president and chief executive officer welcome operator and thank you and our next question comes from luca issi from rbc capital your line is now open luca issi rbc capital markets analyst great thanks so much for taking my question and congrats on the progress just a few quick ones one maybe circling back on enac it sounds to me that the safety signal that you ve seen in rats was actually replicated in nonhuman primate so wondering if you can talk a little bit more about that and why you ultimately decided to switch horses so to speak here and then maybe on a1at i want to make sure i m clear is there a scenario where you can possibly file ahead of running a phase 3 or do you think at this point running a phase 3 is a must and then maybe last one on mixed dyslipidemia why going after this indication for both ang3 and apoc3 and not maybe prioritizing one versus the other christopher anzalone president and chief executive officer ok there s a lot there so let me start with aat i don t want to speculate on that we are interacting with the fda we ve had a we still far we ve had a good relationship with them we will continue to share data with them and have a discussion about what the fastest and best way to bring this important medicine to these patients is going to be so stay tuned on that we ll let you know as soon as we know what that is with respect to the mixed dyslipidemia and both apo and ang so let me be clear on that so first with ang this was always a focus for ang given what we saw in the phase 1 2 study given what we saw in nonclinical studies and given what we ve seen in gwas analysis we know or at least we think we know that this drug candidate is good at lowering ldl and lowering triglycerides and there s a clear need for that so we always saw a big opportunity going after that very large market now with apoc3 we are doing a phase 2b study in that population we don t yet know if we re going to do an outcome study to address that very large population but what we wanted was optionality and so we re going to do the phase 2b study we re going to see what it looks like and then we can and then if we do decide to do an outcome study would go ahead and do it rather than waiting in a couple of years while we have to do the phase 2b study i think that optionality is important i think it s worth the money we re spending on that phase 2b study now should that sort of come to pass that we do want to address that same general market with these two drugs i think it s a real benefit to be honest to have those two drugs because i think we re going to learn a heck of a lot in these phase 2b studies and potentially in phase 3 studies about how these drugs work and what kinds of patients they can help and so ultimately we re going to provide the cardiologists and lipid clinics potentially at least tools that they can use according to their patients needs and so they can really provide specialized personalized healthcare this is sort of the dream right of healthcare and so having those two tools and using them as they see fit we think is a really important thing so we see a big opportunity there and also look we want to take that market share there may be other apoc3 or ang3 inhibitors at some point in the future and we see no reason why we shouldn t take as much of that market share as possible and sorry what was the first question luca issi rbc capital markets analyst enac what did you see in monkey christopher anzalone president and chief executive officer yes yes ok so look we i don t want to go too much on that because we don t generally talk about glp tox findings but we did see some we didn t see exactly what we saw in rats but we did see some signs of some local lung inflammation and as we talked about what i think was happening is we were just i think we re giving more drug than we have to to be honest this once a day for three day cycle was designed because we wanted to make sure that we had a pretty wide berth once we see what depth and duration of the knockdown was we ve learned a lot since then and i think that that s we probably don t require that amount of drug and we probably don t require that frequent of dosing so it gives us confidence that for rage and muc and potentially enac 2 not only do we have i think more potent drugs but we have better understanding about how efficient it can be to deliver the drugs and so again we you don t know until you know we don t know until we re in the clinic but we do feel given the data we ve got both clinical and nonclinical we feel optimistic at least but that this platform that these drug candidates will be well tolerated and important potential drugs luca issi rbc capital markets analyst got it super helpful thank you guys operator and thank you and our next question is from alethia young from cantor fitzgerald your line is now open alethia young cantor fitzgerald analyst hey guys thank you for taking my question there are kind of two other similar types of questions but on this pulmonary franchise it seems like you re kind of branching out potentially into bigger indications but i just wanted to know kind of how you re thinking about building out pulmonary business that will be pretty similar to kind of partnerships and collaborations and now that you guys are longer are larger and hopefully capital markets open up one day you can get capital and do what you want to do for even big indications and that kind of just broadens it out to a larger strategic question here you have a lot of program you have a lot of collaborations you re moving forward in many different ways and i just want to know if the strategy is the same or do you guys think about keeping more of your kind of the core assets and how often do you also think about kind of building with bigger potentially albeit commercial opportunities where it may take a bigger investment on your expense side but something that could yield like much bigger opportunities too thanks christopher anzalone president and chief executive officer sure thanks alethia it s still early with pulmonary but we like the space and we like the idea of building out commercial for pulmonary i think there are around 16 000 pulmonologists in the u s and when we look at that when we look at what we think our pulmonary platform can do we don t see two or three drugs we see eight or nine drugs and so we like the idea of building out of sales force to address those 16 000 pulmonologists who have eight or nine drugs in the bag that s an efficient way i think to build a commercial force so right now we like the idea of holding on to those assets look the lung is a target rich environment and so it is certainly conceivable that enough targets will come up that we may want to partner on here or there but strategically that s how we re thinking about it you ve heard us talk about this before that that if we re going to build a company that i think that we should be building we need to have a large a relatively large number of important drugs that we commercialize ourselves and so we re cognizant of that we re not going to over partner we partner in order to a get drugs to patients that we can t get them to very well and b to provide us capital so we can afford to run our own programs and we ll continue to use that partner strategy in that kind of way alethia young cantor fitzgerald analyst i appreciate that christopher anzalone president and chief executive officer welcome operator and thank you and our next question comes from joel beatty from baird your line is now open joel beatty baird analyst hi congrats on the progress and thanks for taking the question first question is on aro rage how close is the relationship between the circulating s rage biomarker and activity in the lungs to be able to really help with sampling the dosing thanks james hamilton senior vice president of discovery and translational medicine yeah so the s rage comes from two different origins it s a splice variant that is secreted or it s cleaved off of the actual rage receptor that s transmembrane receptor so by measuring the s rage we should have a very good idea of what knockdown of that receptor is i hope that answers your question joel beatty baird analyst yes and as a follow up how closely behind could subcutaneous lung programs be to the lung administered programs christopher anzalone president and chief executive officer it s too early to tell on that these are early programs and we are excited about it because again if we can make this thing work and make it scalable it s a real breakthrough so it s a real focus of ours we re not quite there yet so it s hard to tell how far away we are i do expect that we will do we ll see what covid looks like but hopefully an in person pulmonary focused r d day or at least a webinar at that point i think we ll be able to share some of our data again it s we re excited about it but we re still working on it joel beatty baird analyst great thank you operator thank you and our next question comes from mani foroohar from svb leerink your line is now open mani foroohar svb leerink analyst thanks guys so i m digging through this angptl3 data from ionis which we also cover they have previously shown 62 knockdown with their 80 milligram dose we don t actually know what the 320 milligram phase 2b knockdown really look like we haven t seen that full data but with you guys at 300 you took 88 knockdown some of nuances around dosing obviously in terms of frequency etc given the commentary from pfizer that suggests that perhaps despite seeing impressive knockdown they hadn t seen that translate to reproducing the level of clinical benefit on triglycerides non hdlc etc are there specific data sets that you guys look at that suggest the knockdown that you re seeing will translate to those clinical benefits when they did not in the larger clinical trial that pfizer showed and i have a quick follow up javier san martin chief medical officer well we have what we presented the ldl and non hdl data and triglycerides data with that level of knockdown in the 80 to 90 range from the 200 and 300 milligrams dose so the non hdl and ldl data is clearly superior to what ionis had presented in the past but we don t know what is current data exactly so we do believe that there is at least three different sources that speak to the correlation between the level of knockdown or the level of suppression of angptl3 and the pharmacodynamic effect the gwas study the regeneron data and the comparison so far between the ionis and our data if you look at the regeneron data they do need to dose pretty high to get to the level of suppression to achieve the pharmacodynamic effect and we did see a dose response in our case as well and again as i said we ll study the differentiation between the heterozygote and homozygote is quite clear so i think this is a target where the magnitude of the target suppression correlates with the clinical or the pharmacodynamic effect christopher anzalone president and chief executive officer and i think so if you look again it s very difficult to compare these because we haven t seen their data really in these 2 separate studies but you look at their dosing once every 2 weeks or once every month we re doing it every quarter and potentially less frequently second you look at alt increases we had 2 patients with alt increases and we think we know why that was we think it was related to other medications those 2 patients we re on so we think that that s difference third we haven t seen increases in liver fat it sounds like they did and so i think this is a good example broadly of the advantages of rnai over antisense i think whenever you can compare those 2 modalities rnai is leads to deeper and more durable knockdown the safety profile if the sequences are chosen correctly it can also be favorable so we feel great about the candidate we still feel great about the target as javier points out at the gwas data as well as other data mani foroohar svb leerink analyst yes so that makes sense to me but what i m trying to understand so the what we have is limited to a press release obviously from pfizer they didn t have formal events the commentary around what they saw as clinically justifying going into a large complex phase 3 how do you think about what your threshold would be around what would be a number that justifies going in a phase 3 in a broad patient population as opposed to something like a more narrow and niche defined population like what are the do you think the numbers that you previously showed adequate or do you think pursuing a higher deeper more aggressive knockdown even than what you ve seen so far is necessary christopher anzalone president and chief executive officer look we ll see we ll take a look at our phase 2b data we ve seen ldl reduction of as much as 50 mean reduction as much as 50 we ve seen triglyceride reduction and i think in the 70 or so percent range something like that those are substantial now we re not going to see clinical outcomes in a short study and so i don t so we re dependent upon these surrogate endpoints but i think those are substantial you look around at other triglycerides lowering agents and there s just not much out there and i think that that if our data put it this way i think if our data continue to roll out the way we ve seen them so far in the phase 1 2 study i think that that would be that would give us good confidence to go into an outcome study mani foroohar svb leerink analyst great that makes sense to me thanks for taking the questions guys christopher anzalone president and chief executive officer welcome operator and our next question comes from keay nakae from chardan your line is now open keay nakae chardan capital markets analyst yeah thank you two questions first subcu admin to the lung are you using the same conjugate targeting ligand for integrin or you evaluating something different and is the primary performance objective a better safety profile christopher anzalone president and chief executive officer yes so i can t answer the first question because we are playing around with various ways to do this and so hold off and when we present we can talk more about it so i want to say that we re looking for a better safety profile that s it s a good question it s not as though we are afraid of the inhaled route but it just makes our life simpler right if we can administer this via subcu there are unknowable questions that you don t have any longer about or unanswerable questions that we don t have any more with respect to a safety profile in tox animals so it does make our lives easier but also look it s an easier mode of administration for or potentially all indications rather than using a nebulizer which is still relatively light touch but still requires having a machine and require some time that s just more cumbersome than a simple subc injection that could be who knows once every two weeks once a month once every three months whatever that s going to be that s just a more convenient mode of administration we think that that would be just a massive breakthrough in this field and again i don t want to oversell it because we re not there yet but what we ve seen so far has told us that we want to continue to explore this keay nakae chardan capital markets analyst ok great and just a clarification on the upfront from gsk the 120 million you received in january how much of that will be recognized as revenue in fiscal q2 and how much might be amortized over some period of time christopher anzalone president and chief executive officer sorry can you repeat that keay nakae chardan capital markets analyst the 120 million upfront from gsk received in january how much will be recognized as revenue in fiscal q2 versus how much might be amortized period of time ken myszkowski chief financial officer probably all of it will be recognized in fiscal q2 our performance obligations are basically complete for that milestone that we received keay nakae chardan capital markets analyst ok great thank you ken myszkowski chief financial officer thank you operator and thank you and i am showing no further questions i would now like to turn the call back over to christopher anzalone for closing remarks christopher anzalone

these foundations to deliver great value to service a growing customer base which is up 30 million customers since 2015 increasing profits improving profitability our rote is up close to 170 basis points since 2015 and of course strengthening our capital base in a very significant way as well as delivering sustainable returns to our shareholders just a couple of numbers on this we have remunerated shareholders with eur 19 billion since 2015 and our tangible nav has grown by eur 12 billion since then so i m very pleased to report that a strong 2021 takes us very close to meeting our 2019 investor day targets in spite of the pandemia actually in some cases we re ahead and we will continue to focus on growth profitability strength including shareholder remuneration we are guiding for 2022 a mid single digit revenue growth cost income close to 45 and return on tangible equity above 13 and we are aiming to keep our cet1 fully loaded at around 12 we re also aiming to keep the 40 payout in 2022 of which as we already said will be 50 share buybacks and the other 50 in cash i also want to say that longer term we aspire to increase our total shareholder remuneration beyond the 40 to around 50 again through share buybacks and growing our cash dividend while maintaining a cet1 of 12 this would be of course subject to future corporate and regulatory decisions and approvals so if we go to the next slide you ve seen a very strong 21 results our net profit is actually up 25 from 19 underlying in a similar percentage reflect as i said the strength and resilience of our business model we onboarded five million new customers we are growing revenues by 7 to over eur 46 billion we again increased efficiency and reduced the cost of credit that s down to just 77 basis points and generating a return to shareholders as measured by tangible nav per share and cash dividend per share of 11 importantly 2021 was a pivotal year for us in terms of capital we are at the high end of the range delivering a 12 cet1 fully loaded and going forward as i already said we expect to keep it at these levels of 12 so you can see our p l here we have been able to recover actually more than recover our pre pandemic levels of customer activity in terms of the underlying profit before tax again it s a record high of eur 15 3 billion actually on the quarter it s the highest underlying in 12 years and this is up 21 our underlying profit of eur 8 7 billion that s up 80 versus last year 23 compared to 19 and again this reflects optimal cost of risk but also very strong execution of what i have said many times is a structural change in our business model very importantly as you can see revenues are growing more than cost with a positive operating leverage very strong capital generation in the year and up to cet1 of 12 even though we had significant regulatory headwinds this year even more important is the strong business momentum and you can see some examples here we are moving our business model to more fees diversifying into different sources of revenues linked to our customer focus these are only some examples loans and deposits are growing mutual funds are growing at 13 but in the higher return value added services which are really what s adding to our profitability our pos point of sales up 38 insurance premiums up 12 our new buy now pay later this is a business we have built on top of our tech stack openbank in germany it s going across europe soon two million customers in the first few months debt capital markets m a fees up 16 this is really important for the future and these are the businesses in which we re investing more heavily jose antonio will give you details later on the regions during the year we also leveraged the diversification and scale of the group these are two key elements and we are working more and more in this key strength of our business model so operational performance is improving across the board europe north america south america our digital consumer bank which as you know combines our auto and consumer finance and openbank is one of our important growth initiatives in europe we are working really hard to transform the business model return on tangible is close to 10 as you can see in the slide our customer focus is also showing up in better nps across the different countries and again the structural changes have led to cost efficiencies of around eur 200 billion and this is an area we continue to focus on for next year north america we generated a return on tangible equity of close to 25 we are working also in a structural basis in the u s i ll give you more details later on and really trying very hard to leverage the connectivity across the group our experience in consumer finance in europe and latin america and other relationships that are global corporate investment banking also have made great progress in north america and in mexico we are increasing profitability and been very successful in growing new business like the auto business organically south america again a standout performer with chile and brazil being the best bank in terms of profitability in their respective markets and overall returns of 26 we re growing double digit in terms of revenues growing in terms of market share and growing customers in very different segments in all these markets our digital consumer bank again very strong year producing a return on tangible equity of around 15 i would like to point to two key numbers in this slide if you look at the group s customer loans and group underlying profit you can see europe is where we have 60 of our loans and 28 of our profits again this means our business is more dependent on lending in europe this is something we re working on to increase fees and increase profitability it also means reduced risk as a lot of these loans are secured and mortgages in countries like the u k and spain south america on the contrary you can see 14 customer loans 31 underlying profit this is exactly the example of very positive operating leverage very diversified businesses many of them high growth fee businesses linked to digital initiatives like auto platforms getnet and other such businesses same in north america as you can see 14 of the loans and 29 of the profits we have been leading and intend to continue to lead on the responsible banking and here we have very specific targets in terms of our green transition for us and our customers building a more inclusive society and of course talent and diversity so in terms of the green transition we are working with our customers to help them in that transition we are focused on delivering on our own net zero ambition by 2050 which of course includes our customers in terms of our own operations we re already net zero and we are working again on the advisory side on the capital markets but also increasingly developing retail and sme products we originated eur 61 billion in green finance since 19 we have eur 27 billion under management and with the no 1 bank in project finance in renewal energy but we re again making a lot of progress in our very important goal of empowering 10 million individuals by 25 we re on target to reach that we ve done some we ve empowered seven million people in 19 and also allocated eur 500 million in microfinance in 21 as i said before we are very very focused and proud to have been no 1 bank in bloomberg gender equality index and no 2 company worldwide and this is an area where we ll continue to focus as we think diversity is not just the right thing it s also good for business so in summary responsible banking we believe is key to delivering on all our other commitments we are creating value for our shareholders we did set a 40 payout of underlying earnings in equal parts between cash dividends and also buyback programs we ll be announcing in a couple of weeks the second dividend after the interim dividend of eur 1 7 which was half and half between cash and buybacks we continue to believe buybacks are an excellent investment of our capital and so that would be the intention for the second dividend as well so i will now pass over to jose antonio who s going to review the regions and detailed operating metrics for the year jose antonio alvarez vice chairman and chief executive officer thank you ana and good morning to everyone as ana has already commented we recorded that a pretty strong set of results in 2021 with an underlying profit of eur 8 7 billion 78 higher year on year in constant euros driven by a very positive performance across the board notably in u s u k brazil and the cib and wealth management businesses our net operating income pre provision profit was around eur 25 billion with an increase of 9 year on year but i think is remarkable this was driven by a 7 revenue growth net interest income grew 7 on the back of higher volumes lower cost of funds better credit spreads in latin america and some starting some positive impact from recent interest rate hikes in some latin american countries and poland net fee income rose 8 year on year double digit growth in corporates wholesale banking and wealth management insurance due to greater commercial and financial activity costs increased half of the pace of the revenue what has driven significant efficiency improvements the significant fall in loan loss provision across the group accelerated in q4 with driven by the improving in the macroeconomic outlook and the very positive performance of our main portfolios if we look at one step down in the p l and we analyze the quarterly trends in core lines we saw improving trends across the board and the p l lines through the year q4 was the profit of 2021 of eur 2 3 billion after a good behavior particularly on the provisioning side but also this some of the releases were offset for the contribution to the positive guarantee from bank levy the charge for the swiss francs in poland so net net the quarter is fairly comparable with the previous ones in more detail sustained customer revenue growth plus 4 nii and 3 income quarter on quarter driven by greater volumes initial impact for interest rate hikes as i mentioned before and growth in higher value added products and services q on q increase in cost is almost fully explained by so this does not represent a running rate for the coming year in addition a lower loan loss provision in q4 favored the aforementioned provision release i will run through the costs and provisions in more details in the following slides on the cost side we have seen significant inflationary pressure around the world group costs rose 4 in constant euros but were 2 lower in real terms absorbing higher it expenses digital developments increased activity and labor agreements that particularly affected in the second part of the year our efficiency ratio improved to circa 46 this was basically driven by europe minus five full percentage points which recorded the highest efficiency gains i should stress that the cost in spain went down 7 in portugal 5 and u k also decreased this is more to come in 2022 and we are on our running rate will decrease in line with our targets for the region we continue to make a structural change to our operating model to drive new improvements in productivity which should enable us to maintain cost growth below inflation and further improve our efficiency rate so on the credit quality the balance sheet remains i would say robust npl ratio at 3 16 below 2020 and 2019 provision is down 37 in constant euros due partly due to the releasing provisions in q4 we also have significantly cost of credit was mentioned already by ana to 77 basis points below 2020 and 2019 levels and exceeds our initial 2021 target in 2022 we expect to maintain the cost of credit below our ratio through the cycle spain will be key as we expect cost of credit to reduce to approximately 50 basis points offsetting some normalization in the u s and u k finally on capital in 2021 we reached a fully loaded core equity tier 1 of 12 12 thanks to the strong operating results with the lever quarter over quarter in q4 we generated 42 basis points organically a combination of net profit net of dividends and also the efficiency efficient risk weighted asset management that the risk weighted assets were flat in the quarter negative impacts in the quarter of two basis points due to small regulatory impacts we already spoke about this in the previous quarter nine basis points due to market movements affecting some alco portfolios and five basis points from the minority interest that in mexico including acquisition of scusa that was approved the same week was executed in the same week of eight basis points we closed at 31st of january 2022 and the announced acquisition of the broker dealer amherst pierpont that affects eight basis points with this still subject to completion which will have an impact of 16 basis points on our pro forma cet1 ratio will stand at 11 96 we were able to combine this performance with an increase in tangible net asset value share looking at the regions starting with europe we are accelerating our business transformation it s where we are pushing harder in changing our operating model profits doubled in the region reaching eur 3 billion with higher profitability due to volume growth particularly mortgage in line with economic recovery 24 net operating income supported by wider jobs in most countries revenue was up 11 particularly customer revenue while costs were flat ongoing due to the long efficiency gains 32 reduction in loan loss provision and our cost of credit improved to 140 basis points in the following slides for the sake of clarity includes the return on tangible equities adjusted to the 12 return core equity tier 1 in all the units due to the fact that in order to have a like for like comparison between the units and given the fact that they have different very different capital ratios we are making this adjustment so in europe starting with spain spain showed a strong pickup in activity in individuals mortgages consumer lending customer funds also grew significantly in the last year profit nearly doubled boosted by strong net operating income performance 10 full percentage points revenue grew 3 and efficiency gains drove 7 reduction in costs loan loss provision reduced 8 year on year and in 2022 we expect to have our cost of credit so as we expect a single digit balance sheet growth in 2022 in u k we improved fourfold is a fourfold increase in profit basically by record net mortgage lending you don t see this in the loan book that only grows 0 5 due to the fact that we completed the transfer of the cib business to the london brands and this affect some of the loan portfolio went from plus 22 year on year growth in nii due to repricing on volumes on the mortgage that i mentioned before cost savings from our transformation program partially offset by it investments and regulatory related programs efficiency improved by nearly 11 full percentage points loan loss provision releases reflecting balance sheet strength as a result we achieved double digit return on tangible equity in u k in north america we improved our competitive position in the increasing connectivity in the region consolidating it functions and advancing significantly in the business simplification we also announced several transactions in 2021 in line with our strategy to deploy capital in the most profitable business volumes grew driven by our main segments in both countries profit doubled driven largely by the lower provisions and higher revenue in the u s o in the u s we had extremely positive 2021 on a like for like basis excluding puerto rico and bluestem portfolio disposals along with double digit growth in auto originations customer funds increased due to retail deposits with a significantly lower cost of funding underlying profit increased sharply supported by an 11 increase in net operating income and nii fees and auto lease results and 85 decline in loan loss provisions in short strong performance with u s being one of the engines of the group in 2021 results mexico to increase our stake to over 96 and continue to invest in the franchise reflecting in positive results and customer growth in a challenging environment rate cuts in 2020 unfolding volumes we were able to quickly adapt resulting in improving trends during the year as a result we delivered 8 increase in profit thanks to the loan and deposit growth controlled costs well below inflation despite it investments and better cost of credit finally the region of south america we continue to stand connectivity we are a market leader across the region we are capturing synergies across the region and we had new business opportunities investing our already profitable franchise we saw strong customer growth in all the countries where we are leader in quality of service as we measure in nps in terms of results in 2021 we delivered greater volumes in all countries double digit customer revenue growth increased productivity with gross growing below inflation and lower cost of credit in all countries that resulted in strong profit and very high return on tangible equity in brazil another excellent year record customer attraction more than five million customers which made to significant growth in individuals growing loans to individuals growing 22 consumer finance 12 and smes plus 15 this translates into the p l with a return on tangible equity well above 20 double digit growth in customer revenue and record annual efficiency levels below 30 for the first time maintained credit quality at comfortable levels in chile our digitization process allow us to increase significantly our customer attraction which is reflected in the plus 23 increase in demand deposits and double digit fee income growth widen the gap in nps with our competitors being the market leader excellent year on year profit performance nii plus 10 improved efficiency increase in capital lower cost of credit driven by better than expected performance in smes and corporates the consumer bank digital consumer bank balance sheet dynamics were solid new business activity has recovered to the pre covid levels up 10 despite the challenges posed by covid restrictions and the semiconductor shortage of note was auto plus 13 origination on the back of increasing our market share by 50 basis points across europe additionally we are working on the expansion of openbank which performed very well in the year in terms of customer increase and volumes loans grew 48 customer funds 24 total digital consumer bank revenue was boosted by the new business recovery particularly fee income and leasing positive year in credit quality with further reduction in cost of credit in summary excellent results reflecting a 16 underlying profit growth and increase in profitability return on tangible equity achieving 14 going to the two businesses that we report as secondary segments both have had in the industry a very good year and the corporate investment banking well revenues grew 10 sharp improvement in loan loss provision we are gaining share and we are on top of the market in finance top 3 in project finance in europe and latin and as ana mentioned focused on the sustainable alternatives and esg through the green financing we are investing in the business the cost increase as we are investing both in continental europe u k and u s to develop new capabilities to serve our customers in wealth management insurance excellent business performance in 2021 record commercial flows of eur 20 billion eur 12 billion in private banking and eur 8 billion in the asset management insurance premium and protection business increased double digit wealth management insurance total contribution to the group increased 12 to eur 2 3 billion finally on pagonxt well we made the commitment to grow the business to grow the revenue 50 so we achieved eur 500 million 47 year on year merchant acquiring getnet continue to deliver growth increasing the number of active merchant and total payments volume by 50 getnet brazil recorded significant market share gains getnet europe started to operate in the second half of the year as a pan european acquirer following integration of former wirecard s technology international trade one trade currently connects our customers in santander banks exceeding 8 000 active smes and corporates double in size since march in summary we have significant progress in the last 12 months as pagonxt as we invest in world class technology and to create the best payments to continue doing the right thing and launching new products and i turn over the floor to ana to continue with the presentation ana botin executive chairman thank you very much jose antonio so as i said we re delivering today and we are building the santander of tomorrow we believe in an area of digital revolution this is absolutely essential and i have to say first of all i am hugely proud of our team and the progress we have made over the last few years we have made the foundation to deliver great value and service to our growing customer base which as i said was up 30 million since 2015 we have at the same time increased profit we have improved our profitability and we have strengthened our capital base as well as delivering sustainable returns to shareholders i am incredibly excited about what lies ahead we are continuing our journey to become the best open financial services platform acting responsibly and earning the lasting loyalty of people customers shareholders and communities and this is what is driving our day to day across regions and businesses in our daily work actually we re not just of course meeting our legal and regulatory expectations our aspiration is to exceed all our stakeholders and our people s expectations this is a key driver to attract the best talent which as we know is the basis of success for any company these days so we are focusing on the areas where as a group we can have the greatest impact helping more people and businesses prosper in a way that is simple personal and fair i mentioned earlier our unique business model delivering more predictable and growing results through the cycle and this is the case not just over the last few years but over the last 20 25 years we have a diversified geographical footprint which is well balanced between emerging and developed markets i would like to note especially the contribution of the u s to the group s underlying profit increase from 7 in 19 to 22 this year we are building on a global scale and this is really what s allowing us to grow revenues but also to expand our business one great example you have here is getnet getnet is a global platform now operating in six countries and our global businesses insurance and corporate banking continued to add value with very strong revenue growth compared to 19 up 25 for cib and 12 in wealth management insurance these are areas where we re intending to invest more as they have very high profitability and strong growth importantly and this is a key goal for us across the bank is customer satisfaction we want customers that love our products our nps is already at the top 3 in most of our markets and we intend to continue building on that improving customer service but also increasing connectivity this is one of the i would say more difficult but more successful goals we have set for ourselves over the last few years we are continuing to invest in technology to change our business model increasing the connectivity not just sharing but building across the group together creating a better bank where do we see the return on these investments i think these are two key facts you have on the screen over the last two years this is compared to 2019 our digital transactions of our core banks have gone from 55 in 19 to 76 in 21 our digital sales again across the group over total sales from 36 to 54 and again i want to stress in many cases now building those solutions together i will comment a bit more later but pagonxt aims to me a common tech backbone on payments for all our customers across the group as well as for open market one santander we re redefining our own operating model and i want to give a couple of examples our regional consumer finance platform in south america a single platform for all of the countries in south america in europe our common app but also other initiatives to develop key products and drive connectivity where we have horizontal business owners already in place leading for europe and in north america where for example technology is already being shared across the u s and mexico we saved 100 million over the last couple of years just for 22 we re aiming for an additional 50 million in this region last but not least digital consumer bank where we are replatforming our legacy auto and consumer on top of our retail banking native digital openbank i want to stress in this vertical we re going digital building our own technology at the same time we are maintaining a 14 15 return i want to now briefly share with you how we are managing our capital allocation and how we re increasing every year the discipline we today have the tools to manage in a very granular way our capital you can see here in 21 that we had 30 of our rwas below the cost of equity we re aiming to have 20 in 22 of course these are businesses where we re investing for the future and i want to say that in 2015 that 30 was 60 so we ve been ruthless in this discipline we intend to continue to manage in this way going forward we will allocate more capital as we have done over the last few years to our most profitable and higher growing geographies segments and businesses we are expecting rwas to expand at lower rates than loans again in 22 we again have a target for a front book to not have assets going on the books on average across the bank below 2 2 in 22 compared to 1 8 and we ll continue to actively manage our underperforming portfolios as i mentioned we are also making some accretive investments of course the offers to buy minorities we ve done we did brazil at the end of 14 we ve done mexico and santander consumer as jose antonio mentioned was actually closed this monday two days away two days ago and we also made still pending closing the acquisition of amherst pierpont that s pending regulatory approval but this is incredibly accretive to us and the connectivity with our franchises cib franchises across europe and americas is really important in every case we are in these acquisitions we are always having returns on investment above our cost of capital so again we continue to expect strong and actually growing organic capital generation this is based on solid growth optimal return on risk and rotes above 13 keeping fully loaded at 12 so we can continue to grow in the future increase shareholder returns going forward so as a summary strong focus on capital discipline will be key we have done it in 21 we aim to deliver tangible net asset value per share growth growing cash dividends and profitability sorry growing cash dividend as profitability improves and making share buybacks a meaningful part of our remuneration strategy we continue to target a 40 payout ratio even though in the future we would aim to increase that to 50 again subject to a more than to the performance of the bank longer term this is the intention and very importantly we aim to keep our cet1 at the 12 level as i mentioned so how are we going to deliver on these goals we want to continue to deliver on our business model we are working on the increased connectivity our three strategic initiatives which i will mention briefly now one santander pagonxt and the digital consumer bank all of which are providing a distinctive competitive advantage because we re building a globally recognizable brand that customers trust and value at the same time improving profitability so first with one santander this is the way we are building first regionally but also from today across the global footprint shared services i mentioned the latin america in consumer finance but the many others are european operating hubs and we re aiming first and foremost to improve customer experience but to do that in an efficient way in a profitable way so these are the targets for europe again structural change while delivering sustainable profitability this covers the four countries spain u k portugal and poland we are very very confident that this turnaround you ve seen already some of those numbers this year for individuals the focus will be enhancing digital but always building on that personal and digital combination we are working through pagonxt on delivering for smes a differential services cross border we announced also the eur 1 billion cost synergies by the end of 22 we are remaining committed to that obviously it s going to be a bit more challenging given the inflation environment we are expecting for 22 some tailwinds so normalizing cost of risk by 23 and in addition we ll continue to reallocate capital among not just segments and countries but also into more profitable and higher growth businesses in north america we expect to develop and work further on the synergies on the back of that cross border u s mexico but also across the group opportunities operational efficiencies will be meaningful we are now working actually we already have the plans in place we ve got the approval yesterday to manage the business in a different way i will comment on that in a few minutes we launched a few years ago the u s mexico business corridor we re generating very high growth in cross border customers just as an example total revenue had a 20 increase year on year on this business and we re aiming to continue that growth the aim for the region would be around 20 rote and an efficiency of 44 in the u s and i want to focus on the consumer side the goal is to simplify the bank and really build a consumer auto business leveraging on what we have done in europe and also in latin america but also on the very strong santander consumer franchise and the core deposits in our retail bank amherst pierpont again is going to allow us to deliver for many more customers the connectivity is already great around 10 for example in our wealth management customers in the u s have been referred by our bankers in other geographies and this is a business where we can actually grow much faster and in mexico again accelerating growth improving profitability where we have been investing in technology together with the u s for the last couple of years just a bit more detail on the u s and how we are looking at the business i want to just remind everyone that for a few years we are very much focused on and of course that will continue to be a focus but now we can focus on growth and on the management of the business which is aligned to the u s peers so the consumer business will be focused on a consumer model much like the digital consumer bank is in europe we ll be leveraging on two very key group assets one is technology and the second one is our oem and experience across and relationships across the world this year we delivered 24 return on equity actually a bit above that for next year the goal is 19 with efficiency around 43 this simplification is going to be key we re actually exiting some businesses in the u s like the home equity and mortgages to really simplify the bank on what it is we believe we need to support our retail customers and the consumer business in terms of the cre and multifamily we are top 10 in the u s very profitable through the cycle funded by commercial deposits cib i mentioned already we see a lot of upside in low risk customer base businesses where amherst pierpont adds a significant investor institutional customer base and leading brands we have in all of latin america in high net worth again there s many opportunities here for add on businesses where we are investing and we believe this is going to be one of our drivers of growth we will by the way we re working some time in q2 to have a more detailed meeting with investors on our strategy in the u s giving you more detail on how it is that we re going to execute in this key market for us south america again strong growth in customers and revenues we remain absolutely confident that the region is a high growth opportunity delivering through the cycle one key aspect is the growth of the middle class in many of these markets that is the key to the expanding demand for our services we are expecting double digit growth in retail we will consolidate more and more operations across the region in many of the verticals we believe there s a lot of value operating as a single bank with its regional approach and building of the connectivity that i described in corporates just to give you an example we re growing by around 25 with multi latinas that s a eur 250 million business today and of course with very strong opportunities also with amherst pierpont in terms of accessing dollar markets in wealth the connection with our bank in miami is a key differentiator for us and in the global businesses and here i mean cards and payments again building on the global platforms and all of that leading to a regional return on tangible equity of around 25 and that is in spite of the cyclical currency depreciation with the current efficiency of around 35 so let me briefly turn to pagonxt this is a very strategic initiative payments are at the heart of our customers banking relationships it s key for our loyalty strategy that s not new it has happened for many years now it s turning digital and scale becomes crucial so again this is a high growth high profitability business and i want to say that as we build this platform we re also delivering revenue growth we are very pleased with the progress that pagonxt has made this year we re investing to integrate all these payment systems to benefit the scale across the santander banks but especially customers but also open market as you can see there in the slide we have been ambitious target for 22 we grew close to 50 of revenues this year we re aiming for a 50 growth in revenues next year you can see there our payments hub again this is where uniting all our banks with a common tech platform and payments we are aiming to reach 26 million customers this year and to be managing the payments the legacy payments will be managed for all our banks eventually here but about a third of the total payments volume already in 2022 and more than eur 3 billion by the way these are trillions of transactions if you measure that in billions we re going to continue to accelerate the growth here we re working on integrating the merchant acquiring business including with wirecard under a common platform we have a very strong e commerce proposition again we are aiming to increase our active merchants to 1 6 million our payments volume to eur 147 billion and very importantly to generate 20 in open markets in acquiring the international trade again we re aiming to grow this in a significant way this is the way we re going to bring together our smes the smes that trade these are the higher growth higher profitability usually customers and we are also as you know with ebury we re very happy with the progress and with a 50 revenue growth aimed for 22 our third strategic pillar i mentioned several times already the digital consumer bank it s operating in 16 european countries it s being replatformed as we maintain profitability into the openbank tech stack and i want to say that 21 has been a very important year we have set important targets for 22 as you can see in the slide we are now openbank is the world s largest full service global digital bank operating in five countries including in argentina now we launched yesterday for 22 we re expecting to serve close to two million customers but with very strong double digit growth in certain products like robo advisor and customer assets we are serving more than 85 000 sorry 65 000 roughly this year and aiming for 85 000 offline and e commerce merchants with very high growth on customer loans especially through the buy now pay later which we re aiming to launch in spain in 22 in the auto business again where we have not just in europe but in north america and south america we re probably the global leader in this business we re planning to serve 6 8 million customers with new originations in leasing and auto growing more than 10 and 25 and digital sales also doing incredibly well and growing double digits for 22 our rote expectation and guidance is 15 with efficiency at 44 driven by double digit customer growth so i just want to end by saying again that as i started we have delivered every single year in many cases above our guidance but very importantly 2019 and in spite of covid we re today ahead of where we were in 2019 in many aspects on capital we set a target of 11 to 12 we re at 12 on a fully loaded basis on rote we said 13 to 15 we re very close to 13 and aim to be above 13 for 22 we are guiding to continue revenue growth in the mid single digit eur 1 billion efficiencies and that is double what we said in 2019 if you remember we said eur 1 billion efficiencies we added another eur 1 billion last year which will be completed in 22 and a 45 cost to income for next year so very importantly for shareholders shareholder returns 40 of underlying profit with again this is a first for santander we believe investing in our own shares is an excellent choice and this will be a permanent feature of our shareholder remuneration all of that while we re advancing our dream finance objectives i m not going to go through these obviously we can give you more detail but we are really trying to lead the sector on this we ve provided specific 2030 targets for our energy portfolio for coal specifically we re very ambitious in our financial empowerment we believe an inclusive society is crucial and we can really be a leader on this also and of course embedding esg in general into our decision making processes and culture and ensuring we do things across the bank and across the group in an inclusive and sustainable way in terms of the medium term and this is preliminary of course our intention is as we finish 2019 plan which of course will finish this year we will be having a new investor day we still have to decide the date but we are confident that our medium term targets would be at 15 rote 40 efficiency while keeping capital of 12 we will continue to invest in higher growth higher profitability businesses we believe diversification continues to be important building global technology platforms are key we need to be able to compete and we are competing with the tech disruptors and winning in many cases we want to ensure we are top of mind to consumers that consumers love our products and that we deliver those in a profitable way for you our shareholders scale geographic footprint and business line diversity again remain at the key of our business model it s going to allow us on numerous organic growth opportunities and what we want to be the primary choice for our customers and increasingly in the open market we believe our 2015 21 strong performance step by step delivering every year our commitment to be radically improving our profitability through capital allocation to achieving cost savings through structural changes will be very important and will make us a winner in the digital age and of course i want to finish by saying thank you to our teams a huge thanks to everybody i was visiting you all in the countries during the pandemia in branches you ve done an amazing job for our customers you are committed to living our purpose and i want to thank you for this extraordinary work during these years and look forward to more ahead thank you also to all of you our investors for your attention and of course we re now very happy to answer questions thank you questions answers operator our first question is coming from from dbs unknown speaker first one would be on the asset quality guidance in brazil if you see any downside risk to that stable cost of risk guidance you have given considering the slow economy and the fast growth of the retail books in recent years and the second question is around city selling retail operations in mexico if you can give us any color around potential interest on the asset how would you approach the funding i mean the 12 cet1 target is a binding constraint even including potential m a in mexico and some of the places ana botin executive chairman so let me take the second one i mean jose antonio can take the second the first one on brazil so we are very satisfied and we have a great business in mexico we do not need to buy we re generating great profits we believe that s going to accelerate we re gaining market share i actually commented this morning that we ve built from scratch an auto finance business that in a couple of years is 10 market share so let me be very clear we do not need to buy to generate very attractive and profitable growth having said that mexico is one of our core markets and so when and the process is expected to begin and actually it s months away we expect to be part of that process i can assure you we re generating a lot of capital we want to generate more capital and that is one of the goals of all the management team ensuring that we are putting business on the books that is profitable and reducing the investing in new businesses as i said from 30 to 20 of our total rwas so we would do that in a way that is attractive for our shareholders that s really all i can say if it ends up happening if you look back the last couple of years in some cases we actually went ahead and the transactions in others in brazil was a good example we did not do the deal that was obviously an end market co market opportunity so that is really all i can say at this point on the asset quality on brazil jose antonio would you take that please jose antonio alvarez vice chairman and chief executive officer yes sure as you ve seen in the results presentation that we re going to grow in brazil i should say that these two different speeds in the loan book in brazil one is speed from the i m referring to 2021 in the consumer side where we re growing around 20 that particularly grew faster in the first part of the year than the second half where we tightened a bit our credit standards and we grew less in the second part of the year going forward on top of this we were building a significant amount of provisions for the expected loss taking into account the macro outlook that as you mentioned in your question we expect gdp to grow barely to grow in 2022 and we are adjusting to this situation and we already feel that we are we provide for this scenario already in 2022 our growth is going to be what we are seeing right now is a relatively low demand on the corporate sector and our growth now in the consumer side is going to be advance in line with inflation at best i should say inflation running now at 10 expected to run out at the end of the year in the 6 probably you should expect a high single digit but in line with inflation or below inflation and probably we re going to grow less than the market so this makes us comfortable that taking into account our provisioning levels our origination stand as we re going to be able to manage the slowdown so remember that we face a more difficult situation in 2015 and 2016 when the market was extremely negative and although we are not in a position to reduce cost of risk as we did in 2015 and 2016 we think that we be in a position to but not to change significantly the cost of risk from what you ve seen in the last couple of quarters ana botin executive chairman yes i may just add one fact which i think is crucial for all of you and the reason that we re doing so well in brazil of course we have a great team and there s great execution but please do not forget that for south america and brazil is 80 13 of our loans and 31 of profits and the reason for that is we have a lot of fees and a lot of diversified different income streams that are growing really well this is crucial aside from the actual credit management that jose antonio was explaining jose antonio alvarez vice chairman and chief executive officer i forget to mention that lending to consumers now 52 is secured in the past was below 40 now it s 52 secured that means that is payroll based lending and mortgage so this make us more comfortable vis à vis with the synergy you mentioned operator our next question is coming from francisco riquel from alantra francisco riquel chief financial officer and first one i wanted to ask about your cost to income target for 22 if you can please comment on what should drive the improvement in the ratio at the group level in particular how do you see cost inflation in emerging markets and brazil in particular if you think that cost to income could improve in these markets or not and also in developed markets you admitted the eur 1 billion cost cutting target is challenging you maintain a high level in technology so i wonder if you can give more guidance in terms of costs for the business units u k particularly the restructuring seems a bit slow and second question on capital you can update on the headwinds expected for 22 in terms of restructuring charges given and then also the regulatory headwinds that we might expect and also related with capital and a follow up on the previous question if i wonder what is the minimum cet1 that you would be comfortable in leveraging up if you were to embark on m a for example the pagonxt deal i see that you are guiding for 12 both in 22 and in the medium term which is an increase versus the previous range so i wonder if this is also your new threshold in terms of capital also in the event of m a ana botin executive chairman thank you very much so let me just give you a high level view on capital again so as i said 2021 has been a pivotal year for santander from a capital perspective we gave a range of 11 to 12 back in 19 i want to stress that from a regulatory perspective from a supervisory perspective from an economic and prudence perspective the 11 to 12 i e the 11 5 gives us ample buffers against some minimums this is really important we finished at 12 12 actually fully loaded and 12 if we take account of the inorganic and i really want to stress that the 12 is because we understand investors want the 12 so we are going to be at 12 for 2022 throughout the year this allows us as i said us to be very strong from a balance sheet perspective it allows us to grow profitably and also to reward our shareholders increasing as our profits increase so again the buffer is just to give you a number 365 of our minimums but also because we have proved and i gave these numbers not all banks require the same amount of capital business models are different they re more or less volatile we have proven to be the most resilient bank in the latest eba stress test with i think it s 250 a bit more capital depletion in the adverse that s 485 on average for the banks but very importantly our geographic diversification retail commercial business you ve seen that in the 08 crisis you ve seen that in the global pandemia year after year this is not just last 10 years the last 25 years we have the lowest eps volatility another evidence of course is the fixed income investors which look at our balance sheet inside and out we have the i think the first or second probably the second lowest credit cost than any of our peers so again this is crucial having said that as i said we are going to be at 12 and 12 is our target for 22 and very importantly and you ve seen that year after year we re generating more and more capital organically increasing our profitability and that s still the intention i just said for the medium term and we ll give you detail how we get there we ll be at 15 or actually maybe even above that so this is really really important jose antonio i think answered that at least on the higher level which i think is something which we care about again we re listening to you we re listening to investors and it s been a pivotal year and our aim is that this is not the issue that we need to discuss we want to focus more on growth and opportunities ahead on the cost income i think we were reluctant to give many more details but obviously we want to going to give more i would stress that we have said that we are committed to the eur 1 billion i m just saying that it s going to be harder to do because of the inflation but we re going to listen and hopefully our track record jose antonio alvarez vice chairman and chief executive officer your question if i understood you well it s more related with emerging markets where we are facing very high inflation both in brazil and mexico nothing to say about argentina and let s show in chile what we think given the efficiency levels that we got in these countries we do not expect we expect we already elaborate on brazil s outlook we do expect not to grow constant top of revenues probably there s not much room to go lower in the in brazil where we re already below 30 so we re going to probably stay at these levels in chile where we are slightly below 40 40 continues to be referenced to be in argentina we have room to improve we are still above 50 and medium term target and we should make significant progress toward this is to go to the 40 that we deem is the right cost to income ratio for an emerging market like argentina so this is our view but the main gains again should come from europe yes so cost in europe we have a target we feel comfortable with our target in europe and we re going to continue to show some gains in costs and costs in europe in 2020 should go down in nominal terms i didn t mention ana is telling me that i didn t mention well is in 2022 we expect a significant still in spain costs going down 7 8 in nominal terms portugal probably more so probably in the region of double digits minus 10 and u k probably in the region of close to mid single digits so down in europe so this is the big deal on cost in 2022 as ana mentioned before we are on track to meet our target and our target requires us to be negative territory taking in account inflation in poland we may be around flat inflation in poland is pretty high salary increases in poland are running in the region of 7 8 and taking account of this respect to be in line with the flat costs in poland so that s the work we are doing chaining our operating model in europe that one europe means taking advantage of our scale in the four quarters to increase the productivity on the back of a better operation model operational model operator our next question is coming from britta schmidt from autonomous research britta schmidt autonomous research analyst i ve got three questions please just to confirm on the cet1 ratio if we included a buyback element for q4 and the pending deals would it be right to say it will be at 11 8 and can you just confirm that the regulatory headwinds are still expected at around 30 basis points the second question is on spain despite a decrease in the customer spread nii was up can you give a bit more color on that and maybe also on the reduction in insurance fees and the third one is on the u s operating model you commented on some regulatory approvals could you tell us a bit more about that please ana botin executive chairman regulatory approvals yes regulatory approvals in the u s we got approval for santander consumer buybacks and we executed that on monday we have pending approval for the amherst pierpont which is the other transaction that s the only one pending on the cet1 including everything we know until now would be not would be very close to 12 i think it s 11 96 11 97 so including all the we were at 12 12 exactly at the close of december will be very close to 12 11 97 11 98 something like that it s in the 11 96 including the pending approvals which will happen in q1 in terms of so again we said we will be at 12 as i explained we have a diversified very predictable business model we ve delivered every single year and there will be some ups and downs every quarter but our goal is to be at the end of the year at 12 or above and i d say every quarter also regulatory headwinds i think maybe jose antonio you can take that one and the spain insurance regulatory headwinds i think have you said anything about that do you want to expand again we re going to be at 12 we feel very confident on and they should be leveling off and of course a lot less than in 2021 that s for sure jose antonio alvarez vice chairman and chief executive officer on the capital naturally there is some potential regulatory headwinds coming basically from difficult to assess at this stage but we feel that aside from any kind of inorganic that we don t have things that we do not contemplate at this stage we re going to be running around 12 maybe a bit higher a bit lower than that including the regulatory headwinds and probably taking into account the look for interest rates some impacts coming from the alco portfolios so everything in good basis and our expectation of right now so this is in cet1 insurance well we have insurance businesses is running is going very well all across the world including spain spain is growing a lot what we have had in spain is some one off coming from annuities that well probably it s not going to no for sure it s not going to repeat it in 2022 but i will be surprised if our insurance fee insurance generation in spain does not grow in the region of 15 in 2022 so i m fairly optimistic about insurance and i think insurance continues to be our one of our best opportunities to grow our fee income finally the third question you want to take it the operating model in the u s ana botin executive chairman sure so we will give more detail on at some point in q2 we are planning to do a special in the u s but the operating model in the u s has four business lines as you can see in one of the slides one is a consumer vertical we re not aiming to compete as a full service bank but rather follow more the digital consumer model in europe i e consumer where we have the 10th largest consumer auto lender in the u s we are going to manage that as a consumer vertical where we re going to fund with core retail deposits this is essential to grow our business in consumer into the prime and near prime because of cost of funding in parallel we re going to streamline our retail operation we are planning to exit certain businesses that are not scalable where we re not competitive and focus on where we are competitors we re working on a new tech stack that we believe will allow us to achieve significant synergies and that s not just for the from the management of the business with the consumer which by the way we re not able to do because it was a listed company and so you re going to see very much a bank that mirrors u s banks where you have the consumer funded by core deposits where you have a commercial operation that is based on the connectivity with markets i explained mexico and others and finally the wealth management and cib that i refer to in my presentation so that s really the operating model we are working on operator our next question is coming from alvaro serrano from morgan stanley alvaro serrano morgan stanley analyst the first one is kind of on the payout i mean you ve reached your 12 which you ve described at length which is where you want to be profits outlook is significantly better than what consensus is saying is according to your guidance you re expecting only sort of low single digit rwa growth why not 50 payout rate in 2022 is it because can we expect some reassessment or top up of the buybacks maybe later in the year or is there some restructuring charges that we don t know about that might happen or are you leaving some room for add on m a just what it feels like your capital accumulation should be very strong this year and it feels like there s a disconnect there and second on the u s strategy i realize you re going to give more color presumably in q2 with a special but have you had any more interactions with chrysler i realize they re all in house financing arm and your joint venture comes to an end in may next year do you have any more color maybe what part of the revenues you think you can keep and what would be a risk i mean in the past i think jose antonio has explained that the subprime part is probably something you can keep i don t know if you can quantify that for us and how you re going to be able to offset that what s the idea ana botin executive chairman very much excellent question so on the payout as we ve said we intend to increase and we are aiming for increased profitability which means if that happens and we are confident it will we would be increasing dividend per share and buybacks at the moment the intention is a 50 50 for next year i also said that we expect to sorry we aspire to increase total shareholder return beyond the 40 with around 50 of remuneration through share buybacks and that is really all we can say at point again we have profitable growth opportunities we think it s interesting for you the investors that we do that in an era of increased competition we ve been very disciplined about where we put our investments we are getting returns i mentioned 50 revenue growth for pagonxt again next year and i can tell you also it s going to be ebitda positive actually next year so that is the goal the other very important change i want to stress is the current management is absolutely bent and the board is absolutely supportive and we all believe it s an excellent opportunity to buy back our shares we are not going to issue new shares at this price we are buying back shares i want to leave that very clear that that is something we will not do it was an exception last year because of our retail investors and ecb guidelines we want to buy back as many shares as we can within the guidance we ve given you in terms of the u s chrysler has indicated that we will continue to be their preferred provider we ve arrived on a very attractive agreement in europe with stellantis as their auto partner this is a great business it s a great business in europe in the u s and in latin america and we have a great relationship which is working for both sides operator our next question is coming from sofie peterzens from j p morgan sofie peterzens j p morgan analyst it s sofie from j p morgan so just a follow up question on the previous comments so you mentioned that you are not going to do any more kind of you re not going to issue any new shares does this also relate to any potential bid for banamex in mexico so if you could just elaborate on these points and then also another follow up question could you just confirm that the regulatory headwind capital headwinds in 2022 will be around 30 basis points and then my final question would be in the u s we saw 43 basis points of loan losses in 2021 in the past i remember you re talking more about 300 400 basis points was a normalized level could you just comment how we should think about the loan losses in the u s going forward and what is that through the cycle normalized level of cost of risk in the u s ana botin executive chairman so i want to be very clear we are not contemplating in any case to issue new shares for banamex or whatever we are buying back shares we believe it s an excellent opportunity it would make no sense for us to be buying back shares and then to issue new shares we re not planning we re not contemplating issuing new shares for any acquisition at this point at this share price we believe again it s an excellent investment opportunity you ve seen myself buying every time i can i mean i bought many many shares it s a public number so that is very clear we re not contemplating issuing shares in terms of the regulatory i believe jose antonio mentioned that less than 30 it s not 30 it s less than 30 in terms of the u s and maybe you can comment on the cost of risk but what s important in the u s and of course we are delivering 24 and 19 this year we are using 12 as the adjusted rote across our markets because u s and mexico for example we re expecting very large dividends this year and some next year actually the u s would be managed around 11 not 12 and the returns on the u s including the cost of risk and everything else we are aiming 15 medium term through the cycle which is a very attractive return to our shareholders on the cost of risk jose antonio alvarez vice chairman and chief executive officer yes i should say our business you re referring to scusa the cost of risk in 2021 as you see in the presentation was unusually low we expect some normalization going forward not coming back to the same levels in 2022 and even looking in the coming years our business we continue we re going to continue to be a preferred partner for chrysler for the next couple of years this is our expectation and we are generating originating more on the primary space than in the subprime space naturally the cost of risk the second number will depend on the mix because on one side across the cycle we have the subprime space where the cost of risk is in mid to high single digits and in the prime space is less than 2 so naturally this is what is going to drive this on the long run this will come to this will be maintained across the cycle not in 2022 where we are we expect the cost of risk to be still significantly lower than the number you mentioned the 3 that we have had in the previous year so it s not going to be the case in 2022 and going forward the mix is what matters probably we re going to have more prime and less subprime because we are as ana mentioned in the presentation we have booking in the bank more prime launch operator our next question is coming from benjamin toms from rbc benjamin toms rbc capital markets analyst two on the u k please firstly in terms of customer spread we saw that fall slightly in the u k quarter on quarter in relation to your sensitivity guidance for a 100 basis points rate rise in the geography can you just clarify what you ve assumed or talk a bit more about assumptions for customer spread changes deposit beaters and margin erosion from competition and then secondly we saw some data released recently in the u k which showed that bio mortgage demand was very strong over the christmas holidays can you just clarify what you re assuming for loan growth or mortgage growth in the u k for this year ana botin executive chairman jose antonio maybe you take those jose antonio alvarez vice chairman and chief executive officer yes so in u k this two you mentioned the rate rise we are taking in our assumptions some raising rates not as big probably and our assumption is to go from the current 25 basis points to 75 basis points maybe a bit higher this has two effects as you rightly said we expect to make some margin expansion on the liability side on the mortgage on the asset side that means more which depends on the competition the competition drives prices in u k is a market that is fairly competitive and as you mentioned the second part of your question is during christmas we have strong demand in mortgages and we were keeping our market share we grew along with the market we expect to grow along the year the mortgage book in line very much in line with the market not losing or gaining market share and the big question mark is competitive pressure in the market we saw 2021 with year the first half of the year more competition in the second half now it s fairly stable yes so that s the situation on the market and this is what i can comment to you at this moment naturally rate prices place in favor of us so sensitivity to the balance sheet is toward higher rates operator our next question is coming from ignacio ulargui from bnp paribas ignacio ulargui exane bnp paribas analyst i have two questions one is on esg commitments i mean you have given guidelines on what is the support that you are planning in terms of lending on green finance targets i was wondering whether at what stage the bank is considering to disclose a scope 3 emissions for the loan book and to track a bit more on progressing toward that net zero by 2050 and the other question is a bit more linked to the previous one at the bank level if you could just run through a bit of what s your interest rate sensitivity on the main units of the bank ana botin executive chairman thank you so let me take both of those i mean the interest rate sensitivity actually we are positioned for higher rates so net it should be positive sometimes it takes some time to feed through but clearly positive on the esg commitments scope 3 so we are taking into account scope 3 as we go through the stress test we did some of that already last year we re doing that this year we re actually going to be very focused on embedding that bottom up but obviously to measure scope 3 we need consistent numbers we need our customers to give you numbers that we can rely on and we then need to compare that with others in a way that s comparable and all of that is going to take some time so it s really important and we are working with regulators and supervisors that we take these stress tests where we are going to measure the scope 3 as a learning exercise so we can have common measurements that we can compare much as you do with financial numbers we are very involved i m personally very involved in the working group so we can ensure that that happens in a fair way again the countries we re not in africa but of course we are in latin america that are now beginning to develop and to ensure that we can measure those what is green and what is acceptable we need some common grounds but yes we are measuring that and we will disclose as soon as we believe we can do that in a way that is comparable across others as soon as possible operator our next question is coming from marta sánchez romero from the bank of america marta sanchez romero bank of america merrill lynch analyst my first question is going back to banamex given the relative discount of santander group shares would you consider rating equity using your listed companies in mexico or minorities are done related to this have you run preliminary numbers on potential cost synergies in mexico where you could buy banamex and my last question is if you can comment on the general outlook on asset quality in spain and also more specifically what are your plans for your real estate subsidiaries merlin metrovacesa and the jv with blackstone there s been a lot of headlines recently in the papers are there any risk of further impairments in this space ana botin executive chairman so let me take those i think what s really important is we are not contemplating in any way issuing group shares we want to buy back our group shares it s really too early to say we are very happy with our organic growth as i said before when the process begins we do expect to be part of the process but we are not going to in any way contemplate at these prices group share issuance in terms of banamex numbers for years we follow our competitors we know our competitors numbers so we do have an understanding we re not working on that specifically at the moment it s really too early in terms of asset quality let me just comment on the group and say that normalization through the cycle of cost of credit we expect to happen in 23 so 22 would still be below the cycle and again jose antonio gave some detail already i believe on brazil which could be one of the areas where there could be some questions in terms of our real estate subsidiaries these are not permanent holdings in any way we re trying to make sure we maximize value in terms of when we have to restructure some assets the goal there is to stay as long as it makes sense at some point obviously this is not a core business but for the moment we don t have any specific plans there to actually do anything it s we believe we can generate value for now operator our next question is coming from daragh quinn from kbw daragh quinn kbw analyst just a first one on banamex if you could give us an idea about how you understand the time line for that process this year and then a second question just on the u k and nii declining in the quarter maybe just remind us of how you see the u k nii reacting to higher rates and the impact the current expectations for higher rates could have on loan growth if any and then just a final small question just on the 2021 dividend i mean traditionally you ve always announced the dividend proposal with the results and i think you said you d be announcing the dividend in a few weeks time just curious on what kind of change in time line and if you could be more specific on the timing for the announcement of the final 2021 dividends ana botin executive chairman again on banamex i think the crucial thing for investors is and i am also a significant shareholder at least at my level we re not going to issue shares and the process we have no idea but we believe it s going to be long we don t think it s going to be for a few months because there s a carve out involved they have announced that they need to put in place a new subsidiary where they would be actually putting the assets they want to keep so we don t think that s going to happen for months probably more q3 but again we are not in we re not we do not know we have not engaged at this point in terms of net interest income in the u k i think jose antonio explained that in sufficient detail in terms of higher rates in the u k would have a positive impact a significant positive impact in the u k that was the previous question it would be hundreds of millions of a positive impact for 100 basis points parallel rise in the curve in terms of the dividend there is no mystery i mean we have said what it s going to be effectively without saying the reason is that buybacks require a different process from cash and so that is one of the reasons but mainly it s because we d like to keep some announcement to our shareholders meeting so i m a bit surprised at the questions on this we have said it s going to be 40 of underlying income 50 cash 50 shares so again i would not like to give the number but it s a pretty simple mathematical calculation so in a few weeks we ll be saying that again we have a shareholders meeting coming up and we ll be calling the shareholders meeting at the end of february that s when we will be giving that operator our next question is coming from mario ropero from bestinver securities mario ropero bestinver securities analyst my first question is on revenues in spain nii outlook for 2022 is probably hard so i just wanted to ask if you think the fee growth will be enough to offset this and perhaps linked to this to give some fee guidance in spain in 2022 and then the second one is on pagonxt well basically an update on when you expect breakeven to be reached ana botin executive chairman pagonxt ebitda positive next year 50 growth in revenues we ll be giving more detail on that in april we re planning to give a restatement and showing you the horizontals in more detail it s a business that s growing 50 revenues ebitda positive in 22 on spain jose antonio alvarez vice chairman and chief executive officer well the question of nii in spain i should say volumes will be relatively flat probably grow a bit both in loans and deposits the main driver is going to be tltro so as the tltro expires it s the negative will come basically from the tltro impact in the nii in spain operator our next question is coming from andrea filtri from mediobanca andrea filtri mediobanca analyst first question on capital can you tell us the expected impact from the eba regulatory changes on the treatment of minorities please and just a clarification i m following from britta s question before the 12 cet1 ratio fully loaded that you ve given pro forma for all inorganic operations is not including the second tranche of the buyback against 2021 profits including it it would be 11 8 if i m correct second question on m a if you re not issuing shares is the 12 cet1 target you re giving a firm target even in case of banamex acquisition and finally you announced you re exiting some businesses in the u s if you could detail for us the profits and risk weighted assets attached to this ana botin executive chairman so the eba minimum jose antonio alvarez vice chairman and chief executive officer well it s not yet a regulation it s suppose to come that is not yet reregulation in any case as it is what we know as of today maybe in the region of a couple of basis points maybe five maybe three maybe four in this region so it s what we know today ok because it s not still translated into as far as i know into a regulation ana botin executive chairman right on capital again the pro forma included both acquisitions one has closed the other one hasn t i reiterate that 12 for 22 for every quarter as i said before the target is to be at 12 for 22 including every quarter in 22 including q1 including buybacks and cash and of course that gets accrued when you actually do it and the accrual will happen in q1 most likely in terms of the u s we ll give more details on when we do a special day on the u s we re planning to do that in new york we ll announce that briefly in a few weeks probably so we can give you all the details on that and again the 12 is a target for this year and we re not planning to issue new shares in the event that we do something inorganic operator our next question is coming from benjie creelan sandford from jefferies benjie creelan sandford jefferies analyst i had a question on the digital consumer bank just looking at the rote and the cost income guidance for 2022 it sort of implies you expect the cost of risk there to remain still relatively low this year i was just wondering if you could perhaps discuss the trajectory of the cost of risk in the digital consumer business and what you would see as the normalized level and also on the digital consumer bank you ve talked before about some of the synergies potentially available between the traditional consumer business and the digital bank i m just wondering whether you could confirm whether you re currently able to use deposits raised in the digital bank to fund business out of the consumer bank in europe and or whether that s still a potential tailwind for the profitability of that business going forward ana botin executive chairman so yes we are running those businesses together and so that deposit funding which is now at eur 11 billion is it s able to fund the consumer we re aiming to grow that in a significant way we ve grown customers actually through openbank in germany holland for total outside of spain around 80 in those markets and germany and we believe we can do much more of that again one of the goals by managing these customers in a native cloud based platform is going to be easier to launch a new market but very importantly what we have learnt in spain with openbank is we are very effective at cross selling and actually achieving what i don t believe any other digital bank has achieved which you have core deposits customers that use the bank as a primary bank and therefore much lower cost of deposits than other native digital banks so that s the opportunity you haven t seen that yet and we should expect to see that in 22 23 cost of risk normalized cost of risk jose antonio alvarez vice chairman and chief executive officer in 2022 we have early we re going to be already in line with 2021 so we do not see a significant risk there yes so the credit quality is very good ana botin executive chairman it s still good yes operator our next question is coming from fernando gil de santivañes fernando gil de santivanes barclays analyst just a quick follow up question please on 2022 guidance first is on alco strategy is there any big change on the alco strategy that you are including in your guidance i think that the polish book is still big this is one question one part the second is on provisions taken on that outlook rotes above 13 are you contemplating any reuse of the overlay provisions do you still happen then ana botin executive chairman so on the alco strategy we re not anticipating any change there as i said we are positioned for higher rates 100 basis points by our little shift we have the biggest benefits in the u k but even bigger in the eurozone again if you take both together over eur 1 billion if you take europe the eurozone and the u k but again we don t have the jose antonio alvarez vice chairman and chief executive officer yes we are just projecting the portfolios we already having the one initiated at the end of december ana botin executive chairman on provisions release for overlay i don t think we have anything in 22 jose antonio alvarez vice chairman and chief executive officer we still have some overlay in the balance sheet as you know and this well maybe a reduction may be offset potential credit losses depending but we are as i mentioned in relation with our questions very well provide to offset potential headwinds on the macro side while we are working on this being ifrs in respect to the losses and expected losses naturally depends largely on gdp growth so we have synergies for different countries not that unique i should say in line with imf ana botin executive chairman yes we use imf and we use the curve and again going back to my point early on diversification there could be some positives but we believe positives could be offset by the negatives and at the end of the day the model is going to continue working so should be in principle no surprises even though you might get surprises in individual countries we believes the trends would offset each other operator our next question is coming from pamela zuluaga from credit suisse pamela zuluaga credit suisse analyst i have two the first one is regarding the fx denominated mortgages in poland how should we think about your exposure to those we ve seen other banks both actively reaching for out of court settlements and increasing their coverage levels amid unfavorable court decisions do you anticipate increasing charges related to the resolution of these mortgages and then my second question is basically a follow up you had initially guided for an rote ranging from 13 to 15 now you re guiding for 13 in 2022 is this level encompassing any downside risk from the higher than anticipated costs amid higher inflation like you are highlighting ana botin executive chairman first one and then jose antonio on the swiss francs so i believe it s remarkable what the team has achieved we are achieving close to 13 in 21 after covid so in 2019 we guided medium term that s three four years so that s 22 23 to 13 to 15 we re going to we re close to 13 now we are saying above 13 next year second very important point again that shows we not just delivered but over delivered when we gave the guidance we said 11 to 12 cet1 the goal there was 11 5 we re delivering close to 13 after a pandemia with a lot more cet1 than what we guided in 19 so that shows you the strength of our model the strength of our strategy and of our execution we re now saying medium term we said 15 but we re still working on what would be our next three to four year plan which we ll present to you in 23 so i just want to stress that we re not just delivering we re overdelivering in some aspects if you consider the extra capital that we have versus what we were planning for in 19 and of course the pandemia and so on so in terms of the swiss francs jose antonio jose antonio alvarez vice chairman and chief executive officer well it s very long we have an exposure between the consumer bank and the bank of eur 2 billion around eur 2 billion fx swiss franc mortgages our provisioning levels now are 22 23 well we are doing some settlements with the customers as everybody is doing the same the final cost of this largely depends on some rulings for the courts and the success of the settlements we are doing but well this is largely behind us on the back of much better outlook for the polish business on the back of higher interest rates you see the margin nii expanding 24 quarter on quarter in the q4 and this is going to give us enough room to offset potential losses that come from there that are not going to be very large unknown speaker we are running out of time but i have two questions left i will ask you to be very brief operator our next question is coming from stefan nedialkov from citi stefan nedialkov citi analyst i have just a couple of quick ones on nii at the group level what s your assumption for the in the guidance that you re giving us for 22 mid single digit revenues what s your assumption for the alco portfolio you ve decreased the allocation to spain quite significantly while keeping the overall alco portfolio level pretty constant versus 2020 what should we how should we think about it going forward how about tiering for example what s your assumption baked into the guidance as well as rate rises in europe and across your geographical footprint so that s on nii and if i may a super quick one on the dgf and erf charges from 2024 onwards or even maybe 23 are you expecting a significant reduction there ana botin executive chairman ok jose antonio could you just if you could be if i may ask you to be brief we have one more question and we have jose antonio alvarez vice chairman and chief executive officer nii growth you re referring specifically to the alco portfolio yes so in the second half of the year we already had in 2021 i mean less revenues coming from the alco portfolio in the back the alco portfolios are basically in brazil chile mexico somehow in poland and somehow in u s not in europe where the portfolios are small on the system and u k is not system so higher rates naturally means lower revenues from this but this is included in our nii guidance and in our guidance for 2022 with the expectations we have for rates yes so that is to go up in mexico brazil u s u k not in europe but europe does matter in this regard that s it the second question was yes well in 2023 if i m not wrong we cover the back the low side of the range established by bank of spain so very likely this year they already reduced somehow the contributions by a small amount eur 10 million eur 15 million eur 20 million no more but this shows you the path going forward well the resolution the same may happen yes so those are two things that cost us eur 600 million a year eur 700 million so well this and this is something happens this is the path going forward unknown speaker can we have the last question please operator our last question is coming from carlos cobo catena from societe generale carlos cobo catena societe generale analyst i ll try to be quick one is on organic capital formation you ve guided to sorry you explained the 42 basis points formation this quarter but if i deduct the cash payout in dividends and i may get to something more around 20 basis points so i was wondering what is the difference and whether that delta is record going forward or not if that includes any sort of securitizations in the group and the second question is about stellantis in europe you reinitiated the agreement and i was wondering if you could give us a little bit more color on what are the expected changes in the business plan going forward different business lines or how that new agreement would affect the business performance ana botin executive chairman so let me just take the second one on stellantis again we have a very strong relationship in europe we ve already agreed a very i think interesting agreement for both sides which would allow us to grow our business together over the next few years really that s baked into the numbers that you have again we are making a strong digital transformation as we deliver every year and we are committed to continue to do that and again stellantis is a very strong partner of us here and in the u s in terms of the just as a general point i d say that we are generating more and more capital organically in 21 you ve had headwinds not just on regulation but also on markets especially exchange rates and interest rates to some degree i think jose antonio showed that in his presentation i don t know what you want to say about the future but jose antonio alvarez vice chairman and chief executive officer securitization naturally is a tool to match capital the guide there is fairly simple as long as we can release capital do securitization with an implicit cost of equity below the cost of equity we re going to do that how much is going to be this this 2021 was fairly positive because in granular portfolios like the consumer finance ones we were able to release capital at the levels at 4 5 6 that are very attractive and we continue to check the securitization market if we offer opportunities we re going to take it if they don t offer an opportunity we will keep more loans in our balance sheet it s fairly simple our approach but naturally this is a source of flexibility given the very nature of our portfolio particularly the consumer finance ones ana botin executive chairman so i think that s it we will try to answer every question we very much appreciate your attention we know this has been a bit long but we wanted to give you not just the update today but also a higher strategic vision of the confidence and the optimism actually we have about the business and reiterate again our commitment to continue profitable growth also increasing shareholder remuneration as we grow profits and we are very again our model has once again shown it works and we are again very proud of our teams the huge work they ve done this year and are confident that they will continue to deliver for you all and for all our stakeholders in the years ahead again thank you very much and if anybody has any other questions our ir team is at your disposal have a great day thank you duration 0 minutes call participants ana botin executive chairman jose antonio alvarez vice chairman and chief executive officer unknown speaker francisco riquel

we reported q2 worldwide revenue of 59 1 million representing a 1 3 sequential increase but a decrease of 7 8 versus the prior year this revenue performance reflects another quarter where our business continued to be pressured primarily by lower procedure volumes related to hospital capacity issues and staffing shortages caused by covid 19 our recovery from the delta variant was suppressed by the arrival of omicron in december consistent with past surges the impact was more acute in the peripheral qualification segment of our business which is deemed more deferrable and is more susceptible to the long term havoc created by covid we now know that staffing turnover and shortages caused by covid have had a chronic dampening effect on the entire peripheral vessel preparation and atherectomy market the latest market data from independent sources indicates that the peripheral vessel preparations and atherectomy procedure volumes are down 10 to 12 versus the prior year the good news is that we continue to believe this is temporary and that many of these procedures will be regained as the omicron surge fades the healthcare system recovers and patients return to hospitals and clinics for long overdue interventions it is difficult to predict the exact timing but we expect the backlog of cases to gradually flow through our accounts at some point after this latest wave recedes we are also encouraged that the fundamentals in our business like new accounts new customers trained and new contracts all improved sequentially in q2 and we continued to gain share and achieve strong growth in our international markets in addition we achieved sequential growth in our us coronary business in q2 and we believe that we are recovering some market share we expect this to continue as cath labs and physicians return to the consistent use of atherectomy in their standard daily clinical practice we believe we have the preeminent sales force in the us market the work we do improves the quality of life prevents amputations and saves lives for thousands of patients every year our morale has remained strong and our employees have diligently supported our customers and patients throughout this latest surge so even though covid has caused us to adjust our near term outlook for this fiscal year we are excited about our future and we expect to return to growth supported by improving market dynamics our innovative product pipeline and expansion large and fast growing markets in a moment rhonda will provide additional information regarding our commercial progress but first jeff will provide you with additional details regarding our second quarter financial results and our revised revenue guidance jeff jeff points chief financial officer thank you scott good morning everyone financial results for q2 were as follows worldwide coronary revenue increased over 4 sequentially to 22 2 while also increasing slightly from the prior year in the us coronary revenue grew sequentially 3 from q1 and decreased 7 to 16 7 million over the prior year period outside the us coronary revenue increased 60 over the prior year period to 3 6 million as a result of continued strength in japan combined with the launch of coronary oas in europe worldwide peripheral revenues were flat sequentially at 38 9 million while decreasing 11 compared to the prior year in the us peripheral revenue was also flat sequentially or decreasing 12 compared to last year turning to expenses gross margin was 69 4 for the quarter excluding a one time charge of 2 8 million related to the voluntary recall of our wirion embolic protection system gross margin was 74 3 q2 gross margins also reflect lower oas volumes and an increasing mix of isd in international revenues operating expenses totaled 49 6 million which was about flat with last year that loss was 9 million or 0 23 per share we ended the quarter with 176 million in cash and marketable securities and no long term borrowings turning to our outlook our sales have been constrained by omicron since the surge began in december and this trend has continued into february based upon forecasts from public health experts we expect that hospital capacity constraints could begin to ease in late february and our procedure volumes may gradually begin to improve in mid march as a result we expect domestic revenue to decline sequentially in the third quarter and gradually improve in fourth quarter although the timing and magnitude of the recovery is difficult to predict due to the dynamics introduced by labor shortages we do expect sequential growth to resume in fourth quarter to accommodate the new constraints cause by the omicron and the related to staffing shortages we are adjusting our guidance for the fiscal year ending june 30th 2022 as follows revenues of 235 to 245 million gross margins of approximately 73 net loss in a range of 15 to 18 of revenues and an adjusted ebidta loss in a range of 4 to 7 of revenues to close we are hopeful that omicron will be followed by a period where covid is less disruptive and we will get back to consistent sequential growth i will now turn the call over to rhonda who will provide our commercial update rhonda robb chief operating officer thank you jack and good morning everyone today i will provide my thoughts regarding q2 and share some of the key performance drivers for the back half of fiscal 22 in the us personal revenue declined to 12 and as scott noted in opening comments the entire market for vessel preparation had declined 10 to 12 versus last year we believe that the market decline is due to patient behavior incidental covid and chronic staffing issues as a result many patients are being medically managed for longer period of time as such we believe and our market research corroborates that there is a backlog of patients that need to be treated we do believe that some of these procedures will be recovered and we are working with our customers to prepare for a rebound however the pace of the recovery is difficult to predict the recovery is likely to progress more rapidly in our obl where the barriers to increasing procedure volumes are much lower throughout the pandemic that will be outside of service it has proven to be more resilient than the hospital setting and the migration of peripheral patients to the obl outside of service continued in the quarter obl volumes increased 7 sequentially and now represents 51 of our peripheral procedures we are pleased that the market dynamics in the obl setting have stabilized and our sales organization has recaptured market share since q1 although it s still early and obl coping with covid we are not seeing much impact from the changes implemented on january 1st our obl customers are not happy about these changes but they are striving to drive efficiencies and we re supporting them with a series of programs and initiatives that will build and support high volume obl accounts that are focused on the care of critical limb ischemia and other forms of complex cad our customer customized outpatient resources program will include procedural education inventory management volume based pricing program clinical support claims assistance and other initiatives that will transcend teacher reimbursement changes and assure efficient and effective care for our patients in the obl setting customer education has always been a key core competency at csi and we are focused on training new physicians and adding new accounts in q2 we trained 61 new physicians and 52 new personnel accounts adding to our future pipeline of oas users in the us sales of our peripheral isds increased to 1 2 million in the quarter following the successful launch and adoption of the jade balloons we are launched into approximately 25 of our us pad accounts and expect this to ramp considerably in the next two quarters given the significant number of large contracts secured and effective january 1st jade balloons represent a significant opportunity to increase our revenue per case to approximately 100 per oas by the end of our fiscal year turning to coronary our us coronary revenue grew sequentially 3 1 to 16 7 seven million this is an important step up following the launch of coronary obl last february over the past year a lot of cath lab began trialing obl where the device would fit in their treatment algorithm we are driving a rebound in our coronary business as cath labs resumed the use of atherectomy for the treatment of lesions with intimal and medial calcium heavy stenosis eccentric and and multivessel disease of course these are typically oas cases and we are encouraged that our customers are returning to the consistent use of atherectomy in their standard daily clinical practice we continue to serve high demand for customer training and coronary atherectomy in 2022 we ve begun training over two hundred fellow certified one hundred and one new users and open 11 new coronary announced in the us we look forward to working with these physicians to complete their certification in the months ahead and are excited by the idea that we are seeing in the expanded utilization of our product our training pipeline remains strong and is an important indicator of future growth during q2 we sold 751 to support products for every coronary oas sold this was roughly flat at q1 but with over 200 higher than the prior year period in total sales of coronary support products were 2 7 million in the quarter we still have a large opportunity here since this product is relatively new and we continue to make our customer base more aware of our product offerings we are also expanding our coronary ifp portfolio and following the recent fda pma approval we are in the process of launching the scoreflex nc scoring balloon in the united states the balloon creates a focal stress pattern to facilitate safe and controlled plaque modification scoreflex nc has the highest rate of first pressure in the united states and is indicated for the dilatation of a de novo stenotic coronary lesion and in stent restenosis scoreflex represent a growing 50 million market in the us and we believe scoreflex nc backed by compelling clinical data will continue to be well received turning to international we are really pleased with our q2 international results with revenue growing 62 to 3 7 million we continue to gain share and competitive atherectomy and ipl accounts with strong progress in japan and europe like the us we continue to serve strong demand for physician training and certification in our international markets we certified over 70 coronary interventionalists outside the us and launched our coronary device in six countries during q2 and we remain on track to be commercial in over 30 countries by this year end during the back half of fiscal 22 we expect to continue strong revenue growth despite covid as we drive adoption and launch oas to several new countries we re on pace to deliver 15 to 16 million in revenue in fy22 including for q2 we strengthened the fundamentals of our business program in new customers trade new accounts new contracts and new product launches and of course we re also pleased with our share gain recapture and strong growth in international markets i ll now turn the call back over to scott scott ward chairman president and chief executive officer thank you rhonda we are obviously operating in a very dynamic environment which is really so defined by covid but we are encouraged by our performance in q2 as you just heard from rhonda with a lot of very favorable outcomes on many of our leading indicators so despite all the chaos we really do have some great opportunities and we re making strong progress in our efforts to transform csi into a multi product multinational company capable of delivering consistent and profitable growth looking forward we will continue to protect and grow our core orbital atherectomy business while we expand globally and develop a robust portfolio of new products over the next 18 months we plan to introduce new products to serve our customer base drive higher revenue per procedure and expand the use of orbital atherectomy in the near term we will launch the scoreflex nc which will be the first non compliant coronary scoring balloon in the us and next fiscal year the 2 0 max which is a large vessel crown that will expand our offering to treat soft and mixed plaque and the larger vessels above the knee and we will also launch an innovative line of coronary microcatheters for accessing chronic total occlusions longer term our pipeline includes several products representing some of the fastest growing segments in the market including everolimus drug coated balloons for coronary and peripheral applications a pvad for high risk pci and ibl balloons for peripheral and coronary artery disease and i m happy to report that we re making really great progress on each of these programs last quarter we announced the first in human experience for the coronary drug coated balloon our r d team recently completed several important development and preclinical milestones for our pvad device and we expect to conduct our first in human clinical experience with that device in an oas trial later this fiscal year and most recently we announced the development of ibl balloons for the treatment of peripheral and coronary artery disease so i think you can see that we ve assembled an impressive portfolio that diversifies our growth platforms and expands our total addressable market from about 1 8 billion today to over 12 billion in the future we have a great team our greatest asset at csi is our people and we have made strong progress in the execution of our product pipeline i m confident that we will overcome our near term challenges and restore growth to our business while we transform csi to become a leading innovator in the care of patients with cardiovascular disease i would like to thank our csi employees for their continued resilience as we continue to deliver exceptional support to our customers and patients during this extraordinary time i would also like to thank all of you for your continued interest in csi and we will now take your questions so candice if you would please repeat the instructions that would be great thank you questions answers operator thank you we will pause here briefly for questions or comments our first question is from matthew blackman from stifel your line is now open please go ahead matthew blackman stifel financial corp analyst all right good morning everybody thanks for taking my questions i ve got a few here maybe just the start you mentioned a couple of times that you think you regain share in the quarter versus the first quarter can you maybe just talk a little about the competitive environment in the second fiscal quarter and how you thought about competitive headwinds in the new guidance range and then i have a couple of follow ups jeff points chief financial officer yeah thank you matt and good morning i think where we probably made the most important improvement is in our coronary business where you noted that we grew sequentially quarter over quarter we are also seeing that the trialing now of ibl balloons is really drawing to a close and at least in many of our accounts and i think in those accounts that trialed early in let s say the ibl launch we now are beginning to see a recovery of our procedures in those accounts that is really coming back about to our normal pace so we re excited about that our organization is doing a great job and continuing to work closely with our customers you know educating them on the proper lesions in which to use orbital atherectomy and we re also seeing the results of that as physicians are returning to adopting our device on a regular basis so a good good news there i think as we as we look forward we do expect to see continued improvement in that coronary segment in the second half of this fiscal year we are as we have talked about before we continue to anticipate some potential competitive headwind as it relates to the launch of ibls for the above the knee segment in peripheral although we now think that will be fairly muted as we ve got just a short amount of time it s early days but we haven t seen a large impact from ibl in the atk segment that may progress over the course of the second half if it does we don t think it ll be a large impact but it is a change in the competitive dynamic and i think that addresses your question matt if i haven t fully addressed it please ask a follow up on that matthew blackman stifel financial corp analyst yeah no i think you covered it scott appreciate it and maybe one for jeff and then i ll squeeze in one for rhonda we just some the guidance for the full year gross margin guide at 73 i don t think implies you get back to the what s called the mid seventies that you hit in the first quarter so that all volume headwinds as we think about the back half gross margin or are you seeing any upward pressure on cost supply chain things like that and then maybe sneak this one in for rhonda on the large kind it sounds like timing maybe flipped the bed into next fiscal year i think you were previously saying previously saying later this fiscal year that i hear that right and as we think about commercialization so the commercialization of the large crown is that plug and play or were accounts going to have to get recertified we train just any help on that would be appreciated thanks jeff points chief financial officer right now thanks for the question on gross margin as we look to the back half of the year that is really if we compare to kind of the original guidance we provided that difference is really all volumes at this point if we get back to normal volumes we would be kind of in that mid seventy range and it ll be a little bit lower here in the back half and that s just because of the lower volumes rhonda robb chief operating officer and matt thanks for the question for timing on the large vessel now we re calling it the 2 o max we expect we re working very closely with the fda and that s going really well we expect to have actually approval later in the quarter so realistically kind of a timing for launch will be kind of that early fy23 time frame so that that s the status update there and when you say plug and play i mean i think yes to a degree you know it will work with our existing handles we will of course train and educate as we always do with that device but i think it s going to be a really straightforward launch into a huge market that will give us access to atk procedures which are about 60 of the atherectomy procedures out there jeff points chief financial officer all right thank you so much operator thank you our next question comes from michael matson from needham and co michael your line is now open please go ahead unfortunately your question there is no one there when your question can i ask you to reregister please matthew our next question is from chris macios from guggenheim securities your line is now open please go ahead chris macios guggenheim securities analyst thank you rhonda talked about the initiatives you guys have underway way to help your obl customers cope with reduced economics in that setting with obls now accounting for the majority of us pad mix what impact do you expect that to have on your own business should we assume some incremental pricing pressure over time as they take advantage of volume discounts and the like or do you expect to be able to maintain stable trends even as you help them become more efficient scott ward chairman president and chief executive officer yeah thanks chris and good morning i think that we expect now our obls to stay fairly consistent and actually to return to the good strong growth rate that you ve seen in the past i would note that our obl segment has always been had had more difficult pricing pressures and that most likely will continue we ve seen pricing erosion there in the mid single digits typically and i would anticipate that we ll continue to see that going forward chris macios guggenheim securities analyst ok and then keeps update on the water on filter after the recent recall but what s the path to getting that product back to the market how should we think about timing there jeff points chief financial officer yeah so the timing on that is still a bit to be determined we have now just completed the recall or we re just about complete with it and in terms of bringing back the devices we will be making improvements in that device will be improving the retrieval catheter and some of our use procedures and as we assess that will then be in a better place to give you a better sense of timing we ll probably be able to do that next quarter chris macios guggenheim securities analyst thanks thank you operator thank you our next question comes from danielle antalffy from svb leerink danielle antalffy svb leerink analyst hey good morning everyone thank you so much for taking the question rhonda i have a question for you and then scott a question for you on that mat product atk i appreciate it s a large market opportunity but also more competitive and i guess just would love a little bit more color on the rationale behind investing in this product is it more about the breadth of the portfolio strength into your competitive positioning do you think this is a higher growth market than maybe i had been assuming so just a little more color there would be great rhona robb chief operating officer sure yeah thanks daniel for the question much appreciated i mean it is a large market and as i mentioned in my earlier comments it constitutes about 60 of atherectomy procedures we currently do perform procedures in atk today but with this device will have better access to a new plaque morphology that we typically don t treat with oas today and that s soft and mixed plaque so we re looking forward to it it s going to be a new market it leverages our existing platform so it s actually really pretty efficient for us to develop this and get it launched because it does work with our existing handle and so from that standpoint it s really a cost effective way for us to access a really big market danielle antalffy svb leerink analyst got it okay thanks for that and then scott question for you around and maybe this is for you too on the coronary side of things great to hear that you re regaining share i guess one of the things that we ve been hearing in our due diligence here on vessel prep in general is that the market has been expanding and now that the trailing seems to be coming to a close at your account at least what are you seeing from ibl is the market from a market expansion perspective and just getting more patients to undergo vessel prep than prior to ibl anything that of note there i know covid complicates things but just curious even anecdotally what you re saying thanks so much scott ward chairman president and chief executive officer yeah thanks danielle we are most definitely seeing ibls expand the market i think they are broadening to a completely different customer group that historically maybe has not treated calcium in the past i think that is actually having a beneficial impact on the market as those efforts are raising the awareness of calcium and also making it evident that severely calcified and even moderately calcified lesions should be treated before stents are placed and you know that hasn t always been the case so definitely improved awareness strong market expansion out beyond the tertiary care centers now into more community hospitals and other areas and also expanding the use of interventional procedures for treating calcium let s say to less severe lesions which all of which has really been very beneficial and i think is an indication of things to come as we do expect that market expansion will continue and that ibl in the in particular in the treatment of coronary lesions will continue to be adopted and done well i happen said that i think we also are seeing that physicians recognize and understand in their own practice that when they come across a severely calcified lesions where they have a high degree of stenosis or a nodular lesions where there s a lot of internal calcium that these are cases where they really do need to use outdoor activity and we re seeing them come back to that in their more standard daily clinical practice which is what we expected this is happening as you know the trialing is kind of drawing to a close and we see individual physicians and cath labs kind of returning to their more standard practice so good news for us and we expect to see that trend continue now as we head into the second half of our fiscal year here operator thank you our next question comes from michael matson from needham and co your line is now open please go ahead michael matson needham and company analyst ok can you guys hear me now scott ward chairman president and chief executive officer yes we can mike thank you good morning michael matson needham and company analyst good morning so i wanted to follow up on rhonda s comments from the obl reimbursement changes i guess one concern that i had around that was that it could lead to more some increased incentive for the customers to maybe move some of the lower cost products out there you did mention value based pricing which i think you have talked about in the past with the obl setting but can you just provide some more detail there is this something that s putting some additional price pressure on you scott ward chairman president and chief executive officer uh no i don t think it s putting additional price pressure on our business mike i think we would expect to see that continuing just recall and you notice that about three years ago we changed our approach to office based labs and began developing deep partnerships with select labs where we do provide a wide range of support including procedure support and inventory management and we do volume based pricing programs so those initiatives have been in place they re kind of built into our base and i think that you can expect to see that continue going forward so i don t really envision that the reimbursement changes in office based labs will fundamentally change the business model that we have deployed to that side of service i would say that probably one of the things that has been fairly encouraging to us over the course of the past month is that our obl customers are not ancillary they re not on a hospital ancillary so their procedure volumes is what determines how they do month to month and we do expect to see the obls returned to a stronger performance as omicron recedes and at least thus far our customers are driving toward achieving higher volumes in their in their practices and that is how they re responding to these pricing challenges as rhonda said i don t think any of the customers are happy about it but they re really striving to improve efficiencies in their practices and we re in there working right alongside them and working with them to help them make that happen and to really increase their volumes as they deal with omicron coming back as well as this pricing challenge at the same time but early on at least here in january the indications are relatively positive that the office space labs we work with will overcome these challenges michael matson needham and company analyst ok got it and then i just had a couple on the ibl news that you re developing a product there so i guess my understanding is it took exactly about two years from their first in human to getting the product commercialized so can you maybe comment on does that imply sort of like a fiscal twenty five launch and is there any way to accelerate that and then can you just talk about coronary versus peripheral are you going to go after both or going after one before the other jeff points chief financial officer thanks mike we will be pursuing both coronary and peripheral ibl balloons we would anticipate our peripheral launch to occur probably late fy23 or fy24 so that is out let s say 18 to 24 months from now and you made a note of the timing from first to human of course we have the benefit now of being second coming into this market and recall that the peripheral approval is a five 10 k approval we are working with the fda now on what requirements they will see as being important for that launch and then we ll be able to be more specific about the timing as we get greater clarity from the fda the coronary clinical trial requirements that coronary approval is is a pma approval as you know and that will likely be fy25 fy26 before we see approval for that coronary segment we may launch outside the united states earlier than that but that s what we would anticipate in the us michael matson needham and company analyst ok got it thank you operator thank you our next question is from suraj kalia from oppenheimer your line is now open please go ahead suraj kalia oppenheimer and company analyst morning everyone can you hear me all right jeff points chief financial officer yes we can suraj thank you suraj kalia oppenheimer and company analyst perfect so scott couple of questions the first one either for you or for jeff so the updated guide is approximately 20 lower than your original guide so can you give us a breakdown of the relative impact of covid versus ibl so that as we structure the remaining two quarters and the outlook over this calendar year we can put the different pieces together jeff points chief financial officer yeah suraj thank you for that question the vast majority of the impact is omicron and the related staffing shortages and labor shortages that are impacting the market broadly i think as we look at our performance in january and now into early february as you ve heard from many companies reporting we are seeing reduced procedure volumes largely due to the acute impact of omicron we do expect in our markets that we will see some restoration of normal commercial activities probably beginning in the mid march time frame and then we are anticipating that we will see a slow and gradual recovery after that it will be slower than what we ve seen in the past if you recall last year when we had that january outbreak the market actually recovered fairly fast and in march and april there was a backlog of patients that were rapidly treated and what s different this year is that hospitals are dealing with these staffing shortages and we find that in many cases hospitals are triaging cases they re coming back and doing their most severe cases first and frankly the treatment of patients with intermittent communication are not arriving on the high end of that priority list so we are expecting that that will result in a slow and gradual recovery in our peripheral hospital segment and that would largely be the patients that have intermittent qualification so that is some of the basically the rationale for that guide naturally if the omicron wave recedes more quickly or if these staffing shortages are addressed more rapidly we would anticipate that that our that our guidance may improve i have to say though suraj at this point our conclusion is there s not strong evidence that this shorting of the staffing shortage and the labor shortage that is impacting hospitals in particular we don t think that s going to resolve quickly we think that this is going to take some time to recover so i hope that helps in regards to your question suraj kalia oppenheimer and company analyst got it scott my second question i ll just put a position for you or rhonda and it s a two part question first what percent of your cases are being done independently on site i e just to give us an idea in terms of leverage ability once omicron disappears and the second thing to the extent that you can either rhonda you or scott can talk about this on your ibl approach what is the specific competitive attribute that you all are targeting is it imagers per catheter number of pulses per catheter deliverability or size limitations because these are issues in the current platform i d love to get again any color you would share thank you for taking my questions scott ward chairman president and chief executive officer yeah thanks suraj about about two thirds of our cases we cover about two thirds of our cases so about one third are conducted independent now as we have been impacted by omicron and our reps have not had easy access to our accounts over the course of really the past couple of months that number has reduced pretty significantly so we re not we re not covering two thirds of our cases at this point however our sales teams have been collaborating very closely with our customers during this time working to identify where the backlogs exist getting prepared and really interacting with our customers to understand how can we help them best if and when this volume comes back there are many issues in these hospitals for example that the technicians that support cases in cath labs we have seen a fair amount of turnover in that particular part of the workforce we ve got to get back in train and educate those cath lab techs we ve got to train and educate others in the support and care network there so that they know how to manage patients that have been treated let s say with orbital atherectomy or frankly that are just being treated for interment coagulation or cli or coronary lesions so our field sales organization and the fact that we have a substantial organization actually positions us very well to provide outstanding support to our customers in conducting these cases but also training and educating their new staff as they re dealing with the turnover that they re experiencing so i think we re well prepared to deal with this we ve done it before and if and when this wave comes back through we ll be in a good place to manage it in terms of the competitive attributes of the ibl yeah our ibl will address some of the limitations of the product that are currently in the market we will be talking more about that as we get closer to commercial launch but i think that you articulated quite well some of the key areas of that that need to be addressed in the areas that we will be addressing in our product operator i think we re ready for the next question operator thank you our next question comes our final question comes from brandon vasquez from william blair your line is now open please go ahead brandon vasquez william blair analyst everyone thanks for taking the question first i just wanted to follow up on kind of the backlog that we re talking about here i appreciate the color around it and staffing shortages can impact the market s ability to treat this backlog i would think maybe the obls could maybe be a source of alleviating that backlog is is that a fair statement and if so it seems like you guys might be in a good position to kind of benefit from that backlog coming in so kind of curious is that a fair statement and then is that kind of benefit potentially based in the guidance or not or could that be a little upside as we move through the year jeff points chief financial officer yeah i think that the obls usually do bounce back more quickly largely because the barriers to patient care and their ability to increase their volumes quickly are there the barriers are much lower so we may see that happen in the office based labs we in our current guidance are anticipating that the omicron impact will really impact nearly all sites of service through that march 15th time frame and then after that we will see some recovery begin i think geographically this will be asymmetric across the united states so you know in the south where office based labs are more prevalent we may see the office based labs in let s say florida texas that those parts of the country rebound more quickly than other parts of the country so that is most definitely an opportunity and we re prepared to address that there brandon did you have another follow up question on that brandon vasquez william blair analyst no that was good on that i did have one follow up separate to that but appreciate the color there it looks like international was a big market for you guys and obviously covid delayed that for a while it seems like this may be the first quarter where you re starting to dip your toe back into the international markets can you just talk a little bit about where you re kind of seeing some early momentum there and where are you making investments in the international markets that will drive growth in the next 12 to 18 months thanks jeff points chief financial officer yeah thank you for that question our international markets actually have been growing nicely despite covid even over the course of the really the past four quarters so we re really pleased with our launch of our business outside the united states where we are taking share from ibls we re taking share from other atherectomy devices as well mainly in the coronary segment so we focus principally in coronary outside the united states we have gained really strong share in japan and our launch in europe our coronary launch in europe has also progressed very well so we now are launched in 22 countries and we expect by the end of this fiscal year we will get to about 30 countries so here is a circumstance where we have a marketplace that has never had access to orbital atherectomy before and we re able to now engage with our customers their train and educate them on the use of this technology they see the benefits of this technology and the care for their patients they adopt it and incorporate it into their daily practice so we re excited about that and we did this quarter with very strong growth there about 62 year over year and about 3 7 million we are expecting to continue on about that run rate and that would lead us to probably having 15 million to 16 million dollars of revenue in our international segment of our business this fiscal year which would be obviously very strong growth and we re not done there we expect that to continue going forward as we launch into this new markets and continue to grow our business there brandon vasquez william blair analyst great thank you jeff points chief financial officer excellent thank you brandon operator thank you there are no additional questions waiting at this time so i ll pass the conference to the management team for closing remarks jeff points chief financial officer excellent thank you very much and thanks everybody for your

nicholas kamm afp losing users for first time in history one of the major reasons for the stock wipe out was the revelation that for the first time since it was founded in 2004 facebook s growth stalled with the platform actually losing users it s the first time this has happened in its 18 year history with more than half a million users deserting the site in the last three months of 2021 that has taken the total number of daily facebook users from 1 93 billion to 1 929 billion in a telling sign the loss was most significant in the previously growing markets of africa and latin america following slowing growth in the us and europe in recent years the fall in these key developing markets indicates that facebook may have reached global saturation levels which would mean the trend was here to stay and not just a temporary blip and growth across the parent company s other platforms such as whatsapp messenger and instagram was also relatively weak the share price of mark zuckerberg s meta plummetted on thursday cost of the metaverse in october 2021 facebook announced its rebrand to meta to much fanfare the name comes from the greek word for beyond and was chosen to reflect facebook s transition away from being a social media platform only instead facebook revealed a new major focus on developing the metaverse by investing heavily in virtual and augmented reality hardware but that transition comes at a mind blowing cost last year meta invested more than us10 billion a13 9 billion in its reality labs division which includes its virtual reality oculus quest headsets and augmented reality technology which contributed to the fall in profit part of that involved growing the team by 23 per cent to a total of 71 940 staff members in the last quarter facebook

tiktok and youtube blaming the rise of these rivals for meta s grim results tiktok is so big a competitor already and also continues to grow at quite a fast rate zuckerberg said adding the firm was now investing in its own version of the popular video platform reels people have a lot of choices for how they want to spend their time and apps like tiktok are growing very quickly he continued and this is why our focus on reels is so important over the long term apple stopping apps tracking you zuckerberg also blamed apple for its horror quarter with facebook set to lose a whopping us10 billion a14 billion in 2022 following a significant iphone change in 2021 apple added a new function to iphones that would bar companies from tracking users across apps as a result of apple s ios 14 5 update the overwhelming majority of users opted out of tracking and it has given facebook revenue a hammering the impact of ios overall as a headwind on our business in 2022 is on the order of us10 a14 billion meta cfo david wehner said we re working hard to mitigate those impacts and continue to make ads relevant and effective for users that s because most of meta s revenue comes from advertising as a result of the firm s trove of personal information collected from users but the apple change meant that a sizeable chunk of that valuable data was lost meta also claimed inflation had impacted advertising budgets facebook ceo mark zuckerberg pictured with wife priscilla chan picture josh edelson afp series of scandals meta s gloomy results come after a tumultuous few years for the company which has been plagued by scandal after scandal last year whistleblower and former staff member frances haugen leaked the so called facebook papers to the media and the securities and exchange commission and testified before congress claiming facebook put profits over people s safety in february 2021 facebook s bombshell decision to temporarily ban australian news from the platform also sent shockwaves across the world and sparked a massive boycott push in 2019 nbc news obtained and released thousands of pages of leaked internal documents which revealed facebook s plan to grow ever powerful including an alleged strategy of using users data as a bargaining tool to wield against rivals and help out allies in 2018 it was rocked by the cambridge analytica fiasco which involved the selling of tens of millions of facebook users personal data to political data firm cambridge analytica without their consent with the information later used to influence voter behaviour during the 2016 us election although the breach was not known at the time facebook was ultimately slapped with a 5 billion fine as a result of the largest data scandal in its history in 2018 it emerged the platform had also been used by anti rohingya accounts to incite genocide against the muslim rohingya community in myanmar the platform was also accused of spreading mass misinformation in the lead up to the 2016 us election and in 2017 it was revealed that hundreds of likely russian fake facebook accounts spent around 125 000 on ads during the election campaign in 2016 it also landed in hot water after censoring a number of images and videos including a famous vietnam war picture and clips of the dakota access pipeline protests and in 2014 facebook faced yet another major backlash after it was revealed it had secretly carried out psychological tests on almost 700 000 unwitting users back in 2012 originally published as what really went wrong at facebook s meta after mark zuckerberg s share
