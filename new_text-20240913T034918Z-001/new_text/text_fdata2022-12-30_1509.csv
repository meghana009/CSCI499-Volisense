cannabis investors just love when a giant new market opens for business what happened there was a distinct whiff of marijuana floating above the stock exchange on thursday as a clutch of pot stocks rose notably in price this was an anticipatory reaction to the launch of an important new market green thumb industries gtbif 0 64 rocketed more than 12 higher and curaleaf curlf 3 31 increased by nearly 5 over the border canadian companies aurora cannabis acb 6 05 advanced by almost 7 and sndl sndl 3 12 closed up 3 so what new york state is now open for recreational marijuana business appropriately enough at 4 20 pm local time a dispensary called housing works cannabis co in manhattan was to be the first retail outlet in the state to go live with such sales this marks the launch of that all important segment of the retail pot business in new york the knock on effect for curaleaf and green thumb is obvious as both companies also have new york dispensaries three for the former and two for the latter s rise brand that will expand from selling only medical product investors are clearly pleased that the pair will barrel into the new year selling recreational goods in the huge and populous state while neither aurora nor sndl will benefit directly from the opening of the new york market it s a juicy and irresistible target for them when and if the u s government gets around to rescheduling read decriminalizing cannabis as foreign entities they are currently barred from selling directly to american customers now what like most states that have turned on the green light for recreational sales new york is being cautious and incremental in these early days although their dispensary counts seem low curaleaf and green thumb are actually prominent retailers due to the low number of total licenses at any rate the opening of this market is a good development for the broader weed industry and investors were fully justified in their bullish reaction to the news

republicans are planning to use their control of the house of representatives in 2023 to intensify attacks on companies that account for climate related risks when they re making investment decisions gop officials in washington and more than a dozen states say they re focusing on firms that are using their financial power to push a so called woke political agenda rather than trying to maximize profits as part of the campaign florida louisiana and missouri have collectively pulled more than 3 billion from blackrock over the investment firm s consideration of environmental social and governance esg issues faced with the political backlash vanguard another large asset manager said it decided to withdraw from a group of investors that s working to zero out greenhouse gas emissions by midcentury republicans say they re fighting a coordinated effort by big investors to impose progressive policies that threaten capitalism itself rep andy barr a republican from kentucky and a senior member of the house financial services committee says esg investing is aimed at politicizing capital allocation and actively discriminating against fossil energy esg is a cancer in our capital markets that must be eradicated barr said in a statement to npr the republican offensive might dissuade some investors from publicizing what they re doing to address climate threats like rising sea levels and worsening drought but financial experts say it isn t shaking a belief that s spreading among many investors that global warming is creating risks to the bottom line that have to be reckoned with esg isn t particularly controversial within the investment field or among public companies says jon hale head of sustainability research at morningstar a financial services company to the asset managers who run and to the public companies in which they invest things like climate change are real and pose a real threat to many businesses michael m santiago getty images getty images larry fink the ceo of blackrock the world s largest asset manager has become a favorite target of republicans who are attacking investors that consider environmental social and governance issues when they re making investment decisions esg goes mainstream inviting attacks a lot of investors had a bad year in 2022 through november investors had pulled more than 250 billion out of u s investment funds as stock prices fell inflation rose and the threat of recession grew according to morningstar however funds that have made esg a central focus of their investing strategy fared better taking in around 3 billion during the same period and painting a much brighter picture than the overall u s fund market the firm says sustainable investors tend to be more connected with their investments hale says they re more long term oriented and so when things go south i think we see sustainable investors staying the course more so than investors overall now the sorts of considerations that are at the heart of esg investing are showing up across the world of business and finance he says most big companies and investment fund managers have set their own esg initiatives or consider those kinds of issues when they re making investment decisions hale says even if sustainability isn t their core focus the fact that esg has become a more common concern embedded across businesses helps explain why it s being attacked says mindy lubber ceo of ceres a nonprofit focused on sustainability a december hearing that texas lawmakers held on esg investing could be a preview of things to come in congress texas lawmakers said the practice of analyzing climate risks to make investment decisions is threatening fossil fuel companies in the state and the entire american economy under questioning in texas dalia blass blackrock s head of external affairs said the firm considers esg issues that pose financial risks and opportunities for clients in order to deliver the best risk adjusted returns we can for them blass said only a small fraction of the investment funds that blackrock manages in the u s are labeled as esg she also said the firm found that esg index funds usually performed better than their non esg counterparts over a three year period going forward republicans control the house they seem bent on investigations so perhaps after hunter biden we may see some effort to try to haul in esg proponents says hale of morningstar but i think when they do that they ll find that this is not a group of leftist ideologues that they seem to expect but rational business people and investors rep patrick mchenry a republican from north carolina and the incoming chairman of the house financial services committee said in a statement to npr that gop lawmakers will conduct appropriate oversight of activist regulators and market participants who have an outsized impact spencer platt getty images getty images republican opponents of esg investing say the practice of considering risks from climate change is steering money away from the fossil fuel sector and threatening american energy companies blowback could make investors more conservative in dealing with climate change voters seem to think that investors should be free to act on concerns about climate risk in a september poll by rokk solutions and penn state university s center for the business of sustainability 63 of registered voters said the government shouldn t limit esg investing they re essentially saying that businesses should have the autonomy to do they see fit and act in the best interest of their stakeholders says tessa recendes an assistant professor of business at penn state but congressional hearings could still be damaging or at least embarrassing for some investors i think both sides have probably overstated their case the ones attacking esg and the ones who perhaps oversold esg for selfish opportunistic reasons says shivaram rajgopal a professor at columbia business school financial experts say esg isn t a substitute for government action to deal with climate change and there have been complaints that some companies misrepresent their environmental actions a practice known as greenwashing as the political backlash grows some esg critics are focusing on investment firms that worked together to apply new standards for sustainability saying that sort of collaboration could violate antitrust laws i m sure lawyers are spending a lot of time going over minutes statements conversations to make sure that lines weren t crossed and where lines were crossed they have defense strategies says witold henisz of corporations that could be the focus of republican scrutiny henisz is faculty director of the esg initiative at the wharton school of business at the university of pennsylvania i don t think they anticipate huge liabilities huge penalties but could some firms be embarrassed could there be some conversations that crossed a line that lead to some fines i mean i wouldn t be surprised henisz says one of the biggest risks from the gop attacks is that investors will be less willing to take aggressive action to deal with climate change but he says there s no sign that investors are wavering in their belief that esg issues like global warming pose a serious financial threat vanguard says that while it s no longer part of the net zero asset managers initiative it will continue focusing on climate risk and offering investors information and investment products to help them meet goals of zeroing out greenhouse gas emissions copyright 2022 npr to see more visit
a worker counts chinese currency renminbi at a bank in linyi east china s shandong province the renminbi s value used to feature heavily in debates about global imbalances while outsiders considered it to be undervalued and urged appreciation the people s bank of china insisted on maintaining the currency s de facto peg to the us dollar in recent years however china s concerns that its currency would grow too strong have been replaced by fears of a sharp depreciation though china has sustained its current account surplus capital outflows have been putting the exchange rate under frequent downward pressure since 2015 the sources of the pressure can be divided into three broad categories based on the drivers of the outflows deteriorating domestic economic conditions noneconomic factors and arbitrage in 2015 while equity prices crashed and led to months of market turbulence and gdp growth was losing its momentum the pboc introduced a new rule for setting the renminbi central parity rate against the us dollar to make the renminbi exchange rate more flexible though the move itself was correct it triggered a sudden rise in expectations of renminbi depreciation with that capital began flowing out of china and continued to do so through the end of 2016 to shore up the renminbi the pboc burned through some 1 trillion in foreign exchange reserves during this period in 2018 non economic factors specifically rising tensions with the united states became the main driver of capital outflows from march 2018 to may 2022 the renminbi exchange rate fluctuated significantly reflecting the shifting intensity of sino american tensions for much of this period the renminbi exchange rate hovered below the psychologically important threshold of 7 to a dollar the recent build up of renminbi depreciation pressure began in may 2022 with the renminbi depreciating against the dollar at an unprecedented rate again breaking the 7 to a dollar threshold in september this time the main factor has been arbitrage activities with investors seeking to take advantage of the widening interest rate differential between china and the us anecdotal evidence suggests that capital flight may have also played an important role in the past whenever the renminbi s dollar exchange rate neared the 7 to a dollar threshold some economists would warn that a collapse could follow if the threshold was allowed to be breached this time despite concerns the pboc has held firm in rejecting sustained intervention and of course the crash has not come the pboc s response to the latest renminbi depreciation a policy of benign neglect is particularly laudable policymakers did lower the foreign exchange reserve requirement ratio for banks and they persuaded commercial banks to support the renminbi in various subtle ways but they did not intervene in the foreign exchange market in any significant way some might argue otherwise citing reports that the pboc sold some 100 billion in us treasuries in the first half of 2022 but if the reports are true it was not a currency market intervention it was part of the pboc s long term plan to diversify china s foreign exchange reserves or as some chinese economists may argue it could be partly a result of the revaluation effect of us government bonds in any case external pressure on the renminbi is waning this is partly because of developments in the us inflation has fallen for four consecutive months and perhaps more important central bankers seem to have realized that their aggressive monetary tightening 75 basis point rate hikes at four consecutive policy setting meetings is untenable because today s inflation is the result of both demand and supply side shocks interest rate hikes alone cannot contain it what they can do is suppress growth causing the us economy already at risk of recession to suffer stagflation in light of this the fed now seems to be softening its hawkish stance on inflation in fact at its last policy setting meeting of 2022 the fed raised interest rates by only 50 basis points as market expectations for us interest rate hikes wane so does downward pressure on the renminbi but the renminbi s value is not decided by us central bankers the currency retains a fundamental strength rooted in market confidence in the chinese economy this time renminbi depreciation has triggered no panic in china s financial market which reflects the maturity of chinese investors and the market itself if chinese growth can rebound strongly in 2023 net capital outflows will decrease or even reverse providing further support to the renminbi the chinese government s decision to optimize its covid response policy makes this scenario more likely not least because that policy constituted the most powerful constraint on the effective implementation of expansionary fiscal and monetary policy the likely result will be a growth rate that is higher than previous market forecasts but while household consumption will rebound in the foreseeable future supply chains may take longer than expected to repair as a result inflation may rise sometime in 2023 at the same time the pboc may need to lower interest rates to give the economy a boost the failure to strike the right balance between anti inflation and pro growth policies and any misstep in implementing expansionary fiscal and monetary policy will negatively affect the renminbi exchange rate whatever happens the pboc would do well to stick with benign neglect allowing the exchange rate to act as an automatic stabilizer while treating capital controls as the last resort in other words china s government should focus on economic growth and let the market take care of the renminbi the author former president of the china society of world economics and director of the institute of world economics and politics at the chinese academy of social sciences served on the monetary policy committee of the people s bank of china

donald trump s tax returns long the subject of speculation as well as a three year legal fight are now in the public eye for anyone to review after last week releasing a summary of the irs efforts to audit the former president along with some details of his income in recent years the house ways and means committee early friday released redacted versions of six years worth of his returns whether americans learn much from the reams of information released today is another matter as with many ultra wealthy individuals trump s finances are dauntingly complex indeed the irs itself has previously remarked on the difficulty of examining every entity from which he has drawn income over the years here are some of the areas tax professionals said they re focusing on what do the returns actually show about his finances that could be hard to assess given trump s sprawling business empire the former president is financially linked to more than 400 separate entities including trusts limited liability corporations and partnerships according to house researchers of these however just seven were examined in the ways and means committee s report earlier this month although the returns being disclosed friday will likely name these entities and list an income or loss for each one additional details will likely be limited experts said we re not going to know what those are doing bruce dubinsky a forensic accountant and founder of dubinsky consulting you re just going see a line and an amount could be income could be a loss for that year we would then need those llc or s corporation returns to see ok what s going on such a large number of entities makes it more likely that some sources of trump s income losses or wealth could be left out offering a misleading picture of his tax status the irs has highlighted the complexity of performing a comprehensive examination of trump s income and tax liability with over 400 flow thru returns reported on the form 1040 it is not possible to obtain the resources available to examine all potential issues states an irs memo cited in the ways and means report like all the tax pros interviewed for this story dubinsky noted he has no specific insight into trump s returns and made his assessment based strictly on his knowledge of the tax code and published excerpts of trump s finances but a preliminary review of trump s 2020 tax return released by the house panel on friday shows the kind of ordinary income gains and losses that any major real estate developer might report dubinsky said those include large losses from over 100 business entities as well as credits for taxes he paid on his ventures around the world including golf courses in scotland and ireland he s got a lot of different real estate entities dubinsky told cbs news after reviewing the documents some were generating millions of dollars of income some had depreciation creating losses he s got quite a bit of interest income and dividend income if you do a back of the napkin calculation i think in 2020 that s probably equivalent to about 500 million of just net worth in liquid assets by contrast the releases show that in 2015 alone trump paid 573 000 simply to have his individual 1040 form prepared underlining the enormous tax prep costs for such complex returns how much did money trump make from being famous the report from the joint committee on taxation said trump paid no federal income tax in 2020 the final year of his presidency the former president paid a net of only 750 in income taxes in 2017 he paid 1 1 million in net federal income taxes combined in 2018 and 2019 although trump early in his career made money chiefly from his family s real estate empire in time he capitalized on his celebrity to generate income making hundreds of millions from the bestselling art of the deal and other books as well as the nbc television hit the apprentice i m going to look at the schedule cs i want to see if there is anything from publishing book deals that sort of stuff dubinsky said was he getting royalties on the apprentice if so there might be royalties that come in and are reported on the return according to the new york times the apprentice alone earned trump 200 million between 2005 and 2018 if he kept earning royalties while in office he wouldn t be the first former president barack obama also benefited from publishing although on a much smaller scale while he was in office obama earned twice as much from book royalties as from his presidential salary forbes has calculated dubinsky noted that it s hard to tell just looking at a tax return how successful somebody is there might be three ventures that are very successful there might be a venture that s not so successful he added but i think on par when you look at everything in the tax return in total i think it does paint a picture of a very complicated business venture system that donald trump was running in a statement sent by the trump campaign after the tax returns were disclosed the former president said his returns show how proudly successful i have been the democrats should have never done it the supreme court should have never approved it and it s going to lead to horrible things for so many people trump said how charitable is trump the charitable activities of the businessman turned president are sure to garner considerable interest said e martin davidoff founder and managing partner of davidoff tax law i might look at his personal returns just out of curiosity i ve never seen the tax returns of a billionaire davidoff said what does he deduct how much is he giving to charity that would be an interesting thing because that could be a very big deduction davidoff expects to see some limited information on the types of charitable contributions you ll know whether it s cash or property because there are two separate forms for doing that and two separate line items for schedule e he said if he gave away appreciated stock if he gave away real estate that ll be listed out that s required in the detail in the final year of his presidency trump reported making no charitable donations the tax returns show that contrasted with the prior two years when he reported making about 500 000 worth of donations it s unclear whether any of the figures include his pledge to donate his 400 000 presidential salary back to the u s government he reported donating 1 1 million in 2016 and 1 8 million in 2017 as for exactly where trump directed his charitable contributions that may not be clear either tax experts said although many people do list recipients of charity on their returns it s not required meanwhile many ultra rich individuals form a charitable trust or a private foundation to keep the details of their giving under wraps another question likely to remain un answered for now is whether trump accurately claimed the value of all his donations tax pros said one issue the ways and means committee brought is up whether a type of deduction known as a conservation easement that trump reported as being worth 21 million was truly worth that much the irs allows that deduction but the irs may be questioning the value of it and we won t know the outcome until the audits are done dubinsky said how lucrative is it to be a real estate developer previously published excerpts of trump s returns have focused on years in which he reported large financial losses in the 1980s and 90s the times concluded trump appears to have lost more money than nearly any other individual american taxpayer trump s longtime accountant also recently testified at the trump organization s recent criminal trial that the real estate developer reported losses on his tax returns every year for a decade including nearly 700 million in 2009 and 200 million in 2010 many have questioned the fairness of a self proclaimed billionaire being allowed to avoid income tax liability with one columnist calling it a national disgrace but tax pros underline that this reflects questions about the tax code which offers a range of ways for wealthy americans including real estate moguls to legally shelter their income the obvious question is how does a guy pay such a small amount in tax when he s so wealthy by design real estate shelters income davidoff said if i have real estate and there s positive cash flow the depreciation on that real estate shelters some of that income he added the obvious question people will have is why is the amount he is paying so low that s the tax laws for example depreciation is an artificial calculation designed to account for the fact that assets like buildings lose value over time dubinsky illustrated it with an example of a developer who builds a project worth 50 million and as is common puts up 1 million of his own money for the project while borrowing the rest when you have a professional tax preparer as president trump had you can take advantage of those tax code sections and the loopholes if you call them loopholes they re legal dubinsky said and there s evidence in his return he took a lot of appreciation deductions on his real estate ventures and continued to generate those deductions and that offsets other income and that s totally legal to do these tax breaks deliberately designed to incentivize real estate projects might seem alien to most people whose main source of income is their job the average person doesn t do that dubinsky said they re getting a w 2 for 85 000 and they re like well i m paying tax on 85 000 why isn t this guy that s making billions or supposedly worth billions paying his fair share i mean i hate to come back to it but unfortunately that s the way the tax code was crafted the associated press contributed to this story
cannabis investors just love when a giant new market opens for business what happened there was a distinct whiff of marijuana floating above the stock exchange on thursday as a clutch of pot stocks rose notably in price this was an anticipatory reaction to the launch of an important new market green thumb industries gtbif 0 64 rocketed more than 12 higher and curaleaf curlf 3 31 increased by nearly 5 over the border canadian companies aurora cannabis acb 6 05 advanced by almost 7 and sndl sndl 3 12 closed up 3 so what new york state is now open for recreational marijuana business appropriately enough at 4 20 pm local time a dispensary called housing works cannabis co in manhattan was to be the first retail outlet in the state to go live with such sales this marks the launch of that all important segment of the retail pot business in new york the knock on effect for curaleaf and green thumb is obvious as both companies also have new york dispensaries three for the former and two for the latter s rise brand that will expand from selling only medical product investors are clearly pleased that the pair will barrel into the new year selling recreational goods in the huge and populous state while neither aurora nor sndl will benefit directly from the opening of the new york market it s a juicy and irresistible target for them when and if the u s government gets around to rescheduling read decriminalizing cannabis as foreign entities they are currently barred from selling directly to american customers now what like most states that have turned on the green light for recreational sales new york is being cautious and incremental in these early days although their dispensary counts seem low curaleaf and green thumb are actually prominent retailers due to the low number of total licenses at any rate the opening of this market is a good development for the broader weed industry and investors were fully justified in their bullish reaction to the news
follow us today since musk announced his intention to buy twitter on april 14 for 43 billion tesla shares have gone down more than 60 this means in less than a year more than 600 billion has been wiped off tesla s 1 trillion market cap yes in the meantime all growth stocks have experienced a huge sell off however tesla s losses have undoubtedly been exacerbated by musk s twitter deal there are 3 main reasons why musk buying twitter has caused tesla shares to go down first although elon musk is the richest person in the world with a net worth north of 185 billion most of musk s wealth is tied up in his 17 stake in tesla this means in order to raise the necessary capital to buy twitter musk had to sell his tesla shares and between april 26 and 29 this is exactly what happened although tesla reported a record breaking quarter several days prior out of the blue on april 26 tesla stock started to crash and in the next few days tesla s stock price starts to recover only to give up all the gains on the same day at the time the reason tesla s stock price was going down was a head scratcher for the ev maker s investor community however on april 29 in a filing with the securities and exchange commission it was revealed that elon musk selling tesla shares was the reason the ev maker s stock went down by 18 related news tesla opens 10 000th supercharger in china at the most iconic location in shanghai according to the filing in those 3 days elon musk sold 9 6 million tesla shares to raise 8 5 billion to fund his twitter buyout the second reason musk s twitter deal has negatively affected tesla shares is fears that musk s attention will be diverted to twitter musk is one of the busiest people on earth on top of running tesla full time as the ceo the serial entrepreneur also serves as the company s chief product architect musk is also the ceo of the space venture he founded spacex at spacex musk holds a significant engineering role serving as spacex s chief technology officer on top of all this musk is also involved in the tunneling venture he founded the boring company which recently announced it will be building a working hyperloop add to this his involvement at his neural implant startup neuralink and to put the icing on top musk is also a father to 7 children by now i assume you can see how constrained musk s time is however despite everything he has going on musk has now taken on the role of twitter s ceo and from his tweets it appears that musk is deeply involved in the daily activities of the social media platform although recently musk has revealed that he will be stepping down as twitter ceo as soon as he finds a replacement and finally the third reason musk buying twitter has negatively affected tesla was musk s later abandoned plan to take out a 13 billion margin loan against his tesla shares to buy twitter if you happen to be unfamiliar a margin loan basically entails using shares in a company as collateral to borrow money margin loans are a creative way to increase cash holdings without having to sell shares basically they allow you to have your cake and eat it too however the problem begins if the share price starts to tank after the share price goes down by a certain amount the person who took a margin loan will get a margin call at this time the debt holder will be forced to sell his her shares to pay back the loan and the more the person is forced to sell the more the stock price goes down causing a downward spiral and huge losses to alleviate this risk musk entirely abandoned plans to take out tesla backed margin loan and instead directly borrowed 13 billion to fund his twitter purchase although there are new rumors suggesting that elon musk is reconsidering taking a tesla backed margin loan to pay down some of twitter s debt and these rumors have caused a further decline in tesla s stock price and all these factors added together tesla investors have been frustrated with elon musk s involvement at twitter and its effects on tesla s stock price however although musk s twitter shenanigans have harmed tesla s stock price in the meantime the ev maker has never been in a better state as a company just in 2022 tesla has inaugurated two new massive factories on two continents and only months after starting operations tesla has recently revealed that both giga berlin and giga texas have reached an annualized production run rate of 150 000 vehicles related news i have a feeling warren buffett may be eyeing tesla in 2023 due to these 4 factors tesla s fremont california plant and giga shanghai have also seen significant production increases in 2022 with the plants nearing a production run rate of 750 000 and 1 million vehicles a year respectively tesla s full self driving software fsd beta has finally entered wide release running in well over 150 000 vehicles in north america and long gone are the days of websites dedicated to countdowns for when tesla will be bankrupt the ev maker is currently in a really strong financial position with over 20 billion sitting in the bank and in a recent company wide email elon musk reminded tesla employees that despite the stock price going down the ev maker is actually in excellent condition and that he believes tesla will be the most valuable company in the plant in the email titled final few days which was dated december 28 musk started by thanking tesla employees for the exceptional execution in 2022 musk then followed up by rallying the troops to work extra hard to deliver customer vehicles before midnight on december 31 however after finishing the email musk followed up by saying by the way don t be too bothered by stock market craziness as we demonstrate continued excellent performance the market will recognize that long term i believe very much that tesla will be the most valuable company on earth the email that elon sent to tsla employees yesterday don t be too bothered by stock market craziness as we demonstrate continued excellent performance the market will recognize that long term i believe very much that tesla will become the most valuable company on earth pic twitter com fsfdrnuvce mathias føns fonsdk december 29 2022 currently tesla s market cap stands at around 370 billion and for comparison the most valuable company in the world currently is apple with a market cap just north of 2 trillion or in other words around 6 times tesla s value although this is not the first time musk has expressed his belief that tesla will be the most valuable company on earth if it indeed happens this will certainly be exciting for tesla investors and it s nice for the ceo to reiterate this belief at such trying times as of now even though tesla is executing better than ever as a company the stock still has a long way to go to overtake apple however we will be sure to keep you posted on tesla s stock performance going forward until then make sure to visit our site

shares of the egg producer fell in spite of a strong earnings report what happened shares of cal maine foods calm 2 60 were moving lower this week after the country s largest egg producer reported strong growth in its fiscal second quarter but missed earnings estimates as a result the stock was down 16 4 for the week through thursday according to data from s p global market intelligence with the bulk of those losses coming on thursday after the earnings report came out so what another outbreak of bird flu led to egg prices spiking cal maine s revenue jumped 110 to 801 7 million beating estimates at 797 8 million as prices for conventional eggs hit records increasing to 2 88 per dozen from 1 15 per dozen in the quarter a year ago prices for conventional eggs actually topped those for specialty eggs which include categories like organic and cage free and rose from 1 90 to 2 37 per dozen thanks to the higher prices earnings per share jumped from 0 02 to 4 07 but that was shy of estimates at 4 24 volume sales which may be a better metric to track cal maine s growth since egg prices are volatile rose 6 to 284 000 dozen showing steady growth and management noted that demand for specialty eggs was particularly strong ceo sherman miller said our results demonstrate the strength of our operating model and ability to execute our growth strategy in a dynamic environment he added above all we remain focused on our mission to be the most sustainable producer and reliable supplier of fresh shell eggs and egg products in the united states now what cal maine stock has actually surged this year bucking the broader market trend as it s benefited from rising egg prices the company also has a unique dividend policy where it pays out a third of its profits as dividends so investors have directly benefited from the increase in profits based on its recent quarterly dividend payout of 1 35 the stock is paying a dividend of more than 10 but future dividends will depend on egg prices egg prices are likely to recede eventually but the national supply of hens is not expected to reach its historical average until december 2023 meaning 2023 could be a bumper year for cal maine as well

tax credits that should boost demand for electric delivery vehicles are just days away what happened investors in canoo goev 18 14 have had a rough year in 2022 with the stock plunging by 85 but shares in the electric vehicle ev maker jumped today and there are two likely reasons after popping 8 4 early thursday canoo stock was holding on to a gain of 6 5 as of 12 30 p m et so what one bit of news that might have investors more positive on the stock is a new report from ev sector site electrek the report summarizes a lawsuit filed by canoo last week against former employees it says stole canoo s intellectual property to start a rival ev company harbinger motors is run by several executives formerly with canoo including phillip weicker the chief technology officer and co founder for harbinger weicker was also a co founder of canoo like canoo harbinger plans to make commercial evs used for service and delivery canoo is also accusing harbinger of recruiting a large number of its employees in a statement published on electrek harbinger called the suit meritless and vowed to defend itself vigorously it s too early to see how the lawsuit might evolve or whether the outcome will benefit canoo but one thing that should benefit it beginning in the coming days are tax incentives related to the inflation reduction act ira that will become effective next week the ira calls for tax credits of 7 500 or 40 000 for commercial electric delivery vehicles the incentive is based on the size of the delivery vehicle and doesn t include made in the usa restrictions written into the ira for electric passenger vehicles now what in its most recent investors presentation last month canoo said it has 2 billion in orders of which 750 million are contractural commitments investors are probably thinking canoo s order book could get a boost after the ira credits kick in next week they will have to wait until the company s fourth quarter update to find out more about the backlog and if the lawsuit against harbinger is successful there may be one less competitor to worry about too

honolulu dec 29 2022 globe newswire barnwell industries inc nyse american brn today reported net earnings of 5 513 000 0 57 per share for the year ended september 30 2022 as compared to net earnings of 6 253 000 0 73 per share for the year ended september 30 2021 for the quarter ended september 30 2022 barnwell reported a net loss of 143 000 0 01 per share as compared to net earnings of 1 547 000 0 16 per share for the quarter ended september 30 2021 mr alexander c kinzler chief executive officer of barnwell commented we are pleased to report that our oil and natural gas revenues more than doubled for fiscal 2022 as compared to the prior year this was due to higher prices and production for all products with oil natural gas and natural gas liquids prices increasing 68 77 and 51 respectively and our production of oil natural gas and natural gas liquids increasing 24 39 and 100 respectively as compared to last year our oklahoma operations generated 3 496 000 or 15 of our oil and natural gas segment revenues for fiscal 2022 the 740 000 decrease in net earnings in fiscal 2022 as compared to fiscal 2021 was primarily due to the company s recognition of 4 472 000 in gains in fiscal 2021 that did not occur in fiscal 2022 which included a 2 341 000 gain from the termination of the company s post retirement medical plan 1 982 000 in gains from the sales of assets and a 149 000 gain on debt extinguishment in total our oil and natural gas segment operating results before income taxes had an 8 113 000 improvement from the prior year due to both higher oil and natural gas prices and new production from wells drilled in canada in fiscal 2022 and oklahoma in late fiscal 2021 also contributing to the increase was a ceiling test impairment of 630 000 in the prior year period whereas there was no such ceiling test impairment in the current year period equity in income from affiliates decreased 2 393 000 and land investment segment operating results before non controlling interests share of such profits decreased 532 000 due to the kukio resort development partnerships sale of six lots in the current year period whereas there were eight lot sales in the prior year period due to these sales the company received 3 028 000 in net cash distributions in fiscal 2022 contract drilling operating results also decreased 133 000 due to the completion of a significant drilling contract in the prior year period general and administrative expenses increased 956 000 primarily due to increases in professional fees in the current year period as compared to the same period in the prior year partially offset by a decrease in stockholder costs in the prior year period as compared to the current year period the company also incurred a 484 000 foreign currency loss in the current year period due to the effects of foreign exchange rate changes on intercompany advances as a result of the strengthening of the u s dollar against the canadian dollar in the north twining unit ntu in which barnwell holds a 29 interest the two new wells that began production in our second fiscal quarter continue to perform strongly and a second drilling program consisting of four wells 1 16 net in the ntu began in our third quarter of these four three began production with very encouraging initial rates the fourth well has been completed and is expected to

sarajevo bosnia herzegovina ap vildana mutevelić huddled in her apartment with her two young children and elderly cousins they had no heat electricity or running water as artillery shells tore the roof off their building and almost took their lives to survive she improvised mutevelić made a lamp out of used engine oil water and a shoelace for a wick she cooked on a fire fueled by books furniture shoes or clothes a plastic spoon she discovered when lit worked well as a temporary flashlight if she ventured outside plastic sheets covered the blown out windows a flimsy buffer against the bitter cold her news of the world came from a neighbor who powered a radio with a car battery the electricity failed right away mutevelić 70 said through a translator and everything we had in our freezers it melted those were our stocks basically that s all for mutevelić these are memories from three decades ago when bosnian serbs besieged sarajevo causing thousands of civilian casualties but it s all happening again in ukraine russia s armed forces have aimed their firepower at ukraine s energy infrastructure as winter weather sets in ukraine president volodymyr zelenskyy who has accused russia of energy terrorism said earlier this week that about 9 million people were without electricity the country s prosecutor general andriy kostin told the associated press that russia s deliberate targeting of ukraine s essential utilities is another act of genocide the most heinous of war crimes we are convinced that the crimes russia is committing in ukraine bear all the hallmarks of genocide kostin said in a statement the aggressor state is weaponizing winter depriving ukrainians of the basics electricity water and heating ___ this story is part of an ap frontline investigation that includes the war crimes watch ukraine interactive experience and the documentary putin s attack on ukraine documenting war crimes on pbs ___ to make civilians suffer and die as a way to force their government to yield isn t a new wartime strategy but it s prone to failure families neighbors and entire communities band together brainstorm and resist as sarajevo did and as britain did when the island nation refused to buckle under nazi germany s withering assaults 80 years ago the ability of a modern population to survive under duress and under aggression because of the mere willingness to continue to exist is sometimes underestimated said bruno tertrais adviser for geopolitics at the institut montaigne a paris based think tank ukrainians are displaying the same resolve and ingenuity larysa shevtsova s apartment in ukraine s southern city of kherson lost its electricity and water but gas still flowed into a stove in the cramped kitchen with two fire resistant bricks and advice from a family friend she and her husband were able to keep the temperature bearable in their home without being confined to the kitchen they d set a brick directly on one of the stove s four burners the three others covered by large pots and a kettle when the rectangular block was hot enough it was carried carefully into the living room and set on top of a soviet era space heater that no longer worked shevtsova her husband and two sons one of them 3 years old huddled around the brick for warmth that would last for about 30 minutes we use this method to heat the room shevtsova said before that we just froze the associated press and the pbs series frontline drawing from a variety of sources have independently documented more than 40 attacks by russia on ukraine s electrical power heat water and telecommunications facilities since february the extent of russia s path of destruction is not limited to one region of ukraine from the east to west russia has unleashed an onslaught of drone and missile attacks meant to inflict maximum damage to ukraine s energy infrastructure with a drastic uptick in strikes since september according to ap s analysis of the data the repeated attacks have left ukrainians accustomed to daily blackouts to prevent overloading the system as temperatures continue to drop we should be clear about what russia is doing president joe biden said last week at the white house during a joint news conference with zelenskyy it is purposefully attacking ukraine s critical infrastructure destroying the systems that provide heat and light to the ukrainian people during the coldest darkest part of the year russia isn t slowing down its attacks on ukraine s energy grid on thursday russian missiles damaged power stations and other critical infrastructure in the biggest wave of strikes in weeks ukrainian military chief gen valerii zaluzhnyi said russia fired 69 missiles at energy facilities and ukrainian forces shot down 54 in a tweet ukrainian foreign minister dmytro kuleba called the latest barrage of missiles senseless barbarism russian president vladimir putin has said the attacks are a response to an oct 8 truck bombing of the bridge connecting russia s mainland with the crimean peninsula which moscow annexed from ukraine in 2014 the world health organization has estimated that 2 million to 3 million ukrainians will leave their homes this winter in search of warmth and safety it is absolutely the case that terrorizing the civilian population to break their morale to get them to demand of their leaders that they surrender is not a form of military necessity said mary ellen o connell a university of notre dame law professor and expert on international law even if you re attacking a military objective if the intent in doing so is to terrorize civilians then you have committed a war crime since the start of russia s invasion in february moscow has launched 168 missile strikes on ukraine s energy infrastructure with nearly 80 percent of the attacks occurring in october november and december according to kostin ukraine s state controlled naftogaz oil and gas company reported earlier this month that more than 350 of its facilities and 450 kilometers 279 miles of gas pipelines had sustained damage russia made ukraine s electrical grid its primary target because it s the easiest way to disrupt civilization and to create humanitarian catastrophe volodymyr kudrytskyi the ceo of state owned power grid operator nec ukrenergo told the ap without electricity he said basic utilities and other critical infrastructure sectors such as communications and health care are crippled no transmission system operator in the world ever encountered this large scale of destruction kudrytskyi said nec ukrenergo has described on facebook how hundreds of its technicians and specialists are dispatched to restore power when it s knocked out by patching what can be patched and replacing what can be replaced but it can be at times a sisyphean task russian shelling in early december cut off power in much of the newly liberated ukrainian city of kherson just days after it had been restored sarajevans experienced the same descent into darkness and cold in the mid 1990s when serb forces laid siege to the bosnian capital during the bloody breakup of yugoslavia like ukraine bosnia faced an existential threat from a neighboring nation that sought to control the country by carving it up a glaring difference between sarajevo and ukraine is the western world s response for nearly four years sarajevo s roughly 350 000 residents were trapped and faced daily shelling and sniper attacks cut off from regular access to electricity heat and water they survived on limited humanitarian aid from the united nations while drinking from wells and foraging for food fearing more bloodshed and seeking a political solution the united states and the european community the european union s predecessor backed a u n arms embargo on the former yugoslavia that blocked the bosnian government from acquiring weapons to fight back against serb attacks for ukraine money and weapons are flowing the united states has delivered or pledged billions of dollars in military aid including a patriot surface to air missile battery the most powerful such weapon committed to ukraine yet ukraine has weapons and what we got back then was an embargo on weapons said mirza mutevelić the 38 year old son of vildana mutevelić i perceive this as another injustice lamija polic a retired nurse in sarajevo dodged bullets to get water and used a metal garbage can as a stove firewood was hard to come by by the summer of 1993 most of sarajevo s trees were gone and people were digging up tree stumps so we burned everything we had slippers shoes old clothes books you name it polic said we heated the smallest room in our flat the kitchen and we spent all the time there you build a fire but it lasts for just a few minutes and then you wait until you can no longer stand the cold to build another one i remember that our blankets and sheets were so cold that you had a sense they were wet some residents of kherson a city on the dnieper river in southern ukraine are facing similar hardship the city was the only regional capital that moscow s forces seized falling into russian hands in the first days of the invasion and it was occupied for nearly nine months as they retreated in november russian forces wrecked power lines and other key infrastructure sending thousands of kherson s newly liberated residents into the dark larysa who declined to use her last name for fear of reprisals against her family told the ap in late november that at times she felt like she was having a nervous breakdown unlike many houses that are able to use gas larysa s home relied solely on electricity so when russian soldiers damaged energy supply lines she and her husband were left in the dark unable to cook or take hot showers so they ate canned mackerel pates and porridge without meat in the dark in their freezing apartment about once a week larysa went to a friend s house that still had gas to wash her hair in warm water and eat a home cooked meal she and her husband wanted to buy a portable generator but prices had spiked from about 190 to more than 1 600 larysa said i am tired of all of this and want my old life back larysa said in kyiv ukraine s capital mariia modzolevska has relied on a generator and a car battery to keep her cafe blukach up and running through the almost daily power outages customers still come in they charge their mobile phones and other gadgets while drinking the cafe s coffee and eating its sweet small bites modzolevska 34 devised ways to keep her shop powered an old recharged car battery keeps the credit card machine running a diesel generator powers the espresso machines we were making money until the first drone attack and blackouts then income dropped by 30 plus percent she said it s come back up ever since we equipped the coffee shop with power and internet i don t know for how long we may operate in the future tetiana boichenko s corner apartment in kyiv faces north even in november her bedroom was cold heat and electricity came and went in her neighborhood depending on whether russian missiles hit their targets boichenko bought a small tent for 10 and set it up on top of her bed inside the tent on top of a few blankets boichenko was 3 to 4 degrees warmer than the temperature of her room boichenko said she doesn t plan to take down her tent until spring i will sleep in it because it is warm she said ___ beatrice dupuy richard lardner and sabina niksic associated press dupuy reported from new york lardner from washington and niksic

3 3 bounce tsla stock is still down slightly for the week and 37 in december after such a huge sell off tesla stock was due for a bounce but remains far below key levels tesla stock is on track for its worst annual loss ever tesla model y tax credits the tesla bull case for 2023 relies heavily on new u s tax credits of up to 7 500 under the inflation reduction act fueling high margin domestic sales offsetting weaker demand and prices in china and possibly europe on thursday the treasury department listed vehicles that qualify for the u s ev credits most versions of the model y will have a 55 000 price cap to receive ev credits vs the 80 000 cap for suvs pickup trucks and vans but seven seat model y vehicles which have not been big sellers will be eligible up to 80 000 the current base model y in the u s starts at 65 990 tesla would need to slash the price perhaps by reintroducing a lower range model y sr to get tax credits unless it s a seven seat variant but there s yet another twist the treasury also said evs leased by consumers can qualify for commercial ev tax credits that makes evs assembled outside of north america eligible including the hyundai ioniq 5 and kia ev6 foreign automakers and u s allies in europe and asia had strongly objected to the north america assembly requirement but the leasing rules also appear to let any ev qualify at any price without income limits either it ll be interesting to see what tesla and other automakers do with regard to variants and pricing to maximize the benefit from the new tax credits guggenheim lowered tesla estimates for 2023 in part on the tax credit guidelines in short the disclosure is negative for tsla with most model y s being subject to a 55k price cap as a result only the 7 seat version of the model y will be eligible for the 80k price cap and while this will make that vehicle more attractive we believe it represents a low percentage of overall us sales the firm s analysts explained we previously estimated that 60 70 of tsla us units would qualify for ev sales credits based on current prices but with revised guidance that number is likely to be closer to 10 20 barring a price cut on the model 3 lr tsla

question is whether they will follow up in the coming days and weeks the market moved into correction on wednesday as the dow jones undercut its 50 day moving average and the nasdaq set a two year closing low so thursday was just day one of a new market rally attempt it s going to take lot more than that to feel more confident the dow jones is back above its 50 day line but still below its 21 day line the s p 500 is still below its 50 day with further resistance at its 200 day line and december peaks while tesla stock apple and many beaten down chip and software names led thursday s bounce some leading stocks flashed buy signals or moved into position such as medp stock time the market with ibd s etf market strategy what to do now it s tempting to move back into the market when the indexes are up sharply and there s a sea of green among leading and notable stocks but ever since the bear market bottom on oct 13 breakouts and buy signals have largely fizzled some sectors including industrial metal and medicals had held up better in recent weeks so it s easier to justify nibbling in this areas either with specific stocks or sector etfs but keep any exposure small and be quick to

new hampshire is home to many passionate ice fishers that spend their winter huddled in huts hoping to reel in some of the hardest to catch species there are tons of different fishing locations in new hampshire so there is something new to do even if you re an experienced fisherman whether you re just looking for something new or something unique we ve listed some of the best lakes for ice fishing in new hampshire below keep in mind regulations can differ depending on the lake therefore be sure to read the current regulations before you take to the ice 1 lake winnipesaukee one of the most popular lakes for ice fishing in new hampshire is lake winnipesaukee lake winnipesaukee is new hampshire s largest lake at more than 44 000 acres which is about 71 square miles its size is comparable to the famous lake champlain and moosehead lake which are also popular ice fishing spots there is an annual derby here put on by the meredith rotary club this derby has high cash prizes which often attracts many fishermen each year while there are many fish available throughout the year salmon cannot be taken through the ice therefore if you go ice fishing here you ll need to catch other fish instead such as cusk you can also find smallmouth bass in the drop off areas of the lake there are several islands where these fish like to hang out too lake winnipesaukee offers many access points one of the most popular is the public boat ramp in meredith however there are several others scattered around the lake too lake winnipesaukee is the largest lake in new hampshire istock com gerry fagan 2 massabesic lake this lake covers about 2 500 acres and provides practically all the drinking water for manchester which is located near the lake this lake holds about 15 billion gallons of water allowing the town to take plenty of water without really draining the lake on top of providing drinking water the lake also has plenty of fishing opportunities for instance it is stocked with trout of several species each year the lake also has self sustaining populations of both largemouth and smallmouth bass therefore there are lots of fishing opportunities during many of the months this lake isn t terribly deep however there are some larger holes that reach about 50 feet deep in some cases there are many public access areas as well therefore getting on the lake is pretty straightforward lake massabesic covers over 25 00 acres in manchester and auburn new hampshire istock com jon bilous 3 mirror lake mirror lake is a smaller lake that doesn t get as much traffic therefore it s a good option for someone looking for a more solitary fishing experience this lake is only 54 acres there are many other lakes nearby so many people tend to choose larger lakes this lake offers just about everything the larger lakes do just in a miniature size making it one of the best lakes for ice fishing in new hampshire plus the lake is stocked with brown rainbow and brook trout therefore you can easily find most kinds of trout in this lake plus there is public access on the western shore these are the unusual ice patterns that wildlife photographer karl ramsdell captured with a drone in mirror lake new hampshire this might be caused by heat rising from the water below pic twitter com gnaucvtquu massimo rainmaker1973 january 11 2022 4 squam lake despite being in the shadow of lake winnipesaukee squam lake is a great opportunity for fishermen at 6 791 acres it has a range of different species for instance you ll find perch pickerel lake trout largemouth bass and smallmouth bass there is easy access to this lake too if lake winnipesaukee is a bit too crowded for you you may want to consider visiting this lake instead it offers a similar fishing experience on a smaller scale squam lake is northwest of lake winnipesaukee istock com jason heid 5 tewksbury pond as the name suggests this is more of a pond than a lake it takes up only 47 acres and only goes down to about 50 feet deep the state stocks the pond with brown trout in the spring and fall which is the main reason it draws fishermen you can find other species of trout as well rainbow and brook trout are also stocked in the pond periodically however because it is so small there aren t many sustaining fish populations if you re interested in trout this may be a solid option for you 6 lake winnisquam this lake isn t one of the most popular in the area but you can still find a healthy population of rainbow trout bass white perch and lake trout here all of these species are pretty easy to catch within the lake where ice fishing is open from january to march if you re interested in rainbow trout most experts recommend fishing in shallower parts of the lake which is 4 214 acres however lake trout often congregate in the deeper part of the lake lake winnisquam is the fourth largest lake that is entirely in new hampshire with over 4 000 acres istock com eric broder van dyke 7 first connecticut lake this lake is positioned in the far northeastern portion of the state so many people have to drive a bit to get to it however it is 2 800 acres long making it plenty big and more than able to support several fishermen it has a healthy population of many types of fish including lake trout and cusk plus much of the lake s shoreline is covered by forests therefore it offers a more secluded option for fishermen looking for more secluded fishing spots this is the top reason so many fishermen like coming to first connecticut lake making it one of the best lakes for ice fishing in new hampshire first connecticut lake is the largest lake on the first connecticut river offering some of the best fishing in new england nekvt shutterstock com 8 newfound lake newfound lake features two lighthouses and is in a beautiful part of the state the lake is 4 451 acres and often a destination for ice fishers interested in a more scenic view it s one of the best lakes for ice fishing in new hampshire and it even has its own annual ice fishing derby you can purchase tickets at one of the local boat launches and partake you can find many different fish species here however the rainbow trout is the biggest draw the lake produces large rainbow trout every season so it s a great place for those looking for larger trout you can also find lake trout though they aren t usually as plentiful here new hampshire s newfound lake has around 22 miles of shoreline istock com eli wilson 9 lake sunapee lake sunapee is best known for its crazy water clarity you can see down to around 30 feet in some places of course you won t be seeing down nearly this far when ice fishing both types of bass can be found in this lake which are the main species fishermen seem to go after here there are several boat launches on lake sunapee that allow for easy access this lake which covers 4 136 acres does sometimes freeze later than others so be sure to check if it is open to ice fishing before heading out lake sunapee is the fifth largest lake located entirely in new hampshire and contains 11 islands istock com sawbear 10 highland lake this lake is very small at only 700 acres therefore it is considered one of the least challenging lakes in new hampshire as you can move across it much easier the fish tend to be easier to find as well because they just don t have as many places to go usually anglers look for smallmouth and largemouth bass on highland lake however in the shallow areas you can also find pickerel perch and crappie there is a boat ramp on the lake

local businesses jackson emc and lawson air conditioning plumbing recap their efforts to maintain utility services through single digit temperatures over the holiday weekend as temperatures in northeast georgia dipped close to zero over the christmas weekend many residents found themselves in a tenuous situation between frozen and bursting pipes to power outages utility services throughout the region were inundated by calls and maintenance requests power provider jackson emc set records for their power usage reaching over 1 500 megawatts as crews worked around the clock to restore power to more than 23 000 members who were impacted director of public relations wendy jones said she is grateful to have such a strong team of technicians who were willing to put their own holidays on hold in order to restore power for the users we really appreciate the hard work and long hours that are fully put in jones said we appreciate the understanding of their families because they were with us they weren t with their families one of the major aspects that helped jackson emc manage power output was mindful customers jones said while they didn t have to formally put out a notice for users to lessen their power consumption many users did so on their own which helped take enormous stress off the system the 1 525 megawatt record was set during the coldest hours on the morning of december 24 in comparison the previous record was set in july 2022 reaching 1 343 megawatts as a result of residents running their air conditioning units because of that we really do plan for those high demand periods and we spent all last week preparing and obviously before that but especially last week preparing to be ready to roll to repair and replace equipment as needed jones said and we did replace approximately 130 transformers within 48 hours this past weekend jones reported that morale was high during the service times while having so many power technicians on call it was no easy task leaving many workers tired and cold after long hours our number one priority is making sure folks have that power in their homes jones said and we re a family here at jackson emc and it is our responsibility to make sure that our member s families are comfortable at home so although it was hard work very long hours lots of folks inside and outside obviously those of us that got to stay inside were much more comfortable than the crews that were outside but again they know that that is our number one priority and like i said everybody was willing to step up and get it done debbie lawson davis the owner of lawson air conditioning plumbing said the holiday weekend was hectic but made easier with the help of a strong willing workforce the company fielded over 230 calls throughout the weekend their phone service reportedly went down for 12 hours as well and davis estimated another 200 calls may have slipped by during that time some of those were no heat calls davis said but so many of them were i would say our plumbing calls that could have been leaks or broken pipes or frozen you know we even had frozen wells we had frozen pipes we even had frozen lines on haters davis said they were forced to interrupt their own family holiday celebrations in order to help dispatch calls to those in need lawson ac plumbing had six technicians on call responding to a combined 120 calls over a four day period many of the technicians reported over 60 hours worked for the week arriving at 4 00 a m to assist with flooding homes in some cases we had some you know that we got up there we assessed the problem we got the water cut off they had to call their insurance company davis said their insurance company said don t do anything until we send an adjuster so you know we had to pause on those and couldn t really get them repaired until the insurance company assessed what they needed to with all hands on deck davis said they were able to help a lot of local residents over the holidays which in some ways was a reward in and of itself they were happy to help davis said and of course they got rewarded when they saw the customer satisfaction and knew that they made a difference for them so i think it was rewarding beyond a financial reward for them pay day today but they knew that we re making a difference for those folks who relied on them to get them back their lives back into normal davis said one of the lessons they learned moving forward was how sensitive the supply chain can be she was grateful they were able to eventually obtain all the materials and equipment they needed for both commercial and residential repairs but there were some situations where small parts became unavailable or lagged in delivery davis plans to maintain a deeper inventory stock during extreme weather events in the future the director of water resources for the city of gainesville linda macgregor estimated over 1 000 customers experienced some form of a pipe break or leak at their homes even still the main hub for water resources in gainesville had breaks of its own over the holiday weekend as well macgregor said getting through the extreme weather conditions was only made possible because of the on call technicians and workers who were standing by to help we actually have an amazing workforce of people that are willing to come in when they re on call macgregor said they know they re on call over a holiday weekend they don t always know what they re responding to when they get on the road to respond to the call they re just really an amazing group of people who are willing to do what s necessary and you know day or night rain and cold they re just truly amazing and this weekend was no different macgregor put an emphasis on customers ability to go online to the gainesville city water website and view a portal that shows your water use in a detailed breakdown you can learn more about jackson emc and lawson air conditioning plumbing by visiting their websites

an interest rate selloff but not a credit selloff like in previous years in the muni market including during the pandemic and the great financial crisis it s been a dismal year for most investment strategies across traditional asset classes said catherine stienstra head of municipal investments at columbia threadneedle investments so there was nowhere to hide this year as this aggressive focus on fighting inflation from the has caused rates to sell off dramatically but while inflation is still high stienstra said the market is moving more toward perhaps a pivot from the fed and more confidence that municipal bonds have been oversold in this environment moreover inflation despite being significantly high is starting to fall in december the federal open market committee opted to hike rates 50 basis points after four consecutive 75 basis point rate hikes and while there will be a few more rate hikes in 2023 she said the aggressive fed tightening that has taken place so far is starting to tighten financial conditions in such a way that will start to impact the economy and we ll see slower growth in 2023 in that kind of environment is typically when you re going to see bonds start to outperform stienstra added muni mutual funds have seen record outflows that erased the strong inflows from 2021 outflows continued as refinitiv lipper reported 1 946 billion was pulled from

while exchange traded funds saw inflows of 452 988 million after 313 254 million of outflows the previous week the selloff has also erased the last positive price performance of the investment grade indices going back over the last 14 years she said once more indicating how challenging this year has been given the negative performance seen in the declining navs there s just been a vicious cycle of fund redemptions and then mutual fund managers having to increase bid wanteds to fund those redemptions she said and it still continues the muni market has seen tax loss swapping further exacerbating mutual fund redemptions etfs which are growing significantly and have seen inflows have benefited etfs have been the recipient of the mutual funds selling and the outflows where investors are parking the tax loss swaps into these etfs she said credit spreads are still relatively tight she said investment grade lower investment grade and high yield were in sync until the last few months of this year when some high yield spreads widened however she noted it s more of those more liquid names in the high yield sector we believe that an up and quality bias is probably most likely to outperform in 2023 just from the credit side as the economy slows down and we believe that credit selection will be important as we head into 2023 she said the market is entering 2023 in pretty solid condition revenues are coming in stronger and rainy day funds are higher than they were entering this downturn additionally the fiscal stimulus issuers received as a result of the pandemic supported

we expect more favorable conditions for the year ahead said nigel green ceo and founder of devere group some themes will still matter to investors in 2023 inflation china and the u s dollar bond markets traditionally a safe haven in times of volatility have declined by 12 averagely he said adding that stocks and cryptocurrency also fell the downward moves of financial markets have wiped out tens of trillions of dollars in wealth over the last year inflation will ease he said allowing central banks to ease their feet off the economic brakes going easier on interest rate hikes before winding down even wage inflation should cool china s reopening green said could be the most visible most anticipated and most impactful upside boost for global markets we ve seen in recent times the rebound is likely to be dramatic as for the dollar it should peak in the middle of the year before weakening the dollar s strength has fueled inflation he said and added to the need for some central banks around the world to tighten their own financial conditions this will all ease when the dollar s supremacy weakens but josé torres senior economist at interactive brokers sees 2023 as another tough year for investors after a difficult year in which the federal reserve underestimated inflation and aggressively tightened monetary policy in order to catch up investors are likely to spend 2023 dealing with declining business performance and dwindling valuations he said consumers will curtail spending due to inflation driven by an incredibly tight labor market a shift from globalization toward regionalization geopolitical tensions relative inefficiencies regarding supply chains climbing commodity prices and continued deficit spending the result will be slower revenues and higher costs point to margin compression and earnings coming under pressure torres said
as we get ready to ring in 2023 we ve compiled what we think are the 10 most important stories we followed and reported on for our town in 2022 here s a rundown of each with links included if you want to go back in time and read our coverage more in depth we look forward to covering the issues people and events in and around riverhead in 2023 happy new year downtown revitalization in riverhead continued with a 10 million boost supervisor yvette aguiar and councilmen frank beyrodt left bob kern ken rothwell and tim hubbard after the 10 million grant announcement in the supervisor s office this morning courtesy photo town of riverhead joseph maiorana this past year was perhaps the most important for downtown riverhead since the town began revitalization efforts years ago 2022 started off with a bang when the state announced on jan 13 that riverhead had won a 10 million downtown revitalization initiative award from the new york department of state to invest in both public and private projects downtown throughout the year a local planning committee made up of state and local officials and business leaders with community input recommended 10 projects totaling funding requests of 13 4 million though the amount of funding that would actually be available was 9 7 million after fees for consultants hired by the state to assist with the planning and application process were deducted from the 10 million award those recommendations culminated in an announcement last tuesday that eight of the projects would be funded by the award most of them at the full amount recommended by the committee at the center of it all is the riverhead town square a public space project that started development in 2019 and leapt forward in 2020 with the town s purchase of three buildings on the south side of east main street town sponsored projects in the square received just under 3 5 million in funding from the dri award following the demolition of two of the buildings last year to make way for the town square it was planted with grass and improved with a cement walkway this year connecting main street to the riverfront and even became home to a 18 foot spruce that was decorated as a christmas tree for a new riverhead holiday tradition the town board took the town square s development further this year by also designating j petrocelli development associates the master developer of the town square project endorsing a proposal that included a boutique hotel on the east side of the square and a condominium building on the riverfront a master developer agreement for the project is still in negotiations and is expected to be revealed early next year with revisions from its initial iteration the final design of the town square and other riverfront development is still taking shape the long island science center is also still developing plans to renovated the building on the west side of the square as a new museum with a planetarium the town is also looking at building possibly two parking garages off of main street to make up for parking space on the riverfront that will be lost to new uses aside from town sponsored projects development proposals for other properties downtown are also in motion those projects include a five story mixed use addition to the back of the suffolk theater a four story mixed use building at the former west marine building called landmark at riverhead a four story mixed use building on mcdermott avenue known as the zenith building and a five story mixed use apartment complex on east main street redevelopment of the blighted area around the long island rail road station also took steps forward with the designation of rxr and georgica green ventures as the joint master developers of the town s transit oriented development project the developers were designated qualified and eligible under urban renewal law by the town board in october and a master developer agreement has been executed the developer proposed a four and five story mixed use building with 243 apartments and podium parking on an internal portion of the ground floor lined by perimeter uses on the two acre town owned parking lot between court street and railroad avenue in addition a mixed use multi level building with 36 workforce apartments and retail shops along griffing avenue is also proposed on a county owned parking lot with a multi level parking garage planned for behind the building this project received 2 75 million in dri funding the town board also approved plans for a five story mixed use apartment building on the corner of osborn avenue and court street with a blighted long vacant medical office being demolished to make way for the new development a lot of industrial development was proposed in calverton sparking calls for a moratorium a 641 000 square foot logistics center tenant unknown is proposed on middle road in calverton pictured is a 640 000 square foot amazon fulfillment center in nampa idaho photo adobe stock tracy king this year continued the trend of a slew of proposals for industrial development in the hamlet of calverton included in those proposals is a 641 000 square foot riverhead logistics center facility proposed by northpoint on middle road the planning board adopted the final scoping statement for the environmental review of the project in october and the project is awaiting a submission of a draft environmental impact statement the planning board also continued the review of the 2020 application for a 412 629 square foot industrial building complex proposed by hk ventures on 30 acres on middle country road the board accepted the final environmental impact statement for the project and is currently accepting comments on a supplemental environmental impact statement these projects were criticized by local residents throughout the year for the potential truck traffic they could bring to an area with primarily residential roads the planning board also began review of a 131 acre industrial subdivision on middle country road by ostad riverhead that would prime the land for millions of square feet of industrial development plans for the expansion of two existing warehouses in calverton the pods warehouse whose owner is seeking to double its size and 74 650 square feet addition to an existing 139 806 square foot warehouse with 127 415 square feet of new outdoor storage also surfaced this year as did plans for a u haul warehouse and self storage facility in addition to that development there s the ongoing development proposed for the calverton enterprise park where a developer proposes building an air cargo hub and other industrial buildings on land it seeks to purchase from riverhead town or proposals for other industrial buildings meant for warehouses and storage but in the midst of the review of the applications for these and other industrial projects this october the riverhead planning board came out in support of a moratorium on industrial projects outside of the calverton enterprise park some residents have been urging the town board to impose an industrial moratorium for the last two years but to no avail if you ve been to a town board meeting lately you ve heard the word moratorium more than once a moratorium is a temporary pause on designated development activity while a comprehensive plan is being written the town board can halt the processing of applications for new development by adopting a local law establishing a moratorium the main reason why both the planning board and residents want a moratorium particularly in the industrial zoning districts located outside the calverton enterprise park is because of the age of the town s current comprehensive plan last revised between 1999 and 2003 the town is currently going through the process of revising and updating the comp plan which is supposed to guide development within the town but the process for revising the plan was delayed over and over again since it got underway in early 2020 the existing plan adopted in 2003 does not contemplate some uses currently proposed in industrial districts such as high cube warehousing and distribution centers the development also has the potential to create significant cumulative impacts on things like traffic air quality the character of the calverton hamlet and the town s water and sewer infrastructure moratorium advocates say the proposed projects require in depth study through the comprehensive planning process but the only town board member in support of a moratorium for the full length of the estimated time to complete the comprehensive plan update following the planning board s recommendation was council member tim hubbard who proposed an 18 month moratorium other board members argued a moratorium could stall tax base growth in the town and two members said might support a short term moratorium but only if it exempted projects the greater calverton civic association started asking for a moratorium in the fall of 2020 but the idea did not gain traction with the town board outcry for a moratorium particularly from calverton residents has escalated within the last few months at town board and planning board meetings at the last town board meeting of the year community members rallied outside of town hall and then packed the meeting room to urge the adoption of a moratorium the board has a resolution on its jan 4 agenda scheduling a public hearing on a 6 month moratorium proposal but it remains to be seen if three members will support it discussions on whether to adopt a moratorium and what it should look like will most certainly continue in the new year as passionate residents show no signs of letting up their pressure the town board also extended a moratorium on applications to build solar energy production systems this year continuing the pause on development for another use being built primarily in calverton near the lipa substation on edwards avenue the comprehensive plan update stalled again akrf senior vice president robert white right and riverhead building and planning administrator jefferson murphree during a public meeting at riverhead town hall in april photo denise civiletti riverhead s comprehensive plan update process hit its biggest snag yet this year dissatisfied with the slow pace of progress and shallow depth of study on the update to the 20 year old master planning document the town board in july terminated its contract with the planning firm first hired in late 2019 to prepare the comp plan update akrf originally scheduled to be completed in august 2021 the completion date was extended for one year and then extended again to spring 2023 the town s top planner who is leading the comprehensive plan update along with akrf were also criticized by jamesport civic association members in february for being out of touch with residents after the community outreach meetings murphree who lives on the south fork also said during a civic association meeting that he never personally drove on sound avenue on a weekend and had no first hand experience of heavy traffic on the roadway he said the same about crowded town beaches and wineries the central advisory committee for the comprehensive plan update made up of town officials residents and business leaders only had one meeting in 2022 during the march meeting the sub consultants hired to do traffic analysis for the plan l k mclean associates presented recommendations for easing traffic congestion and improving transportation throughout the town in connection with the plan update among the recommendations during the meeting was widening sound avenue and adding a center turning lane and bike lanes along the length of the road the recommendation was not received well by committee members and sparked public backlash causing the consultants and building and planning administrator jefferson murphree to walk back the recommendation during a presentation to the town board days later he denied that the consultants had recommended adding a center turning lane along the length of sound avenue and there has been misinterpretation in the press about the idea he said that the center turning lane would only be at certain choke points on the road after a string of community meetings in april there was radio silence about the progress of the comprehensive plan update until supervisor yvette aguiar announced on june 24 that the town would be terminating its contract with akrf the town took three months to decide what planning firm would succeed akrf to complete the plan the board heard pitches from three firms in august h2m architects engineers bfj planning and cashin associates before inviting back bfj and h2m a second time this time with cost and work estimates the town board finally decided to hire bfj on oct 6 and said they would pursue hiring l k mclean associates to continue the firm s traffic and infrastructure analysis for the project at last week s board meeting the town board authorized a 422 000 contract with bfj planning and l k mclean as sub contractors to finish the update residents and town officials alike hope to see progress on the plan in 2023 although the 14 month timeframe given by bfj to complete the plan means the town won t adopt a full plan until 2024 at the earliest the stalled process has only invigorated calls for moratorium on development especially in calverton town board members said analysis on the impacts of solar energy systems battery storage systems anaerobic digestion systems and the repair of the town s ineffective transfer of development rights program are some of the biggest priorities for the update the fight for drinking water extensions in manorville and calverton continued clean water activist adrienne esposito speaks at a press conference in manorville nov 23 where residents gathered to demand state officials provide funding for public water in a remote area of manorville where private wells are contaminated with toxic chemicals photo alek lewis the goal of getting public water extensions to homes serviced by polluted private wells in calverton and manorville got a lot closer to being realized this year riverhead town received two federal grants throughout the year for the public water extension projects through the congressional community project funding program 3 5 million in march and 2 million in december riverhead officials said the federal funds will be split proportionately between riverhead water district extension projects in calverton and in manorville the latter of which is in partnership with suffolk county water authority under an agreement reached in september to fund an extension project in the hamlet in homes in both the towns of riverhead and brookhaven the riverhead cost of the manorville project is an estimated 9 5 million while the other extension projects in calverton also cost an estimated 9 5 million other state grant applications by the town were not funded although town officials said they anticipate having more funding opportunities coming in the new year residents in the manorville and calverton area continued to show up to town board meetings and water forums to demand action and advocate for clean water they also held a protest after riverhead s funding application was denied to demand state officials bring funding to the drinking water projects in june the environmental protection agency issued a new lifetime health advisory for pfas chemicals in drinking water due to new analysis that showed an impact on human health at exposure levels much lower than reflected by the agency s 2016 lifetime health advisory the epa is also in the process of creating drinking water maximum contaminant levels for the substances despite the new advisory the u s navy will still rely on the old epa health advisory level to rule out intervention in areas near the former naval weapons reserve plant in calverton residents continued to argue this year that activity by grumman which manufactured and tested aircraft for the navy at the facility from the 1950s until 1996 is to blame for the pollution in their private wells navy representatives said their testing does not draw a causal relationship the coronavirus roller coaster ride continued protesters outside the high school in january photo alek lewis the coronavirus disrupted life in 2020 and 2021 and that trend continued in 2022 the year started off with a surge of coronavirus cases fueled by the omicron variant of the virus resulting in school absences after the winter break cases started to drop off gradually by late january it was found that the omicron variant although more contagious than previous variants caused less severe illness at the end of january the mask mandate debate hit a high point in riverhead after a nassau county judge struck down a mask mandate requirement although the mandate was still enforced pending an appeal the ruling sent some community members to protest the restrictions at riverhead central school district offices people also protested the restrictions in front of the high school days later including with representatives from the right wing political group the long island loud majority the mask mandate in schools remained until february when new center of disease control and prevention guidance prompted gov kathy hochul to lift the mandate the school board removed the mandate from the district s reopening plan days later new vaccines and guidance on booster shots also came and went in march the food and drug administration authorized a second covid 19 vaccine booster shot for people 50 and over and for all other people age 5 and older in the following months in august the cdc changed its covid 19 guidance and quarantine recommendations to make the disease less disruptive to everyday life and removed strategies like test to stay for schools the school year started with no mask mandate and no quarantine requirement the most normal it felt since the virus shut down the country in 2020 in september a new bivalent coronavirus vaccine booster shot crafted to give greater protection against the omicron variant of the virus became available masks also became optional in public transportation although the requirement for masks in healthcare facilities is still in place currently transmission rates for coronavirus and other respiratory illnesses are high in new york suffolk county has a high transmission rate and people in suffolk county are advised by the cdc to take precautions including wearing a high quality mask or respirator in public places and on public transportation in addition to keeping up with their vaccinations although 2022 might be coming to a close the coronavirus seems to want to stick around the sale of calverton enterprise park land entered a new chapter rendering of cat s phase 1a development by cat s architect rld architecture riverhead town s 40 million sale of more than 1 600 acres of undeveloped land in the calverton enterprise park took several steps forward this year the town unveiled a plan in february to complete the long delayed real estate transaction between the town community development agency and calverton aviation and technology a triple five company caused by the town s inability to move its state department of environmental conservation permit applications forward necessary to subdivide the land in march the town approved the transfer of its land holdings to the riverhead industrial development agency 1 644 acres of which are currently under contract to sell to cat and made a joint application with cat to the ida for benefits to induce the redevelopment of the site only about 600 acres are developable with more than 1 000 acres considered environmentally sensitive to be set aside for preservation if the ida approves the application for benefits the town will transfer the land to the ida and both the town and cat will enter into lease and project agreements with the ida that town officials say will require cat to complete the intended development plan required by cat s current contract with the town approved in december 2017 the lease and project agreement between the ida and cat would also shift the burden of obtaining subdivision and other approvals to cat at cat s expense the ida in september released the joint application by the town and cat for financial assistance for the first stage of development the ida benefits sought include real property tax abatements sales use tax exemptions and mortgage recording tax exemptions during a presentation following the application s release representatives from cat revealed a plan to transform the calverton enterprise park into a regional air cargo logistics hub for package delivery services to consumers on long island the development would also include flex buildings to have tenants in the aeronautics industrial aviation environmental energy medical and educational fields in the following weeks cat representatives released statements contradicting its presentation to the ida with attorney chris kent saying that cat has no intent to develop an air cargo jetport after it was reported in october that the law firm hired by the ida to do the due diligence review on cat s financials represented a triple five subsidiary in connection with the ghermezian family s american dream mega mall in new jersey the ida last week hired a new transaction counsel to avoid a perceived conflict of interest in the community the joint application remains under review by the ida meanwhile the financial situation of triple five a parent company of cat raised questions about the firm s financial feasibility to undertake the massive development the firm is currently involved in a civil racketeering lawsuit claiming a triple five subsidiary and members of the ghermezian family sold counterfeit hand sanitizer beginning in the early days of the covid 19 pandemic the company also missed debt payments on its new jersey megamall project which it lost more than 59 million in during

the new york times reported this week that although both russia and ukraine are open to peace talks to end the war both of the governments hard line positions make it unlikely that serious

2021 mourning continued for the five members of the rivera family natives of jeréz jutiapa guatemala who lived on the third floor of the multifamily home and died in the blaze zonia dinora rivera mendoza her children carlos cifredo peñate rivera 25 and andrea isamar gonzález rivera 16 and her nephews duglas edgardo rivera aguirre 27 and carlos alberto ramos aguirre 24 a riverheadlocal investigation into the home s compliance with safety requirements found that the third floor apartment where the rivera s died did not have two independent means of escape as required by the n y state multiple residence law town officials said a letter of pre existing use issued by the town in 2009 exempted the building from that requirement however town records do not present a clear picture of the building s pre existing use status as far as the third floor apartment is concerned and contained numerous inconsistencies the records also show riverhead town issued rental permits for the third floor apartment for more than 20 years despite the fact that town tax records have the structure listed as a three family dwelling containing apartments on the first and second floors only and notwithstanding the lack of a second means of egress for the third floor apartment the riverhead town board took action to prevent similar incidents from occurring introducing a local law to reform its rental dwelling units code the amendment which passed in june and takes effect in the new year requires that homeowners renting homes three stories or more have a sprinkler system a second means of egress and an interconnected smoke detection and alarm system the local law also reduced the term of the town s rental permit from two years to one year to allow town officials to inspect rental homes more often for compliance with fire safety codes the suffolk county police department also released the documents detailing what happened during the fire on nov 16 the fast moving fire was caused when recently extinguished cigarette butts discarded in a plastic receptacle on the porch of the home sparked a fire in the receptacle which then ignited a cushioned wicker couch on the porch and spread throughout the home what remained of the home was finally demolished on oct 18 the community continued to mourn the rivera family and held a second candlelight vigil in their memory on the anniversary of their death the rivera family s story will continue into 2023 as notices of claims for damages were served on the town as well as suffolk county by the proposed administrator of the estates of the rivera family early in the year riverhead town also served three summonses on the homeowner carmela cannella just three weeks before the fatal fire for renting the apartments without

requirements of substantial funding to conduct our planned research development and commercialization activities for a list and a description of the risks and uncertainties that we face please see the reports we have filed with the securities and exchange commission i would now like to turn the call over to lonnel coats advertisement advertisement lonnel coats thank you mike good afternoon everyone and thank you for joining us as expected the third quarter of 2022 was an active period for both of our lead programs sotagliflozin our dual sglt1 and 2 inhibitor that we re developing for heart failure and lx9211 our aak1 inhibitor that we are developing for neuropathic pain let me jump in and tell you that i m very pleased to report we had our mid cycle review meeting with the fda earlier this week for nda for sotagliflozin for the treatment of heart failure the agency indicated that there were no significant review issues that may impact approvability of the nda that it had identified no major safety concerns and that it has no plans to hold in an advisory committee meeting so everything remains on track for an anticipated pdufa target action date in may of 2023 we continue to believe the unique data from our soloist whf trial and recent and worsening heart failure may provide a point of differentiation and strong entry into the heart failure market if approved just this past weekend unique new data from the soloist whf trial was presented at the american heart association scientific sessions demonstrating sotagliflozin significant effects in reducing cardiovascular mortality and the risk of hospital readmission at 30 and 90 days following discharge after an initial event this is a significant finding that we believe could provide tremendous benefit to patients physicians hospitals and payers and help differentiate sotagliflozin within the current heart failure treatment paradigm we look forward to continuing to work with fda throughout the remainder of the review period and if approved for marketing we are expected to commercially launch sotagliflozin in the u s in the first half of next year and preparations for which are already well underway moving to our lx9211 program for neuropathic pain as you know we announced positive top line results from our phase ii proof of concept study of lx9211 in painful diabetic neuropathy earlier this year final data from this successful trial will be presented this coming monday at the 16th annual pain therapeutic summit in washington d c which will be followed by a conference call discussing the final results in detail and their importance in this area of significant unmet medical need also we completed enrollment in a second phase ii proof of concept study of lx9211 in post herpetic neuralgia earlier this quarter with top line results anticipated to readout before the end of this year we believe lx9211 represents an innovative approach to treating neuropathic pain and if approved could provide a significant improvement to the treatment landscape for the benefit of patients now i will turn the call over to jeff to put into context some of the recent analysis from the sotagliflozin program jeff advertisement advertisement jeff wade thank you lonnel more than 6 million people in the united states are living with heart failure with about a million new cases diagnosed each year and these numbers are on the rise failure is already a very large multi billion dollar market that is poised for substantial growth due both to increasing prevalence and to the anticipated adoption of sglt inhibitors as an important element of the standard of care driven in part by new guidelines recently issued by major cardiology societies in the united states and elsewhere recommending their use in treating heart failure heart failure is the leading cause of hospitalization for americans over 65 with approximately 1 million hospitalizations for heart failure annually patients who are hospitalized for heart failure are very likely to return with approximately 25 of patients being readmitted to the hospital within 30 days of discharge and 65 within one year these hospital readmissions are burdensome for the patient the provider and the healthcare system overall there is a substantial unmet need for better treatment options for patients and a strong incentive for providers and hospitals to identify new approaches to reduce hospital readmissions as lonnel mentioned dr bertram pitt presented an important post hoc analysis of some unique data from the soloist whf trial at the american heart association scientific sessions this past weekend assessing sotagliflozin s effects in reducing cardiovascular mortality and the risk of hospital readmissions at 30 and 90 days following discharge from a heart failure hospitalization i will now turn the call over to craig to review some of the data from dr pitt s aha presentation and to discuss the importance of these findings see also 10 cheap solar stocks to buy and cultural influence by country top 25 advertisement advertisement craig granowitz okay jeff as a reminder the soloist whf trial enrolled approximately 1 200 patients with type 2 diabetes and worsening heart failure double blind randomized treatment began either in the hospital or within three days following discharge there are approximately 50 of patients in each of these categories the primary endpoint for this trial was achieved with a statistically significant and clinically meaningful reduction of 33 in the composite of total cardiovascular death hospitalization for heart failure and urgent heart failure visits with the need to treat only four patients to avoid one event a finding which is unsurpassed within the sglt inhibitor class the objective of dr pitt s post hoc analysis was to evaluate the efficacy of sotagliflozin versus placebo at reducing hospital readmissions and mortality within 30 and 90 days after discharge from a heart failure hospitalization among the patients who began study treatment on or before discharge as a reminder there were no differences between these two groups for baseline characteristics or the primary endpoint presented here are the results for cardiovascular death and heart failure related events for the first 30 days post discharge you can clearly see the sotagliflozin arm in blue begins to separate from the placebo arm in red very early on reaching a significant reduction in events of 51 compared to placebo by 30 days with a p value of zero equals 0 023 now extending to 90 days post discharge you can see that the separation and reduction are maintained with a reduction in events of 46 compared to placebo by 90 days with a p value of 0 004 the authors concluded that sotagliflozin significantly reduces the 30 and 90 day rates of cardiovascular mortality and heart failure related events as well as total mortality by 90 days post discharge when administered prior to hospital discharge after an episode of worsening heart failure these findings are unique and they underscore the benefits of early initiation of evidence based heart failure therapy sotagliflozin is the first compound to demonstrate a reduction on both mortality and heart failure events for treatment initiated during a worsening heart failure hospitalization we certainly agree with the author that these results have important implications for patient quality of life and healthcare costs and expect that these data to be key points of differentiation in the marketplace should sotagliflozin obtain regulatory approval now turning briefly to our lx9211 program lx9211 is a potent highly selective small molecule inhibitor of a novel target the adapter associated kinase one or aak one in a number of clinically relevant animal models of neuropathic pain lx9211 demonstrated consistent significant reductions in pain scores even when compared to positive controls such as gabapentin lx9211 achieves high levels of drug in the cns and importantly the mechanism of action of lx9211 is independent of the opioid pathway in phase 1 studies lx9211 was shown to be well tolerated with a pharmacokinetic profile supportive of once daily dosing lexicon has been granted fast track designation by the fda for diabetic peripheral neuropathic pain as we discussed during our last quarterly call the primary endpoint of the relief dpn 1 study was achieved with a statistically significant reduction in average daily pain score or adps at week six compared to placebo in the low dose arm it was an absolute reduction in adps from baseline of 1 39 points with a p value of 0 007 compared to placebo advertisement advertisement the high dose arm achieved a reduction from baseline of 1 27 points with a p value of 0 03 compared to placebo narrowly missing the significant threshold of 0 28 but showing consistent effects importantly the therapeutic effect was seen early during treatment with separation from placebo being evident and statistically significant by week one in both arms and remaining throughout the treatment period also the drug effect was remarkably consistent across a range of baseline factors including age sex background medication and baseline pain score importantly the patient s reported outcomes which are a measure of patient s overall wellbeing or experience in the study showed greater improvement in those treated with lx9211 compared to placebo adverse events were more frequent in the lx9211 treatment arms particularly at the higher dose as expected based on our experience in phase 1 the most common adverse events observed were dizziness headache and nausea would nearly all reported as mild or moderate in nature what we did not observe in the safety profile of lx9211 were some of the limitations of current therapies for painful diabetic neuropathy such as peripheral edema increased appetite blurred vision for dry mouth the adverse events tended to occur early in treatment suggesting the possibility that they may be associated with the loading dose and given the rapid onset of effects on adps offering the potential for further optimized dosing for both tolerability and efficacy to summarize we believe the results of the relief dpn 1 study support aak 1 inhibition as a potential new mechanism of action for treating neuropathic pain and the rapid advancement of lx9211 in development for treatment of diabetic neuropathic pain we believe that lx9211 has the potential to overcome many of the shortcomings of current therapies and could become a welcome new innovation for those suffering from neuropathic pain on a daily basis we are continuing to work to identify and optimize the proper dosing regimens and we are planning to engage in a dialogue with fda on how best to advance the program into phase 3 development as quickly and efficiently as possible we believe this program would benefit from a partnership that offers the right strategic fit for our organization and stakeholders and are engaged in discussions in this regard which we believe will yield a positive outcome in the meantime we are proceeding with our plans for further development without pause lastly a reminder that the final results of the relief dpn trial beyond which we have already reported as top line results will be presented at an oral presentation this upcoming monday november 14 at the 16 annual pain therapeutic summit in washington dc immediately following the presentation we will host a conference call at 5 00 pm eastern time to review the final results and we invite you all to participate the details for which can be found on our website i d now like to turn the call back to jeff to take us through the financial results for the third quarter of 2022 advertisement advertisement jeff wade thank you craig i will provide some key aspects of our third quarter 2022 financial results more financial details may be found in the press release that we issued earlier today and our 10 q filed with the sec we ended the quarter with 136 2 million in cash and investments this amount includes net proceeds of 94 3 million from the public offering and concurrent private placement of our common stock that closed in august together with our existing capital resources the proceeds from this recent round of financing provide us with funding to support continued commercial preparations and the potential launch of sotagliflozin in heart failure our loan facility with oxford finance which provides up to 125 million in additional borrowing capacity gives us substantial financial flexibility as we proceed with preparations for the launch of sotagliflozin make appropriate investments in research and clinical development and move towards a potential lx9211 partnership as a result we anticipate that we will have sufficient resources to manage our operations well into the anticipated launch of sotagliflozin into the market without taking into account any proceeds from or costs assumed by a partner in any partnership that we may establish for lx9211 now turning to our financial results for the third quarter as indicated in our press release this afternoon we add minimal revenues for the third quarters of both 2022 and 2021 research and development expenses for the third quarter of 2022 decreased to 10 6 million from 15 7 million for the corresponding period in 2021 primarily due to lower external clinical research expenses and professional and consulting costs selling general and administrative expenses for the third quarter of 2022 increased to 12 6 million from 7 3 million for the same period in 2021 primarily due to increases in personnel and external expenses relating to preparations for the commercial launch of sotagliflozin in total net loss for the third quarter of 2022 was 23 4 million or 0 13 per share as compared to a net loss of 23 1 million or 0 16 per share in the corresponding period of 2021 our net loss for the third quarters of 2022 and 2021 include a non cash stock based compensation expense of 2 6 million and 2 7 million

a british drug dealer branded inept by his own barrister had to flee colombia never to return after snorting cocaine from the grave of the infamous drug lord pablo escobar steven semmens subsequently said he carried out the stunt for a bet and did not think things would go as far as they did semmens barrister said his client s actions which were put on facebook did not go down well with criminal confederates of the former cartel boss and were a sign of his naivete and of the walter mitty fantasy world he was living in semmens and four fellow cocaine conspirators have been sentenced to a total of more than 52 years in prison at swansea crown court for their parts in peddling the class a drug an article in wales online reports the court heard the men were involved in trafficking large quantities of cocaine into south wales often shipping stock from areas where there was glut of supply to areas where the supply was more limited and in demand and therefore where profits were higher one of the defendants shane white used the encrochat secure communications network to run the operation while still working for the family glazing business he also plotted with semmens to import kilos of cocaine from south america to the uk though as his barrister told the court not a single gram of the drug was every actually brought into the country by the duo due to their lack of ability he said there was something almost comical about their ineptitude another of the defendants swansea plumber andrew botto used a shipping container hidden behind camouflage netting and fencing just yards from one of the city s busiest roads as a base for his separate cocaine dealing operation when police forced entry to the locked unit in may last year as part of operation wizard they found a 1kg block of high purity cocaine in a cool box along with disposable gloves bags and a set of scales botto was arrested the same day with more than 2 000 cash in his trouser pockets semmens also known as steven pascoe aged 39 of constant road taibach port talbot andrew botto aged 34 of penlan fach penlan swansea shane white aged 34 of broomhill port talbot and 37 year old ieuan emlyn williams of ynys y gored port talbot had all previously pleaded guilty to conspiracy to supply cocaine between april 2020 and august 2021 when they appeared in the dock for sentencing on thursday semmens and white had also admitted to conspiracy to import cocaine botto had also previously pleaded guilty to a separate conspiracy committed with others unknown to supply cocaine while white had also previously admitted conspiracy to import cannabis botto had a previous conviction from 2014 for possession of cocaine with intent to supply for which he received a five year prison sentence speaking in 2018 semmens said he had snorted cocaine off escobar s grave for a bet and thought it would be a laugh he said i was drinking with a friend and they said do you want to go and see the grave and then my friend said sniff cocaine off it and bet me 200 i wouldn t do it on facebook live the video of him emptying a bag of white powder on the grave and then rolling up a 5 note subsequently went viral he said he later shaved his hair in an effort to change his appearance and went into hiding but was found by the colombian police and thrown out of the country semmens said the incident and the notoriety that followed had made it awkward to get a job i just thought it would be a laugh i didn t think it would go this far he said i was drunk at the time i ve been bombarded with threats that i m going to get skinned alive andrew taylor for semmens said his client had led an unusual and unfortunate life he said the defendant s biological father had little to do with his son and semmens lived in spain with his stepfather where he became fluent in the spanish language the barrister said the defendant ended up worked as a nightclub ticket promoter in san antonio ibiza where he met and formed a relationship with a colombian woman the couple subsequently moved to colombia he said semmens snorting cocaine off escobar s grave came to the attention to the drugs baron s criminal confederates and was something they were not pleased about the court heard shortly after this incident semmens fled colombia never to return the barrister described his client as naïve and a fantasist inhabiting a walter mitty world of a lifestyle he sometimes thinks he has he added that his client had profited little from his involvement in the cocaine business andrew evans for botto said his client was a plumber from penlan who with work hard to come by following the covid lockdowns had returned to his old business of supplying drugs he said botto had been operating as a one man band from his unit in brynhyfryd and now realised he had ruined the lives of his partner and her daughter and wished he had not returned to his old ways as a route out of his financial difficulties references presented to the court described him as a fundamentally decent and honest person nicholas wells for williams said his client had been involved as a courier working under the direction and instruction of others he said williams had served with the royal welsh regiment for seven years and had served in iraq in 2003 where he witnessed horrific events including the bombing of a school bus the barrister said williams was subsequently medically discharged and diagnosed with post traumatic stress disorder and in 2011 the ministry of defence accepted liability and awarded him 60 000 however he said much of the money went on legal bills and an expensive car which he subsequently ruined james wing for white described his client as a middle man connecting dealers and suppliers and moving money he said the defendant had not been working for a class a drug crime group but had been working in a quasi self employed capacity for which he was paid on a commission basis at the same time as working for the family glazing business the barrister said since being on remand the defendant had realised the devastating effect cocaine had on people families and communities and realised it was not as he had previously thought just a party drug or a drug you take with friends in spain but mr wing said it was accepted that white made significantly more money from importing cannabis from america and supplying it he said white realised he had ruined his young son s future and that he would not be there for his son for a considerable period judge huw rees said defendants had been involved in commercial scale trafficking and dealing of cocaine he told them it goes without saying but sheer greed led you to profit from selling an insidious class a drug without a thought or a care about the misery or danger being inflicted on others you were in it for the money and you must pay the consequences for your avarice with discounts for their guilty pleas he sentenced semmens to 13 and a half years in prison white to 15 years and four months botto to nine years and seven months and williams to six years as part of the same operation richard philip ronald gerrard aged 42 of heysham road heysham lancashire had previously pleaded guilty to conspiracy to supply cocaine alongside semmens white botto and williams and has already been sentenced to seven years and eight months in prison luke thomas aged 21 of heol llan north cornelly had previously been sentenced to six months in prison suspended for 12 months and ordered to do 180 hours of unpaid work after pleading guilty to conspiracy to supply cannabis white had imported speaking after the sentencing det insp russ jenkins from south wales police s force intelligence and organised crime unit said this was a complex and protracted investigation which resulted in the successful prosecution of a number of organised criminals the web of conspirators were spread far and wide crossing national borders and continents as a direct result of this investigation south wales police are still actively engaging with other uk police forces and the national crime agency along with our international partners to disrupt the activities of those who seek to flood the streets of south wales and the wider uk with cocaine we are committed to tackling the most serious organised criminals who affect our communities i would urge the public to contact us

targets from larger firms tracked by cnbc s market strategist survey he pointed to calming credit markets and volatility as forces that could boost stocks in the year ahead he also said that stocks

oil has been the single most influential resource in modern history driving industrialization building nations and deciding the outcome of wars it has been responsible for raising millions of people out of poverty and for razing entire cities to the ground from technological advancements to environmental disasters few if any industries have left as large a mark on the earth while the history of oil can be traced back as far as 3000 bc when builders in mesopotamia began to use bitumen to strengthen bricks the story of the modern oil industry really began in the 1850s since then explorers investors kings journalists spies and scientists have all attempted to leave their mark on the industry this is a list of the ten people who for better or worse are responsible for shaping the oil industry as we know it today 10 winston churchill churchill may be best known as the stubborn wartime prime minister of britain but it was in his role as the first lord of the admiralty that he transformed the oil industry forever in 1911 as tensions between germany and britain were mounting ahead of the first world war churchill made the fateful decision to convert the british fleet from coal power to oil power while today such a decision may seem an obvious one at the time it was considered both reckless and wasteful the conversion was not only expensive and experimental but it left the british navy vulnerable as it would now have to rely on oil from persia rather than coal produced at home in 1914 in order to secure a reliable oil supply for the navy churchill convinced the british government to buy 51 of the anglo persian oil company which would later become bp when the first world war broke out in july 1914 churchill s decision was vindicated the new british navy was faster and more efficient than its counterparts it was now accepted that oil would indeed be the fuel of the future and securing it was a matter of national security thanks to churchill the international oil industry would now forever be intertwined with foreign policy the battle for control over both the production and trade routes of this critical resource continues to this day 9 t boone pickens for the oil industry the 1980s were a time of great upheaval in the aftermath of the 1979 oil crisis ronald regan completely deregulated oil boosting competition and leading to consolidation across the industry in 1983 the new york mercantile exchange introduced a futures contract in crude oil up until the creation of a futures market the price of oil had been set by oil companies like standard oil by regulators such as the texas railroad commission and by opec now the price of oil was decided by traders on the open market these events combined to mean efficiency and value were the two most important traits for oil companies and one man more than any other would take advantage of this new age in oil t boone pickens positioned himself at the intersection of the oil industry and wall street styling himself as a servant of shareholder value he was a master of mergers and acquisitions in the industry and would play a key role in making the industry leaner and more efficient his strategy involved finding a company whose stock price did not reflect the value of its oil and gas reserves acquiring a significant block of its stock and then forcing the company s management to act to increase its share value his most famous deals included gulf oil phillips petroleum and unocal every corporate raider and activist investor in the industry today owes a debt to t boone pickens the man who showed investors how to take power back from the oil giants 8 harry st john bridger philby while he isn t even the most famous person in his family his son kim was the notorious british intelligence officer who acted as a double agent for the soviet union harry philby played an integral role in the development of saudi arabia s oil industry helping to form what would ultimately become the largest oil company on earth saudi aramco philby was born in modern day sri lanka studied at the university of cambridge and in 1915 was recruited to the indian civil service where he helped to organize the arab revolt against the ottoman empire this first posting marked the beginning of his life long obsession with arabic culture and languages in 1917 he was chosen to lead a mission to the arabian peninsula where he would meet a tribal chieftain by the name of ibn saud the future founder of saudi arabia his meeting with ibn saud would ultimately lead philpy to leave the indian civil service convert to islam and play a central role in negotiating what could be considered the biggest oil deal of all time by 1930 philby was convinced that ibn saud and his government were sitting on a great untapped natural resource but the king was more interested in drilling for water than oil it was only in 1932 when standard oil of california made a discovery in bahrain that the king began to consider his country s oil potential standard oil of california had already approached philby in the hopes of gaining an introduction to the king but philby in order to drive the price up reached out to anglo persian and started a bidding war ultimately in may 1933 standard oil of california managed to outbid anglo persion marking the united state s entry into saudi arabia a decision that would have far reaching consequences for both the oil industry and the geopolitical dynamics in the region 7 mohammad mosaddegh the prime minister of iran from 1951 1953 mohammad mosaddegh was the first leader of a middle eastern oil nation to exercise the nuclear option of nationalizing its oil concessions in response to this nationalization britain implemented an embargo on iranian oil that saw the country s production plummet from 660 000 barrels per day in 1950 to just 20 000 barrels per day in 1952 despite the growing economic pressure mosaddegh refused to relent infuriating negotiators from both britain and the u s in august 1953 the cia and mi6 initiated operation ajax an operation designed to overthrow mosaddegh in a coup the operation was a success but the dynamics of the oil industry had already changed forever even with the shah back in power there was no reversing the nationalistic fervor regarding oil that mossadegh had fanned resentment towards the british government and the anglo iranian oil company was as strong as ever in iran meanwhile u s companies were reluctant to get involved in what they saw as a high risk venture without pressure from governments it seemed that there was no way back for iran s oil industry in the midst of the cold war the u s government was worried that iran would fall into the russian sphere of influence if its oil industry wasn t resurrected by western companies in the end seven companies supported by the u s and british governments agreed to form a consortium in iran critically the consortium was forced to acknowledge that the national iranian oil company now owned the country s oil resources and facilities mosaddegh may have been overthrown and would spend the rest of his life under house arrest but he had earned a vital victory for oil nations the concept of foreigners owning an oil concession had now changed forever and the middle east would never be the same 6 wanda jablonski referred to as the most influential oil journalist of her time in daniel yergin s the prize wanda jablonski founded petroleum intelligence weekly the journal which came to be known as the bible of the oil industry yet it is not her remarkable journalism nor her legacy as a trailblazer for women in the industry that gets her on this list wanda as she was referred to in the industry played a critical role in the formation of one of the world s most influential oil organizations opec the year was 1959 and tensions between international oil companies and oil exporting countries were soaring russia had just returned to international oil markets and supply was climbing faster than demand this led to a price war that saw oil companies cut the posted price of oil unilaterally reducing the national revenues of oil exporting nations at the same time the first arab oil congress was taking place in cairo with 400 people in attendance including of course wanda at the conference she invited two of the most ardently anti oil company individuals in the world to her room for a meeting this was the first time that saudi oil minister abdullah tariki met juan pablo perez alfonso venezuela s minister of mines and hydrocarbons as wanda had predicted the two men immediately established a rapport and went on to organize a secret meeting with other oil ministers on the side of the cairo conference it was at this meeting that the concept of an organization of petroleum exporting countries was first established 5 nick steinsberger now this could be a controversial one frequently it is george p mitchell who is credited with solving one of the most consequential problems in the history of oil how to economically extract oil and gas from shale rock but it was nick steinsberger an engineer at mitchell s company who in 1997 first successfully applied the slickwater fracturing technique that ultimately led to the u s shale boom mitchell already has the moniker father of fracking so it seems only fair that steinsberger should have his place on this list technically the fracturing of rock to stimulate oil wells can be traced all the way back to 1864 when edward a l roberts developed the first torpedo as a way of boosting production hydraulic fracturing using a pressurized liquid to fracture rocks can be traced back to an experiment in 1947 but it wasn t until steinsberger s 1997 well that it was proven to be economically viable u s oil production which had been in terminal decline began to soar on the back of this technological breakthrough in 2018 thanks in large part to the shale boom the united states became the largest oil producer in the world at the same time fracking came to the attention of environmental groups as it was seen to poison groundwater induce earthquakes and emit huge levels of methane to this day it remains a controversial topic with some countries banning fracking altogether while others see it as a path to economic independence whatever you think of it there are few technological breakthroughs that have had the same geopolitical environmental and economic impact as hydraulic fracturing 4 ida tarbell no history of the oil industry would be complete without the woman who took on the wealthiest american of all time john d rockefeller ida tarbell was an investigative journalist or muckraker as they were then known who was determined to hold the oil industry to account every anti trust lawsuit or environmental claim that has been brought against the oil industry since her time is building upon her legacy in her illustrious career tarbell wrote biographies of both napoleon and lincoln but is most famous for her 1904 book titled the history of standard oil the book described by historian j north conway as a masterpiece of investigative journalism detailed how standard oil would use its wealth power and an expansive intelligence network to put immense pressure on independents and other competitors she wrote that rockefeller had systemically played with loaded dice and painted him in the words of daniel yergen as an amoral predator ultimately tarbell s work led to the dissolution of the world s largest oil company and in time the birth of the u s oil majors that we know today 3 john d rockefeller john d rockefeller s career in the oil industry began in 1865 when he bought his business partner out of their produce shipping firm and slowly but surely refocused it on refining oil five years later in an effort to consolidate the industry during a price crash he joined with four other oilmen to form what would become the most powerful oil company in history standard oil in the following years as kerosene and gasoline became a cornerstone of life in america rockefeller used his profits to buy up more and more of the industry reportedly controlling 90 of u s oil by 1880 rockefeller s main goal was to tame the new and out of control oil industry in order to ensure it was as efficient and healthy as possible in pursuing that goal rockefeller created the first ever integrated oil company initiated price wars to crush competitors and as tarbell uncovered ultimately built an oil monopoly advertisement when standard oil was broken up in 1911 the sum of its parts ended up being worth more than the company as a whole and rockefeller became even wealthier while his focus largely shifted to philanthropy in the 20th century the shadow of rockefeller still looms large over the oil industry in fact the modern oil giants exxon mobil chevron and marathon petroleum can all trace their origins back to the 1911 breakup of standard oil 2 juan pablo perez alfonzo juan pablo perez alfonzo s list of achievements in the oil industry is as long as it is impressive he is perhaps best known as one of the two founders of opec an organization he later described as my little idea that has changed the history of the world but opec was simply the logical conclusion of work he had started years earlier one of the most intractable problems in the oil industry is the division of rent in economic terms oil rent is the difference between the value of crude oil produced and the total cost of production from 1943 to 1948 juan pablo perez alfonzo played a key role in shaping what would become the global norm for dividing these rents between companies and countries under the 50 50 deal that he helped shape venezuela and the international oil companies agreed to divide that rent evenly the deal resulted in venezuela s oil income increasing by 600 between 1942 and 1948 yet perez alfonzo wasn t done he recognized that low cost producers in the middle east posed a threat to venezuela s market share and so had the documents translated into arabic and brought to the middle east by a venezuelan delegation suddenly saudi arabia wanted a 50 50 split of rents while iran s mosaddegh wanted to go further still once the concept of dividing the oil income equally between countries and companies had been established it was near impossible for oil companies to fight it the 50 50 formula remained the global norm until the 1973 oil crisis disrupted markets once again in 1948 following the coup that toppled president rómulo gallegos perez alfonzo obtained political asylum in the united states and spent years studying the texas railroad commission and how it had dealt with the oil crash of the 1930s it was during this period that many of his first thoughts of how opec should operate were formed ideas that he then shared with abdullah tariki when wanda introduced them in cairo it may surprise some that a man who was so central to shaping the oil industry considered himself an ecologist and was primarily focused on the conservation of energy he believed that opec would ultimately lower the use of energy around the world 1 george bissell commonly referred to as the father of the american oil industry george bissell was the spark that ignited the inevitable march of oil from a relatively unimportant liquid that oozed from rocks to the most important resource on earth bissell recognized that rock oil which he had seen being gathered with rags in order to make medicine could actually be used as an illuminant if he and his business partner james townsend could only extract the liquid in sufficient quantities it could compete with the whale fat and coal oils that were then being used in lamps after confirming that this rock oil had the desired chemical characteristic bissel and his business partners launched the first ever oil company the pennsylvania rock oil company the pennsylvania rock oil company decided that the best way to go about extracting the oil would be to drill for it using the same technique that had been developed to bore for salt the company employed edwin l drake an out of work railway conductor who was staying in the same hotel as james townsend to carry out the project drake traveled to the tiny village of titusville secured the title to the land and employed william a smith to help him drill on august 27th 1859 the two men hit oil for the very first time in history bissell immediately rushed to titusville to buy up and lease as many farms as he could becoming the first of many who would make their fortune off an industry that was about to change the world forever by josh owens for oilprice

honolulu dec 29 2022 globe newswire barnwell industries inc nyse american brn today reported net earnings of 5 513 000 0 57 per share for the year ended september 30 2022 as compared to net earnings of 6 253 000 0 73 per share for the year ended september 30 2021 for the quarter ended september 30 2022 barnwell reported a net loss of 143 000 0 01 per share as compared to net earnings of 1 547 000 0 16 per share for the quarter ended september 30 2021 mr alexander c kinzler chief executive officer of barnwell commented we are pleased to report that our oil and natural gas revenues more than doubled for fiscal 2022 as compared to the prior year this was due to higher prices and production for all products with oil natural gas and natural gas liquids prices increasing 68 77 and 51 respectively and our production of oil natural gas and natural gas liquids increasing 24 39 and 100 respectively as compared to last year our oklahoma operations generated 3 496 000 or 15 of our oil and natural gas segment revenues for fiscal 2022 the 740 000 decrease in net earnings in fiscal 2022 as compared to fiscal 2021 was primarily due to the company s recognition of 4 472 000 in gains in fiscal 2021 that did not occur in fiscal 2022 which included a 2 341 000 gain from the termination of the company s post retirement medical plan 1 982 000 in gains from the sales of assets and a 149 000 gain on debt extinguishment in total our oil and natural gas segment operating results before income taxes had an 8 113 000 improvement from the prior year due to both higher oil and natural gas prices and new production from wells drilled in canada in fiscal 2022 and oklahoma in late fiscal 2021 also contributing to the increase was a ceiling test impairment of 630 000 in the prior year period whereas there was no such ceiling test impairment in the current year period equity in income from affiliates decreased 2 393 000 and land investment segment operating results before non controlling interests share of such profits decreased 532 000 due to the kukio resort development partnerships sale of six lots in the current year period whereas there were eight lot sales in the prior year period due to these sales the company received 3 028 000 in net cash distributions in fiscal 2022 contract drilling operating results also decreased 133 000 due to the completion of a significant drilling contract in the prior year period general and administrative expenses increased 956 000 primarily due to increases in professional fees in the current year period as compared to the same period in the prior year partially offset by a decrease in stockholder costs in the prior year period as compared to the current year period the company also incurred a 484 000 foreign currency loss in the current year period due to the effects of foreign exchange rate changes on intercompany advances as a result of the strengthening of the u s dollar against the canadian dollar in the north twining unit ntu in which barnwell holds a 29 interest the two new wells that began production in our second fiscal quarter continue to perform strongly and a second drilling program consisting of four wells 1 16 net in the ntu began in our third quarter of these four three began production with very encouraging initial rates the fourth well has been completed and is expected to come online later in our second quarter of fiscal 2023 barnwell s 100 working interest well that was brought onstream in march 2022 has also performed well during the year ended september 30 2022 the

the book takes aim at the standard portrayal of australia as a middle power dedicated to upholding a rules based international order fernandes argues that you can t explain the nation s foreign or domestic policy using this rubric marshalling historical and current events to show that australia is a sub imperial power dedicated to upholding the dominance of the united states the analysis his argument relies on is what the military paid him for as an intelligence officer working seven storeys underground at sydney s garden island his assessments weren t always what his superiors or indeed their counterparts in washington wanted to hear a mushroom toastie at liminal in collins street credit jason south i would sometimes work for 48 hours straight i wouldn t go home i had a change of clothes upstairs and i would shower shave and put on a new uniform and come back i really loved the idea of reading all the materials and writing my reports on may 21 1998 suharto resigned and i was the only person inside the intelligence system who predicted that he was going to resign weeks before he did and why he would do so i was ordered by the intelligence boss to de publish that assessment and withdraw it from the system i was also the first and only person to predict the indian nuclear tests that was controversial too fernandes says he was required to take back these accurate forecasts because they were at odds with australia s sub imperial role which has benefited the nation greatly in some ways but kept it back in others in the book he points to our wealthy but dependent economy too heavily reliant on export of a limited number of mineral resources a stock exchange in which the dominant private investors are us based and under no obligation to benefit australia in their actions and the way in which our parliament is excluded from information and national security decisions ranging from going to war and renewing support for the pine gap surveillance base to the recent aukus deal the result is that australians are too often prevented from tackling hard truths about the nation s actions abroad from chile in the 1970s to china today pointing at my rapidly disappearing plate of rotisserie hazeldene chicken he continues information is about variety and unpredictability if the kitchen here only served the same dish every time then the menu would carry no information it would be perfectly predictable liminal s rotisserie hazeldene chicken credit jason south when you say security or we are defending ourselves every state says that it carries no information we are defending ourselves in afghanistan we are defending ourselves in iraq we are defending ourselves in the taiwan strait and the biggest lie at the moment is that we are doing freedom of navigation operations in the south china sea we are not doing freedom of navigation operations we are dropping sonar buoys in order to identify the acoustic signature of chinese submarines in order to attack them with the united states we re not dora the explorer or matthew flinders us australian and allied naval vessels take part in exercise pacific vanguard in august credit royal australian navy in his book he reminds readers of a much shared scene in the abc s comedy utopia where rob sitch s character highlights the absurdity of spending hundreds of billions of dollars protecting our trade routes from china our no 1 trading partner that may be funny he says but it misses the point that is not the aim of the policy in the real world the military build up is about whether foreign military and intelligence activities can be conducted inside another country s exclusive economic zone fernandes rejects the idea that the public needs special expertise to debate such issues recalling that he was one of just four cadets selected to join army intelligence in his intake there were about 15 cadets on the intelligence corps course and that s because everyone who failed pilot s course and armoured corps course or were colour blind and couldn t drive a tank were told well you can go to intelligence that showed me that the mystique of intelligence and security clearances is not true instead we need better access to information us style declassification of government records us style oversight of intelligence agencies as he puts it in the book but also a change in attitude from strategic narcissism to strategic empathy take taiwan whose right to self determination he supports we know how we would feel if china set up a military base in the solomon islands and the solomon islands are about 2000 nautical miles away from us strategic empathy is to see things rationally we were in beijing s place with what douglas macarthur called an unsinkable aircraft carrier 180 nautical miles away from us the united states is not helping taiwan it is using taiwan we plan in australia for other country s capabilities not their intentions but we say you should plan for our intentions which are always benign not our capabilities should australia purchase b 21 bombers or push ahead with the aukus deal we are not buying submarines fernandes insists when i raise this we are subsidising the us navy s submarine budget do we want about 50 000 us troops to be based in northern australia by the end of the decade as he predicts will happen he believes australians and their representatives must have more say in these questions the bill from liminal credit in his book fernandes takes the somewhat unusual step of thanking his two lawyers for some years he has fought in court to bring secret papers about australia s conduct towards indonesia and east timor into the public domain one of his friends historian craig stockings has also worked to bring these facts to light and i ask fernandes about the recent publication of stockings official history of australia s peacekeeping effort in east timor which he has read what was able to do in the book is go through the deep roots of the policy showing that protected indonesia when they committed genocide in the 70s and in the 1980s and 90s and that the policy s real objective was to keep timor inside indonesia loading where i think there is room for disagreement fernandes adds is when is trying to evaluate the effect of public pressure his main source is an interview with tim fischer who claimed there was no suggestion that civic activism forced the government s hand

the book takes aim at the standard portrayal of australia as a middle power dedicated to upholding a rules based international order fernandes argues that you can t explain the nation s foreign or domestic policy using this rubric marshalling historical and current events to show that australia is a sub imperial power dedicated to upholding the dominance of the united states the analysis his argument relies on is what the military paid him for as an intelligence officer working seven storeys underground at sydney s garden island his assessments weren t always what his superiors or indeed their counterparts in washington wanted to hear a mushroom toastie at liminal in collins street credit jason south i would sometimes work for 48 hours straight i wouldn t go home i had a change of clothes upstairs and i would shower shave and put on a new uniform and come back i really loved the idea of reading all the materials and writing my reports on may 21 1998 suharto resigned and i was the only person inside the intelligence system who predicted that he was going to resign weeks before he did and why he would do so i was ordered by the intelligence boss to de publish that assessment and withdraw it from the system i was also the first and only person to predict the indian nuclear tests that was controversial too fernandes says he was required to take back these accurate forecasts because they were at odds with australia s sub imperial role which has benefited the nation greatly in some ways but kept it back in others in the book he points to our wealthy but dependent economy too heavily reliant on export of a limited number of mineral resources a stock exchange in which the dominant private investors are us based and under no obligation to benefit australia in their actions and the way in which our parliament is excluded from information and national security decisions ranging from going to war and renewing support for the pine gap surveillance base to the recent aukus deal the result is that australians are too often prevented from tackling hard truths about the nation s actions abroad from chile in the 1970s to china today pointing at my rapidly disappearing plate of rotisserie hazeldene chicken he continues information is about variety and unpredictability if the kitchen here only served the same dish every time then the menu would carry no information it would be perfectly predictable liminal s rotisserie hazeldene chicken credit jason south when you say security or we are defending ourselves every state says that it carries no information we are defending ourselves in afghanistan we are defending ourselves in iraq we are defending ourselves in the taiwan strait and the biggest lie at the moment is that we are doing freedom of navigation operations in the south china sea we are not doing freedom of navigation operations we are dropping sonar buoys in order to identify the acoustic signature of chinese submarines in order to attack them with the united states we re not dora the explorer or matthew flinders us australian and allied naval vessels take part in exercise pacific vanguard in august credit royal australian navy in his book he reminds readers of a much shared scene in the abc s comedy utopia where rob sitch s character highlights the absurdity of spending hundreds of billions of dollars protecting our trade routes from china our no 1 trading partner that may be funny he says but it misses the point that is not the aim of the policy in the real world the military build up is about whether foreign military and intelligence activities can be conducted inside another country s exclusive economic zone fernandes rejects the idea that the public needs special expertise to debate such issues recalling that he was one of just four cadets selected to join army intelligence in his intake there were about 15 cadets on the intelligence corps course and that s because everyone who failed pilot s course and armoured corps course or were colour blind and couldn t drive a tank were told well you can go to intelligence that showed me that the mystique of intelligence and security clearances is not true instead we need better access to information us style declassification of government records us style oversight of intelligence agencies as he puts it in the book but also a change in attitude from strategic narcissism to strategic empathy take taiwan whose right to self determination he supports we know how we would feel if china set up a military base in the solomon islands and the solomon islands are about 2000 nautical miles away from us strategic empathy is to see things rationally we were in beijing s place with what douglas macarthur called an unsinkable aircraft carrier 180 nautical miles away from us the united states is not helping taiwan it is using taiwan we plan in australia for other country s capabilities not their intentions but we say you should plan for our intentions which are always benign not our capabilities should australia purchase b 21 bombers or push ahead with the aukus deal we are not buying submarines fernandes insists when i raise this we are subsidising the us navy s submarine budget do we want about 50 000 us troops to be based in northern australia by the end of the decade as he predicts will happen he believes australians and their representatives must have more say in these questions the bill from liminal credit in his book fernandes takes the somewhat unusual step of thanking his two lawyers for some years he has fought in court to bring secret papers about australia s conduct towards indonesia and east timor into the public domain one of his friends historian craig stockings has also worked to bring these facts to light and i ask fernandes about the recent publication of stockings official history of australia s peacekeeping effort in east timor which he has read what was able to do in the book is go through the deep roots of the policy showing that protected indonesia when they committed genocide in the 70s and in the 1980s and 90s and that the policy s real objective was to keep timor inside indonesia loading where i think there is room for disagreement fernandes adds is when is trying to evaluate the effect of public pressure his main source is an interview with tim fischer who claimed there was no suggestion that civic activism forced the government s hand
the airline with the ticker luv now a far cry from its early customers first days under co founder herb kelleher ruined countless holiday reunions over the past week southwest airlines marooned not just passengers but also its own crews and landed tens of thousands of its customers in a sisyphean holiday week bog from which there seemed to be no escape to anywhere but the filthy bathroom or the knee deep bar canceled flights were rescheduled to other canceled flights pilots deadheaded to nowhere stressed out travelers searched for overpriced planes trains and automobiles even the airline s shareholders got burned as the reputation searing meltdown caused the company s stock to fall the market having deduced southwest was about to lose much of its pricing power and brand affection chicago was at the epicenter of this mess unless you re going to mexico or canada or a couple of minor allegiant frontiers you re almost certainly flying southwest out of midway whose luggage strewn floors looked more like a refugee camp this week allowing one massive airline to so monopolistically dominate a publicly owned airport designed to serve the people of northern illinois looked like utter folly no wonder local politicians started making statements sure there was a very bad storm but any frequent flyer knows that airlines love to trot out the liability shielding word weather when a more honest reason for a delay is a chronic staff shortage as was clearly the case in denver for southwest no backup plans or in this instance problems with an archaic off the shelf phone and crew scheduling system that buckled under pressure even as every other airline quickly got back to normal evidence mounted that southwest apparently still stuck in the 1990s had ignored numerous calls to upgrade its technological support system even after it knew the danger of a meltdown rather it focused on restoring its stock dividend and reportedly installing a pickleball court at its headquarters as with many businesses in crises southwest and its top executives were slow to heed the scale of the problem coming over the net this week airline delays on this scale aren t just about missing family gatherings although that is bad enough or sitting on the floor for hours they can be matters of life and death this is a public company and a crucial part of the nation s transportation infrastructure that recently enjoyed billions of dollars in federal pandemic bailout funds in our view if the southwest board is doing its job overpaid heads at the world s largest airline should now roll not all of the reporting on this issue has been accurate southwest is not a low cost airline anymore its holiday week fares were eye watering generally it is just as costly to fly with southwest as on the other majors which clearly operate in a more efficiently zoned way rather than hopscotching crews all over the map with breakneck turnarounds incredibly southwest now the nation s largest airline has been allowed to operate without so called interline agreements and without any requirement whatsoever to put stranded passengers on other carriers flights it needs one now on fear of re regulation southwest is not the only offender here internal memos have revealed that american airlines won t now routinely rebook delayed passengers on other flights unless they have platinum status or above but it is far and away the worst our grinchy friends at the wall street journal editorial board used this week of human misery to warn the federal department of transportation against interfering apparently trusting southwest to fix itself we beg to differ given the strategic importance of transportation the oligarchical nature of today s airline industry and the level of public funds just expended you just can t do this to innocent people in times of emergency interline agreements and prompt rebookings must be required and full refunds for canceled flights should be immediate and not require hours on the phone and all of those people whose holidays were ruined deserve proactive additional compensation but here s an idea the journal might like the draconian federal regulations that cover crew workdays might be worth moderating in an emergency safety must be the first priority of course but that can be a more complex matrix than people realize is it safer for 160 stressed out passengers to decide instead to drive through the snow consider what happened in buffalo new york rather than to allow a single flight attendant an extra hour or two of work so that a flight can take off is it safer to keep a sick older person from medication for days than allow a pilot another 60 minutes to reach one hub destination in many cases it s not so much more regulation that is required as smarter regulation with the ability to adapt to weather and other emergencies there also have to be financial incentives to not take people s money and not deliver the goods in a timely way the european union put such regulations in place and such stories in europe are far less common southwest we hope is now committing millions of dollars to upgrading its technology so it will never fail at this level ever again it has promised as much and it should be held accountable and the long range planners at the city department of aviation might consider making room for a few more flights from competing non southwest carriers at the southwest side gateway getting so much in bed with only one clearly problematic carrier can mean a lot of people lose their

targets from larger firms tracked by cnbc s market strategist survey he pointed to calming credit markets and volatility as forces that could boost stocks in the year ahead he also said that stocks

by alejandro lazo and jeanne kuang calmatters writers california faces a projected deficit next year even if the nation avoids a recession despite the expected shortfall policymakers say they ll maintain spending on social programs though advocates are calling for more the legislative analyst s office recently said in its annual forecast that gov gavin newsom and the democratic party controlled legislature are facing a 24 billion projected budget deficit for the next fiscal year if the state enters a recession the outlook is even worse with revenues predicted to fall short by 30 billion to 50 billion the governor signed a record breaking 308 billion budget in june the legislative analyst attributes the projected shortfall to california s reliance on those whose incomes often ebb and flow with the price of stocks real estate and other investments those are the same people who get a lot of their income from financial investments said legislative analyst gabriel petek that volatility then gets transmitted directly to the state budget the governor will present a proposed budget in january and then a revision in may the budget which the legislature must approve will fund state government for the fiscal year beginning july 1 h d palmer spokesperson for the state department of finance declined to comment on whether social spending cuts might be proposed he did say however that the governor s priority was to not scale back programs that people have come to depend on or to begin new ones some program expansions in later fiscal years could be delayed if there isn t enough revenue to support them he said the goal is to avoid the kind of drastic program reductions enacted during the great recession that took years for the state to restore building reserves the state s democratic legislative leaders have said they are not inclined to cut recently expanded programs such as the extension of free health care to low income undocumented immigrants which began with older adults this year and is slated to open up to all ages in january 2024 the expansion is expected to cost more than 2 billion annually the budget is in a much stronger position than it was during the state s last fiscal crisis said phil ting the assembly budget committee chair from san francisco we have a significant amount of cash available both in terms of reserves but also in terms of liquidity ting said so this is a very different situation than the state faced in 2008 2009 where they were running out of cash the governor nevertheless has signaled he is being cautious newsom in october said he had vetoed 169 bills and saved taxpayers billions seventy five of those vetoes were directly budget related with many including boilerplate language that the state was facing lower than expected revenues and that it was important to remain disciplined when it comes to spending particularly spending that is ongoing among the bills vetoed by the governor earlier this year were proposals to expand government funded care for new mothers expand free transit programs for california students and create grants for graduate students in mental health who commit to working at certain california based nonprofits newsom whom voters elected to another four year term has used surpluses to pay down debts build reserves and provide direct payments to millions of californians recently moody s analytics rated california one of the states most prepared for a recession citing its reserves nevertheless california s budget enacted in june 2021 committed to 3 4 billion in new ongoing spending and is expected to grow to 12 billion in the 2025 budget year the budget enacted in june of this year committed an additional 2 3 billion expected to grow to nearly 5 billion by the 2026 budget year the legislative analyst s office said the state has 37 billion in specific reserve funds that includes about 23 billion in a rainy day fund voters agreed to strengthen in 2014 at the urging of then gov jerry brown the state also has 900 million in a reserve account for safety net programs the rest of those reserve funds are in school specific and general operating reserves but palmer noted the state can only draw down the rainy day fund by half in any year the legislative analyst s office has advised the legislature to slow down or pause program expansions before dipping into reserves ting s office contends the state has billions in unspent federal and state dollars in its coffers that could address a potential deficit using that money would avoid cuts to programs but delay other projects is it time to spend anti poverty advocates said in interviews they plan to continue pushing for program expansions arguing the precipice of a downturn is the time to bolster social spending not cut it nearly 30 of california residents live in or near poverty according to the public policy institute of california experts expect poverty rates to increase after the end of a boost in federal cash aid which came in 2021 in the form of an expanded child tax credit included in the american rescue plan act advocates are proposing that california mimic that federal expansion by opening up the state s young child tax credit currently a 1 000 a year credit for low income families with children under age 6 to include all children in low income households they estimate 1 million children live in families that would qualify at an additional cost of 700 million a year additional tax credits could make a difference to people like ivonne sonato vega a medical assistant in santa rosa last year she used some of the 4 000 in federal child tax credits on school supplies and clothes for the four children she and her boyfriend are raising she said with prices rising this year she was unable to save any of that subsidy if the credits were an annual payment she said it would allow her to plan for expenses maybe use it as a little savings account to draw on when the children grow out of their clothes or save it for a security deposit if the family needs to move it was kind of like a tease she said of the credit it was here and then not advocates said they also want the state to create an unemployment benefits program for undocumented immigrants and to include all low income immigrants regardless of immigration status in its food assistance program we know the projected budget shortfalls make it more challenging but the past few years highlighted why something like this is so important said sasha feldstein economic justice policy manager at the california immigrant policy center people who are excluded from our safety net have been the most adversely impacted from the covid 19 pandemic and are the most harmed during times of economic downturn lawmakers and newsom this year allocated money to expand the california food assistance program a state version of food stamps to include undocumented immigrants age 55 and older the benefits are expected to become available late next year newsom vetoed a bill that would have tested an unemployment benefits program for undocumented immigrants citing costs the makings of a budget problem the projected shortfall is the state s first major fiscal challenge since newsom s office predicted a 54 billion shortfall in may 2020 when the country was in the grips of the covid 19 pandemic after financial markets rebounded and the federal government provided unprecedented stimulus the anticipated shortfall resulted in surpluses the federal reserve began hiking interest rates in march 2022 to cool inflation then housing sales initial public stock offerings and stock markets fell all are important sources of personal income tax revenue in california personal income withholding fell even as the job market recovered over the last decade california has increasingly relied on some of the state s highest earners to fund its budget which among other things takes aim at poverty and some of the nation s starkest income inequality much of the state s general fund is paid for by its progressive personal income tax which voters in 2012 raised on the state s highest earners after brown warned of cuts to health and education in 2016 voters extended those higher income tax rates through 2030 while also allowing a temporary sales tax to expire the increases meant for education and health care spending have also paid for increased social safety net spending about 49 of the personal income tax paid in california in 2020 came from just 1 of tax filers according to the state s finance department and in the past decade taxes collected from the most volatile form of income capital gains have doubled making up a larger share of the state s revenue and tying the state s budget to particularly unstable economic cycles to address that voters approved changes to the state s rainy day fund in 2014 the changes serve as a check on spending directing california to capture additional dollars in reserve when capital gains tax receipts are high building reserves large enough for a state to ride through a recession is difficult said donald boyd a state finance expert at the university of albany in new york as a practical matter it is very hard to build a rainy day fund that s big enough to get you through a rainy season boyd said you need huge amounts of money to offset the effects of even a modest recession
