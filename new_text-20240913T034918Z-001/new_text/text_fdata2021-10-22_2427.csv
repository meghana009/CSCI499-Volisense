the federal reserve is imposing a sweeping new set of restrictions on the investments its officials can own a response to questionable recent trades example video title will go here for this video example video title will go here for this video washington the federal reserve is imposing a broad new set of restrictions on the investments its officials can own a response to questionable recent trades that forced two top fed officials to resign the fed announced thursday that its policymakers and senior staff would be barred from investing in individual stocks and bonds they would also have to provide 45 days advance notice of any trade and receive prior approval from ethics officials and they would have to hold the investments for at least a year the new rules which have yet to be implemented would also require fed officials to publicly disclose all financial transactions within 30 days and would bar trading during periods of heightened financial market stress the central bank said it hasn t yet decided how to define such periods nor did it say when the new rules would take effect fed officials suggested that they might have to expand their legal staff to implement them the changes announced thursday would limit fed officials to owning diversified investments such as mutual funds rather than individual securities these tough new rules raise the bar high in order to assure the public we serve that all of our senior officials maintain a single minded focus on the public mission of the federal reserve chair jerome powell said in a statement powell who is under consideration by the biden administration for a second four year term as fed chair came under fire last month after it was revealed that two regional federal reserve bank presidents traded stocks and other investments last spring although the trades complied with fed financial ethics rules they occurred while the fed was taking expansive steps to boost the economy and calm financial markets as a result the trades raised the possibility of conflicts of interest because the two officials could have profited from the fed s actions one of the officials robert kaplan who was president of the dallas fed made trades of 1 million or more in 22 stocks last year including apple facebook and chevron the other official eric rosengren who was head of the federal reserve bank of boston invested in funds that held mortgage backed securities of the same type that the fed was buying as part of its efforts to hold down longer term interest rates kaplan and rosengren announced their resignations soon after the questionable trades came to light ethics experts said the trades underscored how lax the fed s rules were given its outsize influence over financial markets the regional fed bank presidents take part in private discussions about potential interest rate changes that stand to affect the financial markets they can also move markets in their frequent public speeches which typically reflect their inside knowledge of the fed s policy discussions powell s term expires in february but most observers expect the white house to announce a decision this fall many progressive groups though have urged the administration to nominate lael brainard a member of the fed s governing board or some other candidate rather than powell some have argued that the fed s rules around investing were too lax not all critics are likely to be satisfied by the stricter rules unveiled thursday the changes announced today by the federal reserve are long overdue and a good start but don t go far enough said dennis kelleher president of better markets an advocacy group the fed should apply them more broadly kelleher said to any fed employees with access to nonpublic information not just senior officials senior leaders kelleher said should have to put their holdings in a blind trust the fed considered blind trusts officials said but did not choose that route because officials would be unable to guarantee that they were not invested in individual stocks or bonds powell s own investments have also raised concerns a former partner at the carlyle group an investment firm powell owns municipal bonds a type of security that the fed bought last year for the first time as part of its efforts to ensure that financial markets could operate smoothly at a news conference sept 22 powell said he thought that fed officials generally shouldn t own financial assets of the kind that the fed itself is purchasing he said he had owned muni bonds for years
it s been a rough year for gadget makers the global chip shortage has impacted everything from the playstation 5 to graphics cards for a while it seemed like apple had avoided the worst of the supply chain woes but it looks like that luck has finally run out according to bloomberg most of apple s newest products won t ship until mid november or even december that includes the iphone 13 lineup the ipad mini the 9th gen ipad the apple watch series 7 and macbook pro even more concerning the delays are also affecting older products like the macbook air and the newest imac delays aren t necessarily a new thing when it comes to apple products the problem right now is the scale the iphone 13 pro for instance has only been out for about a month and nearly every version of the device is difficult to find if you look on apple s site the earliest delivery window is nov 19 29 and at least in new york city no version of the phone is available at any of the 12 apple stores in the five boroughs earlier this month the company also slashed its 2021 iphone 13 production targets by about 10 million units the ipad mini has the same delivery window and only a handful of versions were available for pickup at one or two apple stores in all of nyc the shipping window for the apple watch series 7 is nov 30 dec 7 and none of nyc s apple stores seem to have them in stock the macbook pros announced earlier this week are also already backlogged to nov 12 19 the 24 inch m1 imac is also delayed to nov 12 19 if you pay us8 11 or nov 15 22 if you opt for free shipping only one or two configurations were available for pickup somehow apple s new us19 25 polishing cloth is also delayed by 10 12 weeks because this is the world we now live in the global chip crunch will likely ding apple s bottom line during its most profitable quarter but it s hard to feel too bad for one of the richest companies on earth still if your loved one wants a shiny new apple gadget this holiday season best to order sooner rather than later

some feedgrain prices are dropping due to mounting supplies but barley is holding up just fine says an analyst advertisement read also used cooking oil amount proves surprising saskatoon canada s canola oil is facing stiff competition from used cooking oil uco and tallow in renewable diesel markets it s hard to get too negative on barley when you have corn prices as high as they are said marketsfarm analyst bruce burnett the december corn futures contract was trading at us 5 39 per bushel as of oct 20 and barley is fetching a premium over the delivered price of u s corn in lethbridge you re talking some pretty expensive corn to replace very expensive barley he said imported u s corn will keep a lid on canadian feed barley prices but they will still remain at near record values said burnett this means the energy component of the feed market will remain at elevated levels but there has been some softening on the protein side of the equation the protein feed market is going to be burdensome he said mac marshall vice president of market intelligence with the u s soybean export council said that has a lot to do with shifting dynamics in the crush sector advertisement we re crushing more for oil than we are for meal he said during a recent webinar organized by ussec the natural implications of that are we re probably going to have a little more meal to sell marshall said soymeal values have plunged 20 percent since the start of the calendar year while soy oil prices have soared due to tight global vegetable oil stocks randy mittelstaedt head of market insights with r j o brien agreed with that assessment over the next 12 months for sure we most likely are going to be a bit heavy on the meal side in the u s he said that is happening at the same time that hog and pig inventories are falling in the u s said mittelstaedt the u s department of agriculture reports there were 75 4 million hogs and pigs as of sept 1 2021 down four percentage points from a year ago advertisement another factor to consider is the rebound in u s ethanol production which is resulting in more distillers grain jim mintert director of the center for commercial agriculture at purdue university said the usda is forecasting 5 2 billion bushels of corn use in the ethanol sector in 2021 22 up from 5 03 billion bu last year and 4 86 billion the year before that he believes the number will be even higher than the usda s estimate based on recent ethanol margins of about us 0 66 per gallon it s the strongest margins we ve seen certainly since the pandemic he said during a webinar hosted by the university weekly ethanol production numbers recently climbed above pre pandemic levels after being well below those levels for most of 2021 he believes many plants are once again operating at full capacity which means less corn and more distillers grains available for feed markets burnett said another reason to remain bullish on corn and barley prices is sky high fertilizer prices which may dissuade some growers from planting corn in brazil and argentina this year and the united states next year advertisement it will change the economics for those producers he said barley is also going to be in a tough battle for acres in canada where cash canola prices were 22 per bushel as of oct 20 he does not expect barley acres will change much at all from last year s levels that is despite expectations for extremely tight barley stocks heading into the new crop year there is just too much competition from other crops like canola durum and pulses contact sean pratt producer com

afternoon everyone and thanks for joining us today we are pleased with our results this quarter as we reported net income of 12 1 million and diluted earnings per share of 1 21 both of which are up more than 40 from a year ago excluding 800 000 of pre tax costs incurred as we redeemed 25 million of 6 sub debt we recorded adjusted net income of 12 7 million or 1 27 per diluted share the board of directors and management are intent on increasing shareholder value and i would like to highlight several ongoing initiatives in that pursuit we have improved profitability by expanding our net interest margin diversifying our fee revenue and managing our expenses our performance in the third quarter generated an adjusted return on average assets of 1 18 marking a substantial advance from a year earlier this is the fourth straight quarter we have generated an roaa in excess of 1 we are confident in our ability to continue growing revenue and earnings for the remainder of the year and into 2022 in the third quarter we were very pleased with the balanced growth in c i and single tenant lease financing our newest lending area franchise finance which i ll talk about a little more about in just a moment got off to a great start with over 25 million in originations in just three months time importantly commercial loan pipeline heading into the fourth quarter are strong up 65 through our teams diligent work sourcing new opportunities we expect construction activity in small business lending to be key areas of growth for us in the months and quarters ahead as of september 30 unfunded construction commitments across all business lines were 190 million up 30 from the start of the year our commercial real estate construction team has several new opportunities in the pipeline and we expect our unfunded commitments to increase by an additional 100 million during the fourth quarter these projects typically fund over 12 to 24 months horizon the second leading growth driver for us is small business lending which remained strong in 2021 we made a 300 million commitment to the small business owners as part of that pledge we recently announced that we have teamed up with applepie capital a leading provider of growth financing to franchisees in various industry segments across the country together we are funding loans to proven businesses fueling economic growth and job growth while deploying our capital in to an attractive asset class with strong risk adjusted returns we began working with applepie in the third quarter as i noted earlier we funded just over 25 million of loans during that time and expect to fund up to 100 million of originations in total by the end of 2021 we anticipate funding up to 150 million in additional loans next year we have had a very positive experience with applepie to date and i would also note that we are actively exploring balance sheet relationships with several other fintech companies of course the cornerstone of our commitment to small business is the small business lending platform we have built out over the past few years through the end of the sba year ended september 30 we have secured approvals for 172 million in sba 7 a program loan we also funded 30 million of ppp loans earlier this year to date 85 of our ppp loans have been forgiven by the sba i m very proud of the way our team responded to the operational challenges brought on by a series of ppp rule changes 7 a program updates and the sba s move to a new transfer agent which added complications to the collection of relief payments as well as the sale of loans looking ahead to 2022 we anticipate originating 215 million of sba 7 a loans which is expected to generate sales on revenue in the range of 15 million for the year keep in mind that secondary sales volume will be impacted as the standard government guarantee on sba 7 a loans reverts to 75 compared to the 90 guarantee temporarily installed in response to the pandemic we are also building out a wider range of services to serve our small business customers we recently announced a partnership with finzly a fintech provider of modern banking solutions to provide an innovative payment hub that will enhance the digital experience for our small business owners and empower them to manage their business and cash flows more effectively over the last 1 5 years the covid 19 pandemic has accelerated the demand for digital banking services thanks to our branchless banking model we did not have to lose time transitioning away from the branch operations we were able instead to leverage our customer focused product and our expertise in the digital service delivery to attract new customers and enhance the customer experience we continue to invest in our digital capabilities and expect to announce additional relationships within the next few weeks to conclude we are committed to continuous improvement to serve our growing base of customers nationwide and we believe this dedication puts us in a great position to expand our relationships and generate strong results for our shareholders in the upcoming quarters before i turn it over to ken i d like to call your attention to two important announcements first i am pleased to share that our board of directors has authorized the repurchase of up to 30 million of our common stock this authorization is open through the end of 2022 additionally we released our first esg report earlier this week the report chronicles our existing commitments and future priorities around mindful governance and responsible corporate citizen including the company s response to the financial effects of the covid 19 pandemic on our customers and communities by advancing our esg initiative we hold ourselves accountable for effectively managing risk while also facilitating financial inclusion i m proud of our team s efforts and successes i encourage you to read the report which is of course available exclusively in digital format at firstinternetbancorp com with that i d like to turn the call over to ken to discuss our financial results for the quarter ken lovik executive vice president chief financial officer thanks david as david mentioned it was another strong quarter with net income of 12 1 million and 1 21 diluted earnings per share which included about 800 000 of additional pre tax interest expense related to the redemption of 25 million of subordinated debt after taking into account these costs adjusted net income came in at 12 7 million and adjusted diluted earnings per share were 1 27 representing increases of 14 7 and 14 4 respectively from the second quarter profitability continued to improve with an adjusted return on average assets increasing 12 basis points from the second quarter to 1 18 and an adjusted return on average tangible common equity increasing 118 basis points to 13 97 looking at slide 5 total loans at the end of the third quarter were 2 9 billion down modestly from the second quarter and down 2 5 from september 30 2020 as david mentioned earlier we were pleased with the growth in commercial and industrial and single tenant lease financing during the quarter and are excited about the early performance in our new franchise finance lending area the growth in these lines of business were largely offset by net payoffs in our healthcare finance and public finance portfolios as balances were down 38 5 million and 10 4 million respectively additionally small business lending balances were down 20 4 million due primarily to 25 million of ppp loan forgiveness but partially offset by new production consumer loan balances increased moderately compared to the second quarter due primarily to higher balances in the residential mortgage portfolio moving on to deposits on slide 6 overall deposit balances were up modestly from the end of the second quarter and we again saw improvement in the composition of our deposit base during the quarter non maturity deposits increased by 58 3 million or 3 2 driven primarily by increases in small business and commercial balances as our focus in this area continues to pay off cds and brokered deposits decreased 39 9 million or 2 8 on a combined basis cds and broker deposit balances continued to decline as higher cost cd maturities were either funded with on balance sheet liquidity or replaced with much more attractively priced money market accounts checking accounts and lower rate cds this lowered our cost of interest bearing deposits 9 basis points during the quarter and we expect to experience continued reduction in deposit costs in the fourth quarter and into next year compared to the first nine months of 2020 we ve realized 22 million of deposit interest expense savings to date and expect to realize around 26 million for the full year based on the current deposit pricing environment turning to slide 7 and 8 compared to the second quarter both reported net interest income and fully taxable equivalent net interest income decreased 700 000 or 3 2 to 20 9 million and 22 3 million respectively excluding the costs associated with the redemption of subordinated debt net interest income increased 100 000 to 21 7 million and fully taxable equivalent net interest income increased to 23 1 million the average balance of interest earning assets increased 48 million or 1 2 compared to the second quarter with higher average balances of securities being partially offset by lower average balances of loans and other earning assets the yield on interest earning assets declined to 3 16 due to the changes in the earning asset composition as well as lower loan fees net interest margin decreased 11 basis points from 2 11 for the second quarter to 2 for the third quarter and fully taxable equivalent net interest margin decreased 12 basis points from 2 25 for the second quarter to 2 13 for the third quarter fully taxable equivalent net interest margin adjusted for the cost of the subordinated debt was 2 21 down 4 basis points from the prior quarter as you can see on slide 8 the 4 basis point decline was driven primarily by lower average loan balances and fees which had a negative impact of 14 basis points this was partially offset by continued decreases in deposit costs which provided a benefit of 8 basis points the securities portfolio also added a benefit of 3 basis points elevated cash balances also continued to negatively impact net interest margin currently cash balances have already decreased by about 100 million compared to the end of the third quarter as we put cash to work by funding loans and retiring high cost cd maturities although not included in the net interest margin roll forward as cash balances have been elevated for some time 100 million of excess cash balances held at the federal reserve had a 6 basis point punitive effect on net interest margin looking ahead to the fourth quarter and into 2022 we expect our yield on interest earning assets to revert closer to what they were in the second quarter and then increase from there as we grow the commercial loan portfolio compared to the end of the second quarter we have seen loan pipelines increase 65 primarily driven by growth in sba franchise finance and construction opportunities additionally we continue to see opportunities for further downward deposit repricing in future periods over the next 12 months approximately 787 million of cds are scheduled to mature with a weighted average cost of 122 basis points currently the replacement cost of these deposits is in the range of 36 basis points looking ahead to 2022 with our expectations for loan growth and continued downward deposit repricing we anticipate annual net interest income growth to be between 9 million and 11 million turning to noninterest income on slide 9 noninterest income for the quarter was 7 8 million up from an adjusted 6 4 million in the second quarter the increase was driven primarily by higher revenues from mortgage banking activities but was partially offset by slightly lower gain on sale of loans we sold 22 million of sba 7 a guaranteed loans during the quarter which was consistent with the second quarter however we experienced lower premiums on those sales as i mentioned earlier loan pipelines especially in our sba business are strong heading into the end of the year therefore we expect sba gain on sale revenue to be up in the fourth quarter probably in the range of 5 million turning to noninterest expenses as shown on slide 10 the decrease on a linked quarter basis was driven primarily by a decline in consulting and professional fees and loan expenses the decrease in consulting and professional fees was mainly due to the timing of normal third party loan review work performed on our loan portfolio the decrease in loan expenses was due to the reimbursement of costs incurred in prior periods related to nonperforming loans now let s turn to asset quality on slide 11 credit quality improved during the quarter as nonperforming loans declined by 1 2 million mainly due to the payoff of a single tenant lease financing relationship which had previously been classified as nonaccrual nonperforming loans now represent 27 basis points of total loans down from 31 basis points last quarter and down from 32 basis points in the third quarter of 2020 net charge offs were less than 100 000 during the quarter and net charge offs to average loans was one basis point we are proud of the fact that we continue to exhibit high asset quality that is among the industry s best the provision for loan losses in the third quarter was a benefit of 29 000 compared to a provision of 21 000 in the prior quarter the decrease was due primarily to the 22 million decrease in loan balances as qualitative factors in the allowance model remained consistent with the second quarter and net charge offs were low overall the ratio of allowance for loan losses to total loans remained unchanged from the prior quarter at 95 basis points and 96 basis points excluding ppp loans which totaled 15 million at quarter end with respect to capital as shown on slide 12 our overall capital levels improved and remain healthy at both the company and the bank with the strong earnings performance this quarter our tangible common equity to tangible assets ratio increased to 8 61 up 18 basis points from the second quarter additionally tangible book value per share increased to 37 12 up from 35 92 in the second quarter and over 16 higher than one year ago as david mentioned earlier on the call our board of directors have authorized a new stock repurchase program with an aggregate purchase price of up to 30 million that will run through the end of 2022 we also completed a 60 million offering of 3 75 fixed to floating rate subordinated notes due in 2031 during the quarter while a portion of the proceeds were used to redeem the 25 million of subordinated debt callable at the end of the quarter the offer further strengthened regulatory capital and provides greater flexibility to evaluate strategic opportunities or deploy cash toward share repurchases with that i will turn it back to the operator so we can take your questions questions and answers operator we will now begin the question and answer session and the first question will come from john rodis with janney please go ahead david becker chairman chief executive officer so i guess i got a few questions i guess first off let me just start on the buyback great to see that announcement the stock is up some this morning but obviously stock is still trading below tangible book for modeling purposes how should we model it how aggressive i guess do you guys plan to be with this buyback ken lovik executive vice president chief financial officer i think obviously we re in a blackout period right now i think as we it was nice to see the price pop up today but yes to your point john we re still below tangible book and we have it in place through the end of next year so i think obviously we need to weigh strategic opportunities we have in front of us with the buyback but i think we can do both so i think it s really a timing issue i think ideally we feel like through the end of 2022 we should be able to do i think a pretty good portion if not all of the buyback but just timing may impact that just due to other strategic opportunities we have in front of us that we re evaluating john rodis janney analyst okay ken so ok so it sounds like it will be more of a i guess just to rephrase more of a drawn out process it s not something you d look to do the whole 30 million in the next quarter or two ken lovik executive vice president chief financial officer correct david becker chairman chief executive officer yes as ken said we ve got other opportunities we re taking a look at john and we think there s a position to do both and if for some reason we get something over the finish line that the market doesn t like then we ll come in with guns blazing on the buyback and take advantage of it so but we have definitely enough capital and with the increase in earnings over next year we think we re in a position we can feasibly do both very easily john rodis janney analyst okay and ken switching gears on expenses they were down linked quarter but it looked like there was some noise i guess you said some oreo sale gain and then looks like you had the reimbursement of some expenses so how should we think about operating expenses going forward ken lovik executive vice president chief financial officer yes they were i mean obviously we re pleased with how they came in but there were some moving parts in there that were benefit of timing and just other offsets to expenses i think if we go back and look at we re probably close to a call it a 15 million or 15 5 million run rate as we get into for the fourth quarter that s probably a good estimate in that line and then kind of looking forward where we ve continued to build out our sba platform in terms of headcount or some of that was delayed over the course of the year due to the timing of originations but we ve continued to add there and obviously add both around the bank so you bake a full year run rate of headcount into next year s expenses and we re probably closer to 15 5 to 16 looking forward to next year john rodis janney analyst maybe just one more question ken your i guess sort of near term drivers the increase in spread income of 9 million to 11 million just curious does that off of 20 of this year is that with or without the 800 000 of sub debt expense and spread income ken lovik executive vice president chief financial officer that would be without john rodis janney analyst okay so the reported number ken lovik executive vice president chief financial officer yes john rodis janney analyst okay makes sense thanks guys operator the next question will come from michael perito with kbw please go ahead michael perito kbw analyst hey good afternoon guys i want to start on the applepie partnership david i was wondering if you can maybe just give us a little bit more color on kind of how those loans are sourced and then what the nature of the partnership is are they originating loans and you guys are holding them on balance sheet are you guys involved in the underwriting if there s something more to the beyond that within the partnership just a little bit more color there if you don t mind david becker chairman chief executive officer sure michael the partnership is actually almost identical to what we were doing would provide healthcare endeavor over the last three or four years applepie has been around about 8 to 10 years i think and existence is originated over 1 billion with franchise loans and they have long term relationships with franchisees all over the country continue to increase they like the banking world as a whole where a little thought during the covid crisis because the franchise or it s kind of pulled in the reigns to help existing franchisees instead of expanding so they re on a nice growth curve themselves and in the second half of the year which was great timing for us we have created a credit box like we did with provide and they source those loans that fit that credit box and i can tell you from our underwriters and internal folks they re ecstatic with what we ve seen today i think out of all the loans we processed we even we only had a discussion about maybe one or two as far as some of the information in the file so it comes to us we funded stays on our books we re doing full servicing they do the origination but we take it from there so it s been a great program we re really excited about the kickoff and it looks like it s going to be very strong for 2022 michael perito kbw analyst is there any opportunity with these customers to pick up funding or anything else like along those lines that over time or is it really just purely a lending relationship partnership david becker chairman chief executive officer no they kind of look at the funding side and i misspoke there michael they are doing the servicing we purchased the loan but we have talked to them about giving the deposit opportunity with these folks as well and one of the nice things about it they ve been in the industry long enough a lot of these individuals are not brand new franchisees there s a guy coming back for store number three store number four they re multi franchise or the franchisees so it s good strong credit good strong businesses kind of the opposite of our fcl program historically we ve financed the facility and not the operator so it s been an interesting time for us to look at the credits but yes there is definitely a with this program where it is not just the real estate we re hopefully working on a program get the deposit relationship as well michael perito kbw analyst and is this kind of an indicator of the type of things that you guys are looking at that are in the pipeline are they mostly partnerships that would fall into this type of arrangement or is there more diversity and some of the incremental things that you guys are alluding to that that could come in the near term david becker chairman chief executive officer a lot of diversity the other partnership we announced here during the third quarter with finzly that s just a technology which actually complements our small business products we have other folks where it s a lending opportunity we have two or three fintech firms out here where it s a deposit opportunity so we re looking at all facets and we obviously have other fintech companies that have technology to just make our existing systems work better so we ve got i think i said probably one or two calls back we ve got about 10 different services that we re actively looking at and talking to and should have hopefully several more announcements here in the fourth quarter and early next year michael perito kbw analyst and what are the rates kind of on these applepie loans roughly david becker chairman chief executive officer applepie net is a little over 5 and the term is a little lower than the healthcare loans were averaging i think about a 7 year term on them versus 10 so it s a nice bump up in yield as well as the shorter term michael perito kbw analyst got it helpful and i wanted to clarify on the top line guide ken of the 9 million to 11 million of growth in 2022 i mean just are we basing that off kind of like an annualized year to date run rate or something like in the high 90 million range is that the right way to think about it or is there a difference would you clarify that at all ken lovik executive vice president chief financial officer no that s exactly it mike on an fte basis you re spot on michael perito kbw analyst okay and then just lastly i was wondering if you guys could just spend a minute on the dynamics within the sba in the quarter it sounds like was pipeline pushed out was it really just the margin contracted more than you expected and now the pipeline is larger than you expected for the fourth quarter just curious about the dynamics there with the revenue pickup in the fourth quarter and then was part b of that just wondering if you can provide a little bit more color behind the scenes about the pipeline for next year the revenue target is that the current team is that continuing to add more salespeople just would love a little bit more insights there if you guys don t mind ken lovik executive vice president chief financial officer yes footprint for you at the end of the third quarter was during the month of september the sba has used colson as their transfer agents i think from the beginning of time they switched over to a new firm called guidehouse that created a lot of slowdown and complications with the cares payments that were being made by the government as well as getting sales to the secondary market so part of the push here fourth quarter and the bump up is stuff that we just couldn t get through the pipeline obviously september 30 the physical year end which is just massive volume for them to begin with it was also the end of the 95 insurance writers so sba was flooded picked a pretty poor time to change the transfer agent in hindsight but so a little bit of the fourth quarter bump up is carryover going into 2022 we just had a meeting with the sba team and plotting up with financing their budget we hope to add another bdo or two but we ve got a good solid team we re definitely adding some more back office staff to support that volume growth but they re pretty comfortable as the 48 hours ago the 215 is a realistic number and a good opportunity for us so obviously sba has been up ppp is getting out of the way and kind of getting cleaned up for everybody so it s making it a little more competitive but we think we ve got a great team great program and look forward to really growing significantly again next year michael perito kbw analyst awesome thank you guys for the color and taking my questions appreciate it david becker chairman chief executive officer thanks mike operator the next question will come from brett rabatin with hovde group please go ahead brett rabatin hovde group analyst hey good afternoon good i wanted to first ask when we think about the loan portfolio growth in the fourth quarter looking at some of the individual segments that have had payoffs i guess i m curious do you expect that some of the line items like healthcare maybe continue to have some atrophy due to rate competition and as we think about fourth quarter and 2022 i mean it looks like you could be a double digit core grower as the ppp winds down here what are your thoughts on net origination versus the payoffs that you might be looking at ken lovik executive vice president chief financial officer yes i think we feel pretty good about pipelines going into the fourth quarter here i do obviously healthcare finances it s an asset class we like and we love to find a new team to work with in that area and grow that portfolio but there may be some continued decline in the short run there but obviously the applepie growth forecasted for the year which is right on track is that remains right on track remains pretty robust but we re also seeing in areas in single tenant for example pay downs prepayment activity has slowed a bit there and with kind of the bump up in the longer rates on the curve our pricing is more competitive than it was earlier in the year when the 10 year was at a bottom so i think kind of across the board in a handful of areas and what we retain on the sba as well i mean our origination our sba pipeline is strong and we re still probably selling some of that volume at the 90 guarantee so we re not retaining as much as we would kind of in a normalized environment but i think kind of across the board as we look at loan growth for the second or excuse me for the fourth quarter i think we feel good about it in several different areas about just overall net growth david becker chairman chief executive officer brett the only area that s going to be a little soft here in the fourth quarter teams feel like they ve been running in place all year we ve got a couple of very large c i opportunities or c i loans that are on the books today that there s a potential sale of the companies here in the fourth quarter so that could have some impact on c i but as ken said everything else looks stable and growing and we re pretty pumped up obviously the applepie adding 100 million there were more than compensated particularly with the yield on it any loss that we have from healthcare so we re pretty excited about fourth quarter numbers brett rabatin hovde group analyst okay and then the other thing i was curious about was just thinking about the deposits you ve obviously managed the cd cost down nicely most of the industries just had some less liquidity kind of come at them from a deposit perspective but you guys deposits have been fairly stable can you talk maybe about the management of the deposit base and then i think people are starting to think about rates and don t know if it s a late 22 or 23 possibility but as we think about the eventuality of higher rates how you re thinking about managing the deposit costs when we go to the other side of the coin on rates ken lovik executive vice president chief financial officer yes i mean obviously we re like many other banks in the industry that have suffered from excess liquidity on the balance sheet we alluded to it i alluded to it in my comments on the margin but we also had the position of cd maturities coming off and really i mean we ve had the growth and we ve seen the growth in money markets and checking accounts especially in the small business as we ve thrown a lot of time and effort in marketing behind growing those balances but in terms of deposit growth overall we had the luxury of having those dollars come in the door that really replace the maturities on the cd side and i think as we kind of look forward into 22 as well we continue to see that happen eventually your cds can t there eventually gets to a point where the maturity is kind of the pace of maturities will go down but just looking into 2022 we just see continued again i ll call it just continued shift in the composition of deposits from cds to money markets checking etc and i think when we think about pricing and what may happen in different rate environments last time the rate environment was we were in an up rate environment betas on cds were at 100 whereas in the other non maturity products they were lower than that in the money market space too they were probably closer to 50 to 60 than the 100 on cds so i think going into an up rate environment when that occurs i think we feel much much better about the composition of the deposit base and like i said we re not done we continue to foresee this continual shift well into 22 and beyond david becker chairman chief executive officer one of the things we re doing brett obviously somewhere in 22 that probably going to have to do something on rate you made the comment that everybody is flushed with cash so hopefully as the rates start to climb it won t be the feeding frenzy we had the last time in 18 where as fed move 25 institutions we re moving 35 to get the money as ken said but one of the other things we re doing right now we can lock up some commercial cd opportunities with insurance companies etc in that three four five year range that are under 100 basis points so we re trying we adjusted pricing a little bit to pick up some stuff a little longer in term obviously a little more costly but still in the big scheme of things very steep money for the next three to five year window brett rabatin hovde group analyst okay and then maybe just one last one if i could just around capital you could obviously do the entire 30 million and it wouldn t really you still not have any issues with capital i m curious some of these other investments that you re thinking about or partnerships are they going to require equity capital to be deployed with these firms or how should we be thinking about some of these additional partnerships that you re considering david becker chairman chief executive officer acquisition opportunities obviously that s going to involve some dollars i will tell you in a couple of the fintech companies that we re working with and opportunities we are making hopefully in some cases capital investments in that company by a percentage a lot of them are in a series b series c round etc there s an opportunity to participate not only are we signing on as customers and providing products or services to each other but we re also taking an equity stake in the company if possible so a little bit is not massive dollars we re not playing silicon valley bank here but it s a good opportunity for us to kind of get on the ground floor with some really really strong opportunities at least from my background and 40 years in technology there s some unique things happening out here that i think could be in the long term very beneficial to us but as ken said we continue to look at opportunities for acquisitions that obviously would hit the capital pretty heavily but the cash being pretty heavily not capital but we ve generated the i guess we re in a great position right now we re closing in on 9 tce that s probably the highest we ve been since the very earliest days of the bank so we ve got a lot of flexibility and a lot of opportunity here brett rabatin hovde group analyst great appreciate all the color thank you operator the next question will come from george sutton with craig hallum please go ahead george sutton craig hallum analyst i wanted to address david if we could the commercial pipeline in a little more detail how much of that is market dynamic because i haven t heard much of increased commercial demand out there so i m wondering market versus your execution and just the strength of your go to market that s really creating these opportunities david becker chairman chief executive officer we re kind of in an enviable position george i think with the last expansion we had of the fedex hub here in indianapolis we re now actually larger than the home base in memphis tennessee and there are warehouses popping up there s this little firm called amazon that s trying to suck up every square into space in and around indianapolis for distribution so it s just a we re in the right place right time with a great team and it s some folks that we ve worked with over the years that are just having a tremendous opportunity right now i think they re close to 70 million square feet of warehouse space going up in the next 12 to 14 months here in the indianapolis marketplace we have ventured a little bit outside of the indianapolis marketplace on commercial real estate with some of these firms obviously amazon is not throwing all it stakes into one basket here in indianapolis so it s been a nice opportunity for us to take some long term connections and taking advantage of the market george sutton craig hallum analyst got you that s helpful perspective actually ironically i was in indianapolis last week and i saw that amazon operation that you re talking about it is quite impressive so or i m sorry fedex operations yes so relative to the series b deals b and c deals that you mentioned you were contemplating is this incremental to the investments you ve made through private equity funds you re referring to additional opportunities just to be clear david becker chairman chief executive officer yes so some of them are still working with the private equity funds and some were going direct into the companies ourselves in fact we re working on what would be calling us today first id venture sub or something of the nature that i mean we re not going to go crazy with it but there are just a lot of really good companies coming up out here right now and opportunity to get in on the ground floor we re going to take advantage of that george sutton craig hallum analyst okay and then finally just so i fully appreciate the buyback that you are looking at that is really a result of the valuation opportunity that you see that is in no way shape or form related to any diminishment of m a opportunities that you are considering or could pursue is that a reasonable solution david becker chairman chief executive officer you hit the nail on the head george that s exactly right i ve always been grow first buyback second so we re still looking at the acquisition market extremely heavily george sutton craig hallum analyst perfect thanks guys david becker chairman chief executive officer i appreciate it thank you operator our next question will come from nathan race with piper sandler please go ahead nathan race piper sandler analyst yes hi guys going back to the acquisition discussion obviously with the stock still trading below tangible book it s difficult to use your currency i d imagine so i guess within that context how should we thinking about potential earn back periods on tangible solution and so forth as you guys consider complete acquisitions and so forth and not just partnerships per se david becker chairman chief executive officer the ones we re looking at at the current time nate are cash deals it is not an equity situation so the really only dilution would be if there s any goodwill in the deal but it s coming out of cash we re obviously trading at i guess we re closer to i don t know where we re exactly as david yesterday we re 90 of book that s still not good currency to buy anything with so we re looking at cash opportunities nathan race piper sandler analyst and would the earn back period on those potential deals be south of three years or how are you guys going to think about just the tangible book value dilution associated with acquisitions near term david becker chairman chief executive officer yes we re using the three year as kind of the play a month or two shorter a month or two longer doesn t really excite us but yes we re focused in on a three year return nathan race piper sandler analyst okay great and then maybe changing gears and thinking about balance sheet size and the securities book there s been some quarterly fluctuations just between the average and end of period balances in the securities portfolio over the last couple of quarters how should we be thinking about the size of the securities book as you guys have a pretty strong loan pipeline particularly with applepie coming on board does the securities book kind of hold steady here over the next few quarters can or does it kind of shrink to also support the expanding outlook on nim ken lovik executive vice president chief financial officer yes i think probably the way to look at that is kind of a secondary support on that obviously we want to take our cash and fund loans first and as we ve said on numerous times i think we feel really really great about the pipelines we have in front of us of course sometimes you can t always control timing but i would say that on average you would probably expect the securities balance to drift down over from where it s at today we did if you remember earlier in the year in june we did take a lot of our cash balances were well north of 500 million and we put a lot of cash into the securities portfolio than with the expectation that we wouldn t need to put much in there and just let cash balances fund loan growth so i wouldn t expect i don t expect cash or securities balances to go up from here and would expect them to drift down drift down over the next 12 months but as i said it s depending on loan loan timing we may put some money away into the securities portfolio and sometimes we buy mortgage backs for cra purposes but that s really probably all the activity you would see in that area over the next six months minimum david becker chairman chief executive officer yes one of the things that s happening in the marketplace too nathan as ken said in his comments today we picked up three points this past quarter on the securities portfolio a lot of it is mortgage backed product that we ve had on the books some over quite some time and obviously as refi slowdown and repayments on those things slowdown that s going to help one boost yield on the securities portfolio and also slow down the payback so it won t run off quite as fast as it has been and particularly if there is real solid indication that the fed has kind of bump up rates a little bit refi s i think are down over like 62 on a year over year basis so that has impact on our mortgage side which kind of hurts us but on the other side it helps us because it really slows down some of the paybacks on those securities and the premiums that we have to write down so double edge sword but it should be pretty stable for the balance of the year and into 2022 nathan race piper sandler analyst okay that s helpful i appreciate all the color thank you guys operator this concludes our question and answer session i would like to turn the conference back over to david becker for any closing remarks please go ahead sir david becker chairman chief executive officer thank you chuck and i d like to thank all of you for joining us today we had a

at their last meeting that if the economy continued to improve they could start reducing their monthly bond purchases as soon as next month and bring them to an end by the middle of 2022 the discussion was revealed in the minutes of the fed s sept 21 22 meeting released wednesday oct 13 advertisement federal reserve imposes sweeping new limits on policymakers investments share copy link copy the federal reserve is imposing a broad new set of restrictions on the investments its officials can own a response to questionable recent trades that forced two top fed officials to resign the fed announced thursday that its policymakers and senior staff would be barred from investing in individual stocks and bonds they would also have to provide 45 days advance notice of any trade and receive prior approval from ethics officials and they would have to hold the investments for at least a year these senior officials will also have to sell any individual stocks or bonds they now own as well as any category of securities such as municipal bonds that the fed is buying as part of its economic support programs the new rules would also require fed officials to publicly disclose all financial transactions within 30 days and would bar trading during periods of heightened financial market stress the central bank said it hasn t yet decided how to define such periods in a statement the fed said it would incorporate the restrictions into its written policies in the coming months fed officials suggested that they might have to expand their legal staff to implement them these tough new rules raise the bar high in order to assure the public we serve that all of our senior officials maintain a single minded focus on the public mission of the federal reserve chair jerome powell said in a statement powell who is under consideration by the biden administration for a second four year term as fed chair has come under fire after it was revealed that two regional federal reserve bank presidents traded stocks and other investments last spring although the trades complied with fed financial ethics rules they occurred while the fed was taking expansive steps to boost the economy and calm financial markets as a result they raised the possibility of conflicts of interest because the two officials could have profited from the fed s actions one of the officials robert kaplan who was president of the dallas fed made trades of 1 million or more in 22 stocks last year including apple facebook and chevron the other official eric rosengren who was head of the federal reserve bank of boston invested in funds that held mortgage backed securities of the same type that the fed was buying as part of its efforts to hold down longer term interest rates kaplan and rosengren announced their resignations soon after the questionable trades came to light ethics experts said the trades underscored how lax the fed s rules were given its outside influence over financial markets the regional fed bank presidents take part in private discussions about potential interest rate changes that stand to affect the financial markets they can also move markets in their frequent public speeches which typically reflect their inside knowledge of the fed s policy discussions under the rules announced thursday fed officials including the regional presidents will be limited to owning diversified investments such as mutual funds powell s term expires in february but most observers expect the white house to announce a decision this fall many progressive groups though have urged the administration to nominate lael brainard a member of the fed s governing board or some other candidate rather than powell some have argued that the fed s rules around investing were too lax not all critics are likely to be satisfied by the stricter rules unveiled thursday the changes announced today by the federal reserve are long overdue and a good start but don t go far enough said dennis kelleher president of better markets an advocacy group the fed should apply them more broadly kelleher said to any fed employees with access to nonpublic information not just senior officials senior leaders kelleher said should have to put their holdings in a blind trust the fed considered blind trusts officials said but did not choose that route because officials would be unable to guarantee that they were not invested in individual stocks or bonds some ethics experts applauded the fed s move norman eisen a senior fellow at the brookings institution said the new rules compare favorably to other government agencies the fed has treated this as what we in the ethics profession refer to as a teachable moment to broadcast a message of integrity eisen said they are to be congratulated powell s own investments have also raised concerns a former partner at the carlyle group an investment firm powell owns municipal bonds a type of security that the fed bought last year for the first time as part of its efforts to ensure that financial markets could operate smoothly at a news conference sept 22 powell said he thought that fed officials generally shouldn t own financial assets of the kind that the fed itself is purchasing he said he had owned muni bonds for years powell will have to sell the muni bonds under the new rules fed officials confirmed at the same news conference powell acknowledged that the existing rules were inadequate and said the fed would make changes and earlier this month the fed said an internal watchdog would investigate whether the trades by kaplan and rosengren violated any laws

unaudited consolidated balance sheets and statements of income contained within this press release that presentation provides the reader with an understanding of the corporation s results that can be tracked consistently from period to period and enables a comparison of the corporation s performance with other companies gaap financial statements in addition to analyzing the corporation s results on a reported basis management uses certain non gaap financial measures because it believes these non gaap financial measures provide information to investors about the underlying operational performance and trends of the corporation and therefore facilitate a comparison of the corporation with the performance of its competitors non gaap financial measures used by the corporation may not be comparable to similarly named non gaap financial measures used by other companies the sec has adopted regulation g which applies to all public disclosures including earnings releases made by registered companies that contain non gaap financial measures under regulation g companies making public disclosures containing non gaap financial measures must also disclose along with each non gaap financial measure certain additional information including a reconciliation of the non gaap financial measure to the closest comparable gaap financial measure and a statement of the corporation s reasons for utilizing the non gaap financial measure as part of its financial disclosures the sec has exempted from the definition of non gaap financial measures certain commonly used financial measures that are not based on gaap when these exempted measures are included in public disclosures supplemental information is not required the following measures used in this report which are commonly utilized by financial institutions have not been specifically exempted by the sec and may constitute non gaap financial measures within the meaning of the sec s rules although we are unable to state with certainty that the sec would so regard them fully taxable equivalent net interest income and net interest margin net interest income is commonly presented on a tax equivalent basis that is to the extent that some component of the institution s net interest income which is presented on a before tax basis is exempt from taxation e g is received by the institution as a result of its holdings of state or municipal obligations an amount equal to the tax benefit derived from that component is added to the actual before tax net interest income total this adjustment is considered helpful in comparing one financial institution s net interest income to that of other institutions or in analyzing any institution s net interest income trend line over time to correct any analytical distortion that might otherwise arise from the fact that financial institutions vary widely in the proportions of their portfolios that are invested in tax exempt securities and that even a single institution may significantly alter over time the proportion of its own portfolio that is invested in tax exempt obligations moreover net interest income is itself a component of a second financial measure commonly used by financial institutions net interest margin which is the ratio of net interest income to average interest earning assets for purposes of this measure as well fully taxable equivalent net interest income is generally used by financial institutions as opposed to actual net interest income again to provide a better basis of comparison from institution to institution and to

asset management now let me turn the call over to peter peter e baccile president and chief executive officer thanks art and thank you all for joining us our team continued its strong performance in 2021 by delivering another great quarter highlighted by increased in service occupancy new development leasing and continued strong growth in rental rates on new and renewal leasing as importantly we were also successful in readying land for new development starts and replenishing our pipeline with strategic land acquisitions i ll discuss those successes in more detail shortly but let me first update you on the overall strength of the u s industrial market per cbre ea net absorption was a healthy 120 million square feet in the third quarter while completions came in at 79 million square feet through the first three quarters of this year net absorption was 292 million square feet significantly outpacing new supply of 193 million in our portfolio we grew occupancy 50 basis points to finish the third quarter at 97 1 cash same store noi increased 6 9 and cash rental rates for new and renewal leases were up 22 8 looking at rental rate growth for the full year as of today we have signed roughly 98 of the 2021 expirations and including new leasing our overall cash rental rate increase is 15 3 which puts us on pace to top our previous company record of 13 9 in 2019 with respect to 2022 expirations we re off to a great start with 29 of renewals signed and a cash rental rate increase of 19 let me move now to the primary driver of our external growth our development program as most of you know as part of our underwriting process and risk management discipline we operate with a self imposed speculative leasing cap due to continued robust fundamentals in the industrial market the strength of our balance sheet and growth in our portfolio and the significant opportunities we have to create shareholder value through new investments we ve increased our speculative leasing cap by 175 million bringing the total to 800 million now let me walk you through our recent land acquisitions as well as three exciting new development starts that will put some of the incremental cap capacity to good use during the third quarter we closed on three development sites totaling 122 acres for 59 million two are in the inland empire east and the third is in denver in total these sites can accommodate up to 2 1 million square feet of new development and one of the new inland empire east sites we are starting our first pioneer logistics center a 461 000 square foot cross dock facility our total projected investment is 73 million with a targeted cash yield of 6 8 the inland empire continues to be one of the strongest logistics real estate markets in the u s helped by significant net absorption from activity related to the two largest ports in north america market vacancy in the inland empire is sub 2 and market rents have grown more than 80 since we went under contract on this site in early 2020 we look forward to adding this prime asset to our southern california portfolio which represents approximately 23 of our rental income as of the end of the third quarter moving to the east coast we are starting another development in south florida to serve the strong tenant demand we have experienced there with our recent leasing successes at first park miami and first 95 distribution center firstgate commerce center will be a 132 000 square foot class a distribution facility in the infill coral springs submarket market rents in broward county have grown 15 to 20 since the end of 2019 our total estimated investment is 24 million and our targeted cash yield is 5 5 in the fourth quarter we acquired a site in bordentown new jersey just off of exit 7 on the jersey turnpike for 8 million we immediately started construction a first bordentown logistics center a 208 000 square foot facility we look to build upon our past successes in this location where our two prior developments were leased near construction completion the central new jersey market has been exceptionally strong with asking rents up 34 versus last year according to a recent market report from cbre our total projected investment is 33 million with an estimated cash yield of 5 8 in summary these three planned fourth quarter starts total approximately 800 000 square feet with an estimated investment of 130 million and a cash yield of 6 3 including these planned starts our developments in process totaled 6 4 million square feet with a total investment of approximately 725 million at a cash yield of 6 our expected overall development margin on these projects is approximately 65 with development as our primary driver of external growth we re also focused on replenishing our land holdings in the fourth quarter to date in addition to the new jersey site i just discussed we also acquired a total of 10 acres in the inland empire and northern california for a total of 10 million as of today adjusted for our planned fourth quarter starts and the aforementioned land acquisitions our balance sheet land can support approximately 12 5 million square feet of new development our share of the phoenix camelback joint venture is an additional 3 8 million square feet in total that s north of 16 million square feet and represents approximately 1 7 billion of potential new investment activity now let me update you on our recent development leasing successes we just leased the entire 548 000 square footer at first park pv303 in phoenix at completion to a leading omnichannel retailer as part of this lease we are also expanding the building another 254 000 square feet for a total of 802 000 square feet the total estimated investment for the project including the expansion is 72 million and the estimated cash yield is 6 the tenant is expected to take occupancy of the just completed space by year end with the expansion ready for use in the second quarter of 2020 we also leased 100 of our 303 000 square foot first wilson logistics center in the inland empire that will be completed in the first quarter of 2022 with a cash yield of 8 7 we substantially outperformed our underwritten yield this lease further showcases the rapid rental rate growth in the inland empire that i discussed earlier we are pleased that we have land sites in this high growth market that can support another 2 8 million square feet of development as another example of the strength of the southern california market and our platform we just leased our laurel park redevelopment project in the south bay this property is very well suited for port centric warehouse distribution users given its great location and highly sought after yard for surface use our first year yield is 7 5 on our 21 million investment which represents a margin of around 150 moving on to sales during the quarter we sold six properties and four units for 14 million and in the fourth quarter we have sold four additional buildings in detroit totaling 7 million bringing our year to date total to 126 million given current visibility on our disposition pipeline we now expect sales for the year to total 175 million to 225 million a 75 million increase from the prior midpoint of 125 million with that let me turn it over to scott to walk through additional details on the quarter and updated guidance scott musil chief financial officer thanks peter let me start by summarizing our results and leasing stats for the third quarter nareit funds from operations were 0 51 per fully diluted share compared to 0 49 per share in 3q 2020 excluding approximately 0 04 per share of income related to the final settlement of an insurance claim 3q 2020 ffo was 0 45 per share our cash basis same store noi growth for the quarter excluding termination fees was 6 9 primarily due to higher average occupancy an increase in rental rates on new and renewal leasing rental rate bumps and lower bad debt expense slightly offset by an increase in free rent we commenced approximately 2 4 million square feet of leases of these 500 000 were new 1 4 million were renewals and and 500 000 were for developments and acquisitions with lease up tenant retention by square footage was 85 cash rental rates for the quarter were up 22 8 overall with renewals up 21 and new leasing up 27 5 and on a straight line basis overall rental rates were up 36 2 with renewals increasing 34 9 and new leasing up 39 5 moving on to some capital markets activity as previously announced in early july we closed on two financing transactions first we expanded our line of credit to 750 million and improved our pricing to libor plus 77 5 basis points a reduction of 32 5 basis points compared to our prior facility the maturity is now pushed out five years including our two six month extension options we also refinanced our 200 million term loan the new term loan matures in july 2026 and has an interest rate of libor plus 85 basis points a reduction of 65 basis points in the spread compared to our prior facility with our interest rate swaps in place the new fixed interest rate on the term loan is 1 84 on the equity side through our atm we issued 1 1 million common shares at a weighted average price of 55 35 per share for total net proceeds of 59 million to help fund the new investments peter spoke about moving on to our updated 2021 guidance per our earnings release last evening our guidance range for nareit ffo is now 1 93 to 1 97 per share which is a 0 02 per share increase at the midpoint reflecting our third quarter performance and an increase in capitalized interest due to our announced development starts key assumptions for guidance are as follows in service occupancy at year end of 96 75 to 97 75 this implies a full year quarter end average in service occupancy of 96 5 to 96 8 an increase of 15 basis points at the midpoint fourth quarter same store noi growth on a cash basis before termination fees of 6 to 7 5 this implies a quarterly average same store noi growth for the full year 2021 of 4 3 to 4 7 an increase of 25 basis points at the midpoint due to our third quarter performance please note that our full year same store noi guidance excludes the impact of approximately 1 million from the gain from an insurance settlement our g a expense guidance is now 34 million to 35 million an increase of 1 million at the midpoint and guidance includes the anticipated 2021 costs related to our completed and under construction developments at september 30 plus the expected fourth quarter starts of first pioneer logistics center first gate commerce center and first bordentown logistics center in total for the full year 2021 we expect to capitalize about 0 08 per share of interest other than previously discussed our guidance does not reflect the impact of any future sales acquisitions or new development starts after this call the impact of any future debt issuances debt repurchases or repayments after this call and guidance also excludes the potential issuance of equity let me turn it back over to peter peter e baccile president and chief executive officer thanks scott before we take your questions let me thank our team for another great quarter we re excited about our growth prospects as we continue to put into production our landholdings that can currently support more than 16 million square feet of value creating developments we are also focused on replenishing our pipeline with new sites in higher barrier markets we continue to benefit from robust sector fundamentals that are reflected in strong net absorption high occupancy levels and increasing rents with that operator would you please open it up for questions questions and answers operator your first question is from craig mailman of keybanc capital markets craig mailman keybanc capital markets analyst hey good morning guys scott maybe this one s for you just looking at the year to date ffo kind of implies a decel in the fourth quarter to get to the midpoint of your range could you just walk through that scott musil chief financial officer hey sure craig i would say the two drivers there are one is we forecasted 500 000 of bad debt expense in the fourth quarter our actual in the third quarter was 25 000 hopefully we can do better in the fourth quarter than our 500 000 and also the fourth quarter is being hit with a full quarter dilution related to the equity issuance where the third quarter was only partial so i would say those are the two drivers craig mailman keybanc capital markets analyst okay and did you say that there s equities more equity included in the guidance going forward or did i mishear you scott musil chief financial officer no no future equity but what i m saying is that the equity issued in the third quarter was more back end in the third quarter so the fourth quarter it s in for the entire quarter so you have a higher share count fourth quarter compared to third quarter craig mailman keybanc capital markets analyst got you and then just separately peter you noted your spec cap is up 175 million kind of what could you just walk through as you the balance sheet gets bigger over time how we can kind of maybe track the upside to this like what s the most important metric you guys use to set that cap peter e baccile president and chief executive officer sure so we put the cap in place back in 2012 and a little history here will give more context to the answer because the answer is pretty straightforward we put in place in 2012 obviously we had a very very different portfolio and a very different balance sheet and back then the formula was 9 of the total market cap of the company as time has passed we have adjusted the cap based on that formula so we adjusted it in 2015 and 2018 and then again at the beginning of this year we have not changed the multiplier it s still 9 notwithstanding the dramatically improved portfolio and balance sheet so you can say it s even more conservative today than it was back in 2012 so it s pretty simple craig it s just 9 of the total traded value plus debt of the company craig mailman keybanc capital markets analyst got you thank you operator your next question is from ki bin kim of truist ki bin kim truist analyst thanks good morning sticking with the same line of questioning i wasn t sure how you calculated the how much you ve eaten into that speculative cap because you also consider the vacancy in your existing portfolio so i guess first question how much have you eaten into the cap and do you i can t remember that you use like book value for your assets or market value to get to that speculation peter e baccile president and chief executive officer so committed dollars so any new development that we start that has less than 90 leasing those dollars go in on a pro rata basis if we were to do a forward with no tenant those dollars go in and that s how we the cap works we have 279 million of capacity today largely due to the great leasing on our new developments that we ve just completed so of the 800 million 279 million is available does that answer your question ki bin scott musil chief financial officer yeah it s based on book value too ki bin peter e baccile president and chief executive officer also ki bin as acquisition vacancy so if we acquire an empty building it goes into the spec cap we treat that risk the same as development and so when we lease any acquisition vacancy it comes off it comes off the list and finally once an asset is 90 leased it all comes off ki bin kim truist analyst got it so when you think about that and the amount of good leasing that you ve done in your portfolio what is a practical range for development starts on an ongoing annual basis i know you guys don t typically provide guidance just looking for some type of ballpark figure peter e baccile president and chief executive officer right so given the strength and scale of our current land position the spec cap and the pace at which we lease new developments ultimately are going to determine the development volume going forward of course subject to profitability as we always say we re a profit shop not a volume shop so you should see development levels going forward are going to be at higher levels than in the past several years again assuming fundamentals hold ki bin kim truist analyst okay and as you think about funding that development pipeline that s growing should we expect a steady state contribution from dispositions so like 200 million that should ratchet up as the pipeline grows or different sources peter e baccile president and chief executive officer with respect to dispositions i think the volumes that we ve guided to the last few years are going to be similar going forward obviously we just increased and that has a lot to do with quite often we ll get unsolicited offers on assets that are in markets where we want to dispose off more assets and we ll take those offers that s really what you see when we pop up from our original guidance so i think the guidance lines going forward will be similar ki bin to what we ve been giving ki bin kim truist analyst okay that s it for me thanks peter e baccile president and chief executive officer and obviously as we get bigger that s a much lower percentage dwindling percentage of the overall size of the company ki bin kim truist analyst right thank you operator your next question is from rob stevenson of janney rob stevenson janney analyst good morning guys just a follow up on ki bin s question the fourth quarter disposition guidance is now roughly i guess 60 million to 100 million given the full year guidance are you seeing any meaningful change in the asset pricing there or is that increase more of a reflection of the increases to the development pipeline and the need to fund that and the attractiveness of dispositions as a funding source peter e baccile president and chief executive officer no i mean i think the bottom line is we re getting really good pricing and again in these markets and you all know that the markets that are outside our 15 target markets are the markets where we find lower growth and we re going to be disposing of more of those assets and the market for assets in those submarkets is very very strong that s really what drives it we re really not looking to sell real estate to fund development that s not the key driver obviously it s a benefit but it s not the key driver rob stevenson janney analyst and will you be with these 60 million to 100 million in the fourth quarter are you going to be exiting any markets as a result of that peter e baccile president and chief executive officer wholesale exit i don t think so rob stevenson janney analyst okay and then peter there s been a lot of press on the continued supply chain issues and the cargo ships sitting off the coast what impact is that having on your tenants and then their incremental demand for industrial space these days and if this continues through 2022 as many expect what s the impact down to your business you think peter e baccile president and chief executive officer i m going to give that to jojo and peter to give their thoughts on that johannson yap chief investment officer sure sure basically the net impact is that a lot of the tenants in our business who need imported products have is really having a hard time getting product and they cannot ascertain the availability nor the timing so the net effect is that they order more they have to stop more they have to put more inventory because it s so hard the bigger loss is to sell that product and if they don t really know the timing that based on our issues certainly so they re going out the net effect toward they re getting wanting to take more space and what s been happening is that we now have less space than the start of the year and so what happens is that the now rents have been rising because of that and in terms of 2022 we don t know there are so many issues in the supply chain right now and there s strong demand so we hope that this level is off for our tenants sake but the reality is that i don t think it will level off i think it looks the supply chain issues will continue and the rent pressure will continue because of the lack of space and increased demand peter schultz executive vice president hey rob it s peter schultz the other thing i d add to that is we re seeing a marked increase of activity from the third party logistics companies looking for space to help with the capacity constraints that a lot of our tenants and companies have so they are very very active looking for as jojo said a finite and declining amount of space today rob stevenson janney analyst should we be thinking about this time period of elevated rental rates and increased demand as a pull forward and then at some point whether it s 2023 2024 who knows that there will be some sort of lull as the catch up actually happens or is this you think that this sort of elevated level winds up of demand winds up sticking around for a prolonged period of time as people are reluctant to go back to previous just in time inventory procedures johannson yap chief investment officer that s a very very good question in order to answer that question we have to predict where e commerce as a percentage of total sales will be in the market and in e commerce in the next five six years i don t know goes to 50 then all that s even going to be a bigger driver than the supply chain issues so the supply chain issues will be very very minimal compared to that long term driver so now that s the first thing the second thing is that in terms of supply chain it s hard to predict really when it s going because you have offshore issues you have inshore issues you have shipper issues you have labor issues you have checker driver issues you have covid still a little bit it s lessening related efficiency issues and supports so we don t know when that s all going to get fixed peter schultz executive vice president don t forget the primary catalyst to these supply chain issues was covid where everything is shut down and then it opened up all at once and so if anything you re catching up more than you re selling forward if you follow me rob stevenson janney analyst okay all right thanks guys appreciate it operator your next question is from anthony powell of barclays anthony powell barclays analyst hi good morning question on the spec cap you said that it s at 9 of the total i guess market value and that s conservative relative to where you used to be at the company given the increase of the size of the company and the increase of quality of its portfolio given the strong fundamentals why not be a bit more aggressive and increase that spec cap a bit more just given what you re seeing in the market peter e baccile president and chief executive officer yes well one thing that we re very focused on is making sure that we have a business strategy and a portfolio that s going to outperform through the cycle and while it is tempting in times like this to do what you just said we think going forward we re going to be a lot better off if we just stick to the fundamental business plan that we ve always had and we are working hard as you can see in terms of replenishing our pipeline not only for land but new developments and creating great margins there and we re mindful that trees don t grow to the sky trust me we ve discussed what you ve said and at the end of the day we really like the discipline for new leasing that the current cap structure demands anthony powell barclays analyst got it thanks and i guess on the land side you said you replenishing our land bank right now what are you seeing in terms of pricing on land the competitive environment just competitive players for industrial land out there peter e baccile president and chief executive officer jojo johannson yap chief investment officer very competitive and that prices continue to increase they re increasing a lot more on the coast than the middle part of the country but the reason for a bigger increase to coastal markets because the rent growth there has been higher as well so we project that land prices will continue to increase anthony powell barclays analyst all right thank you your next question is from rich anderson of smbc rich anderson smbc analyst hey thanks good morning so just a follow up on the supply chain question that got started with rob s and cory now did you say that the issues that we re talking about are very kind of small in terms of rent pressure upwards versus the broader commentary about e commerce demand is that what you said peter e baccile president and chief executive officer no what i was saying is that when you look at the supply chain issues today you don t really know what the long term impact is if you don t know where e commerce as a percentage of total sales will go and what i said was that if e commerce as a percentage of sales will go to 50 then that will actually make the supply chain issues kind of minimal i think as big today that for 2025 and it goes to 50 that s a bigger driver than anything else that we re seeing and that s why i am saying rich anderson smbc analyst okay i understand thank you for that so but when you i don t know if it s if you re able to quantify this but would you be able to say if there s a 50 of rent how much of that probably impossible question to answer but how much of that is supply chain related how much of that is just basic demand related is it is there any way to answer that question peter e baccile president and chief executive officer it s not an there s no way to answer it but i would say that the demand side of that is vastly exceeds the current pressure from the supply chain challenge there just isn t enough space for the demand anyway a lot of that has to do with the fact that everybody stopped building last year for seven or eight months a lot of it has to do with the fact that it s difficult now and this is a supply chain challenge but it s difficult to get some commodity inputs but the demand is just very very strong you saw that you heard the net absorption numbers earlier relative to new deliveries and that s really what s the primary driver of the very very strong rent growth that we re experiencing peter schultz executive vice president and rich it s peter schultz the other thing i d add to that is remember occupancy costs are only in the 4 5 6 7 range of a company s operation so while rents are going up we re seeing labor and transportation go up even more so the occupancy cost is still a very small percentage of the total rich anderson smbc analyst got you you mentioned that as a way to counter some of these stresses that they re stockpiling more but how does that play into the shortage of truck drivers and moving things around i mean it just sounds like something s going to burst here and i don t know if that s good or bad for your business but can you talk about how the shortage of truck drivers is impacting those types of decisions peter e baccile president and chief executive officer jojo johannson yap chief investment officer well when you look at one of the more successful operations right now there the ltl less than truckload because they re very very busy and they re actually raising rates and they re very profitable and so a lot of businesses a lot of businesses in the transportation industry are naming their price and they re getting their bids and they re getting their prices so i mean a lot of people in the fulfillment business are doing really well so and some and a lot of them are customers too so yes the question is that how is it going to affect the industry i think my feeling is that some of the costs are going to be passed to consumers there s that increased cost by businesses and some of those are going to affect their margins and but some are going to be passed to the consumers but the thing is they re not going to change they are wanting to store more because they want to make the sales and right now there s already top of some importing for next year s season so that s how bad it is rich anderson smbc analyst great thanks for that and lastly for me 0 08 of capitalized interest i think is in your numbers how has that trended and how do you see it trending into 2022 with all the development activity that you ve got teeing up scott musil chief financial officer i would say over the last several years it s trended higher just because the development pipeline today is larger i would say next year it s hard to say because we got to look at our starts and what gets leased up my best guess at this point in time it s going to be at least 0 08 if not more rich anderson smbc analyst okay thanks very much operator your next question is from michael carroll of rbc capital markets michael carroll rbc capital markets analyst yes thanks so how do you guys currently view your land bank i mean right now it s fairly sizable i know that you indicated that you re still looking for some attractive sites to buy to kind of add to that i mean what s kind of the reasoning behind that is that you re short of land in some of these higher end markets that you want to be in and that s going to be a short term hold if you do buy that land you can start it right away can you talk a little bit about that peter e baccile president and chief executive officer sure we re always looking for new land opportunities that are near term developable the definition of near term has certainly changed over the last few years entitlement periods are more like 18 months now and we talked a little bit earlier about some of the delays with respect to getting some of the commodity inputs in particular steel but our current our core current landholdings we estimate would take about three to five years to build out but remember again our land positions are never static we re always sourcing entitling new sites and we ll always have some land sales to users such as some of the land in our jv out in phoenix michael carroll rbc capital markets analyst are there any markets that you re short on land that you re trying to aggressively acquire i guess is there any markets that you re focused on more than others right now peter e baccile president and chief executive officer well we re focused on new investment focuses on the 15 markets that we talked about in our investor day about a year ago and of course we re always interested in new opportunities in the higher barrier markets those are the coastal markets michael carroll rbc capital markets analyst okay great and then can you provide an update on the former pier 1 space i don t remember if we talked about that on this call or not i know that s the leasing expectations pushed out to 2022 but is the leasing activity similar to what it has been or has that changed at all peter e baccile president and chief executive officer peter peter schultz executive vice president so you re referring to our 644 000 square foot cross dock building at old post road along i 95 north of baltimore with our portfolio occupancy over 97 we continue to look for the right fit on a long term basis for a single tenant for the building we re one of two buildings that are available in that submarket the other being an 860 000 square foot building that was delivered earlier this year and we continue to see rent growth in the market and the upside that that building provides but we have no further update today michael carroll rbc capital markets analyst okay great thank you operator your next question is from dave rodgers of baird dave rodgers baird analyst yes good morning everybody you guys have addressed a lot already but i guess i just wanted to ask about the margins on your development starts i think last year what your 2020 stabilizations were around 100 margin your start for the fourth quarter this year about 100 margin but what s in pipeline is about half of that that we want to sneeze at a 50 to 60 margin but maybe more curious on kind of what the driver is are you having differences in land utilization that it s just entirely rent growth that would be the first question and i guess the second question is if you guys are able to buy land put it into service quickly in a development at 100 margin how i mean despite the fact that you re saying land prices are up how inefficiently is land priced today i mean what are land prices going to do and the next round of purchases that i d see peter e baccile president and chief executive officer i ll start off with that and jojo and peter can add their thoughts as far as i mean land prices are going up rapidly especially where we want to buy it but rents are so far growing a little bit quicker we re looking at land prices on a per square foot basis that we never thought we would see and in terms of the margin impact again rents are growing quicker than the cost of land and cap rates obviously have continued to come down and that contributes to the big margins that you re referring to jojo johannson yap chief investment officer so yes i would just basically just for me it s a trifecta of higher yields in the i would say it really to the platform for fr one is that we work really hard on the basis we don t bid on highly marketed deals all the land that we bought is off market and direct field and a result assemblages so we hit the basis we basically buy below market so the basis helps the yield the second thing is that in almost every deal that we did we underwrote conservatively so the rent projection actually the rent grew more than we projected so that helps our yield as well and then lastly this year alone there has been cap rate compression up to 50 basis points so if you put those three together that s a formula for high returns dave rodgers baird analyst when you look at the in process just right here at the end of the third quarter the relative lower margin than that is that a function of when you bought that land is that a function of just location johannson yap chief investment officer well when you look at the developments under construction you do have some markets like a seattle market you re correct and it s a function of a recently kind of acquired site that s lower than our average so that would be one example and then the other example would be a large development at central pa that s a function of a recent land pricing too yes peter e baccile president and chief executive officer on that project we bought and started immediately johannson yap chief investment officer yeah peter e baccile president and chief executive officer where some of these projects like the big margin project that we spoke about in our remarks we tied that land up in 2020 and the rents in that market grew tremendously and cap rates compressed so that s why you saw the huge margin there johannson yap chief investment officer yeah dave rodgers baird analyst that s helpful and is we ve been told of running about 30 to 35 of kind of total building construction costs is that holding pretty consistent it sounds like from what you re saying johannson yap chief investment officer overall it s higher now dave i would add about 10 percentage points to that dave rodgers baird analyst great that s helpful thank you johannson yap chief investment officer thank you operator your next question is from nick yulico of scotiabank greg mcginniss scotiabank analyst hey this is greg mcginniss i m with nick all my questions have been answered actually so thank you very much operator your next question is from connor siversky of berenberg connor siversky berenberg analyst hey all thanks for having me on the 2022 leases already signed can you comment at all on what markets where you re seeing particular strength and maybe what are the upper and lower bounds of what i assume to be a weighted average on that 19 spread figure scott musil chief financial officer well i ll comment on the 29 debt signed it s pretty representative of the entire portfolio of the company and when you look at all of expirations in 2022 it s pretty representative of the overall portfolio as well but the markets that we ve been talking about in q a we mentioned in the script those are the markets that we ve been seeing some really strong rental rate growth in connor siversky berenberg analyst okay that helps and then what kind of escalators are baked into the new leases has there been any meaningful change from what you would have signed in 2020 or 2019 scott musil chief financial officer we re definitely seeing the escalators across all our markets in that 3 to 4 range so you re definitely going to see those escalators going up in the next year or two connor siversky berenberg analyst okay and last one for me i m sorry if you guys already commented on this but i noticed there s a pretty big delta in the price per acre on the parcels acquired in the inland empire during the quarter can you provide any color as to what explains the difference johannson yap chief investment officer sure sure well different submarkets has different rents and therefore a different basis but they re all increased from last year and we project profitability in those of course we still have to entitle those but we think we are well below market and definitely well below market post entitlement connor siversky berenberg analyst okay that helps thank you operator your next question is from bill crow of raymond james bill crow raymond james analyst hey good morning peter and team we re now almost a year past your november 2020 investor day and you offered some 2023 expectations that were really well received and i m just wondering how the past years actualized results and the current fundamentals kind of impact your view toward 2023 and maybe specifically the 260 million affo target throughout there peter e baccile president and chief executive officer sure scott scott musil chief financial officer hey bill it s scott first thing i ll mention is rental rate growth or increase in rental rates on new and renewal leasing you remember i had a question about at investor day i assume 12 this year 8 in 22 and i think 6 in 23 and i said at the time i think we re going to be conservative i really really believe that s the case today case in point the 12 projection is going to be we think plus or minus 15 this year so i think there s upside in that as far as progress on the affo goal this year we ll think would be around 207 million plus or minus 260 is our goal keep in mind that two of the drivers that we spoke about lease up of development and refinancing higher cost debt the impact of that is going to be more in 2022 2023 so i would say we re definitely on track and i would say there s going to be some upside in investor day on growth in rental rates due to new and renewal leasing bill crow raymond james analyst perfect thanks for the color operator your next question is from mike mueller of jpmorgan mike mueller jpmorgan analyst yes hi just a couple of quick ones here the three fourth quarter development starts are they all expected to be completed in 2022 peter e baccile president and chief executive officer yes scott musil chief financial officer yes mike mueller jpmorgan analyst yes okay so it looks like you re going to have quite a bit of deliveries in 2022 if we re thinking out the next few years beyond that should we think of 2022 as being this anomaly on the big side or do you think you can kind of replicate deliveries or something close to that peter e baccile president and chief executive officer we should see yes okay so the run rate if you will has been truncated or changed because we all stopped new projects last year for many months and so you do see this phenomenon where we have a lot of starts and a lot of completions kind of delivering on once over time you ought to see completions or deliveries that are more consistent as we earn into the new development volumes over time is that mike mueller jpmorgan analyst yes yes i think you kind of answered it without putting numbers out there that was it thank you peter e baccile president and chief executive officer okay operator your next question is from caitlin burrows of goldman sachs caitlin burrows goldman sachs analyst hi good morning just one i think earlier you mentioned when somebody asked about dispositions that you weren t looking to sell real estate to fund development so i was just wondering as you think about that development activity going forward is it that you just fund it with retained cash and then incremental equity were needed or how are you thinking about that piece peter e baccile president and chief executive officer what i was really saying is that our decisions to sell particular assets or groups of assets or volume relate only to maximizing the value of that decision and not to how we fund our development pipeline it will be the case that as we execute sales going forward we have the added benefit of using those proceeds to fund development but we don t sit here and say oh we better go sell 500 million because we have a huge development pipeline because when you do that you might tend to take lower prices than you should just to raise the proceeds caitlin burrows goldman sachs analyst that makes sense so i guess would it be reasonable to assume i know you mentioned in the beginning that equity issue assumed in your 2021 guidance going forward but that going forward equity will be one of the options for how you end up funding development peter e baccile president and chief executive officer certainly based on the volumes that we re looking at today that will be one of the options on the table caitlin burrows goldman sachs analyst great that s all thanks operator your final question is from tayo okusanya of credit suisse tayo okusanya credit suisse analyst yes good morning everyone great solid quarter questions still around the supply chain issues again still not 100 clear to me exactly how that s impacting the demand curve for industrial real estate i mean it sounds like a lot of the occupancy increases you guys have seen has really been driven by not a lot of development in the past year or so and still pretty good demand and maybe to an extent there s some formal out there from all these companies saying i need space because everyone is running out is that really the way we should kind of think about it versus the whole kind of collapse of the supply chain actually did is causing some type of increased demand that probably could still be around until supply chain issues are fixed johannson yap chief investment officer so i guess for me the simplest way to think about it is that companies do try to best try to operate in just in time meaning they get the product and they have an order they ship the product to minimize warehouse inventory because warehouse inventory has capital carrying costs and today they can t operate that way so everybody is operating in a just in case why just in case and basically they don t know when the product is coming and they re not sure the product is coming and in some they don t know what cost is coming so they rather front load and order more because also remember due to the increased demand the inventory to sales ratio has dropped so now they re just trying to go back to inventory they call now just in case to basically increase their inventory and on the simplest impact that requires more space when you re carrying more inventory so that is by the way the simplest way of looking at what s happening in the industry in the us today and that s creating demand for more warehouse space peter schultz executive vice president i d add to jojo s point though we re seeing a lot of demand not only for just in case but just net growth across a variety of industries around the country demand is really good particularly from the larger companies in food and beverage and the transportation and logistics field as we said earlier consumer product companies traditional retailers they re all growing in addition to trying to increase their inventories as jojo said tayo okusanya credit suisse analyst got you i mean i guess that s helpful it s just again a lot of companies just kind of even still saying they don t have inventory at all so it s just interesting to me i just kind of wonder sometimes if this whole issue is kind of overblown in the space and it s kind of many other things that are really driving the increase in demand not necessarily this one factor peter e baccile president and chief executive officer the primary as i mentioned earlier the primary driver is just good solid demand the consumption that is happening in this country is higher than it s ever been largely due to covid household savings are the highest they ve been household debt levels are low and so you ve got all the right fundamentals for people to go out and of course try to celebrate life after a year off but also they have the capital to do it so that s what you re seeing it s flat out strong demand and all of the wrinkles in the supply chain have a lot to do with that exploding demand when we aren t fully back to work in a lot of these delivery chains johannson yap chief investment officer also just to finish up with what peter said we expect our customers were fairly capitalized and really well yield in the industry because we ve got very good customers we expect them to be marginally more competitive with the small users in getting supplied because they ve got capital spend they ve got big relationships and you will notice that the larger suppliers out there are getting you good to give example amazon if you order from amazon today you ll probably get it quicker than from a small shipment company so i mean having good customers and tenants like ours is boding well in the industry today peter e baccile president and chief executive officer as far as you re concerned as whether people have inventory or not we can tell you just from our portfolio that all of our spaces are fully being utilized tayo okusanya credit suisse analyst got you that s helpful thank you operator there are no other questions in queue i d like to turn the call back over to peter baccile for any closing comments peter e baccile president and chief executive officer thank you operator and thank you all for joining us today as always please feel free to reach out to me

d like to turn it over to mark mark w begor chief executive officer thanks dorian and good morning we had a very strong third quarter and first nine months of 2021 a continuation of our strong outperformance last year with record revenue in the quarter of 1 223 billion which was up over 14 with core non mortgage market and non uc erc claims revenue growth of 20 we are executing extremely well against the critical priorities of our efx2023 strategy as we highlighted on slide 4 our focus on leveraging the new equifax cloud for innovation new products and growth is clearly driving our strong financial results our revenue growth has accelerated from 3 in 2019 as we were recovering from the 2017 cyber event and investing heavily in our efx cloud transformation to 17 last year we are on track to deliver 19 core growth this year at the midpoint of our revised 2021 guidance more importantly our core growth which excludes the impact of the mortgage market unemployment claims and erc related revenues is expected to accelerate to 21 this year a powerful figure that reflects the strength of our underlying business model and efx2023 growth strategy not only is our core growth accelerating above historical levels during 2021 in challenging covid markets and more recently in a declining mortgage market we are also expanding efx beyond our traditional credit deal routes to a more diverse data analytics and technology company with our investments in the equifax cloud new data assets and npis along with reinvesting our outperformance in bolt on m a in areas such as talent government and id and fraud we are quickly pivoting from building the equifax cloud to leveraging it for innovation new products that will position the new equifax for stronger and more diversified growth in the future our efx2023 growth strategy remains our compass for the future and drives all of our top and bottom line growth initiatives as we move toward 2022 and beyond turning to slide 5 equifax had a very strong quarter revenue at 1 22 billion was up 14 5 with organic constant currency growth of a strong 12 the almost 15 topline growth was off a strong 19 growth last year in a much stronger mortgage market this was our seventh consecutive quarter of double digit revenue growth more importantly our core growth was up a strong 20 our u s b2b businesses of workforce solutions and usis which together represent almost 75 of equifax revenue again drove our growth delivering 17 revenue growth despite the 21 decline in the u s mortgage market in the quarter non mortgage revenue was up over 30 and organic non mortgage revenue was up 24 strengthening sequentially from the 16 and 20 we saw in the first two quarters of the year third quarter equifax adjusted ebitda totaled 404 million up slightly from third quarter last year with margins of 33 as expected margins were down versus 2020 due to the inclusion of cloud technology transformation costs of 45 million in our adjusted results in the quarter which were excluded last year and redundant cloud transformation systems cost of 15 million these costs related to cloud tech transformation negatively impacted ebitda margins by almost 500 basis points adjusted eps of 1 85 a share was down slightly from last year adjusting for the cloud transformation costs of 45 million or 0 27 a share adjusted eps would have been up a strong 11 we continue to make significant progress executing the efx cloud data and technology transformation in the quarter we completed 4 000 b2b customer migrations for a total of 15 400 migrations completed so far this year in september alone usis completed over 900 customer migrations since the beginning of the transformation we ve completed almost 97 000 b2b migrations 3 5 million consumer migrations and 1 million data contributor migrations we remain on track and confident in our plan we continue to expect the north american transformation to be principally complete in early 2022 with the remaining customer migrations broadly completing by the end of next year international transformation will follow being principally completed by the end of 2023 with some customer migrations continuing into 2024 we re still in the early days of leveraging the cloud but remain confident that will differentiate us commercially expand our npi capabilities accelerate our topline and expand our margins and the growth in cost savings in 2022 and beyond our npi performance also continues to accelerate in the quarter we released 30 new products and we still expect our vitality index to accelerate from 5 last year to over 8 in 2021 given our very strong third quarter performance we are increasing our full year revenue guidance by approximately 320 basis points or 131 million at the midpoint of a range between 4 9 billion to 4 921 billion up 19 from last year and increasing our full year adjusted eps guidance by 0 22 per share to a midpoint of 7 57 per share which adjusting for technology transformation cost implies a 23 growth in eps this includes our expectation that the u s mortgage market as measured by credit inquiries will decline just over 7 this year with the bulk of the return to normalization in the second half which we expect to be down around 20 roughly two thirds of the 320 basis point increase in our revenue growth framework to 19 is from organic business performance with the balance from the acquisition of appriss health e fx and teletrack which we expect to add about 45 million to revenue in the fourth quarter in the third quarter equifax core revenue growth the green sections of the bars on slide 6 grew a very strong 20 a third consecutive quarter of core growth at or above 20 non mortgage growth in ews and usis and growth in international drove about 900 basis points to core revenue growth excluding acquisitions and fx with mortgage outperformance primarily in workforce solutions driving about 800 basis points of organic core growth in the quarter as we move through 22 and 23 we expect to continue to see strong and balanced core growth reflecting the benefits of the new efx cloud accelerated npis continued strong non mortgage growth both from organic growth and acquisitions as well as continued strong outperformance from workforce solutions turning to slide 7 workforce solutions had another exceptional quarter delivering revenue of 508 million which was up 35 this is the first quarter workforce solutions has delivered over 0 5 billion of revenue in a single quarter a big milestone this was against a very strong 57 growth last year adjusted ebitda margins were up were 54 non mortgage revenue at workforce solutions was up over 48 with organic non mortgage revenue up 41 the strength of workforce solutions and uniqueness of their twin income and employment data set was clear again in the third quarter workforce s verification services revenue of 403 million was up a strong 34 verification services mortgage revenue grew 22 in the quarter despite the 21 decline in the mortgage market with the ews outperformance driven by increased records penetration and new products importantly verification services non mortgage revenue was up 55 in the quarter consistent with the very strong growth we saw last quarter our government vertical which provides solutions to federal and state governments in support of assistance programs including food and rental support grew over 20 in the quarter government remains one of our largest non mortgage segments with attractive growth potential in the future and represents about one third of non mortgage verification revenue our new ssa contract went live this quarter at relatively low start up volumes and we expect to see it ramp as we move through 2022 we expect new products the addition of appriss and expanded federal and state social services to fuel growth in our government vertical in the future talent solutions which provides income employment verifications as well as other information for the hiring and onboarding processes through our ews data hub had another outstanding quarter from customer expansion and npis growing over 100 talent solutions now represents almost 30 of non mortgage verification revenue as you know over 75 million people change jobs in the u s annually with the vast majority having some level of screening as a part of the hiring process the addition of appriss insights and our new partnership with the national student clearinghouse will fuel growth and new products in this important vertical the non mortgage consumer lending business principally in banking and auto showed strong growth as well of about 90 in the quarter both from deepening penetration with lenders and from some recovery in these markets although auto has been impacted by inventory shortages employer services revenue of 105 million was up 30 million in the quarter this is an important growth engine for workforce solutions that also delivers records combined our unemployment claims and employee retention credit businesses had revenue of about 65 million up about 14 million from last year substantial declines in the uc revenue in the quarter were more than offset by erc which grew substantially sequentially as we support the businesses in obtaining federal employee retention credit payments employer services non uc and erc businesses had revenue of about 40 million up 60 with organic growth of about 35 our i 9 business driven by our new i 9 anywhere product continue to show very strong growth up about 80 our i 9 business is now almost half of employer services non uc and erc revenue reflecting the growth in i 9 and the return to growth of workforce analytics we expect employer services non uc and erc businesses to deliver total growth of about 40 and organic growth of about 25 in the year reflecting the uniqueness between data strong verify our revenue and operating leverage resulted an adjusted workforce solutions ebitda margins of 54 3 the decline versus last year is driven protect driven by investments in the tech transformation as well as redundant systems cost and as well as significant investments in data onboarding sales and marketing to continue to drive workforce solutions growth rudy floater and the workforce solutions team delivered another outstanding quarter and are positioned to deliver a very strong 2021 2022 and beyond turning now to usis their revenue of 380 million was up slightly from last year total usis mortgage revenue of 148 million was down 17 while mortgage credit inquiries were down 21 slightly better than the down 23 we expected in july usis out performance versus the overall market was driven by growth in marketing and debt monitoring products importantly non mortgage revenue of 240 million grew almost 8 sorry 16 with organic growth of over 9 year to date non mortgage revenue was up a strong 17 and organic non mortgage revenue growth is over 10 banking insurance commercial and direct to consumer were all up over 10 in the quarter fraud was up almost 10 organically and up over 75 in total with the inclusion of our kount acquisition auto was up mid single digits despite supply pressures and telco was down just over 5 financial marketing services revenue which is broadly speaking our off line or batch business was 55 million in the quarter and up about 20 the strong performance was driven by marketing related which was up over 20 and id and fraud revenue which grew over 15 in 2021 marketing related revenue is expected to represent about 40 of fms revenue identity and fraud above 20 and risk decisioning about 35 the usis sales team delivered record wins up over 20 versus last year and 40 sequentially in the quarter the new deal pipeline in usis remains very strong during the quarter usis acquired teletrack a u s leader in alternative credit data teletrack is being consolidated with datax our specialty finance credit reporting agency that we acquired in 2018 to expand our capabilities in the fast growing alternative data space serving unbanked and underbanked u s consumers the usis adjusted ebitda margins were 40 in the quarter flat sequentially with second quarter similar to second quarter the decline in margins in the quarter versus last year was due to both costs related to cloud transformation which include the cost of redundant systems and inclusion of our adjusted results of the technology transformation costs which are being excluded in 2020 and the expansion of our investments in sales and marketing as well as new products to leverage both the strengthening u s market and accelerate new product introductions to drive revenue growth in 22 and beyond turning to international the revenue of 245 million was up 10 on a local currency basis and up 100 basis points sequentially this was the fourth consecutive quarter of growth in our global markets following the covid pandemic impacts asia pacific which is principally our australia business performed well in the quarter with revenue of 89 million up about 7 in local currency australia delivered this growth despite the extended covid lockdowns in many portions of that country australia consumer revenue continued to recover up 3 versus last year and about flat sequentially our commercial businesses combined online and off line revenue was up 8 in the quarter fraud and identity was up 13 following 22 growth in the first half european revenues of 68 million were up 9 in local currency in the quarter and flat sequentially our european credit reporting business was up about 5 with continued growth in both the u k and spain our european debt management business revenue increased by about 21 in local currency off the lows we saw last year during the covid recession canada delivered revenue of 44 million in the quarter up over 8 in local currency despite a weakening canadian mortgage market that was down 15 canada experienced strong growth in fintech while supply issues continue to impact our auto business latin american revenues of 45 million grew 16 in the quarter in local currency which was the third consecutive quarter of growth coming out of covid we continue to see the benefit in latam of the strong new product introductions introduced over the past three years international adjusted ebitda margins at 26 7 were down slightly from 27 3 in the second quarter the sequential decline was driven by incremental technology costs in australia and canada as they accelerate their cloud transformation programs the decline in the quarter was principally due to costs related to the cloud transformation both the cost of redundant systems and inclusion in our adjusted results of the technology transformation costs which we excluded last year margins were negatively impacted the quarter by also negatively impacted the quarter by our increased investments in sales and marketing and new products global consumer solutions revenue of 82 million was down 6 on a reported basis and 7 on a local currency basis in the quarter slightly above our expectations we saw growth of about 2 in our global consumer direct business which sells directly to consumers through equifax com and represents a little over half of gcs revenue the decline in gcs revenue in the quarter was again driven by our u s lead gen partner business we expect the gcs partner business and gcs business overall to return to growth in the fourth quarter gcs adjusted ebitda margins of 23 4 were up sequentially reflecting lower operating costs the decline versus last year was principally driven by revenue declines turning now to slide 8 workforce solutions continues to power equifax as clearly our strongest fastest growing and most valuable business with strong 35 growth in the quarter up 57 growth a year ago core revenue growth was 42 driven by the uniqueness of the twin income and employment data scale of the twin database and consistent execution by rudy and his team ews s ability to consistently and substantially outgrow their underlying markets is driven by three factors first growing the work number database at the end of the third quarter twn reached 125 million active records an increase of 12 or 13 million records from a year ago and included 97 million unique records at 97 million uniques we now have over 60 of non farm payroll which makes our twn data set more valuable to our customers with higher hit rates we are now receiving records every pay period from 1 9 million companies up from 1 million when we started the year and 27 000 contributors a short two years ago the exclusive agreement with a major payroll processor that we announced on our february call went live in the third quarter and contributed to this growth our strong momentum continues as we signed another large payroll processor last week on an exclusive basis that will come online in the coming months we also expect to add further payroll processors in the coming months as a reminder almost 60 of our records are contributed directly by employers to which ews provides comprehensive employer services like uc claims w 2 management i 9 wotc erc hsa and other hr and compliance solutions our acquisitions of hiretech i2verify and health e fx this year strengthened our ability to deliver these unique hr services particularly through relationships with payroll processors and hr software companies these partnerships have been built up over the past decade by the workforce solutions team the remaining 40 of our records are contributed through partnerships with payroll providers and hr software companies most of which are exclusive we still have substantial room to grow our income and employment database and expect to continue to add new data contributors as well as reach agreements with several additional payroll processors in the fourth quarter to add their records on an exclusive basis to twn in 2022 beyond the over 50 million non farm payroll records not yet in the twn database we re focused on data records from the 40 million to 50 million gig workers and around 30 million pension recipients in the u s marketplace to further broaden the twn database we have plenty of room to grow twn second increasing our average revenue transactions average revenue per transaction through new products and pricing our existing products to value recognizing the depth of information twn allows us to deliver to customers workforce solutions new product pipeline is rapidly expanding as our teams leverage the power of our new equifax cloud capabilities and third by increasing our penetration in the markets we serve and expanding into new markets for example we continue to increase our penetration in the mortgage market at the end of 2020 workforce solutions received an inquiry in almost 60 of completed mortgages up from 55 in 2019 this 500 basis point increase is a big step forward but we still have plenty of runways to expand the customers using twn mortgage we re also seeing substantial growth in twn in other credit markets including card and auto as these verticals take advantage of the unique lift from twn income and employment data in the 16 hit rates with our database growing system to system integrations is another key lever in driving both increased penetration and increasing the number of pulls per transaction during the quarter about 75 of twn mortgage transactions were fulfilled system to system up over 2x from 32 in 2019 and again we still have plenty of growth potential here workforce solutions is performing exceptionally well with attractive above market and above equifax growth rates and margins that we expect to continue in the future slide 9 highlights the core growth performance of our u s b2b mortgage businesses workforce solutions and usis our combined u s b2b businesses delivered 3 revenue growth in mortgage in the third quarter outperforming the mortgage market by 24 basis points with the market down 21 this strong performance outperformance was again driven by workforce solutions with core mortgage growth of 43 enabled by the multiple drivers that i just discussed slide 10 provides an update on new product innovation leveraging the equifax cloud and our differentiated data a key driver of our current and future growth in the quarter we delivered 30 new products with 150 new products in the market so far this year which is up 18 from the 96 we delivered in the same time frame last year we continue to expect our 2021 vitality index defined as a percent of revenue delivered from npis launched in the past three years to be over 8 in the third quarter we launched significant new products we expect to continue to drive growth in 22 and beyond the ssa payroll exchange that went live as ews product that supports verifications of ssi and ssdi social services delivering critical income and employment status based on program requirements one view with datax is a new integrated consumer credit report that redefines how we deliver display and provide insights to our customers it also sets the stage for integrating nontraditional credit data in a single view solution for our customers alternative data from datax teletrack nc rental payments and other sources are a critical priority for equifax and we expect to continue to drive npis in this space in the future digital identity trust 2 0 product provides businesses with a comprehensive passive identity verification services that delivers a trust do not trust recommendation across both physical and digital identity vectors this product will leverage kount data by year end marketmix premier solution enables the ability for fis to access market share and size of liquidity across geographics this provides quick identification of targeted growth markets to deploy spend across branch sales and marketing efforts and lastly the new equifax affordability product in australia uses bank transaction data and sophisticated categorization to provide an affordability view to customers while removing friction for the consumer we re clearly focused on leveraging our new equifax cloud capabilities to drive our npi rollouts and new product revenue in 21 and beyond growing npi is central to our efx2023 growth strategy as detailed on slide 11 and 2021 we reinvest our strong outperformance in strategic and accretive bolt on acquisitions that strengthen our position in existing growth markets and allow us to enter new markets with new capabilities our 2021 acquisitions add 300 million plus synergies to our run rate revenue we are focused on executing acquisitions that are accretive to our long term revenue growth and margins and deliver attractive shareholder returns our priorities for m a are clear and aligned around number one expanding our differentiated data which is at the core equifax we have scale and unique data sets that we want to expand and leverage with new data elements to drive enhanced decisioning for our customers all of our acquisitions deliver new and differentiated data and more data drive better decisions second expanding and widening our largest and fastest growing business workforce solutions is a priority for our m a the appriss insights hiretech health e fx and iq verify acquisitions strengthen workforce and position ews for future outperformance and last broadening our id and fraud capabilities in the fast growing digital and e commerce space is another m a priority kount strongly advanced our capabilities in this fast growing space we closed the appriss acquisition on october 1st and are focused on integration new solutions and growth appriss insights and our new partnership with the national student clearinghouse are a big step forward in our strategy to build out an ews data hub centered off our almost 500 million historical twn data records to address the fast growing talent and government markets as detailed on slide 12 combining our scale twn data with appriss insights criminal and healthcare credentialing and sections data along with other partner data assets including the exclusive partnership for college and university data we entered into in the third quarter with the national student clearinghouse allows workforce solutions to deliver the most complete realtime 360 degree view of the prospective employee or applicant for government benefits available in the market the talent solutions and government verticals offer large and growing markets for our workforce solutions business through the ews data hub we estimate an addressable market of 5 billion in the u s hiring space and onboarding process with around 75 million new employees onboarded annually in the u s workforce solutions government vertical is focused on delivering data and solutions to support federal and state benefit programs as well as law enforcement agencies this is a substantial and growing sector that we estimate to have an addressable market of about 2 billion appriss insights strongly accelerates our ability to penetrate these large and fast growing twns insights is anticipated to generate 150 million of run rate revenue during 2021 and to grow on a stand alone basis at over 15 annually we also anticipate building toward approximately 75 million in revenue synergies by 2025 leveraging the efx cloud to integrate appriss insight s rich people based risk intelligence data in the aws data hub to form a new multi data solutions and through cross selling efforts acquiring appriss insights and partnering with the national student clearinghouse provide strong pillars for workforce solutions growth and fast growing markets going forward slide 13 highlights our focus on adding alternative data to our database focused on the 60 million un or underbanked population in the united states according to our federal reserve study 6 of u s adults do not have a checking savings or money market account although two fifth use some form of alternative financial service moreover 16 of adults have a bank account but also use an alternative financial service product generally at much higher costs providing services that help bring these underserved populations into the financial mainstream is core to our purpose of helping people live their financial best and is an important priority for our customers our acquisition of teletrack in september which we are combining with our datax business creates a leading u s specialty consumer reporting agency with data on more than 80 million in file unbanked and underbanked and credit rebuilding consumers our national consumer telecom and utilities exchange partnership is another unique data set focused on this space that has more than 420 million records and 250 million consumers helping our customers to expand underwriting to no hit or thin file customers we are focused on expanding our unique alternative data from sources including specialty finance companies alternative lenders telco companies cable and satellite tv providers municipalities and utilities to drive growth in the fast growing alternative data markets and we ll continue to look for opportunities to strengthen our alternative databases through partnerships and m a and now i d like to turn it over to john to discuss our outlook for the rest of the year our increase in guidance for 2021 as well as our share our early read on 2022 assumptions and our financial framework for 2022 john w gamble jr corporate vice president chief financial officer thanks mark as mark discussed our 3q results were very strong and much stronger than we discussed with you in july with revenue about 50 million higher than the midpoint of the expectation we shared for perspective the strength was driven by our u s b2b businesses principally workforce solutions and also usis workforce solutions verification services was stronger than discussed in july principally in non mortgage and talent solutions card and auto as well as to a lesser extent in mortgage workforce solutions employee retention credit and unemployment claims revenue was stronger than we discussed in july we expect the strength in erc to continue in the fourth quarter usis was also somewhat stronger than we discussed in july the strength in mortgage relative to our discussion in july was partially a reflection of the mortgage market being down 21 versus the down 23 we discussed in july workforce solutions outperformance relative to the mortgage market was also stronger than we expected this strong revenue drove upside in adjusted eps relative to the expectations that we shared in july before discussing our increased guidance for 2021 and providing a framework for you to consider for 2022 let s briefly discuss our assumptions for the u s mortgage market as shown on slide 14 we are expecting the 21 year to year decline in u s mortgage credit inquiries that we saw in the third quarter to continue in the fourth quarter with the fourth quarter down about 20 this results in 2021 u s mortgage market credit inquiries being down just over 7 from 2020 slightly better than the down somewhat under 8 we discussed with you in july for 2022 based on trends we are seeing in new purchase and refinance that i will discuss shortly our 2022 framework assumes the u s mortgage market as measured by total credit market inquiries will decline about 15 from 2021 the 15 decline versus 2021 is most substantial in the first half of 2022 given the significant slowing we have seen in the u s mortgage market already in the second half of 21 our assumed level of 2022 u s mortgage market credit inquiries remains over 10 above the average levels we saw over the 2015 to 19 period the left side of slide 15 provides perspective on the number of homes that would benefit by 75 basis points or more from refinancing their mortgage at current rates despite the substantial refinancing activity that s occurred over the past year and current increases in us treasuries the number of u s mortgages that could benefit from a refinancing remains at a relatively strong level of about 12 million home prices have appreciated significantly over the past 18 months which has provided many homeowners with cash up refinancing opportunities which in past cycles has led to increased refinancing activity from borrowers for perspective based upon our most recent data in april mortgage refinancings remain at just under 1 million a month as shown on the right side of slide 15 the pace of existing home purchases continues at historically very high levels this strong new purchase market is expected to continue throughout 21 and 22 our 2022 assumption for our u s mortgage credit inquiries assumes that we see purchase mortgage financings at levels above the levels we saw in 2020 with refinancings declining significantly from the levels we saw in both 2020 and 2021 slide 16 provides our guidance for 4q 21 we expect revenue in the range of 1 23 billion to 1 25 billion reflecting revenue growth of about 10 to 11 8 including a 0 1 benefit from fx acquisitions are expected to positively impact revenue by 5 4 we re expecting adjusted eps in 4q 2021 to be 1 72 to 1 82 per share compared to 4q 2020 adjusted eps of 2 per share in 4q 2021 technology transformation costs are expected to be around 45 million or 0 27 per share excluding these costs which were excluded from 4q 2020 adjusted eps 4q 2021 adjusted eps would be 1 99 to 2 09 per share slide 17 provides the specifics on our 2021 full year guidance we are increasing guidance substantially reflecting our very strong 3q 2021 performance the acquisitions of appriss health e fx and teletrack are expected to add about 45 million of revenue in the quarter 2021 revenue of between 4 901 billion and 4 921 billion reflects growth of about 18 7 to 19 2 versus 2020 including a 1 4 benefit from fx acquisitions are expected to positively impact revenue by about 3 1 aws is expected to deliver over 38 revenue growth with continued very strong growth in verification services usis revenue is expected to be up mid to high single digits driven by growth in non mortgage combined ews and usis mortgage revenue is expected to be up over 18 in 2021 about 25 percentage points stronger than the overall market decline of just over 7 international revenue is expected to deliver constant currency growth of about 10 and gcs revenue is expected to be down mid single digits in 2021 gcs revenue is expected to be up over 5 in the fourth quarter as a reminder in 2021 equifax is including all cloud technology transformation costs and adjusted operating income adjusted ebitda and adjusted eps these onetime costs were excluded from adjusted operating income adjusted ebitda and adjusted eps in 2017 through 2020 in 2021 equifax expects to incur onetime cloud technology transformation costs of approximately 165 million a reduction of over 50 from the 358 million incurred in 2020 the inclusion in 2021 of these onetime costs would reduce adjusted eps by about 1 01 per share 2021 adjusted eps of 7 52 to 7 62 per share which includes these tech transformation costs is up 7 8 to 9 3 from 2020 excluding the impact of tech transformation cost of 1 01 per share adjusted eps in 2021 would show growth of about 22 to 24 versus 2020 2021 is also negatively impacted by redundant system costs of about 80 million relative to 2020 these redundant system costs are expected to negatively impact adjusted eps by approximately 0 50 per share and negatively impact adjusted eps growth by about seven percentage points in 2021 we remain confident in our cloud transformation plan and the savings in 2022 and beyond that we have discussed previously with you now let s turn to a discussion of an early framework for 2022 slide 18 provides the macro assumptions behind our 2022 framework given the continued significant uncertainties in the overall u s and global economy as well as in the u s mortgage market we wanted to provide you with the assumptions we ve been using at this stage in developing our framework for 2022 as i discussed previously we expect the u s mortgage market our proxy for which is u s mortgage credit inquiries to decline about 15 in 2022 relative to 2021 equifax s u s b2b mortgage revenue is expected to continue to significantly outperform the overall mortgage market and show growth in 2022 relative to 2021 our overall framework is based on a continued u s economic recovery that is 2022 gdp growth of about 4 for the full year we expect our usis and workforce solutions non mortgage businesses to outperform their underlying markets we expect workforce solutions uc and erc businesses to decline by almost 30 in 2022 we also expect that international economies will continue to recover in 2022 our international businesses are also expected to outperform their underlying markets slide 19 provides a view of equifax total and core revenue growth from 2017 through 2022 through the 2022 framework in 4q 2021 equifax core revenue growth is expected to be a strong 17 with core organic revenue growth of about 12 almost two thirds of that core organic growth is driven by non mortgage growth across all four bus in 2022 based on the assumptions i just shared equifax total revenue is expected to be up about 8 we anticipate delivering strong core revenue growth of 14 reflecting organic growth of 11 organic core growth of 11 and a 3 benefit from acquisitions completed in 2021 which will more than offset the significant headwinds from the assumed declines in the u s mortgage market and the uc and erc businesses slide 20 provides a revenue walk detailing the drivers of the 8 revenue growth in 2022 from the midpoint of our 2021 revenue guidance to the midpoint of our 2022 revenue framework 2022 revenue of 5 3 billion the 15 decline in the u s mortgage market and the expected declines in the workforce solutions unemployment claims and erc businesses are expected to negatively impact revenue in 2022 by 5 75 percentage points core organic revenue growth is anticipated to be over 11 non mortgage core organic growth is expected to drive about two thirds of the growth the largest contributor is workforce solutions with strong organic growth in talent solutions government and employee boarding solutions including i 9 usis non mortgage international and gcs are also expected to drive core growth mortgage revenue outperformance relative to the overall mortgage market is expected to drive the remaining about one third of the organic core growth this is driven by strong outperformance in workforce solutions the acquisitions completed in 2021 are expected to contribute about three percentage points of growth to 2022 slide 21 provides an adjusted eps walk detailing the drivers of the expected 14 growth from the midpoint of the 2021 guidance of 7 57 per share to the midpoint of our 2022 framework of 8 65 per share revenue growth of 8 at our 2021 ebitda margins of about 33 8 would deliver 11 growth in adjusted eps in 2022 we expect to deliver ebitda margin expansion of about 200 basis points this margin expansion is expected to drive 9 growth in adjusted eps this margin expansion is expected to be delivered by the actions we have discussed with you throughout 2021 our transformation investments will be reduced by about 100 million in 2022 with about half of this reduction or about 50 million being reinvested in new product and other development we will begin to see net cloud cost savings in 2022 defined as the savings from improving production costs driven by the decommissioning of our legacy on prem systems and other improvements in our operations exceeding the cost of running our new cloud native systems margins will also be enhanced by leverage on corporate and g a partly offsetting these benefits to ebitda are cost increases particularly in salaries and contracted services as the tight labor market drives cost higher as well as lower ebitda margins in 2022 from the 2021 acquisitions as we will just be ramping synergies during 2022 depreciation and amortization is expected to increase by about 45 million in 2022 which will negatively impact adjusted eps by about 4 d a is increasing in 2022 as we accelerate putting cloud native systems into production the combined increase in interest expense and tax expense in 2022 is expected to negatively impact adjusted eps by about two percentage points the increase in interest expense reflects the increased debt from our 2021 acquisitions our estimated tax rate used in this framework of 24 5 does not assume any changes in the u s federal tax rate should that occur we will let you know the estimated impact on our 2022 results as there remains significant uncertainty in underlying market drivers including the pace of normalization of the u s mortgage market and the pace of economic growth worldwide what we provided today for 2022 is a framework for you to consider we will provide formal guidance for 2022 in connection with our 4q 2021 earnings release early next year now i would like to turn it back over to mark mark w begor chief executive officer thanks john we hope this early view of our framework for 2022 is helpful and reinforces the power of the new equifax to deliver 14 growth and 8 total growth at the midpoint of our range of thinking assuming the mortgage market and uc and erc declines impact our revenue growth by almost 6 in 2022 stepping back and reviewing the macro trends outlined on slide 22 these macros have been driving information services for the last decade over the last 24 months we believe most of the macro factors have substantially accelerated and through our 2021 acquisitions of appriss kount and teletrack and our efx cloud investments advantage equifax to benefit from these macro trends we believe we also have unique levers at equifax to deliver strong future growth including workforce solutions above market and efx growth and margins and our expanded focus on new data assets like appriss insights the usis recovery and non mortgage growth and kount id and fraud growth the new equifax cloud which is driving our competitiveness npis topline and cost savings and npi leveraging equifax cloud and our expanded resources and focus on new products and then of course m a to broaden strength in equifax these attractive market macros along with broad equifax growth levers and our strong core outperformance in the past few years give us the confidence in our ability to deliver above market growth in the future wrapping up on slide 23 equifax delivered another strong and broad based quarter we had strong momentum as we move into the fourth quarter to 2022 we now delivered seven consecutive quarters of strong above market double digit growth reflecting the power of the new equifax business model and our execution against our efx2023 strategic priorities equifax is on offense we remain confident in our outlook for 2021 and raised our full year midpoint revenue growth rate by approximately 300 basis points to 19 growth for the year and we also raised our midpoint eps by 0 22 to 7 57 per year workforce solutions had another outstanding quarter following our results delivering 35 revenue growth and 54 ebitda margins ews is our largest fastest growing and most valuable business and rudy and his team remain focused on delivering outsized growth usis also delivered a strong quarter with 16 non mortgage growth and 9 organic non mortgage growth offsetting the impact of sharp over 20 decline in the mortgage market sid saying his usis team remains competitive and are winning in the marketplace international grew for the fourth consecutive quarter with 10 growth in local currency as economies reopen and business activity resumes outside the united states we have high expectations for international as we move into 2022 we spent the past three years building the equifax cloud and are now in the early days of leveraging the new and uniquely equifax cloud capabilities as we move into 22 and beyond we will increasingly realize the topline cost and cash benefits from these new only equifax cloud capabilities as i mentioned earlier our 2021 m a has added 300 million of run rate revenue to equifax reinvesting our strong cash flow in accretive and strategic bolt on m a is central to our efx2023 growth strategy we re now focused on integrating these acquisitions and executing our synergy and growth plans in order to leverage our new data products and capabilities our early look at a 2022 financial framework calls for 8 revenue growth and adjusted eps growth of 14 assuming a 15 decline in the mortgage market more importantly the framework includes strong 14 efx growth core efx growth 2022 will be a pivotal year for equifax as we shift toward leveraging the equifax cloud for innovation new products and growth and lastly turning to slide 24 many of you have been closely following equifax for many years and know we ve been speaking to you about for some time about our plan to have our first investor day which will be our first investor day since 2012 and the cyber event it s been a long time let me now turn it over to dorian who will give you the details on our november 10 meeting focused on the new equifax and then we ll take some questions dorian hare senior vice president of investor relations thanks mark i m energized to announce that our investor day will take place on november 10 at 8 30 am eastern time and will be held virtually we ve opened up online registration as of today and the link to do so on slide 24 is live we are very excited to have the opportunity to update you on the progress we have made in making and executing our efx2023 growth strategy share with you our long term financial framework and also our capital allocation plan speak with you about how we are and will continue to leverage our fx cloud capabilities including by continuing to accelerate our new product innovations and provide you with overviews of the state of affairs of our business units related by their respective leaders investor day will be an important day for our company and stakeholders and we look forward to speaking with you then with that operator let me open it up for questions questions and answers operator thank you we will now be conducting a question and answer session our first questions come from the line of david togut with evercore please proceed with your question david togut evercore analyst thank you good morning and i appreciate the helpful detail in the initial 2022 framework it appears that you re guiding above consensus for fourth quarter 2021 revenue and for 2022 revenue but somewhat below consensus on earnings per share for both the fourth quarter and for next year john you walked through some of the sources of pressure on margin for 2022 but i m wondering if you could talk more broadly about headwinds and tailwinds so we can understand the variance is it really the 50 million for example of tech transformation savings that you re reinvesting in the business next year john w gamble jr corporate vice president chief financial officer yes happy to so again as a reminder right we re talking about increasing ebitda margins by on the order of 200 basis points so a substantial increase in 2022 versus 2021 and i think the drivers are what we ve been talking about all year as i mentioned in my prepared remarks we are reducing substantially tech transformation costs but we are taking a significant amount of that in the order of 50 million and reinvesting it in nti and other initiatives to drive growth and to deliver the higher revenue growth you re talking about that you referenced in your question also we do expect now to start seeing benefits so net reductions in costs from ecoms exceeding our cloud costs and that will ramp as we go through 2022 and then but we are seeing some increased costs related to related in our cogs as you would normally expect related to increased costs for people and increased cost for some systems costs that are reducing 2021 ebitda margins to a degree that s not actually that unusual generally speaking generally speaking we see increased cost every year that we manage through high growth next year part of what s happening obviously right is we re seeing substantial negative impacts on our revenue from the weaker mortgage market as well as the reductions in ec sorry in the uc and erc markets so that negative drive in revenue is also somewhat negatively impacting our margin expansion but overall 200 basis points of margin expansion next year we think is really an outstanding performance especially given the fact that we re seeing such large declines in the mortgage market and then also the declines in the uc and erc revenue that we talked about on the order of 30 david togut evercore analyst thanks for that just as a quick follow up in your initial 2022 financial framework you re guiding to 11 3 core organic revenue growth within that number what is your expectation for ews organic growth and how do you think about headwinds and tailwinds for ews next year john w gamble jr corporate vice president chief financial officer yes so i think in terms of the details around how the bus are going to perform next year we re going to have to ask you to wait until november 10 but obviously we expect ews to continue to perform extremely well mark w begor chief executive officer you should obviously we ve been quite clear that we expect workforce solutions to grow above the rest of equifax so i think you should think about it that way in 2022 i went through we ve been through many many times the multiple levers that workforce for example has as they finish up the year and go into 2022 and records starts at the top of that list adding substantial records in the third quarter those become a benefit through the next year their new product introductions continued penetration there s a lot of levers in that business usis their new deal pipeline is a positive lever going forward but workforce is clearly going to be above that the rest of equifax for really as long as we can see in the future from a growth rate standpoint david togut evercore analyst understood thank you very much mark w begor chief executive officer thanks operator thank you our next questions come from the line of kevin mcveigh with credit suisse please proceed with your questions kevin mcveigh credit suisse analyst great thanks so much mark you talked about the vitality index up over 8 any sense of where you think that can go to i mean obviously there s been a really significant step up in the new product innovation and what that can mean to the organic growth longer term mark w begor chief executive officer it s clearly a priority kevin as you know since i joined almost four years ago and really in the last call it 24 months we ve really stepped up our focus on new products as you know we ve expanded the team john and i both talked about it in our comments this morning about continuing to invest there and of course the cloud transformation is central to that that s really we re going to get great benefits from the cloud around cost but we really did it to change our competitiveness and the big piece of that is the ability to bring new products to market that we couldn t do before through multi data solutions and that s really where our focus is and we re in the early days of really leveraging that so we see real opportunities going forward we ll certainly talk in depth in our investor day in a couple of weeks around our longer term outlook for new products but it s an area that we ve invested heavily foundationally in the cloud you add to that our existing differentiated data assets which we ve expanded substantially this year with the addition of new data solutions from appriss from kount from teletrack and then our focus on new products we believe it s an important lever for delivering strong future growth going forward and we ll give you much more detail during our investor day kevin mcveigh credit suisse analyst thank you so much and then just real quick on the customer migrations it seems like you made a lot of progress on that where are you in that process and then are you seeing any incremental step up in revenue as these customers have cut over like is there any way to think about what the revenue impact has been just i know it s a hard question but just like what percentage step up you re seeing as these customers have converted mark w begor chief executive officer yes first on the progress this is a big undertaking i think you know that we talk to you about it every quarter we try to be quite transparent about the efforts 2018 19 and parts of 20 were building the technology in 20 and 21 we ve been heavily focused on implementing that with our customers the migration you ve seen the great progress we still got more to do and we were clear that we expect north america which is canada u s and ews and usis and of course tcs to be substantially complete as we get in 2022 and really complete the migrations next year so we can see the finish line but there s still plenty of work to do in the coming months to complete that with regards to our impact commercially there s a number of layers on that and this is another area our intent is to go in substantial detail about how we think about that what we re seeing during our investor day we ll have our chief technology leader and product leader bryson koehler as well as the business unit leaders will talk about that but you re starting to see some of the early days of that in our view the strong core growth the ability to roll out new products are driving our competitiveness and driving our ability to drive our core growth and there s no question when we sit down with customers we believe we re advantaged having a new tech stack that s in the cloud that can deliver 9 9s of stability meaning very high always on stability deliver data more quickly to our customers we can deliver new products to them more quickly it just changes who we are as a company and it allows us to be a different company so it s quite central to how we think about the new equifax going forward and it will be central to our long term growth framework that we ll share with you in a couple of weeks kevin mcveigh credit suisse analyst makes sense thanks so much mark w begor chief executive officer thanks operator thank you our next questions come from the line of kyle peterson with needham company please proceed with your question kyle peterson needham company analyst hey good morning guys thanks for taking the questions just wanted to touch on the u s auto market i know there s been a lot of concerns over chip shortages and supply constraints potentially impacting auto credit thinking out it s been a little bit of a headwind to canada but what are you guys seeing in the u s particularly in the usis segment for auto credit mark w begor chief executive officer yes similar we could have and should have commented on that in the u s also there s no question that the supply shortages are impacting the ability for consumers to identify cars or get cars new and used and then of course the financing that comes with that and the business we get from that what s been offsetting that to some regard not fully but is our continued penetration of new products and new solutions like workforce solutions continuing to grow the use of twn data in the auto space has been a positive would you add anything john john w gamble jr corporate vice president chief financial officer no i d say that covers it and we re the good news is we re continuing to grow in usis and auto on an organic basis even in the headwinds of the difficult market but yes it certainly isn t at the pace that we expected when we started the year kyle peterson needham company analyst got it that s helpful and then i guess just a follow up on ews obviously good to see really strong record growth in twn and continued share gains moving forward how should we think about records growth i know you guys mentioned a few additional payroll processing partnerships in the pipeline but how should we think about records and kind of a greenfield between some of these alternative data sources like gig workers and pension versus traditional w 2 records that you guys are going to see as prospects mark w begor chief executive officer yes it s obviously an important focus of rudy and the workforce solutions team you ve seen continued success there and remember we ve got two really levers for growth first our employer services business which is large and comprehensive as we ve delivered new solutions to hr managers around i 9 or hsa or w 2 or wotc all the other services we access payroll records so that s a very powerful engine for us to go to individual companies to obtain records and of course we feel like we have some real momentum in adding the payroll processors that are not with us and going after the traditional nonfarm payroll there s still 60 million plus consumers or individuals that are available for us in the traditional nonfarm and we re chasing that so that s one and of course with records being up 12 in the quarter that is a very strong lever for growth that translates pretty directly into revenue because of higher hit rates as you point out there s also a larger universe the nonfarm payroll the 160 million 170 million that are in nonfarm payroll the gig workers as well as pension recipients those are two big areas there s 40 million to 50 million gig workers so we re working different strategies to obtain those records and then the same with pension recipients so there s a long runway from our roughly 60 of nonfarm payroll if you include self employed and gig in there it s much less than the 60 to continue to grow our records which is a very unique business growth lever for our business to continue to add new data assets because as you know in our system to system integrations in workforce solutions we re getting the inquiries we can only fulfill those that we have records on and as we grow our records they become monetized tomorrow afternoon so that s very powerful and the scale of workforce gives us the ability to have large dedicated teams both on the partnership side and on the direct side through employer services to continue to grow our records and we ll likely talk a little bit at investor day about our international expansion which as you know we re already in canada australia and india and those businesses are also growing their records leveraging the core tech stack that we have from workforce solutions in the u s but also relationships that we have either with multinationals or with payroll processors and of course growing those records locally so big big focus and big opportunity going forward when you think about records i think about us being in kind of middle innings still as far as the opportunity for workforce solutions and these take time the payroll processor we signed last week we were probably talking to them for three years it takes time to get organized around that but there s real momentum particularly in that area of acquisition because so many others have signed up with equifax and are having a positive experience we re seeing real momentum there in adding other processors kyle peterson needham company analyst got it that makes sense and it s really helpful color thanks guys operator thank you our next questions come from the line of george mihalos with cowen company please proceed with your questions mark w begor chief executive officer hey george george mihalos cowen company analyst good morning guys and appreciate you re willing to go out to 2022 in this environment very helpful as always i guess first question for me john if we can kind of circle back to the first question just as it relates around margins for 22 i think you had said previously savings from redundancies and obviously the tech transformation we re going to be about call it 150 million you re reinvesting 50 million of that now it sounds like so net 100 million that roughly by my math gets us to kind of the 36 margin at sort of the high end the 200 basis point increase is the reason why margins aren t expected to be higher than that that the natural margin expansion within the business is being offset by some dilution from m a and just sort of higher inflation related expenses as it relates to wages is that roughly the way to think about it john w gamble jr corporate vice president chief financial officer yes so george as i walked through in my comments right so you re absolutely right so we indicated we were going to we would improve our cost structure by on the order of 100 million by taking down transformation costs and then we also said we d improve our cost structure as we drove net savings right as decom and other cost reduction efforts drove us or exceeded cloud and so we absolutely have indicated we re going to deliver on those savings and we re still committed to delivering substantial savings in both of those areas in 2022 and beyond but you are correct also as i mentioned in my comments we re reinvesting a substantial portion of that 50 million in new development and new development related activities also if you think about what s going on given the fact that we re seeing a 600 basis point headwind like the natural growth that you d see in our underlying business that has the very high variable margins that s somewhat lower than you would see in a period in which mortgage is not as negative as you re talking about and you re correct right we re getting a nice bump from growth in acquisitions next year but the ebitda margins on those acquisitions in their first year is substantially lower than the contribution margin we get by growing our internal data assets so when you kind of line all that stuff up and you include the fact that we are seeing cost increases as we do every year right that s certainly something we see every year but there is a tighter labor market so there s an expectation that some of those cost increases will be greater when you line all those items up you end up at about a 200 basis point increase is where we re comfortable talking about right now also i just want to remind everybody 200 basis points right and again a 6 reduction in mortgage and uc erc is really a substantial improvement we feel very good about delivering that and so hopefully the investment community can look at it in that vein mark w begor chief executive officer and george i would add to that we ll obviously talk about a long term framework for revenue and margins in a couple of weeks and we ve been quite clear that we see a lot of ability to grow the top line or we re confident in our ability to grow our top line long term at above market level as well as expand our margins and we ve also been very clear that while we have the ability to expand margins over the long term basis we re also going to invest in the business we have the ability to invest in new products and obviously the tech transformation which we re completing it has really high leverage in driving the top line so we ll continue to have that balance going forward of expanding margins while investing in the future of equifax george mihalos cowen company analyst okay great i appreciate that because i think that s what s weighing on the stock this morning so really really appreciate you are breaking it down like that and then just quickly mark i think if i caught it correctly you talked about as it relates to record growth going after some more of these what i think of as more unbanked individuals gig workers and the like can you talk about the challenges or how you go about sourcing data from that constituency as opposed to traditional w 2 worker and the like is it going to require sort of a different effort in terms of going after like fintechs to partner with or how are you thinking about that mark w begor chief executive officer yes first our primary focus is to continue to grow w 2 income kind of payroll records and you see that we ve had strong success in that over the last couple of years and certainly again in the quarter we re continuing to add to that there s still a long runway there when you think about 60 million 70 million of additional individuals that are not in our data set that are inside of that so that s kind of a primary focus and then as you point out we re expanding into gig some of the same relationships we have companies process on their own contractor payroll we ll be able to pick that up some payroll processors have kind of self employed solutions where there s an ability to pick up data that way there s other hr software providers that will help us through partnerships lead to some of those kind of records and of course the pensioner income at 20 million to 30 million comes from individual companies that process their own pension income or other companies that do that for companies so we ve got a multifaceted approach on that really the point we make in identifying that is that our lens is wider now and there s still a long runway of this important lever to grow records workforce solutions as you know we don t talk about adding data assets in our other businesses what s unique about workforce is that it s only a decade old and it only has 60 of nonfarm payroll so there s a ton of room to grow and then that gets bigger as we both pointed out as you add gig and pension into that space george mihalos cowen company analyst great thank you guys operator thank you our next questions come from the line of toni kaplan with morgan stanley please proceed with your questions toni kaplan morgan stanley analyst thanks so much wanted to start with appriss at the time of the acquisition you had talked about strong accretion in 22 from that deal along with the health e fx and teletrack acquisitions i guess how much is embedded in your 22 eps expectations from the deals and maybe you could help with some of the assumptions behind the significant accretion because i think some investors and myself were getting a little bit more neutral john w gamble jr corporate vice president chief financial officer so it s absolutely accretive in 2022 certainly i m not going to give a specific number for the level of accretion for the acquisitions but kind of similar to the response i just gave with regard to margin movements so we do expect good ebitda margins from those acquisitions and the level of margin that we re generating from that certainly exceeds the cost of the interest expense which we also detailed in our revenue book so we re seeing nice accretion and so which would be consistent with strong from what we talked about back in august but just in general right the level of margins we look at from an acquired company like appriss or anybody else in the first year out the incremental margin we generate from those companies isn t anywhere near the level of incremental margin we generate from incremental organic sales at equifax so the reason why they re somewhat dilutive to our ebitda margin in total is because of the fact that the variable margin we achieved on our direct sales is certainly substantially higher than the level of margin we generate from the acquired company in its first year out toni kaplan morgan stanley analyst got it and then just looking at the revenue trends in the appendix look like non mortgage online info in u s was good at positive 15 but it did decelerate relative to last quarter is that because of the auto softness or are there other verticals that are impacting that as well and it does seem like the banks are talking about the lending environment getting better are you expecting that in the fourth quarter or next year it did look like in your levers page your macro levers page that maybe it gets better but i m just trying to understand sort of how much that is going to be a driver and what you re seeing in the lending environment thanks john w gamble jr corporate vice president chief financial officer i think the biggest driver of the growth rates that you re looking at really is the fact that in 2020 we saw a meaningful improvement in the third quarter relative to the second right so the growth rate in the second quarter of 2020 as we talked about when we did the release was elevated partially because of the fact that it was such a weak quarter and we saw some improvements in the third quarter last year right so that s part of what s driving the fact that the that s a significant driver of what s driving the growth rates to be down but in terms of overall performance i think as mark referenced we feel good about banking and lending we have a nice growth there in the quarter again as we we had nice growth in insurance nice growth in commercial identity and fraud was strong and importantly financial marketing services was very strong right so but again as you look into the fourth quarter similarly to what i just talked about the fourth quarter of last year was a nice improvement from the third quarter so we ll have some of the grow over effects that we talked about in the third quarter but we continue to believe we re going to see nice non mortgage growth in usis in the fourth quarter toni kaplan morgan stanley analyst thank you operator thank you our next questions come from the line of andrew nicholas with william blair please proceed with your questions andrew nicholas william blair analyst thanks good morning my first question was just going to be on the talent solutions business obviously as it gets to become a bigger and bigger piece of workforce solutions i think you said 30 of non mortgage just wondering how you think about the cyclicality of that business we ve talked about the tight labor market but as you re thinking about 22 in particular and embedding that type of growth or some level of growth for that business how do you think about new product innovation relative to existing client growth or hiring activity and how that impacts performance in that business over a shorter time frame mark w begor chief executive officer yes first i think the underlying macro of 75 million people changing jobs every year that macro doesn t really change much over time meaning lots of people change jobs and that may go up or down at some but underlying that is that there s some level of data used in each of those job moves so that s a macro that s quite good the other thing that s changing that we think is going to be a permanent change is the desire by companies to complete that process more quickly meaning they ve made an offer to someone getting them on the floor in the warehouse or the factory or in the retail establishment or in the restaurant in hours or days versus weeks and the only way to do that is through instant decisioning so i think that s the fundamental structural change in the business the ability to use data to speed up the processes for us what we re really having the growth in is building out this data hub which remember is only a year old or whatever we re starting to leverage the four and half five jobs we have in the average american from our twn database remember 0 5 billion of historical records and then adding to it new data elements like appriss insights like medical credentialing the national student clearinghouse of education that s all new turf for equifax as we combine those you re going to see products coming out you already are we re rolling out new products quite rapidly for talent solutions where we have different solutions of more or less historical data and we ll move to in the coming year solutions that are more targeted to specific jobs a job that requires what was your last employer what was your last two employers verifying your licenses verifying where did you go to school some jobs require that some don t so we ll come up with solutions that will be packaged to speed up that process for the background screeners and the hiring managers in order to speed up the ability to hire that individual more quickly so we see a lot of opportunity for growth in that that s a 5 billion tam our business is quite small when you think about 5 billion worth of data and that s why we re investing through new products and through innovation and of course through the acquisitions that we ve made or the new partnerships like the national student clearinghouse andrew nicholas william blair analyst great thank you that s helpful and then just two quick modeling questions the first was i think the legacy system savings that you had outlined in prior investor presentations was 85 million year over year i just want to make sure that s still the number to think about and then also if you wouldn t mind speaking to whether or not the ssa contract was fully ramped this quarter thank you john w gamble jr corporate vice president chief financial officer yes so in terms of modeling again for 2022 what i d ask you to focus on is the guidance we just gave right so what we try to do is give you a fairly detailed walk from this year to next year and obviously there s a lot of moving parts in what s driving our ebitda margin movement which was some of the questions we had earlier so i ask would be a focus on the walk we gave in the 200 basis points of margin expansion when you think about 2022 relative to 2021 mark w begor chief executive officer and on ssa in our comments we i noted that we launched the program we started delivering data to them at kind of early levels and we expect that to ramp as we go through the fourth quarter and into 2022 and get to run rate sometime in 2022 it s a substantial and positive contract for us but it s in the start up mode now which is positive to have it started after a lot of years of building this new solution and getting it integrated with ssa andrew nicholas william blair analyst great thanks for not missing that technical part appreciate it operator thank you our next questions come from the line of hamzah mazari with jefferies please proceed with your questions hamzah mazari jefferies analyst hey good morning thank you my question is just around the integration of the m a you ve done you kind of talked about 2022 seeing synergies roll through could you just give us examples maybe what integration is yet to come what s behind you and then when do you reengage in the m a market is it more of a can you do that next year or is sort of we wait until this integration is done and then you get back more aggressive on m a just any thoughts on that mark w begor chief executive officer yes no we re actively as you know we have completed eight acquisitions this year and a couple of them substantial particularly kount and appriss we re much further along on integrating kount as you might imagine because we completed that deal in the first quarter appriss was only completed a couple of weeks ago so we re still early days of starting that integration the cloud allows us to integrate more quickly and as you know our focus is to bring their unique data into our single data fabric so that s underway with all of the acquisitions in order to drive their growth going forward and we re seeing in kount early positive days of top line synergies and very pleased with the plan on that acquisition and we re very energized about appriss and of course all the other acquisitions that we completed the synergies from these acquisitions i think we ve been very clear when we announced the acquisitions come in over multiple years they start in year one like in 2021 there s some early synergies they build and year two in this case 2022 for those two acquisitions and then they ll continue and we ve talked about kind of year five synergies in some of the acquisitions being quite substantial and those build over time as you roll out the new solutions the new products and fully integrate the business into our cloud capabilities and our single data fabric with regards to your second question we were clear when we announced appriss a couple of months ago that we were going to pause on substantial m a for a number of quarters number one to focus on integration and number two to bring our leverage back in line so to answer your question we would expect to be back doing m a in the latter half of 2022 or somewhere in that time frame we haven t stopped our corporate dev team of continuing to be in the market to look for m a that would be a meaningful and accretive and i hope you get a sense that we re quite disciplined about the kind of m a we want to do we ve been very clear for a number of years about acquisitions we want to do around differentiated data identity and fraud and broadening and strengthening workforce solutions and the deals we ve done this year have checked all those boxes and you should expect the deals going forward to do the same and also with the financial discipline that over the long term they re accretive to our long term growth rates and into our margins we want to do deals that strengthen equifax broaden equifax but also enhance our financials and drive shareholder value hamzah mazari jefferies analyst that s very helpful and just a follow up question just on the international business i know you flagged your expectation of australia gdp for 2022 but any do you expect to see benefits from the tech transformation on the international business as early as next year or does that come a bit later thank you mark w begor chief executive officer most of it comes later although canada is well down the path of their tech transformation they should get some benefits in 22 and there s some early benefits in u k and spain and australia as we get into 2022 but the bulk of that is going to really come particularly in latin america in the latter parts of the year as we get into 2023 hamzah mazari jefferies analyst got it thank you so much operator thank you our next questions come from the line of andrew steinerman with jpmorgan please proceed with your questions andrew steinerman jpmorgan analyst thanks two questions the first one could you just tell us how much mortgage revenues as a percentage of total third quarter equifax revenues there was my second question is about tech transformation expense i want to know if you can indicate what the tech transformation expense drag on 22 eps is compared to the 1 01 the 1 01 for 21 which is referenced on slide 7 footnote 5 john w gamble jr corporate vice president chief financial officer yes so in terms of the mortgage as a percent of total it s just under 32 and that s obviously down significantly from where it was last year and it will go down again in the fourth quarter so in terms of tech transformation expense i think what we ve indicated is that this year we expect to incur about 165 million and that s how you get to the 1 01 and we ve indicated that we expect to reduce by about 100 million it s not a perfect number right but by about 100 million next year so that would be on the order to on the order of 60 million to 65 million next year but obviously we ll refine that as we move through the fourth quarter and give you a really formal guidance as we get into early next year andrew steinerman jpmorgan analyst okay thank you operator thank you our next questions come from the line of george tong with goldman sachs please proceed with your questions george tong goldman sachs analyst hi thanks good morning your 3q revenues beat guidance by about 50 million while your full year guidance increased by about 130 million at the midpoint i know appriss is adding 150 million in annual revenue but how much of the increase in the guide above the 3q outperformance is due to contributions from appriss and other acquisitions versus improved assumed performance in 4q with the underlying business john w gamble jr corporate vice president chief financial officer yes i think we indicated in our prepared remarks it s about 45 million mark w begor chief executive officer in the fourth quarter john w gamble jr corporate vice president chief financial officer in the fourth quarter sorry mark w begor chief executive officer from acquisitions george george tong goldman sachs analyst okay got it and the remainder from performance outperformance in the underlying business mark w begor chief executive officer correct george tong goldman sachs analyst okay and then in your slides you mentioned that usis non mortgage is expected to outperform the underlying margins in 2022 how much of that outperformance is due to m a and how much is due to organic outperformance versus underlying markets mark w begor chief executive officer you re breaking up but i think your question george was in 2022 our mortgage outperformance how much is from m a versus the core business is that right george tong goldman sachs analyst yes versus organic yes mark w begor chief executive officer yes it s substantially all organic john w gamble jr corporate vice president chief financial officer yes so if the question was non mortgage in usis then our statement was intended to be organic right so we re expecting them to outperform their core market on an organic basis mark w begor chief executive officer and the workforce solutions acquisitions are really don t have an impact on their outperformance in mortgage george tong goldman sachs analyst got it thank you operator thank you our next questions come from the line of jeffrey meuler with baird please proceed with your questions jeffrey meuler baird analyst yes thank you on 22 margins are you viewing 22 as a year where it s still pretty depressed by onetime expenses or are you viewing it as a good kind of underlying baseline where there s always going to be some puts and takes i guess there s still 65 million of tti on top of that i think even though the net cloud costs are going down there s still probably some fairly material duplicative systems cost that you can work down over time not trying to ask if you re at peak margin because i know you can increase margins at the acquired businesses you have good incrementals on organic but just trying to understand if you re viewing 22 as still a fairly depressed figure or if it s a good underlying for us to consider how we go forward from thereon mark w begor chief executive officer well i ll start on that one and john can jump in we ll in a couple of weeks in our investor day presentation we ll certainly give you our long term framework around top line and margin growth and we ve been very clear you should expect that to include our ability to grow our margins going forward and 22 is clearly i don t know if you want to call it still a transitionary year you ve got the mortgage market impact obviously and then as you point out we still have substantial cloud transformation costs in 2022 so we re not at a normal run rate in 2022 john john w gamble jr corporate vice president chief financial officer no you covered it right so we just i think we just had an earlier question about how much transformation expense was still investment was still in 2022 and we gave a number of we re at 165 million this year and we said we d reduce by about 100 million so that s still in the p l next year and then also we are delivering cloud savings so our net cloud cost over decommissioning is a positive next year but we ve given a long term model where we expect to deliver substantial savings when the cloud transformation is complete we re still committed to that right so the exact timing as you move through any given year obviously moves around a lot based on decommissionings and the pace of ramp of individual systems so it s hard to be specific in any about any specific number as far as 15 months out but we are absolutely committed to delivering a net savings next year versus the net cost this year and then also there s substantial savings still to come as we get through 2022 and then and into 23 and 24 obviously those don t complete until we complete the international transformation jeffrey meuler baird analyst very helpful and then we get asked a lot about bnpl and if it s cannibalistic to card including from a bureau transaction or underwriting perspective i would expect you to have a pretty unique view into that given australia is a more developed bnpl market plus you obviously have a nice bureau share there so would just love your thoughts on bnpl and over time if you d expect it to be cannibalistic to card or not thanks mark w begor chief executive officer that s a different question about cannibalistic card as far as a card issuer i think some card issuers are probably seeing some pressure from bnpl meaning consumers are using that instead of using their credit card to make purchases when it comes to equifax and our industry is providing data bnpl we sell a bunch of identity data to bnpl players around the globe and increasingly they re starting to use alternative data as a part of their underwriting even in some many cases credit data meaning credit file data going forward so i think if you look at the total pie on consumers using cash or debit versus bnpl and credit the pie is growing meaning consumers are using this as another way to finance their purchases which from an equifax perspective we view as a good thing and we ve got discussions with all of the bnpl players about using our data and our identity data because you have to verify the identity of the consumer before you offer them financing even on a pair of jeans so going forward so we view it as a net positive for the credit bureaus and equifax jeffrey meuler baird analyst thank you both operator thank you our next questions come from the line of manav patnaik with barclays please proceed with your questions manav patnaik barclays analyst thank you good morning john i agree the 200 basis point margin expansion is obviously strong given all the headwinds but i was hoping you could just help us maybe with some order of magnitude i heard 3 things that are the tight labor market and that increase in cost the acquisition impact and then the 600 basis point decline in ec and uc revenues or whatever so like how much of a headwind were each of those mark w begor chief executive officer i would start with number one is that manav we re continuing to invest more next year than this year we re intending to around new products innovation dna customer growth we see real leverage in doing that so john talked about that go ahead john john w gamble jr corporate vice president chief financial officer absolutely look manav i m not going to size them specifically right but we referenced them because they re all meaningful to us right so they re all impacting margins but again 200 basis points increase in a market where there s 600 basis points of headwinds from mortgage and then obviously uc and erc which is we think is a very good outcome so we think we re delivering substantial savings from reduction in transformation and as we indicated we will start delivering savings on net sorry net cloud relative to decom and other cost savings so we feel good about the direction we re headed and we feel good about delivering 200 basis points of growth manav patnaik barclays analyst got it okay and then maybe just some modeling items just so that we get the directional numbers right could you just give us what the 2021 ec and uc revenues were so that we can model that 30 decline and then the same thing i guess the d a interest expense and capex please john w gamble jr corporate vice president chief financial officer for the third quarter i think we gave it in the script i think we manav patnaik barclays analyst no for 2021 like what is the number just so that we can do the 2022 modeling you gave us some changes john w gamble jr corporate vice president chief financial officer so i understand the question so we ll think about that obviously we re going to be together again in a little over two weeks and perhaps we can provide a bridge but we gave i think we gave details on a 30 reduction we said the 30 reduction was 1 25 of revenue so i think between those two numbers you ll get pretty close to the exact number but we haven t disclosed it yet but and i apologize i don t have it at my fingertips but i think with those two pieces of information you can get really close to the uc and erc revenue in 21 and 2022 manav patnaik barclays analyst okay thank you operator thank you our next questions come from the line of ashish sabadra with rbc capital please proceed with your questions ashish sabadra rbc capital analyst yes thanks for taking my questions two questions first one is on pricing you obviously have a very strong pricing power and there were some pretty good pricing increases in the verification business how do we think about pricing increases going forward and then just second one on the 50 million of investment how do we think about that investment i know you talked a lot about it but is this like a onetime investment or should we think about having this like 50 million investment every year over the next several years so color on both fronts thanks mark w begor chief executive officer yes and so on the investment one we will continue to balance as we have since i ve been here balance growing our margins while investing in the business and the 50 million that was referenced is areas where we see opportunities to continue to grow our investments in new products and dna in order to drive our top line and that s really around leveraging the cloud i ll leave the long term discussion until a couple of weeks on november 10 during investor day where we can talk in more detail about that balance but we ve been very clear that we expect our margin we expect to expand our margins going forward while investing in equifax and there ll be a balance there that we think is the right thing for equifax and for our shareholders over the long term john do you want to take the first question your first question was around verification revenue and you want ashish sabadra rbc capital analyst that s right the pricing power mark w begor chief executive officer pricing yes yes the pricing is one lever that we use across equifax workforce clearly has more pricing power than our other businesses and we expect to have price be a positive for us in 2022 and that s inside our early framework and of course we ve got many many other levers that we focus even more strongly on new products is a big one in verification of course the number of polls penetration those will all drive the business and of course records underlie driving verification ashish sabadra rbc capital analyst that s very helpful sir thank you operator thank you our next questions come from the line of craig huber with huber research partners please proceed with your questions craig huber huber research partners analyst thank you maybe if you could touch on your personal finance area and the credit cards area within your traditional credit bureau business how did that do in the quarter what s your near term outlook for that please mark w begor chief executive officer yes i don t think we gave any real specific details on it i can give you some color is that as we expected coming out of covid we expected cards and p loans to see some positive momentum which we have particularly around marketing as you know the card issuers and p loan issuers in 2020 really stopped a lot of the marketing because of the uncertainty around where the consumer was going to be and now as you got into 2021 and certainly through the third quarter we ve seen an increase in marketing you ve seen that in our numbers a lot of our marketing performance in usis is from cards and some from p loans and we expect to see issuers continue to try to acquire more customers and build up their balance sheets which have come down as consumers have been paying down a lot of balances so there s quite a bit of marketing activity going on and we expect that to continue in the future john w gamble jr corporate vice president chief financial officer the bulk of that business for us obviously is in banking and lending and mark talked about the growth we re seeing in banking in the third quarter and second quarter right so we ve seen double digit growth both quarters craig huber huber research partners analyst i appreciate that my follow up question on the global consumer solutions area maybe just touch on your outlook there the next couple of quarters if you could in the direct versus the indirect side i think you just sort of touched on a little bit right there but just go a little further detail on that mark w begor chief executive officer yes i think we talked in our comments that we expect the partner business to return to growth in the fourth quarter it was clearly impacted by the tightening of originations by a lot of their customers and on the direct business we expect the same craig huber huber research partners analyst great thank you operator thank you our next questions come from the line of gary bisbee with bank of america gary bisbee bank of america analyst hey guys good morning i wanted to go back to records growth for a minute and you ve had tremendous success with the payroll channel and it sounds like you ve got maybe at this point the three major players i know there s some reasonably chunky players after that but then it fragments my understanding pretty quickly is that enough to continue to deliver double digit records growth and i guess how meaningful at the moment or over the next 12 to 24 months or some of these other opportunities like the 1099 workers or pensions and are there other sort of types of players beyond payroll that have data that could further you could do deals with to further support growth of records look we get why it s been unbelievable i guess i m just not certain if payroll being a big piece of that can drive the next few years like it has the last few mark w begor chief executive officer so gary as we ve talked about we get the bulk of our records through our employer services business and that s a steady increase in records and 60 of our records come from that so that s clearly a base area of focus where we have a dedicated team on the partnership side they can be a little bit lumpy when you bring in a larger payroll processor but there s still a lot of runway in that vertical if you want to call it that of continuing to expand those partnerships and as we said we ve got continued momentum there and very active dialogues about them wanting to join another area for records is around hr software partnerships where they have access to records because of the software being embedded in an individual company both companies as you know process their own payroll some use their own systems but most use some third party systems so that s another avenue for us in order to access records and then we talked about our focus on gig and pension to go even further as far as our record addition so we see a lot of runway in our ability to continue to grow records which is as you know is a very valuable lever for top and bottom line growth at workforce solutions gary bisbee bank of america analyst and then just one more on that topic you mentioned new products a lot and i know a few times in the past you ve talked about substantially higher priced products like 100 150 200 versus 10 and 20 or whatever the typical but can you give us just maybe an example of one that is in the market driving revenue what the price point is or what is unique about the new offering versus the traditional levels of income and employment i just would love mark w begor chief executive officer yes sure there s a bunch of them i ll give you a couple in mortgage in mortgage our typical solution is a report that shows current income and employment and it verifies that and that might sell for 20 to 40 somewhere in that range and as you know because we have the 0 5 billion of historical records in some

at their last meeting that if the economy continued to improve they could start reducing their monthly bond purchases as soon as next month and bring them to an end by the middle of 2022 the discussion was revealed in the minutes of the fed s sept 21 22 meeting released wednesday oct 13 advertisement federal reserve imposes sweeping new limits on policymakers investments share copy link copy the federal reserve is imposing a broad new set of restrictions on the investments its officials can own a response to questionable recent trades that forced two top fed officials to resign the fed announced thursday that its policymakers and senior staff would be barred from investing in individual stocks and bonds they would also have to provide 45 days advance notice of any trade and receive prior approval from ethics officials and they would have to hold the investments for at least a year these senior officials will also have to sell any individual stocks or bonds they now own as well as any category of securities such as municipal bonds that the fed is buying as part of its economic support programs the new rules would also require fed officials to publicly disclose all financial transactions within 30 days and would bar trading during periods of heightened financial market stress the central bank said it hasn t yet decided how to define such periods in a statement the fed said it would incorporate the restrictions into its written policies in the coming months fed officials suggested that they might have to expand their legal staff to implement them these tough new rules raise the bar high in order to assure the public we serve that all of our senior officials maintain a single minded focus on the public mission of the federal reserve chair jerome powell said in a statement powell who is under consideration by the biden administration for a second four year term as fed chair has come under fire after it was revealed that two regional federal reserve bank presidents traded stocks and other investments last spring although the trades complied with fed financial ethics rules they occurred while the fed was taking expansive steps to boost the economy and calm financial markets as a result they raised the possibility of conflicts of interest because the two officials could have profited from the fed s actions one of the officials robert kaplan who was president of the dallas fed made trades of 1 million or more in 22 stocks last year including apple facebook and chevron the other official eric rosengren who was head of the federal reserve bank of boston invested in funds that held mortgage backed securities of the same type that the fed was buying as part of its efforts to hold down longer term interest rates kaplan and rosengren announced their resignations soon after the questionable trades came to light ethics experts said the trades underscored how lax the fed s rules were given its outside influence over financial markets the regional fed bank presidents take part in private discussions about potential interest rate changes that stand to affect the financial markets they can also move markets in their frequent public speeches which typically reflect their inside knowledge of the fed s policy discussions under the rules announced thursday fed officials including the regional presidents will be limited to owning diversified investments such as mutual funds powell s term expires in february but most observers expect the white house to announce a decision this fall many progressive groups though have urged the administration to nominate lael brainard a member of the fed s governing board or some other candidate rather than powell some have argued that the fed s rules around investing were too lax not all critics are likely to be satisfied by the stricter rules unveiled thursday the changes announced today by the federal reserve are long overdue and a good start but don t go far enough said dennis kelleher president of better markets an advocacy group the fed should apply them more broadly kelleher said to any fed employees with access to nonpublic information not just senior officials senior leaders kelleher said should have to put their holdings in a blind trust the fed considered blind trusts officials said but did not choose that route because officials would be unable to guarantee that they were not invested in individual stocks or bonds some ethics experts applauded the fed s move norman eisen a senior fellow at the brookings institution said the new rules compare favorably to other government agencies the fed has treated this as what we in the ethics profession refer to as a teachable moment to broadcast a message of integrity eisen said they are to be congratulated powell s own investments have also raised concerns a former partner at the carlyle group an investment firm powell owns municipal bonds a type of security that the fed bought last year for the first time as part of its efforts to ensure that financial markets could operate smoothly at a news conference sept 22 powell said he thought that fed officials generally shouldn t own financial assets of the kind that the fed itself is purchasing he said he had owned muni bonds for years powell will have to sell the muni bonds under the new rules fed officials confirmed at the same news conference powell

for the linked quarter ended june 30 2021 and a 109 0 increase over the 1 693 921 or 0 49 per share for the prior year quarter ended september 30 2020 pre tax pre provision operating income for the current quarter is 4 075 010 compared to 3 222 715 for the linked quarter and 2 637 056 for the comparative prior year quarter pre tax pre provision operating income excludes taxes provision for loan losses gains or losses on the sale of other real estate owned gains on the sale of investment securities and other non operating revenues and expenses the increase in current quarter pre tax pre provision operating income is primarily due to an increase in interest income on loans as we recognized more origination fee income derived from the small business administration sba paychecks protection program ppp and were able to redeploy funds received from ppp forgiveness into loans earning a current market rate of interest additionally we enjoyed higher levels of non interest income and continued to demonstrate non interest expense control for the nine month period ended september 30 2021 net income was 8 059 912 or 2 35 per share compared to 4 900 630 or 1 43 per share for the prior year comparative period pre tax pre provision operating earnings for the two comparative nine month periods is 10 157 137 and 7 986 946 respectively bruce w elder president ceo commented like many other community banks our deposits have been elevated over the past 18 months causing a high level of balance sheet liquidity while our ultimate strategy is to reposition our balance sheet away from excess cash and investment securities into the loan portfolio we also are experiencing the repayment of ppp loans the fact that we have seen a 67 5 million reduction in ppp loans due to forgiveness and are able to still show a slight increase in total loans over the past nine months speaks to our commitment to the strategy higher net interest income improving non interest income and paying close attention to overhead expenses has resulted in strong quarterly results for a company with a loan to deposit ratio of 52 while there remains significant work to be done to achieve our goal of transitioning assets we are demonstrating that we are up to the challenge paycheck protection program lending the company made 1 422 ppp loans totaling 110 4 million as of september 30 2021 34 7 million remain outstanding and 75 7 million has been repaid through sba forgiveness and customer payments total outstanding ppp loans decreased by 13 0 million during the third quarter from 47 7 million outstanding at june 30 2021 of the original 74 0 million in 2020 vintage loans 64 0 million have been repaid and 6 loans totaling 10 0 million remain outstanding we anticipate a large percentage of these loans will be repaid during the fourth quarter of 2021 of the original 36 4 million of ppp loans made in 2021 11 7 million have been repaid and 382 loans totaling 24 7 million remain outstanding the 2021 vintage borrowers have until the middle of 2022 to apply for forgiveness and therefore some portion of these loans may remain outstanding well into 2022 the company received origination fees from the sba for participating in the program at origination we recognized as interest income that portion of the fee estimated to be our internal cost of origination the remainder is amortized over the contractual life of the loan if the loan is forgiven or repaid early the remaining unamortized portion is recognized as interest income in the month of repayment amounts recognized as interest income for the quarters ended september 30 2021 june 30 2021 and september 30 2020 are 799 000 572 000 and 254 000 respectively origination fees recognized for the two nine month periods ended september 30 2021 and 2020 are 2 185 000 and 887 000 respectively as of september 30 2021 we had approximately 1 1 million in deferred ppp origination fees to be recognized in future periods asset quality loans past due 30 to 89 days as of september 30 2021 total 1 1 million or 0 18 of total gross loans compared to 1 3 million or 0 28 at december 31 2021 while past due loans remain at a manageable level at september 30 2021 the stimulus money injected into the us economy over the past 18 months has largely subsided and management is paying close attention to determine whether any trends might develop in the near term the company has minimal loan exposure in those areas recently impacted by hurricane ida we have granted payment extensions to three borrowers with residential investment property in affected areas not because of property damage but because the tenants in those properties may have experienced a period of lost income no losses are anticipated total nonperforming assets including loans on non accrual status other real estate owned oreo and repossessed assets are 5 5 million at september 30 2021 compared to 9 1 million at december 31 2020 a comparison of non performing assets at the current and prior year end periods show loans on non accrual status is currently 5 2 million compared to 8 8 million oreo is 255 000 compared to 291 000 and repossessed assets are 23 000 compared to 33 000 management performs a quarterly evaluation of oreo properties and believes their adjusted carrying values are representative of their fair market values although there is no assurance that the ultimate sales will be equal or greater than the carrying values the bank recorded no provision for credit losses in the current quarter compared to 165 000 for the linked quarter and 958 000 for the prior year quarter ended september 30 2020 the allowance for loan losses alll is 8 4 million at september 30 2021 or 1 33 of total loans compared to 8 6 million at december 31 2020 or 1 36 of total loans net charge offs are 538 000 for 2021 year to date compared to 78 000 for the prior year comparative period the increase in net charge offs over the comparative year to date period is primarily due to a short sale of a financed commercial property occurring during the second quarter of 2021 while we believe the current level of our alll is adequate there is no assurance that regulators increased risks in the loan portfolio or changes in economic conditions will not require additional adjustments to the alll net interest income net interest income for the current quarter is 9 4 million reflecting an increase of 549 000 compared to the 8 9 million for the linked quarter and an increase of 1 1 million over the 8 3 million reported for the prior year quarter ended september 30 2020 the net interest margin for the september 2021 quarter was 3 02 and improved by 17 basis points from 2 85 for the linked quarter and declined by 59 basis points compared to 3 61 for the prior year period the yield on earning assets for the current quarter was 3 36 compared to 3 20 and 4 11 for the two comparative periods respectively the cost of funds has declined to 0 35 for current period compared to 0 36 for q2 2021 and 0 50 from the prior year quarter net margin has been significantly impacted by the lower interest rate environment that has been prevalent since march 2020 the volume of ppp loans priced at 1 and a surge in deposit levels causing high levels of liquidity as previously discussed the company originated approximately 110 4 million in ppp loans of which 34 7 million remain outstanding at september 30 2021 the origination of these loans was important for the well being of small businesses in our communities but had an adverse impact on net interest margin the yield on all loans is 5 39 for the current quarter which is up from 5 16 for the linked quarter the increase can be attributed to an increase in the origination fees recognized during the current quarter and the replacement of those 1 ppp loans that were forgiven by core loans priced at current market rates the loan to deposit ratio at september 30 2021 is 51 70 compared to 68 99 at september 30 2020 for the nine month period ended september 30 2021 net interest income is 26 8 million or 1 2 million higher than the 25 6 million for the comparative period ended september 30 2020 net interest margin declined during the current nine month period to 2 91 from 3 99 for the prior year comparative period the decline in the margin for the nine month period was due to the large amount of earning assets deployed in interest bearing cash and investment securities the yield on loans was relatively stable across the nine month periods at 5 26 and 5 25 respectively non interest income total non interest income is 3 8 million for the three month period ended september 30 2021 compared to 3 2 million for the linked quarter and 2 9 million for the prior year quarter service charges and fees associated with deposit accounts are 2 3 million up from 2 2 million at june 30 2021 and 1 7 million at september 30 2020 the largest component of service charges and fees is interchange income on debit card transactions interchange revenue is 1 2 million 1 3 million and 777 000 for the current linked and prior year quarters respectively revenue from nsf fees continues to rebound as government stimulus ends and is 665 000 in the current quarter compared to 523 000 in the linked quarter and 585 000 in the prior year quarter gains on sale of originated mortgage loans continues to be a great revenue source for the company and are 430 000 for the quarter ended september 30 2021 compared to 498 000 and 280 000 for the linked and prior year quarters respectively the origination of mortgage loans during the quarter ended september 30 2020 were adversely impacted by hurricane laura which made landfall in southwest louisiana on august 27 2020 while we anticipate housing transactions to continue to be robust particularly in areas of our footprint impacted by the 2020 storms we also believe that rising interest rates in the foreseeable future could reduce the volume of mortgage originations other non interest income is 1 1 million for the current quarter compared to 494 000 for the quarter ended june 30 2021 and 845 000 for the prior year quarter the current quarter included a gain on a real estate swap of 364 000 and the linked and prior year quarter included gains on the sale of securities of 5 000 and 252 000 respectively non interest income for the nine month period ended september 30 2021 was 9 7 million a 2 2 million or 28 7 increase over the 7 5 million reported for the comparative 2020 period both periods included non recurring gains on the sale of investment securities of 7 000 for the current period and 252 000 for the prior year period in addition the current period includes the aforementioned gain on a real estate swap the increase in recurring operating income was primarily due to a 1 4 million increase in interchange revenue on debit card transactions and a 584 000 increase in gains on the sale of originated mortgage loans non interest expense total non interest expense is 9 0 million for the september 30 2021 quarter compared to 8 8 million for the linked quarter and 8 3 million for the prior year quarter salary and benefits expense is the largest component of non interest expenses and is 4 5 million for all three comparative periods personnel expenses for the current quarter reflect the additional expenses of staffing our newest office at 3600 johnston street in lafayette la we anticipate personnel related expenses to increase in future periods as we look to add commercial bankers to our team occupancy expense has remained relatively stable at 1 4 million for the current quarter compared with 1 3 million for the linked and prior year quarter data processing expense is 1 0 million for the current quarter down from 1 1 million in the linked quarter and up from 899 000 a year ago marketing business development and public relations expenses

fdic insurance premiums oreo expenses other fraud losses and occupancy are partially offset by a decline in salaries and benefits expense losses on the sale of oreo for the current and prior nine month periods are 378 000 and 69 000 respectively additionally we incurred the pre payment penalty noted above income tax expense is 728 000 for the current quarter compared to 470 000 for the june 30 2021 quarter and 234 000 for the september 30 2020 quarter the larger expense is due to an increase in both pre tax earnings and the effective tax rate the effective tax rate is 17 05 compared to 15 34 for the linked quarter and 12 13 for the prior year quarter a larger portion of current pre tax earnings is derived from taxable revenue sources than in past quarters current year to date income

approximately 147 0 million was outstanding at september 30 2021 this growth has been partially offset by 78 2 million in principal amortization and 67 5 million in ppp forgiveness payments from the sba replacing the forgiven ppp loans with new core loans priced at market rates has had a positive impact on both net interest income and net interest margin total deposits have increased by 57 8

million respectively the company normally maintains large balances of public deposits at year end and 12 0 million of the decline in interest bearing deposits can be attributed to a decrease in public funds the percentages of total deposits attributed to non interest bearing demand and certificates of deposit at september 30 2021 are 36 87 and 9 76 respectively other liabilities decreased by approximately 1 4 million since year end 2020 we pre paid a long term fhlb advance which was partially offset by increases in other liabilities due to accruals for income and ad valorem taxes stockholders equity increased by 822 000 to 99 5 million at september 30 2021 from 98 7 million at december 31 2020 the increase is primarily comprised of year to date net earnings of 8 1 million less

a good song is a good song but many of the things that make a good song evolve over time instruments and technology cycle in and out of popularity new sounds come to the foreground nostalgia grips the dial for a little while for many artists and music fans it all comes down to the lyrics and this might be one of the most explicit and obvious markers of changing times so with all due respect to the great songwriters up to and including the first decade of the 21st century cbc music is shining a light on some of the newest canadian songwriters right now who are meeting the moment pens iphones and laptops in hand carly rae jepsen carly rae jepsen is a juggernaut pop songwriter for over a decade she has relentlessly released banger after banger she s often derided for empty lyrics that reveal very little about herself but that s the genius of crj the ubiquity is the point she crafts anthems that you can belt from the passenger seat with all the windows down the kind of unadulterated pop that isn t pressed about being cool the moment she started to get the recognition she deserved or at least when music twitter began to take her more seriously was after emotion and the emotion b sides ep were released but she s been solid since the beginning her hooks beg to be chanted and she cranks out earworms on the regular it sounds effortless but it s far from and that s the mark of a true pop songwriter she writes a lot she wrote more than 200 songs before settling on the 12 that would end up on emotion she synthesizes ideas about love in all its forms to make the kind of widely palatable bright shiny pop that can take on dozens of meanings take too much from her album dedicated the girls just wanna have fun energy of the chorus could easily be about grappling with obsessive tendencies depending on the listener s perspective kelsey adams too much when i party then i party too much when i feel it then i feel it too much when i m thinking then i m thinking too much when i m drinking then i m drinking too much i ll do anything to get to the rush now i m dancing and i m dancing too much so be careful if you re wanting this touch cause if i love you then i love you too much drake no artist of this generation is lyrically more memorable than drake he may not be unpacking complex metaphors in his verses but he s a master at writing lyrics we can all relate to the poet laureate of the everyday moment drake often provides the perfect word or phrase we need whether we re getting into the weekend or getting into our feelings whether we re falling in or out of love this shouldn t come as a surprise from the guy who made sayings like started from the bottom and yolo fodder for everything from instagram hashtags and t shirts to stock trading and cultural economic movements he s also incredibly versatile able to deliver fiery breathless verses make you laugh at a witty play on words or just sit back and ride a beat sometimes all in the same song like many of the best songwriters drake also deals in the deeply personal and confessional using his life as a way for the listener to reflect on theirs sure he raps about success a lot with lines like drinkin every night because we drink to my accomplishments but you don t need to drive a maybach in order to relate to having your heart broken or to being worried about your family jesse kinos goodin

peter dreimanis as one of canada s most enduring alternative rock bands july talk has been through seasons forming in 2012 the group s stomping early work was the catalyst for what would become a career in unparalleled onstage chemistry there wasn t a gimmick in sight not in the retro licked duelling boy girl lead vocals of peter dreimanis and leah fay nor the way they climbed around the stage and each other without skipping a beat what was present all along was dreimanis and fay s ability to read each other and share the responsibility of telling each other s deepest secrets to the outside world with their 2020 album pray for it the raucous party was traded for softness quieting the rumble long enough for us to truly grasp the exquisite realness of their wordplay on identical love the pair trade vows around the transformative power of real love slowing time alongside the wash of a distant sax and keys it s the stuff of poetry the stuff you wish you knew how to say but often can t which is why their role in the canadian landscape remains as precious if not underrated as ever jess huddleston identical love i want to be changed i want to be rearranged my love for you eternal i

félix leclerc prize for song as well as songwriter of the year at the 2017 adisq gala for her album l étoile thoracique and her 2020 album notre dame des sept douleurs is currently on the polaris prize short list pelletier gagnon s visceral writing has been garnering attention since her critically acclaimed debut 2013 s l alchimie des monstres the songwriter possesses a sense of theatricality and an abundant imagination that she expresses with highly colourful turns of phrases often taking risks with her writing something that sets her apart from her contemporaries pelletier gagnon chooses words that create a parallel universe painting vivid images of ferrofluids flowers ferrofluides fleurs from les ferrofluides fleurs and the incontinent sun soleil incontinent from le soleil incontinent in her first two albums a lot of pelletier gagnon s poetry is steeped in nostalgia and sadness often referring to life love and death with powerful metaphors those skills are still found on her latest album but with a more blunt and concrete twist as you can see in für élise caroline levesque für élise paraît qu elle dort sur une branche tout en haut du séquoia qu elle ne se nourrit que d oranges et des livres de kafka paraît que sa peau est si blanche qu elle aveugle les colombes que son sourire est plus étrange que celui de la joconde lowell when a 23 year old lowell real name elizabeth boland burst onto the scene as arts crafts most exciting new signee in 2014 many of the same stories were told about her and her debut album reputable publications like the new york times and rolling stone couldn t get enough of her dancer turned student turned indie star story when really it was her songwriting aptitude that immediately set her apart from her newcomer peers what she d reveal over the next almost decade was a formidable back pocket of hooks human lyricism and very little interest in the centre stage at all shelving her bold solo persona in favour of life as a meticulous songwriting fairy godmother if her pop pen touches a song magical things can happen working with the likes of madison beer tate mcrae demi lovato hailee steinfeld and lennon stella lowell s penchant for relatable often heartbroken sentiments is a known commodity and not limited to those she assists her own 2020 singles showcase artful and expertly worded reflections on the disoriented state of her world and the world at large she s lived a lot of life and can expertly identify other artists who have too helping them translate their earthly experiences with care and sometimes into a certified hit jh god is a fascist god is a fascist and he holds all the cards he brought us together just to keep us apart and there s nothing more tragic than this thing that we are i m a hopeless romantic who didn t get the part monsune when scott zhang better known as monsune released his breakout track nothing in return he was a 19 year old university student experimenting with songwriting it s about falling all over yourself for someone who isn t really putting in equal effort romantically it s racked up millions of views and streams across youtube and spotify since its release and soundtracked many wistful nights of unreciprocated affection in the process the runaway success of nothing in return was a sign that like any great songwriter zhang can expertly take the personal and make it universal then he disappeared for two years privately honing his sound and taking his time with new music the hiatus was well worth the wait when he re emerged in 2019 with outta my mind a track with a slinky and sexy r b sound with lyrics to match he illustrated that he could do more than brooding bedroom pop as with other acts in his toronto cohort he runs in the same circles as badbadnotgood jonah yano and moneyphone it s difficult to pin down his sound regardless of genre that raw vulnerability is always there in the writing like with mountain a song that was nominated for the socan songwriting prize in 2020 it chronicles a period of upheaval in the singer s life with zhang wondering if his relationship can weather the storm ka mountain at the base of your mountain i

his recent solo output that really secures his spot as one of the country s best songwriters right now his polaris music prize nominated debut album when smoke rises is a stunning display of his raw heart wrenching lyrics he tackles the violence and death he witnessed growing up in toronto s regent park neighbourhood with patience and empathy but also sometimes anger and urgency he transforms grief into beauty but never compromises on the truth mustafa is a storyteller whose poetry and music will only grow stronger and more influential with time ml stay alive all of these tribes and all of

writes in the acadjonne language of nova scotia a language that rap duo radio radio took to the mainstream at the end of the 2000s using a lyrical lexicon unique in its colourful poetic imagery the 25 year old singer songwriter and composer who released his debut album greatest hits vol 1 last year doesn t overly intellectualize his narrative instead he writes about the contemporary vagaries of adult life those ordinary everyday scenes through simple words that blend french and english in drivin on empty he sings j aime le feeling du vent dans mes cheveux j ai point beaucoup d possessions mais j suis tout l temps heureux i love the feeling of the wind in my hair i don t have a lot of possessions but i m happy all the time when guimond inserts social commentary into his songs it is straight to the point his humble words paired with distinct melodies are the main attraction and though his lyrics don t come dressed up they leave a lasting mark on the listener s imagination this year p tit belliveau was a finalist for the socan songwriting prize and the 2021 slaight music emerging songwriter award as nominated through the canadian songwriters hall of fame showing that this

yesterday s netflix walkout was overshadowed a bit by a counter protester who showed up with a sign that read jokes are funny that counter protester is a comedian named vito gesualdi who makes videos and has a podcast while he was there supporting dave chappelle s right to make jokes vito was photographed by an associated press photographer named damian dovarganes the shot dovarganes got of him is really pretty great but the caption that went along with it is another matter it read comedian and videographer vito gesualdi screams profanities as he engages with peaceful protesters begging him to leave vito took issue with that description last night advertisement comedian and videographer vito gesualdi screams profanities as he engages with peaceful protesters begging him to leave screams profanities dude i just yelled i love dave chappelle the media sucks pic twitter com 74nkafmfzp youtube com vito vitogesualdi october 21 2021 oh great it s a stock associated press photo caption so that lie is on dozens of news sites now any lawyers in the house this is bs pic twitter com bfkibxcdue youtube com vito vitogesualdi october 21 2021 this afternoon jesse singal pointed out that it s possible to identify the exact moment when this photo was taken and because we can do that we can also tell that the caption is absolutely false 1 this ap photo caption reads comedian and videographer vito gesualdi screams profanities as he engages with peaceful protesters begging him to leave a damaging claim about vitogesualdi circulated globally it never happened join me on some basic photo trutherism pic twitter com olzdotuztw jesse singal jessesingal october 21 2021 3 anyone who has been too online the last day plus already recognizes the tambourine from the protester who has a repent motherfucker meltdown after protesters destroy gesualdi s sign in this viral video jesse singal jessesingal october 21 2021 5 is gesualdi scream profanit i m just here to say that jokes are funny people dave chappelle s a funny guy i love dave i don t know why all the violence i don t know why all the hate i just love dave chappelle daaaaave chappeeeelle wooooo no he is not jesse singal jessesingal october 21 2021 advertisement 7 i did reach out to the photographer via twitter dm and to the ap itself but i decided to go ahead with the tweetstorm because that is 100 the moment in question and everything gesualdi says is audible enough to know with certainly that the caption is inaccurate jesse singal jessesingal october 21 2021 9 as a final point with trust in media at an all time low you should probably invest most of your savings in independent media and podcast subscriptions is my objective opinion jesse singal jessesingal october 21 2021 the caption isn t even the only lie being told about this moment here s a tweet from variety which makes vito the aggressor this is such an insanely dishonest tweet if you watch the video version at no point did the dude instigate anything physically this is after his sign was taken and destroyed and he was muscled out jesse singal jessesingal october 21 2021 in case you missed it yesterday here s the video of vito gesualdi from the moment both of these photos were taken the ap is literally reporting he was screaming profanities when he a didn t use a single one and b the woman holding the tambourine in front of him is shouting repent motherf er over and over how do you manage to get it this wrong wait i m remembering something an image from a public confrontation that gets taken out of context the media runs with the false narrative that suits them gee where have i seen this all before oh right advertisement cnn s coverage of their covington catholic settlement was really something pic twitter com f3ocohqzrr jazz shaw jazzshaw january 8 2020 the media hasn t learned anything it seems the ap needs to issue a speedy correction and an apology update vito just posted the retraction correction issued by the ap it reads in part corrects caption to remove reference to gesualdi using profanities which he did not do at the moment the image was made also removes reference to protesters being peaceful because one protester destroyed his sign so the new caption reads in part comedian and videographer vito gesualdi shouts at people protesting against dave chappelle s netflix special outside the netflix building in the hollywood section of los angeles not mentioned are that gesualdi s co host who was also there had his head shoved into a concrete planter or that the woman holding the tambourine in the photo was shouting repent motherf er if profanities were worth mentioning when vito allegedly said them why aren t they worth mentioning when they were directed at him here s what an accurate caption would sound like comedian and videographer vito gesualdi says he loves dave chappelle as protesters shout profanities at him outside the netflix building in the hollywood section of los angeles worth noting that my co host dick masterson is currently at the hospital getting a ct scan after having his head bounced against a concrete planter by these peaceful protestors youtube com vito vitogesualdi

by matt egan cnn business senator elizabeth warren urged the federal reserve on thursday to release a march 2020 ethics warning provided to fed officials that could shed light on the central bank s trading scandal i am writing to ask that you release this information immediately so that congress and the public can evaluate the extent to which fed officials may have known of the risks from their trading and if they ignored calls by ethics officials to avoid this scandalous behavior warren wrote in a letter to fed chairman jerome powell warren cited a report in the new york times earlier thursday that revealed the fed s ethics office sent an email in march 2020 suggesting officials with access to sensitive fed information may want to avoid unnecessary trading as they launched a daring rescue of the economy from the erupting pandemic the ethics warning sent to regional bank ethics officers was delivered on march 23 the paper reported that was the day the fed launched emergency actions and an unprecedented intervention designed to stave off an economic depression it was also the day that us stocks bottomed beginning a roaring recovery from the steep losses inflicted by the health crisis the fed has not released this email or any other ethics advice given to fed officials during the time period when it was heavily involved in financial markets in response to the covid 19 pandemic warren wrote the fed did not respond to a request for comment the push from warren comes as the fed remains engulfed in a trading scandal last month the heads of the boston and dallas federal reserve banks announced early retirements amid criticism of their trades boston fed president eric rosengren cited health concerns the scandal threatens to block powell s shot at another four year term running the fed powell s term expires in february and the white house has not said whether he will be renominated although powell has received support from republicans and moderate democrats progressives have criticized his stance on regulation and climate last month warren slammed powell as a dangerous man to lead the fed because he has presided over deregulation that has made our banking system less safe the cnn wire 2021 cable news network inc a warnermedia company all rights reserved
the irs hates him of course nike founder phil knight isn t the first person to figure out a few technically legal loopholes that allow him to skirt estate taxes and save billions but he is one of the recent most visible examples of generational wealth hoarding as bloomberg reports american estate taxes are as complicated as anything in the country s legal system but basically when someone dies and leaves a certain amount money to their family or heirs uncle sam will come to collect a portion if the total reaches over a certain threshold safe to say us regular folk mostly don t have to worry about this and even if we do a fraction of a couple million bucks is still several million bucks worth about 60 billion at age 83 knight has much more wealth to protect thus he has followed in the footsteps of other monied individuals and tapped into the power of grantor retained annuity trusts or grats which was only revealed because knight and his son travis are both on the board of nike a publicly traded company knight has ridden inflated nike stock to massive gains billions of dollars of which has been wound through a chain of trusts that skirt tax laws and ensure that his family receives giant chunks of untaxed cash the way this chain is set up guarantees knights heirs untold wealth and long term control of nike when money of this magnitude is gifted it s usually taxed and counts towards the estate tax threshold anyone who leaves over 11 7 million to their next of kin unlocks a 40 federal tax grats circumvent this fee entirely these transactions cloak a persons net worth making it look like they have almost nothing because they re trading not gifting their wealth for a promissory note that essentially says that the trust will repay the gift over time the report outlines knight s other tricks of the trade but the core story is that the knight and other uber wealthy folks have the dosh to put up for wealth advisors capable of slipping their fortunes through america s wealth loopholes veritably unscathed and with complete legality evading estate taxes remains a popular subject for the deep pocketed but the thing is the tax helps cut down wealth inequity by partially funding understaffed agencies like the centers for disease control and prevention and the environmental protection agency and well the irs it s not light reading but then again this stuff matters the point is america is a nation of hoarded wealth and it only makes life harder for those without if you d prefer a more casual primer john oliver s 2014 segment on the subject still rings pretty true

washington oct 22 the federal reserve on thursday banned individual stock purchases by its top officials and unveiled a broad set of other restrictions on their investing activities taking action roughly six weeks after reports of active trading by some us central bank policymakers triggered an ethics uproar advertisement the new rules will limit the types of financial securities the fed s top officials can own including a ban on purchasing individual stocks or holding individual bonds and agency backed securities it also requires a 45 day advance notice and approval of any transaction and stipulates investments be held for at least a year these tough new rules raise the bar high in order to assure the public we serve that all of our senior officials maintain a single minded focus on the public mission of the federal reserve fed chair jerome powell said in a statement in the statement the fed said the new rules were meant to help guard against even the appearance of any conflict of interest in the timing of investment decisions advertisement the new rules were announced after two of the 12 regional fed bank presidents the boston fed s eric rosengren and the dallas fed s robert kaplan resigned after reports of their active trading in 2020 when the central bank launched a massive effort to fight the economic impact of the covid 19 pandemic the fed s efforts helped buoy financial markets on a broad basis active trading by top fed officials will now be expressly prohibited with purchases limited to investments like mutual funds and all transactions vetted in advance by the central bank s ethics officer officials can continue to hold individual stocks that they owned when they took office but would be subject to the one year holding period and the advance notice of any sales advertisement but the new rules will force officials including powell who owns several state and county government issued securities to divest individual bonds that they hold in times of declared financial stress such as occurred at the start of the coronavirus pandemic all transactions will be prohibited atlanta fed president raphael bostic speaking on cnbc said he hoped the steps announced on thursday would let the fed put the ethics controversy to rest and refocus on coming policy debates i am hopeful that swift action will put this behind us bostic said to the fed s sharpest critics on the issue however the new rules were a start but with more still needed in particular to understand whether trading through the pandemic year by different officials violated any laws the new regulations are a very important step forward in restoring the fed s reputation said andrew levin a professor at dartmouth college but along with an existing investigation by the fed s inspector general of prior trading activity he said the central bank should call on the us department of justice and us securities and exchange commission to examine what happened perhaps unique among us government officials fed policymakers not only influence the fate of individual companies or economic sectors like other regulators but have the power to lift asset values far more broadly a fact that made their trading last year a lightning rod beyond the resignations of rosengren and kaplan powell and fed vice chair richard clarida had been criticised for what in other times would have been treated as innocuous transactions involving for example stock index funds in the context of the economic crisis triggered by the pandemic however the disclosures drew demands from leaders in congress for tougher oversight and clouded powell s bid for a second term as fed chief the new rules could head off those demands and dampen the criticism when asked about the fed s new rules on trading a white house spokeswoman said president joe biden s administration respected the independence of the central bank and would not comment on recent developments president biden believes that all government agencies and officials including independent agencies should be held to the highest ethical standards including the avoidance of any suggestions of conflicts of interest she said gregory daco chief us economist for oxford economics said the quick toughening of ethics rules work in his favor with the nomination still likely his to lose focus on regional banks however the issue is unlikely to fully fade particularly with open questions about whether trading by kaplan and rosengren had been reviewed at all by ethics officers at their banks or at fed s washington based board of governors the 12 regional fed banks are quasi private institutions not subject for example to the federal freedom of information act and the selection and oversight of their presidents a subject of frequent calls for reform the ethics controversy has renewed those demands as well as a call for a broader release of any documents detailing whether kaplan for example had advance approval for his multiple sales and purchases of individual stocks this should be the beginning of a comprehensive investigation in what s going on at the board and the reserve banks not the end said aaron klein a senior fellow for the brookings institution a new york times report earlier on thursday said that ethics officials in march 2020 had cautioned fed policymakers about personal securities trading as the central bank geared up for what became a massive and wide ranging effort to battle the pandemic and keep the economy and asset markets from crashing the times said it had confirmed the substance of a march 23 email from the fed s main ethics office ultimately distributed through the system and to all the regional bank presidents advising against what the newspaper characterized as unnecessary trading given the central bank s developing crisis response over the weeks to come the fed would launch programs that touched virtually every asset market and even offered credit to individual businesses following the times story us senator elizabeth warren a democrat wrote to powell asking that the correspondence from the ethics office be released warren has been among powell s harshest critics and in a recent hearing dubbed him a dangerous man for what she regards as inadequate fed oversight of the banking industry she opposes his appointment to a second term as fed chief reuters
