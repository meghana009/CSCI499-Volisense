fed officials surprised financial markets last week when their forecasts showed they pulled forward their expected timing and pace of interest rate increases from the current near zero level while also kicking off a discussion of when to taper asset purchases from their current us120 billion 160 billion monthly pace the quarterly projections showed 13 of 18 officials favoured at least one rate increase by the end of 2023 versus seven in march eleven officials saw at least two hikes by the end of that year in addition seven of them saw a move as early as 2022 up from four the projections also showed that officials sense of risk and uncertainty around their inflation forecasts moved higher the fed s signals on inflation vigilance had an immediate impact on financial markets raising short term rates and flattening long term yields narrowing the spread between 5 year and 30 year treasury yields advertisement powell continued to sound optimistic on the outlook for employment in his congressional testimony job gains should pick up in coming months as vaccinations rise easing some of the pandemic related factors currently weighing them down he said some fed officials estimate that the central bank may need to tighten policy sooner than it expects and the publication of powell s testimony followed remarks earlier on monday from his colleagues on both sides of that debate john williams president of the new york fed said he expects bottlenecks and imbalances produced by a strong recovery to subside bringing inflation down to around 2 per cemt next year and in 2023 it goes without saying that there is a great deal of uncertainty about the inflation outlook and i will be watching the data closely williams told the midsize bank coalition of america dallas fed president robert kaplan said he favours starting the process of tapering the central bank s ongoing bond purchases sooner rather than later while his counterpart from st louis james bullard called it appropriate that policy makers last week opened the taper debate neither bullard or kaplan votes on the federal open market committee this year us central bankers predicted that their preferred price measure the personal consumption expenditures price index would rise 3 4 per cent this year and then decelerate to 2 1 per cent and 2 2 per cent over the next two years according to median estimates the most recent reading on inflation the consumer price index rose 5 per cent in may from a year earlier bloomberg
fed by relentless demand for leverage and hedging strategies the crypto derivatives complex is getting bigger ever more liquid and increasingly influential with bitcoin still up around 250 per cent over the past year despite heart stopping swings and the recent downslide new venues of speculation from decentralised finance to futures contracts have exploded to meet the insatiable appetite to trade consider the options market an average us1 4 billion in notional amount changed hands every day last month at the largest options exchange deribit a nearly 13 fold jump from 2020 open interest in bitcoin contracts now totals us7 billion and a growing cohort of money managers and retail traders are selling crypto options for yield a common strategy in mainstream assets and a sign the industry is growing up fast options change hands on the cme the largest derivatives exchange in the world in addition to more specialised venues like binance huobi and ledgerprime s sister company ledgerx even goldman sachs group is mulling a move into ether derivatives advertisement glorified casino to critics it s all a glorified largely unregulated casino with little real world utility that could easily come crashing down with chinese regulatory curbs the latest threat yet in tang s telling the industry bears similarities to his old stomping grounds on wall street with tried and tested systematic strategies in stocks and bonds gaining popularity in the world of virtual currencies like traditional market makers tang s firm posts bid and ask quotes on options venues and makes money from the spread which tends to be wider in more volatile assets still this is crypto of course a wild west liquidations can happen before a trader has the chance to top up collateral and there s no central clearing house so ledgerprime needs to manage its positions at every venue individually all this helps explain why bitcoin slid precipitously last month it s not like they ll slowly liquidate your positions they basically just market sell or market buy your leveraged positions and blast through the book tang said referring to the exchanges for many the mania is part of the appeal new products appear so quickly that even as one inefficiency narrows another soon materialises across one of the hundreds of exchanges out there and all these opportunities are drawing a more professional crowd with institutional investors representing some 80 per cent of flows on deribit advertisement a hot trend right now is selling options for yield in a wager that crypto price swings will be lower than the market has priced in since that s akin to earning premiums on an insurance policy it can be hugely profitable and risky with an asset like bitcoin the token s one month implied volatility a key variable in option pricing trades around 100 and soared to as high as 165 in last month s wipeout according to deribit the s p 500 equivalent right now around 18 selling crypto options is proving especially lucrative as returns diminish in trades like the spot futures basis in the absence of interesting yields for these alternatives option strategies become more relevant said deribit chief commercial officer luuk strijers the upshot of all this is that option volumes are getting big enough to sway spot prices dealers like ledgerprime buy underlying tokens to hedge their own exposure adding momentum to both rallies and retreats in what s known as a gamma squeeze tang s tip watch spot moves around 4am in new york every friday when most options contracts expire option flow can definitely drive some of the shorter term price action tang said longer term it s still supply and demand bloomberg
two minnesotans have been charged in connection to an illegal pump and dump stock manipulation scheme the u s attorney s office said 42 year old mark allen miller of breezy point 59 year old saeid jaberian of hopkins and 35 year old christopher james rajkaran of queens new york are charged with conspiracy to commit securities fraud securities fraud and wire fraud the trio allegedly used their control over dormant public shell companies to fraudulently manipulate and pump up the price of the companies stock so they could profit from the sale of stock to unwitting investors miller and jaberian haven t yet made their initial court appearances
this is the story about an oil play that so far has lived up to its promise namibia is the setting and a little known canadian explorer is the protagonist it was the speculative investment of 2020 but now we think it s being de risked following two successful drill results and its stock price has been flying as a result the first interview we had with the founder craig steinke was very well received by our readers who were very impressed with what reconnaissance energy africa tsxv reco otc recaf had accomplished in such a short time but since then it has been speculated that certain hedge funds have been spreading disinformation due to large naked short positions and we wanted to get craig on the phone again to set a few things right in the interview we discuss what investors can expect from the coming results why recon could be sitting on a large field with just their first 2 wells why log and core data results could result in substantial investor and industry interest why their esg program is creating such a positive impact within namibia how the kavango region would benefit from a commercial oil discovery what they expect the 2d seismic to show when the core data analysis will be completed what to expect during the summer months what investors should keep their eyes on as new releases come out exactly how well known geochemist dan jarvie is feeling about the results to date james stafford we only spoke a few weeks ago but a lot has happened since then tell me about what you have found in the first part of well 2 what does this actually mean for the basin and the chance of this turning into a producing field craig steinke results from the first part of the second well further confirmed an active conventional petroleum system in this basin the oil and gas shows are very similar to what we saw in the first well 16 km to the south this suggests connectivity between the two wells and a potentially large field although the upcoming seismic survey will better define this possible connection js you mention in both releases about well 1 and well 2 that you have found a working petroleum system what does this actually mean cs a working conventional petroleum system consists of a mature source rock to cook the organic material to create liquid hydrocarbons a migration pathway for the hydrocarbons to migrate to a conventional reservoir rock a trap and a seal these are the key elements reconafrica and its partner namcor the state oil company of namibia are confirming in order to achieve commerciality in the kavango js how long do you think it will take you to drill the second section of well 2 and what are you hoping to find there following the success of the first section cs we expect to reach total depth of the deeper section of the second well by the first week of july our expectation is we will establish further evidence of light oil and natural gas as we ve seen in the more shallow section this will provide further evidence to confirm reconafrica s expectation that the kavango sedimentary basin is charged with hydrocarbons js i have spoken with a large number of people and it seems that there is a lot of money sitting on the sidelines waiting for the log and core data from well 1 do you think that this is the hard data people are waiting for before really getting behind the company when do you expect we will have the data from well 1 cs given reconafrica holds the rights to the entire sedimentary basin there s no question positive results with this data is going to precipitate much industry and investor attention specifically core analysis is used to define the important elements of a reservoir rock such as porosity permeability fluid saturation and grain density all of these measurements are essential to better understand the potential productivity of the basin reconafrica and namcor are working with some of the industry s best third party evaluators corelabs geomark and netherland sewell based in houston and dallas texas therefore you can be assured the results we have are going to be credible the company expects these results will be released in july 2021 js so in both wells you have found oil and gas shows can this be produced if yes with what you know so far do you think it could be economical to do so cs it s important to remember these initial wells were not designed to produce in keeping with reconafrica s commitment to the namibian government these wells were designed to prove an active petroleum system in this virgin basin having said this the first well was only temporarily capped providing the company and namcor the opportunity to return to the well and test it for production at a later date js so analyzing the data you have schlumberger geomark research corelabs houston texas and netherland sewell and associates dallas texas could you tell us a little about these companies and why they are the best people to be analyzing your data and samples cs schlumberger for example employs 82 000 people and operates in 120 countries core laboratories has been in business for 85 years and is a leading provider of reservoir analysis and production enhancement services all of these service providers are used extensively by the majors and iocs they re the best in the business js can you tell us about your esg program and what you are hoping to achieve for the environment and the people of namibia cs june 3 2021 along with its latest drilling results reconafrica announced a 10 million commitment to esg this is an initial commitment and one we expect will grow based on successfully developing a sustainable energy source the company is working with local and national governments to refine the program but generally it will comprise efforts to achieve carbon neutrality support for higher levels of education for the children in the kavango region better access to fresh water and medical services more sophisticated irrigation systems to achieve higher productivity and measures to protect and regenerate wildlife throughout the region specifically what is very important to many of the adults within the kavango region is higher levels of education for their children they know this is the answer to transcending generational poverty that has stricken the region js it seems that you are working from the highest levels of government in namibia all the way down to the local tribes how are your efforts being received by these groups cs our efforts are being received extremely well particularly in light of the fact the drilling program has established a working petroleum system in the kavango achieving commerciality will transform the economics of the local region as well as greatly assist the national government in achieving their vision 2030 of industrializing their country js this might seem like a rather basic question but i m hoping you can bear with me your first well showed over 660 feet of oil and natural gas indicators and on the first part of the second well you reported 440 feet of light oil and gas now these wells were 16km apart so is this basically an underground river of oil that is flowing towards some geological structures called traps that are basically giant underground storage containers for the oil and judging by the size of the river oil could be stored in huge quantities cs we prefer to not make too much out of this currently but there are definitely similar rock and hydrocarbon characteristics shared between the two wells if the 2d seismic confirms connectivity between these two wells then potentially it could be a rather large field but let s wait to see the results of the seismic js how excited are you with what you have seen from well 2 so far cs i m very excited we either just got lucky on these first two wells or these wells are indicative of what the entire kavango basin holds js in your esg plan i see that you have already drilled 4 water wells for villages could you please let us know what this has done for these people how did they get their water before they were drilled cs providing the rural people of the kavango region with much better access to water is central to our esg program many of us take immediate access to freshwater for granted as we ve always had it if you don t have it it s rather a big deal as there is nothing more essential to life than freshwater fortunately there is a prolific freshwater aquifer 80m to 160m below the surface throughout the most part of the kavango region the sad part is the local residents do not have the financial wherewithal to drill water wells to access it as a consequence mostly women are tasked with hauling approximately 45 pounds of water on their head for up to 10 km each day just try to imagine doing this every day reconafrica has responded to this problem by already drilling four community water wells along with permitting an additional 16 water wells as soon as the permits are ready we will start drilling again it s difficult to understand until you actually meet the residents of kavango how profoundly this changes their lives on a daily basis js our readers were very interested in how dan jarvie was feeling last time with the recent progress how is dan now cs dan is the first to admit we re still in the early stages but he is definitely smiling js thanks for your time craig it sounds like things are coming along very well we are all looking forward to the core results and finding out what is in the deeper part of well 2 for those of you looking to find out more about

squeezes into the top 4 oil and gas companies in the world as well and it s no stranger to the african oil game either total betting big on the region s potential the company has been in the region

to shareholders the group will increase its dividend by 5 to 6 percent per year instead of the 3 percent per year as previously announced total said it s also one of the most conscious companies in the business total checks every box in the esg checklist it is promoting diversity and safety making massive changes in its operations to ensure that its business is environmentally sound and has even committed to going carbon neutral by 2050 or sooner it s no surprise that shareholders are loving its forward thinking approach bp nyse bp is another european energy giant slowly pivoting towards greener energy alternatives bp which has been criticized in the past as being slow and late to the environmental cause could now leapfrog its peers we are still a long way from beyond petroleum but chief executive bernard looney believes that we are only 30 years from a net zero bp he has promised that in september the company will lay out a more detailed plan that shows the path to that destination but he has shown already that there is more to his commitment to net zero than there was to beyond petroleum 20 years ago renewables and natural gas together account for the great majority of the growth in primary energy in our evolving transition scenario 85 of new energy is lower carbon spencer dale bp group chief economist said commenting on the outlook to 2040 baker hughes nyse bkr recently announced what it calls the largest deployment of its remote operations digital technology and this deployment involved all of aramco s drilling operations this is how the company describes what the project entails a single solution that covers data aggregation from the edge real time unified data streaming and visualization data management software development services rig site digital engineers and monitoring personnel in other words what we may call remote drilling in a conversation actually involves a comprehensive push to unify and centralize operations in the upstream industry baker hughes has been doing it for 20 years already and its peers are doing it too according to jegatheeswaran this is the future of the upstream because it s beneficial for everyone involved schlumberger nyse slb is transforming itself to survive and thrive in an oilfield a fraction of the size it was only a few years ago the emphasis is shifting from throwing big chunks of iron and a schoolyard full people at a project to minimizing capital intensity of operations through the digital pso transformation we have discussed here the digitalization of the global oilfield will prove to be very sticky and begin to deliver subscription type returns to both companies slb is ahead of the rest of the oilfield pack with their new energy genvia venture which aims to produce carbon free blue hydrogen through a hydrogen production technology venture in partnership with the french alternative energies and atomic energy commission cea and with vinci construction this new venture will accelerate the development and first industrial deployment of the cea high temperature reversible solid oxide electrolyzer soe technology marathon petroleum nyse mpc is one of the leading e p companies and the owner of the nation s largest refining system with approximately 2 9 million barrels per day of crude oil processing capacity across 13 refineries earlier in the year four of texas largest oil refineries saw widespread damage from the cold snap and could take weeks to repair according to bloomberg the outages could reduce demand for crude but cut the supply of refined products the four refineries include exxonmobil s baytown and beaumont plants marathon petroleum s galveston bay refinery and total s port arthur facility the impact undoubtedly impacted marathon s bottom line but the company is back on track and despite underperforming compared to its peers it s still well positioned for a rebound though canadian oil has had a particularly rough go at it this year canadian natural resources nyse cnq tsx cnq kept its dividend intact after swinging to a loss for the first half of the year while canada s producers are scaling back production by around 1 million bpd amid low oil prices and demand though canadian natural resources kept its dividend it withdrew its production guidance for 2020 however it also said it would curtail some production at high cost conventional projects in north america and oil sands operations and carry out planned turnaround activities at oil sands projects in the second half of 2020 while the canadian energy giant has seen its stock price slump this year it could provide a potentially opportunity for investors as oil prices rebound it is already up over 170 from its march lows and it could still have some more room to run even old school fossil fuel producers are getting in on this race while many of the oil majors have given up on oil sands production companies like suncor nyse su tsx tu who focus on technological advancements in the area have a great long term outlook and that upside is further amplified by the fact that it is currently looking particularly under valued compared to its peers but that s just one part of its business however suncor is also a world leader in renewable energy innovations recently the company invested 300 million in a wind farm located in alberta cenovus energy tsx cve is most known for its oil business but it is also actively investing in renewable energy more importantly however is that it has set truly ambitious sustainability goals for itself aiming to cut emissions by a massive 30 in just 10 years this is one of the most actively traded stocks on the tsx the potential is certainly here for this oil company so for investors who are bullish on the return of the oil markets this is a perfect pick in the canadian market tourmaline oil corp tsx tou is another canadian resource producer focusing on exploration production development and acquisition within western canadian sedimentary basin the company is in possession of an extensive undeveloped land position with long term growth opportunities and a large multi year drilling inventory tourmaline s strong leadership make the company a promising pick for investors looking to take advantage of the tremendous canadian oil opportunities which are due for a strong rebound as oil prices inch higher

by lawrence delevingne boston reuters a small texas investor who caused shares of a real estate investment trust to plunge 39 percent in a day has agreed to pay the company restitution to settle a lawsuit against him a rare development that could embolden other companies to pursue such claims quinton mathews who published his research on companies online under the pseudonym rota fortunae will pay farmland partners inc a multiple of the profits on his short bet in 2018 according to the terms of the legal settlement announced late sunday his research had helped wipe out as much as 115 million off farmland s market value the parties declined or did not respond to requests for comment on the exact value of the settlement mathews conceded that many of the key statements in a report he published on website seeking alpha targeting farmland including allegations of dubious related party transactions and the risk of insolvency were wrong i regret any harm the article and its inaccuracies caused mathews said in the announcement which was posted on twitter and seeking alpha paul pittman farmland s chief executive officer said in a statement that investors already recognize that the company was the victim of a short and distort scheme farmland shares traded at around 12 50 on monday afternoon up from around 5 following the short campaign the company has produced trailing total returns of 12 5 over the last three years about 10 percentage points lower than the specialty reit sector according to a morningstar tracker jacob frenkel an attorney with dickinson wright who has defended companies against allegations of stock manipulation and was not involved in the farmland case said mathews apology and payment could build company confidence to pursue similar claims against short sellers it s highly unusual and refreshing to see a company take on this fight because most will take the short term blow of the attack without pursuing legal vindication frenkel said rodolfo hernandez seeking alpha s current managing editor declined to comment george moriarty the former executive editor of seeking alpha told reuters in 2019 that courts had respected the website s status as a neutral platform and that its staff vetted all posts read more mathews runs a one person investigative research business dallas area based qkm llc and has published more than a dozen articles on seeking alpha farmland s litigation against a hedge fund firm that paid mathews for research sabrepoint capital management lp continues sabrepoint founder george baxter said his firm had nothing to do with the seeking alpha article and that it would defend itself and its employees vigorously against farmland s frivolous claims reporting by lawrence delevingne in boston editing by greg roumeliotis and nick zieminski

sacramento calif gov gavin newsom says california will pay off all the past due rent that accumulated in the nation s most populated state because of the fallout from the coronavirus pandemic a promise to make landlords whole while giving renters a clean slate left unsettled is whether california will continue to ban evictions for unpaid rent beyond june 30 a pandemic related order that was meant to be temporary but is proving difficult to undo federal eviction protections also are set to expire on june 30 california had passed its own protections that applied to more people newsom and legislative leaders are meeting privately to decide what to do part of the negotiations over the state s roughly 260 billion operating budget an extension of the eviction ban seems likely to give california more time to spend all the money to cover unpaid rent but landlords and tenants rights groups are arguing over how long that extension should last the expectation for people to be up and at em and ready to pay rent on july 1 is wholeheartedly unfair said kelli lloyd a 43 year old single mother who says she has not worked consistently since the pandemic began in march 2020 lloyd a member of the advocacy group alliance of californians for community empowerment is supposed to pay 1 924 a month for a two bedroom two bathroom rent controlled apartment in the crenshaw district of south los angeles but she says she s 30 000 behind after not working for most of the last year to care for her two children as day care centers closed and schools halted in person learning that debt will likely be covered by the government but lloyd said she recently lost a job at a real estate brokerage and hasn t found another one yet she s worried she could be evicted if the protections expire simply because the state has opened back up doesn t mean people have access to their jobs she said meanwhile in the wine country area of sonoma county property manager keith becker says 14 tenants are more than 100 000 behind in rent payments it s put financial pressure on the owners who becker says have resigned themselves to it but they have grown weary of the seemingly endless protections which he noted were aimed at addressing a public health emergency and not meant to be permanent we should do our best to get back to the starting point where we were in december of 2019 anything other than that is taking advantage of a crisis he said california has 5 2 billion to pay off people s rent money from multiple aid packages approved by congress that appears to be more than enough to cover all of the unpaid rent in the state according to jason elliott senior counselor to newsom on housing and homelessness but the state has been slow to distribute that money and it s unlikely it can spend it all by june 30 a report from the california department housing and community development showed that of the 490 million in requests for rental assistance through may 31 just 32 million has been paid that doesn t include the 12 cities and 10 counties that run their own rental assistance programs it s challenging to set up a new big program overnight said assemblyman david chiu a democrat from san francisco and chair of the assembly housing and community development committee it has been challenging to educate millions of struggling tenants and landlords on what the law is landlords point to the state s rapid economic recovery as a reason not to extend the eviction moratorium much longer california has added 495 000 new jobs since february in april alone california accounted for 38 of all new jobs in the u s this week newsom lifted all restrictions on businesses heralding it as the state s grand reopening we re getting back to normal carlton said it s time to go back to work it s time to pay the rent while employment among middle and high wage jobs has exceeded pre pandemic levels employment rates for people earning less than 27 000 a year are down more than 38 since january 2020 according to opportunity insights an economic tracker based at harvard university the stock market may be fine we may be technically reopened but people in low wage jobs which are disproportionately people of color are not back yet said madeline howard senior attorney for the western center on law and poverty some housing advocates are asking the state to keep the eviction ban in place until the unemployment rate among low wage workers has dropped to pre pandemic levels it s similar to how state officials would impose restrictions on businesses in counties where covid 19 infection rates were higher while those with lower infection rates could reopen more quickly advocates say they were encouraged when newsom told univision earlier this month that he definitively wants to extend the eviction protections beyond june 30 we re cautiously optimistic said francisco duenas executive director of housing now california we definitely need these protections as part of our recovery

live richer reviewed by experts trusted by millions of readers tiktok isn t just about viral dance videos it has quickly become a popular resource for personal finance advice but unfortunately not all of it is good while there are some legitimate money experts on the app there is a lot of financial advice floating around on tiktok that is misleading or just plain wrong gobankingrates asked personal finance experts to debunk some of the worst money advice on tiktok so if you see any of this pop up on your fyp keep on scrolling starting an s corporation can help you avoid paying taxes in a popular tiktok video a woman claims that if you start an s corporation and you own 100 you can buy everything that you own under that s corporation and you don t pay taxes on anything you purchase because it s considered a corporate expense the video also claims that you can hire your children to work for you for 12 000 per year tax free and gift this expense back to your household why this is wrong the s corporation is only allowed to buy things that are considered ordinary and necessary expenses for its own business said bill smith national director of tax technical services for cbiz mhm s national tax office so for example if it bought a lawnmower that you use to cut your lawn that would be treated as a taxable distribution to you there are legions of cases that discuss using a business as a personal checkbook and they are not limited to s corporations as for the claim that you can hire your children to work for you for 12 000 per year tax free this is likely in reference to the annual gift tax exclusion which wouldn t even apply here the s corporation does not have the annual gift tax exclusion available to individuals which for 2021 is up to 15 000 smith said the standard deduction for 2021 is 12 550 not sure when the video posted so assuming that the child is legitimately working and the compensation is reasonable there would be no income tax although still employment taxes the s corporation would not get to deduct the 12 000 in salary if the children did not work or the compensation was unreasonable she seems to conflate the standard deduction and annual gift tax exclusion there is no aspect to this that involves gifting back to your family household what she seems to be saying is your kids can work tax free but what she implies is that they don t have to do anything to get their 12 550 in 2021 that is inaccurate see 10 financial books that will change your life and finances anyone can teach themselves how to day trade and be successful at it a lot of tiktok personal finance content revolves around day trading and how different users have had success doing it but this is not an investing strategy that experts recommend why this is wrong to be consistently successful at day trading you must have significant capital time and emotional stamina attributes most individuals do not possess said will rhind founder and ceo of graniteshares a new york city based etf issuer with over 1 5 billion in assets under management while first time day traders might initially have beginner s luck they are probably more likely to suffer losses over time they could lose their entire investment or even worse go into debt if leverage was applied it s critical to never speculate with more money than you can afford to lose rhind recommends focusing on building long term wealth instead of short term gains you re probably better off putting your money in a diversified investment vehicle that eliminates the guesswork he said exchange traded funds for example offer tax efficient low cost and transparent exposure to a basket of securities that trade on an exchange just like a stock there are thousands of etfs available that solve for a variety of investment objectives such as capital growth wealth preservation income generation and inflation hedging you can turn 56k into a 1m in 11 years thanks to compounding interest in one tiktok video a woman asks curtisray for financial advice stating that her husband makes 80 000 a year and she makes 56 000 ray recommends that the couple live solely off the husband s income while the woman puts her entire salary into a compound interest account he crunches the numbers and finds that her 56 000 investment will become 1 million in 11 years tax free why this is wrong andrew meadows senior vice president at ubiquity retirement savings notes that living off a single income is easier said than done who making 56 000 a year can go a year without being paid he said even though this example is showing a dual income household the point here is what you re willing to give up additionally you ll have to wait 11 years to get that million it sounds easy sacrifice one year s worth of salary if that s even possible and you become a millionaire in 11 years while it s true that it s tax free your contributions are taxed before going in but you re not taxed on the interest you re not quite getting to a million if you re looking at 2 interest and the account fees i m also not seeing the calculations on the fees there are always fees that folks miss that can erode your savings ray s advice may not be wrong but few financial matters are as cut and dry as he makes them seem finance is a nuanced business and getting rich quick is often only for a select and lucky few meadows said beware of all the things that are left out of this advice if you listen critically you ll find you don t have the info how much is the interest who is this through is that institution insured what are the fees while some things might be true just stringing numbers together using loose logic won t turn around a quick buck i ve always been told if it looks that easy why isn t everyone else doing it and while this might be a sound investment for some one size doesn t fit all don t put a down payment on a house if you re not required to in another tiktok video ray says that it s best to put down the smallest down payment possible and then put the rest of the money you had saved for a house into an account with compounding interest why this is wrong alex klingelhoeffer cfa cfp at exencial wealth advisors said that this isn t necessarily wrong advice but that it may not be the best advice for every person this advice comes from a good place he said if you can borrow at a low rate like you can with a mortgage 3 4 and invest in markets at 7 9 you should usually do that in fact most folks carry a mortgage and have investments as well what this advice ignores is the behavioral side of investing most folks are going to trail markets by a significant amount see the market drop sell and be disappointed in the experience in fact i have seen this happen countless times to folks that come into my office in their 40s having made these exact same mistakes in their 20s in addition a home is a safer investment than the market the issue with this system is it is antifragile klingelhoeffer said if you lose your job experience a poor health outcome or any other issue your investments could be down at the same time you need cash is that money available in a heloc no because if you only have 3 down you haven t got any substantial equity again this comes from a good place and on a spreadsheet i can make anyone a billionaire with enough leverage in the real world the swings will take this strategy down buying into newer cryptocurrencies early will make you rich tiktok user superhexwin suggests buying into new cryptocurrencies like hex as a way to get rich noting that people who bought into bitcoin and ethereum early are now extremely wealthy why this is wrong yes assets can and do go up astronomically famously two pizzas were once sold for 10 000 bitcoin that would now be worth 350 million klingelhoeffer said however the rise of bitcoin doesn t demonstrate that every cryptocurrency on the market will see the same surge in value the main usage of crypto is a greater fool item i e you buy it to sell to someone else klingelhoeffer said there are lots of coins nowadays and 99 of them will be worthless in less than three years why there is a finite supply of people willing to put a large portion of their net worth in crypto and those that do will want some liquidity until there is a coin with a demonstrable real world utility better than traditional banking in terms of functionality power consumption and most importantly legality crypto is just a space to speculate and see if you can hit a winner i don t begrudge folks who go to the casino for the same reason it s fun buy with what you can afford to lose more from gobankingrates

helping you live richer reviewed by experts trusted by millions of readers during the height of the pandemic many people dreamed of going on a cruise again many cruise enthusiasts travel several times per year while others look forward to an annual vacation to get away from it all in the middle of the ocean see 30 cruise secrets only insiders knowfind how the cruise industry can win back travelers when passengers were quarantined for 15 days onboard the diamond princess cruise ship not only did the appeal of cruise travel fade quickly but the u s centers for disease control cdc put in place strict restrictions against cruises along with other types of travel and vacations finally this month cdc has loosened restrictions with the recommendation that only fully vaccinated individuals travel the cdc lightened the classification from a risk of 4 very high avoid travel to 3 high fully vaccinated people may travel the hill reported the cdc guidelines seem to be in line with what most americans planning a cruise want in a recent harris poll survey 59 of respondents said they would seek out a cruise line that mandated all crew and passengers be vaccinated what else should you do to prepare safely for a cruise in addition to recommending vaccinations the cdc has set out specific guidelines for those who are not vaccinated and choose to travel the cdc recommends people who are not fully vaccinated quarantine 7 days after cruise travel even following a negative covid test and 10 days for those who choose not to get tested upon their return on their end before cruise lines can begin sailing their ships must pass cdc safety testing by either running a test trip or agree to only book trips in which 95 of passengers and crew are fully vaccinated yesterday royal caribbean s freedom of the seas set out on the very first of the test runs with a group of 600 fully vaccinated volunteers staff and a cdc employee according to cnn royal caribbean sets standards for cruising and covid 19 safety royal caribbean is amongst the first u s cruise lines to put their own guidelines in place for passengers planning to cruise from miami florida to the bahamas on the freedom of the seas ship royal caribbean recommends all guests 16 and over be vaccinated before sailing guests who are vaccinated must show proof of their vaccine s such as the cdc covid 19 vaccination record card those who are not vaccinated or can t show proof must undergo a covid 19 test before boarding and before disembarking at their own expense the cost of the tests royal caribbean reports on its blog is 136 for both royal caribbean says it is not profiting for the tests but only paying the vendors most people can get covid 19 testing free at any urgent care or even many drugstores but royal caribbean is mandating guests take their tests on site immediately prior to embarking guests are also required to get a test three days before cruising at their own cost at an off site location the cruise line has also designated certain areas including bars lounges and restaurants as areas for vaccinated guests only there will also be separate dining areas for vaccinated and unvaccinated guests says the royal caribbean blog discover are these 3 cruise line stocks a buy as the cruising industry returns the real costs of cruise travel today if you ve been missing your cruises you may be ready to book your next vacation today but how much will it cost expedia com is advertising caribbean cruises from miami florida for as little as 849 per person for six nights if you aren t local to south florida you ll also have to add in the cost of your airline tickets and potentially a hotel in the area depending on flight times and availability if you live close enough to drive you ll want to add the cost of fuel into your budget if you re considering a cruise it may be wise to book now as far back as february thepointsguy reported that cruise prices along with airline ticket prices were already starting to rise if you re lucky you may be able to trade your airline tickets from a canceled trip last year or use credit card rewards points to defray the cost of the trip additionally the cdc recommends picking up travel insurance for your trip as refund policies may vary if you have to cancel your trip for any reason insuremytrip com notes that travel insurance prices vary widely but in general tend to cost 4 to 10 of the total price of your trip read the fine print that covers your credit card benefits before you spend extra cash on travel insurance though some travel rewards cards especially offer travel insurance if you book your vacation using the card can you afford the time off if you re not fully vaccinated it s wise to remember you ll need to add 7 to 10 days quarantine time on to the duration of your vacation your employer might approve a two to three week vacation if you didn t take much paid time off last year but given the labor shortage it s possible your company is short staffed and you may not be able to take that much time off paid or unpaid see how to transition back to a vacation culture in the post covid workplacefind the best ways to split costs on a group vacation in instances where securing time off is an issue you might consider a 3 night cruise from miami to the bahamas for just 299 per person covid 19 testing and the vaccines are generally free so unless you choose certain royal caribbean cruises where you ll pay an extra 136 for tests you won t need to factor that into your budget should you splurge on a cruise as many americans savings accounts surged during the pandemic as they cut back on expenses such as travel dining out and entertainment summer 2021 could be as good as time as any to splurge on a cruise just remember to maintain those healthy savings habits developed during the pandemic and keep funds in your account for a true emergency more from gobankingrates

chairman clyburn ranking member scalise and other members of the select subcommittee thank you for the opportunity to update you on our ongoing measures to address the hardship wrought by the pandemic since we last met the economy has shown sustained improvement widespread vaccinations have joined unprecedented monetary and fiscal policy actions in providing strong support to the recovery indicators of economic activity and employment have continued to strengthen and real gdp this year appears to be on track to post its fastest rate of increase in decades much of this rapid growth reflects the continued bounce back in activity from depressed levels the sectors most adversely affected by the pandemic remain weak but have shown improvement household spending is rising at a rapid pace boosted by the ongoing reopening of the economy fiscal support and accommodative financial conditions the housing sector is strong and business investment is increasing at a solid pace in some industries near term supply constraints are restraining activity as with overall economic activity conditions in the labor market have continued to improve although the pace has been uneven the unemployment rate remained elevated in may at 5 8 percent and this figure understates the shortfall in employment particularly as participation in the labor market has not moved up from the low rates that have prevailed for most of the past year job gains should pick up in coming months as vaccinations rise easing some of the pandemic related factors currently weighing them down the economic downturn has not fallen equally on all americans and those least able to shoulder the burden have been the hardest hit in particular despite progress joblessness continues to fall disproportionately on lower wage workers in the service sector and on african americans and hispanics the fed pursues monetary policy aimed at fostering a strong stable economy that can improve economic outcomes for all americans those who have historically been left behind stand the best chance of prospering in a strong economy with plentiful job opportunities and our economy will be stronger and perform better when everyone can contribute to and share in the benefits of prosperity inflation has increased notably in recent months this reflects in part the very low readings from early in the pandemic falling out of the calculation the pass through of past increases in oil prices to consumer energy prices the rebound in spending as the economy continues to reopen and the exacerbating factor of supply bottlenecks which have limited how quickly production in some sectors can respond in the near term as these transitory supply effects abate inflation is expected to drop back toward our longer run goal the pandemic continues to pose risks to the economic outlook progress on vaccinations has limited the spread of covid 19 and will likely continue to reduce the effects of the public health crisis on the economy however the pace of vaccinations has slowed and new strains of the virus remain a risk continued progress on vaccinations will support a return to more normal economic conditions the fed s policy actions are guided by our dual mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the american people along with our responsibilities to promote the stability of the financial system in response to the crisis we took broad and forceful measures to more directly support the flow of credit in the economy and to promote the stability of the financial system at the onset of the pandemic our actions taken together helped unlock more than 2 trillion of funding to support businesses large and small nonprofits and state and local governments between april and december of 2020 this in turn helped keep organizations from shuttering and put employers in a better position to keep workers on and to hire them back as the recovery continues our facilities were designed as backstops to private credit markets not as replacements once lenders and investors understood that borrowers would have access to emergency loans conditions improved for example yields and spreads on municipal bonds started to fall dramatically following the announcement that some municipal notes would be eligible at our money fund facility and that we were opening the municipal liquidity facility this is detailed in the charts accompanying my testimony over the succeeding months issuance of municipal debt surged over the period from april to december 2020 state and local governments and other muni issuers borrowed almost 380 billion in the private markets at extremely attractive rates and 2020 as a whole saw the highest volume of municipal issuance on record we have deployed these lending tools to an unprecedented extent our emergency lending tools require the approval of the treasury and are available only in unusual and exigent circumstances such as those brought on by the crisis many of these programs were supported by funding from the cares act coronavirus aid relief and economic security act those facilities provided essential support through a very difficult year and are now closed we continue to analyze the facilities efficacy and to review the lessons learned from their establishment and operation and additional analysis is included in my written testimony to conclude we understand that our actions affect communities families and businesses across the country everything we do is in service to our public mission we at the fed will do everything we can to support the economy for as long as it takes to complete the recovery thank you i look forward to your questions municipal bond spreads by rating municipal bond gross issuance by rating review of section 13 3 facilities using cares act funding the corporate credit facilities the primary market corporate credit facility and the secondary market corporate credit facility together the corporate credit facilities were designed to support the flow of credit to large investment grade u s companies so that they could maintain business operations and capacity during the period of dislocation related to the covid 19 pandemic the announcement effect of the corporate credit facilities was strong it quickly improved market functioning reduced default probabilities and lowered spreads of both investment grade and high yield corporate bonds the announcement and presence of the facilities thereby unlocked the supply of hundreds of billions of dollars of private credit without direct government involvement or taxpayer exposure the main street lending program the federal reserve established the main street lending program main street to support lending to small and medium sized businesses and nonprofit organizations that were in sound financial condition before the onset of the covid 19 pandemic main street provided an effective backstop and supported credit provision in the private sector substantially adding to the supply of credit for the smallest eligible borrowers the program was also effective in promoting lending to the locations at the times it was most needed in light of the effects of the covid 19 pandemic the municipal liquidity facility the municipal liquidity facility mlf helped state and local governments better manage the extraordinary cash flow pressures associated with the pandemic when expenses often for critical services were temporarily higher than normal and tax revenues were delayed or temporarily lower than normal the mlf contributed to a strong and rapid recovery in municipal securities markets and thereby helped a wide variety of state and local governments and their instrumentalities issue debt with interest rates at or near historic lows this rapid recovery also led to record new issuance with increased demand from municipal investors including very strong inflows to municipal bond funds and improved secondary market conditions ultimately the increased availability of credit to municipal borrowers helped them maintain employment and capacity by avoiding forced cutbacks in payrolls and other critical operations the term asset backed securities loan facility the term asset backed securities loan facility talf supported the issuance of securities backed by newly and recently originated student loans auto loans credit card loans commercial mortgages loans backed by the small business administration and certain other assets the announcement and presence of the talf substantially helped improve liquidity in the asset backed securities markets including those for commercial mortgage backed securities and collateralized loan obligations and contributed to rapid improvement in credit markets for consumers and businesses ultimately the talf helped promote the longer term market based financing that is critical to the real economy

austin texas business wire anebulo pharmaceuticals inc nasdaq aneb anebulo or the company a clinical stage biotechnology company developing novel solutions for people suffering from cannabinoid intoxication and substance addiction today reported recent business highlights and announced financial results for the fiscal year 2021 third quarter ended march 31 2021 business highlights for the quarter and recent weeks include the following completed an initial public offering ipo of 3 078 224 shares of common stock at 7 00 per share resulting in gross cash proceeds to the company of approximately 20 2 million before deducting underwriting discounts commissions and expenses on may 7 2021 the company s common stock began trading on the nasdaq capital market under the symbol aneb management believes ipo net proceeds of 19 0 million provide adequate funding for the company s planned business operations and clinical studies through december 31 2022 anebulo remains on track to commence a phase 2 proof of concept clinical trial with aneb 001 for the treatment of cannabinoid overdose in the fourth quarter of 2021 with anticipated topline results in the first half of 2022 the planned phase 2 study will take place at a single site in the netherlands the study is expected to enroll 100 healthy volunteers with each to receive 10 mg of thc orally and then randomized to one of three doses of aneb 001 or placebo the study has been approved by the necessary regulatory and ethics committee and contract research organization capacity has been secured management commentary the pricing of our ipo in may was a tremendous milestone for anebulo as the capital we raised allows us to advance our lead drug candidate aneb 001 for the treatment of patients with cannabinoid intoxication stated daniel schneeberger md chief executive officer of anebulo there are currently no effective therapies for the negative effects of cannabinoid intoxication and the unmet need to address this issue is growing in lockstep with an increasing number of states legalizing cannabis for medical and recreational use the number of cannabis associated emergency department visits has increased by 15 annually since cannabis legalization began in the u s and reached 1 7 million in 2018 according to our analysis of national emergency department sample overdoses from the ingestion of edible products and synthetic cannabinoids and accidental pediatric overdoses in particular are indications with high unmet medical need we believe aneb 001 has the ability to reverse these adverse symptoms within one hour of administration anebulo believes aneb 001 is an asset with a well understood mechanism of action aneb 001 is a competitive antagonist at the human cb1 receptor with an affinity of 0 6nm with good oral bioavailability and brain penetration brain plasma ratio 1 5 aneb 001 has been shown to antagonize thc induced hypolocomotion in mice a cb1 receptor mediated response aneb 001 is being developed to be administered as an oral treatment in the form of a pill capsule or tablet reaches potentially therapeutic blood levels within 30 minutes and is believed to rapidly reverse the signs and symptoms of cannabinoid overdose in as little as one hour anebulo believes there is a low likelihood of drug drug interactions as preclinical testing demonstrated that aneb 001 does not inhibit the metabolic cytochromes 1a2 2c9 2c19 2d6 and 3a4 at pharmacologically relevant concentrations anebulo is not aware of any competing products to reverse the symptoms of cannabinoid intoxication that are further along in the development process than aneb 001 third quarter financial results operating expenses totaled 552 131 in the third quarter of fiscal 2021 the company did not

gov gavin newsom says california will pay off all the past due rent that accumulated in the nation s most populated state because of the fallout from the coronavirus pandemic a promise to make landlords whole while giving renters a clean slate left unsettled is whether california will continue to ban evictions for unpaid rent beyond june 30 a pandemic related order that was meant to be temporary but is proving difficult to undo federal eviction protections also are set to expire on june 30 california had passed its own protections that applied to more people newsom and legislative leaders are meeting privately to decide what to do part of the negotiations over the state s roughly 260 billion operating budget an extension of the eviction ban seems likely to give california more time to spend all the money to cover unpaid rent but landlords and tenants rights groups are arguing over how long that extension should last get your top stories delivered daily sign up for fox 11 s fast 5 newsletter and get breaking news alerts in the fox 11 news app download for ios or android the expectation for people to be up and at em and ready to pay rent on july 1 is wholeheartedly unfair said kelli lloyd a 43 year old single mother who says she has not worked consistently since the pandemic began in march 2020 lloyd a member of the advocacy group alliance of californians for community empowerment is supposed to pay 1 924 a month for a two bedroom two bathroom rent controlled apartment in the crenshaw district of south los angeles but she says she s 30 000 behind after not working for most of the last year to care for her two children as daycare centers closed and schools halted in person learning that debt will likely be covered by the government but lloyd said she recently lost a job at a real estate brokerage and hasn t found another one yet she s worried she could be evicted if the protections expire related simply because the state has opened back up doesn t mean people have access to their jobs she said meanwhile in the wine country area of sonoma county property manager keith becker says 14 tenants are more than 100 000 behind in rent payments it s put financial pressure on the owners who becker says have resigned themselves to it but they have grown weary of the seemingly endless protections which he noted were aimed at addressing a public health emergency and not meant to be permanent we should do our best to get back to the starting point where we were in december of 2019 anything other than that is taking advantage of a crisis he said california has 5 2 billion to pay off people s rent money from multiple aid packages approved by congress that appears to be more than enough to cover all of the unpaid rent in the state according to jason elliott senior counselor to newsom on housing and homelessness but the state has been slow to distribute that money and it s unlikely it can spend it all by june 30 a report from the california department housing and community development showed that of the 490 million in requests for rental assistance through may 31 just 32 million has been paid that doesn t include the 12 cities and 10 counties that run their own rental assistance programs it s challenging to set up a new big program overnight said assemblyman david chiu a democrat from san francisco and chair of the assembly housing and community development committee it has been challenging to educate millions of struggling tenants and landlords on what the law is landlords point to the state s rapid economic recovery as a reason not to extend the eviction moratorium much longer california has added 495 000 new jobs since february in april alone california accounted for 38 of all new jobs in the u s this week newsom lifted all restrictions on businesses heralding it as the state s grand reopening we re getting back to normal carlton said it s time to go back to work it s time to pay the rent while employment among middle and high wage jobs has exceeded pre pandemic levels employment rates for people earning less than 27 000 a year are down more than 38 since january 2020 according to opportunity insights an economic tracker based at harvard university the stock market may be fine we may be technically reopened but people in low wage jobs which are disproportionately people of color are not back yet said madeline howard senior attorney for the western center on law and poverty some housing advocates are asking the state to keep the eviction ban in place until the unemployment rate among low wage workers has dropped to pre pandemic levels it s similar to how state officials would impose restrictions on businesses in counties where covid 19 infection rates were higher while those with lower infection rates could reopen more quickly advocates say they were encouraged when newsom told univision earlier this month that he definitively wants to extend the eviction protections beyond june 30 we re cautiously optimistic said francisco duenas executive director of housing now california we definitely need these protections as part of our recovery

ruth sunderland ten reasons why we mustn t let morrisons fall to the pandemic predators the 5 5 billion swoop on supermarket group wm morrison by u s private equity vultures is the most outrageous takeover bid for a british retailer since sir philip green launched his failed tilt at marks spencer in 2004 the bid by clayton dubilier rice is just the latest and most blatant example of how buyout barons are seeking to exploit the low share prices of important uk firms hit by covid and brexit more than 52 billion of private equity takeovers of british companies have been waved through with barely a raised eyebrow since the pandemic began but this assault on one of this country s most important food retailers should finally prompt ministers to halt the wholesale sell out the shameless audacity of the bid shows why the daily mail s campaign against private equity barons is so timely the 5 5 billion swoop on supermarket group wm morrison by u s private equity vultures is the most outrageous takeover bid for a british retailer since sir philip green launched his failed tilt at marks spencer in 2004 the morrisons board has rejected the offer as too low that is true but it s beside the point a sale to such an opportunistic bidder should not go through at any price supermarkets are a vital part of our communities and should not be flogged off to faceless american kingpins whose business model is based on maximising short term profits no matter what the collateral damage shareholders government ministers consumer groups taxpayers and trades unions must stop this predatory raid in its tracks here are ten reasons why private equity must never be permitted to take control at morrisons 1 jobs could be at risk morrisons is a very large employer with around 118 000 staff at almost 500 stores many of them women their future would be in the hands of ruthless private equity barons who have no qualms about slashing jobs in order to save costs and bump up profits a daily mail investigation earlier this year found that almost 40 000 jobs have been axed during the covid 19 crisis at firms that are or have been private equity owned the board of morrisons is understood to be seeking assurances and commitments from cd r on employment past experience with private equity is that these cannot be enforced and often are not worth the paper they are written on morrisons is a very large employer with around 118 000 staff at almost 500 stores many of them women their future would be in the hands of ruthless private equity barons who have no qualms about slashing jobs in order to save costs and bump up profits 2 a bad deal for consumers under private equity ownership companies are put under enormous pressure to strip out costs and maximise profits as a result some previous takeovers have resulted in dearer prices for shoppers this includes at poundworld where as the name suggests everything was sold for 1 until private equity took over and introduced items with higher price tags in previous private equity retail disasters including debenhams there has been a lack of investment which resulted in dowdy stores prompting shoppers to defect to rivals under private equity ownership companies are put under enormous pressure to strip out costs and maximise profits 3 farmers thrown to the wolves many farmers are already having a tough time due to brexit a private equity takeover of morrisons could spell yet more difficulty because the supermarket chain plays a huge role in the uk s agricultural sector morrisons unique relationship with british farmers will be threatened under a profit obsessed u s owner the chain buys directly from 2 700 farmers some of whom have been suppliers for decades but what price these cherished ties if the american locusts take control morrisons sells 100 pc british fresh meat milk and eggs but under private equity long standing suppliers may be dumped in favour of cheaper options possibly from overseas regardless of the fact that 70 per cent of customers say they prefer british food morrisons also owns 19 food manufacturing sites and has its own abattoirs fishing fleets and egg farms a quarter of what it sells comes from its own supply chain but these are just the kind of assets that private equity likes to dismantle and sell off to the highest bidder many farmers are already having a tough time due to brexit a private equity takeover of morrisons could spell yet more difficulty because the supermarket chain plays a huge role in the uk s agricultural sector 4 britain s food supply in peril we all saw how precarious our food supplies can be at the start of the pandemic when panic buying briefly took hold would morrisons ability to cope with a future emergency be compromised if it fell into the hands of profit obsessed u s private equity owners who weakened the company through debt and asset sales can we really afford to put this to the test we all saw how precarious our food supplies can be at the start of the pandemic when panic buying briefly took hold 5 dangers of debt high levels of debt are an integral part of how private equity works and a takeover of morrisons which has a net debt of 3 2 billion is likely to be no different debt financing ramps up the returns when things go well and is highly tax efficient unfortunately it also ramps up the risks and makes companies less resilient when times are tough high levels of debt are an integral part of how private equity works and a takeover of morrisons which has a net debt of 3 2 billion is likely to be no different 6 fat cats will cash in again top executives at morrisons will be in line to receive multi million pound paydays if the private equity takeover succeeds they therefore have a strong incentive to favour it regardless of the possible harmful consequences for the country as a whole based on a 5 5 billion price chief executive david potts could receive nearly 18 million in return for his shares and incentives morrisons has already been in hot water after shareholders this month staged a huge revolt over potts s 1 7 million bonus for last year which he was awarded despite the fact that company profits had halved in the pandemic 7 finances can be shrouded in secrecy at present as a company that is listed on the stock market morrisons has to publish copious information on its finances under private equity ownership it would be obliged to reveal much less bosses pay could remain confidential which would no doubt suit the morrisons chiefs after their brutal battle with shareholders over snouts in the trough during covid 8 a rather cosy deal a takeover by cd r would mean a lucrative reunion for a group of former colleagues at tesco sir terry leahy the former tesco boss is an adviser to the buyout firm whilst at tesco he worked with david potts now the morrisons chief executive and with andrew higginson the chairman 9 an asset stripping agenda morrisons owns the freehold on 85 per cent of its supermarkets warehouses and manufacturing sites these valuable properties are a prime attraction for private equity bidders who typically asset strip firms in so called sale and leaseback deals as the name suggests these involve selling properties and then leasing them back to the company this can create long term problems as happened with debenhams if companies are locked into onerous rent agreements morrisons owns the freehold on 85 per cent of its supermarkets warehouses and manufacturing sites these valuable properties are a prime attraction for private equity bidders who typically asset strip firms in so called sale and leaseback deals 10 don t feed the vultures if a private equity bid for a company of the stature and national importance of morrisons is allowed to proceed it won t stop there it will simply encourage the vulture capitalists to believe they can gorge themselves on the rest of our best loved retailers asda has already fallen into the hands of the issa brothers two petrol station entrepreneurs from blackburn in a heavily indebted deal backed by private equity firm tdr sainsbury where a czech billionaire daniel kretinsky owns a 10 per cent stake has been tipped as a private equity target and there are rumours in the city that tesco and m s could be in the frame if morrisons falls it s a sign that no company is safe
this is the story about an oil play that so far has lived up to its promise namibia is the setting and a little known canadian explorer is the protagonist it was the speculative investment of 2020 but now we think it s being de risked following two successful drill results and its stock price has been flying as a result the first interview we had with the founder craig steinke was very well received by our readers who were very impressed with what reconnaissance energy africa tsxv reco otc recaf had accomplished in such a short time but since then it has been speculated that certain hedge funds have been spreading disinformation due to large naked short positions and we wanted to get craig on the phone again to set a few things right in the interview we discuss what investors can expect from the coming results why recon could be sitting on a large field with just their first 2 wells why log and core data results could result in substantial investor and industry interest why their esg program is creating such a positive impact within namibia how the kavango region would benefit from a commercial oil discovery what they expect the 2d seismic to show when the core data analysis will be completed what to expect during the summer months what investors should keep their eyes on as new releases come out exactly how well known geochemist dan jarvie is feeling about the results to date james stafford we only spoke a few weeks ago but a lot has happened since then tell me about what you have found in the first part of well 2 what does this actually mean for the basin and the chance of this turning into a producing field craig steinke results from the first part of the second well further confirmed an active conventional petroleum system in this basin the oil and gas shows are very similar to what we saw in the first well 16 km to the south this suggests connectivity between the two wells and a potentially large field although the upcoming seismic survey will better define this possible connection js you mention in both releases about well 1 and well 2 that you have found a working petroleum system what does this actually mean cs a working conventional petroleum system consists of a mature source rock to cook the organic material to create liquid hydrocarbons a migration pathway for the hydrocarbons to migrate to a conventional reservoir rock a trap and a seal these are the key elements reconafrica and its partner namcor the state oil company of namibia are confirming in order to achieve commerciality in the kavango js how long do you think it will take you to drill the second section of well 2 and what are you hoping to find there following the success of the first section cs we expect to reach total depth of the deeper section of the second well by the first week of july our expectation is we will establish further evidence of light oil and natural gas as we ve seen in the more shallow section this will provide further evidence to confirm reconafrica s expectation that the kavango sedimentary basin is charged with hydrocarbons js i have spoken with a large number of people and it seems that there is a lot of money sitting on the sidelines waiting for the log and core data from well 1 do you think that this is the hard data people are waiting for before really getting behind the company when do you expect we will have the data from well 1 cs given reconafrica holds the rights to the entire sedimentary basin there s no question positive results with this data is going to precipitate much industry and investor attention specifically core analysis is used to define the important elements of a reservoir rock such as porosity permeability fluid saturation and grain density all of these measurements are essential to better understand the potential productivity of the basin reconafrica and namcor are working with some of the industry s best third party evaluators corelabs geomark and netherland sewell based in houston and dallas texas therefore you can be assured the results we have are going to be credible the company expects these results will be released in july 2021 js so in both wells you have found oil and gas shows can this be produced if yes with what you know so far do you think it could be economical to do so cs it s important to remember these initial wells were not designed to produce in keeping with reconafrica s commitment to the namibian government these wells were designed to prove an active petroleum system in this virgin basin having said this the first well was only temporarily capped providing the company and namcor the opportunity to return to the well and test it for production at a later date js so analyzing the data you have schlumberger geomark research corelabs houston texas and netherland sewell and associates dallas texas could you tell us a little about these companies and why they are the best people to be analyzing your data and samples cs schlumberger for example employs 82 000 people and operates in 120 countries core laboratories has been in business for 85 years and is a leading provider of reservoir analysis and production enhancement services all of these service providers are used extensively by the majors and iocs they re the best in the business js can you tell us about your esg program and what you are hoping to achieve for the environment and the people of namibia cs june 3 2021 along with its latest drilling results reconafrica announced a 10 million commitment to esg this is an initial commitment and one we expect will grow based on successfully developing a sustainable energy source the company is working with local and national governments to refine the program but generally it will comprise efforts to achieve carbon neutrality support for higher levels of education for the children in the kavango region better access to fresh water and medical services more sophisticated irrigation systems to achieve higher productivity and measures to protect and regenerate wildlife throughout the region specifically what is very important to many of the adults within the kavango region is higher levels of education for their children they know this is the answer to transcending generational poverty that has stricken the region js it seems that you are working from the highest levels of government in namibia all the way down to the local tribes how are your efforts being received by these groups cs our efforts are being received extremely well particularly in light of the fact the drilling program has established a working petroleum system in the kavango achieving commerciality will transform the economics of the local region as well as greatly assist the national government in achieving their vision 2030 of industrializing their country js this might seem like a rather basic question but i m hoping you can bear with me your first well showed over 660 feet of oil and natural gas indicators and on the first part of the second well you reported 440 feet of light oil and gas now these wells were 16km apart so is this basically an underground river of oil that is flowing towards some geological structures called traps that are basically giant underground storage containers for the oil and judging by the size of the river oil could be stored in huge quantities cs we prefer to not make too much out of this currently but there are definitely similar rock and hydrocarbon characteristics shared between the two wells if the 2d seismic confirms connectivity between these two wells then potentially it could be a rather large field but let s wait to see the results of the seismic js how excited are you with what you have seen from well 2 so far cs i m very excited we either just got lucky on these first two wells or these wells are indicative of what the entire kavango basin holds js in your esg plan i see that you have already drilled 4 water wells for villages could you please let us know what this has done for these people how did they get their water before they were drilled cs providing the rural people of the kavango region with much better access to water is central to our esg program many of us take immediate access to fresh water for granted as we ve always had it if you don t have it it s rather a big deal as there is nothing more essential to life than fresh water fortunately there is a prolific freshwater aquifer 80m to 160m below the surface throughout the most part of the kavango region the sad part is the local residents do not have the financial wherewithal to drill water wells to access it as a consequence mostly women are tasked with hauling approximately 45 pounds of water on their head for up to 10 km each day just try to imagine doing this every day reconafrica has responded to this problem by already drilling four community water wells and along with permitting and additional 16 water wells as soon as the permits are ready we will start drilling again it s difficult to understand until you actually meet the residents of kavango of how profoundly this changes their lives on a daily basis js our readers were very interested in how dan jarvie was feeling last time with the recent progress how is dan now cs dan is the first to admit we re still in the early stages but he is definitely smiling js thanks for your time craig it sounds like things are coming along very well we are all looking forward to the core results and finding out what is in the deeper part of well 2 for those of you looking to find out

companies and the owner of the nation s largest refining system with approximately 2 9 million barrels per day of crude oil processing capacity across 13 refineries earlier in the year four of texas largest oil refineries saw widespread damage from the cold snap and could take weeks to repair according to bloomberg the outages could reduce demand for crude but cut the supply of refined products the four refineries include exxonmobil s baytown and beaumont plants marathon petroleum s galveston bay refinery and total s port arthur facility the impact undoubtedly impacted marathon s bottom line but the company is back on track and despite underperforming compared to its peers it s still well positioned for a rebound though canadian oil has had a particularly rough go at it this year canadian natural resources nyse cnq tsx cnq kept its dividend intact after swinging to a loss for the first half of the year while canada s producers are scaling back production by around 1 million bpd amid low oil prices and demand though canadian natural resources kept its dividend it withdrew its production guidance for 2020 however it also said it would curtail some production at high cost conventional projects in north america and oil sands operations and carry out planned turnaround activities at oil sands projects in the second half of 2020 while the canadian energy giant has seen its stock price slump this year it could provide a potentially opportunity for investors as oil prices rebound it is already up over 170 from its march lows and it could still have some more room to run even old school fossil fuel producers are getting in on this race while many of the oil majors have given up on oil sands production companies like suncor nyse su tsx tu who focus on technological advancements in the area have a great long term outlook and that upside is further amplified by the fact that it is currently looking particularly under valued compared to its peers but that s just one part of its business however suncor is also a world leader in renewable energy innovations recently the company invested 300 million in a wind farm located in alberta cenovus energy tsx cve is most known for its oil business but it is also actively investing in renewable energy more importantly however is that it has set truly ambitious sustainability goals for itself aiming to cut emissions by a massive 30 in just 10 years this is one of the most actively traded stocks on the tsx the potential is certainly here for this oil company so for investors who are bullish on the return of the oil markets this is a perfect pick in the canadian market tourmaline oil corp tsx tou is another canadian resource producer focusing on exploration production development and acquisition within western canadian sedimentary basin the company is in possession of an extensive undeveloped land position with long term growth opportunities and a large multi year drilling inventory tourmaline s

washington ap the economy is growing at a healthy clip and that has accelerated inflation federal reserve chair jerome powell says in written testimony to be delivered tuesday at a congressional oversight hearing still powell reiterated his view that inflation s recent jump to a 13 year high would prove temporary inflation has increased notably in recent months powell said in the prepared remarks he blamed the rise on several factors including sharp price declines last year at the onset of the pandemic which make inflation figures now compared with a year ago look much larger higher gas prices and rapid increases in consumer spending as the economy reopens coupled with supply bottlenecks have also contributed to rising costs as these transitory supply effects abate inflation is expected to drop back toward our longer run goal powell said referring to the 2 inflation rate the fed typically targets currently however the fed is seeking to push inflation slightly above 2 to make up for the roughly nine years that it has come in below that level powell s remarks follow a meeting of the fed s policymaking committee last week when central bank officials signaled they now may increase the fed s benchmark interest rate twice in 2023 that s earlier than the time frame they set out in march when no rate hike was expected until after 2023 powell also said the fed had formally begun discussing when and how the central bank might reduce the current 120 billion a month of treasurys and mortgage backed bonds that the fed is purchasing each month both moves were seen as evidence that the fed wanted to signal it was prepared to keep inflation in check without initially taking any steps to pull back on its efforts to stimulate the economy powell will testify tuesday before a congressional oversight panel about the fed s unprecedented steps last year to provide extraordinary support to financial markets at the outset of the pandemic including the first purchases of corporate bonds in the fed s history separately some fed officials are also making it clear that they are ready to lift interest rates even earlier on friday st louis federal reserve president james bullard said he favored lifting rates in 2022 that caused a sharp stock market sell off higher interest rates generally make stocks less attractive to investors and make bonds a more appealing investment but on monday new york federal reserve bank president john williams who also serves as vice chair of the fed s policymaking committee said that while the economy is rapidly improving conditions have not progressed enough for the fed to shift its monetary policy stance of strong support for the economic recovery i expect that as price reversals and short run imbalances from the economy reopening play out inflation will come down from around 3 this year to close to 2 next year and in 2023 williams said u s stocks recovered most of their friday losses on monday copyright the associated press all rights reserved this material may not be published broadcast rewritten or redistributed

the tech entrepreneur and businessman purchased the farm from jacobs holding ag for an undisclosed sum the lock stock and barrel deal which was brokered by windsor clive international comprises the 1 200 acre hertfordshire farm and the stud s entire blue chip bloodstock portfolio including shastye dam of japan mogul and 14 2 million guineas worth of tattersalls yearlings and newsells park s share of waldgeist s dam waldlerche the 63 year old smith bernal is the founder of opus 2 international the company which has pioneered paperless technology in the legal sector the first major trial to use opus 2 s award winning software abramovich vs berezovsky in 2012 was conducted virtually paperless saving over five million pages of documents opus 2 s cloud based magnum platform is considered an industry standard the world over as well as having been a client of newsells park for the last six years smith bernal also has horses in training with the likes of william haggas john ryan and keith dalgleish he said newsells park stud dates back almost a century and is part of the fabric of british and international horse racing as an existing client i have had the pleasure of witnessing at first hand the meticulous professionalism attention to detail and service provided by general manager julian dollar and his team both in preparing horses for racing and yearlings for the sales ring i consider it a huge honor and a privilege to have acquired newsells park and look forward to building on the legacy of klaus j jacobs and the previous owners to ensure that the stud remains at the pinnacle of breeding and racing newsells park stud was established in 1926 by sir humphrey de trafford whose family owned the property until 1972 among his success stories was breeding the 1959 derby winner parthia and the previous year s st leger victor alcide the current incarnation of newsells park is the vision of german born billionaire klaus jacobs who bought the farm in 2000 the stud which has been run by jacobs family since his death in 2008 is now renowned as one of europe s pre eminent commercial nurseries since the jacobs family purchased newsells park the stud has bred 10 group 1 winners including qatar prix de l arc de triomphe g1 hero waldgeist qipco one thousand guineas g1 victress legatissimo and ladbrokes st leger g1 winner masked marvel it has also stood group 1 winner

newsells park stud chair until the stud s sale said newsells was a passion of my late father he would have taken great pleasure and pride in the stud s many successes and especially waldgeist s win in the arc in 2019 which would have been the culmination of his ambitions as a breeder the time has come now for my family to focus on our other businesses and we know that with graham the stud will find a passionate and successful custodian and owner of newsells park for a new successful journey in both in maintaining and building further on its many achievements newsells park was first crowned leading vendor by gross receipts at the prestigious book 1 of the tattersalls october yearling sale in 2013 and has since claimed the title on four further occasions including the last three years

tenure with gates and the loyalty it has likely engendered had larson not had the professional impact he had it would be a simple yes he should resign said mohamed whose company helps family offices fill leadership positions larson often clad in a pink shirt shies from the limelight and rarely attends conferences for family office professionals a former bond fund manager he won gates s loyalty by delivering consistent returns and instilling in employees the notion that their primary focus was to protect their benefactor s good name according to people familiar with cascade who asked not to be named speaking about the company s inner workings being the investment chief for one of the world s biggest family fortunes might seem like an enviable job for an investor mulling creative bets there s hardly a worry about fundraising client withdrawals or onerous regulations but it often instead involves simply keeping wealth steady the manager had broad leeway from gates on investment decisions they both have said french gates rarely attended meetings in cascade s early days aside from the annual in person gathering and when she did she tended to be a passive participant according to one of the people familiar with the firm she was unaware of most of the allegations involving larson given her lack of ownership of and control over bmgi her spokeswoman courtney wade said in a statement it s unclear where french gates is keeping her money including the more than us3 billion that has been transferred from cascade and whether she s now setting up a family office of her own she also runs pivotal ventures an investment and incubation firm founded in 2015 that focuses on gender and racial equality and employs roughly 90 people conservative mandate being the investment chief for one of the world s biggest family fortunes might seem like an enviable job for an investor mulling creative bets there s hardly a worry about fundraising client withdrawals or onerous regulations but it often instead involves simply keeping wealth steady cascade s assets have periodically been boosted by proceeds from the sales of gates s microsoft stock credit ap aside from detracting attention from the gateses larson s main mandate has been to invest conservatively try to maximise returns but don t lose money one of the people said that reflects the typical investment approaches of big family offices and foundations said raphael amit professor of management at the university of pennsylvania s wharton school the no 1 objective is preservation of capital he said adding that s why family office portfolios are so diverse including not just public equities but also fixed income commodities and assets such as art in a fortune story from two decades ago larson explained that much of his strategy boiled down to countering the swings of microsoft stock at the time the portfolios both for the foundation and for the gateses personal money mostly consisted of bonds with some bets on private equity commodities florida real estate and british hotels that has shifted today cascade holds about us57 billion in public equities ranging from farm equipment maker deere co to track operator canadian national railway to waste management firm republic services companies rooted in the physical world of making moving and selling goods and cleaning things up cascade also owns around 270 000 acres of land enough to make it the single biggest owner of us farmland according to the land report the firm also has been involved in currency and commodities trading venture capital and the development of a property complex in downtown tampa the foundation s most recent tax returns also shows us804 million of corporate bonds and us5 8 billion of other investments like mortgage backed securities bank loans and sovereign debt stable returns cascade doesn t disclose its overall investment performance but financial reports from the foundation offer clues the foundation s assets under management have returned an average of about 8 6 per cent per year since 2001 according to a person familiar with the matter beating the s p 500 index s average annual 7 5 per cent gain over the past two decades that track record is broadly representative of cascade s overall returns another person said credit cascade s assets have periodically been boosted by proceeds from the sales of gates s microsoft stock and warren buffett the billionaire founder of berkshire hathaway has periodically given shares in the conglomerate worth billions of dollars to the foundation buffett is one of the gates foundation s three board members alongside gates and french gates but has no involvement in investment decisions of the endowment according to the foundation one remarkable feature of the portfolio is how little it changes of the 15 stocks listed in the foundation trust s most recent filing which discloses positions traded on us exchanges 10 of them were in the portfolio a decade ago the holdings haven t uniformly jived with the gateses charitable endeavours or priorities which include global health and more recently climate change cascade held investments in oil and gas companies until 2019 it was long the biggest owner of signature aviation the world s largest operator of private jet bases before joining a consortium that took the company private this year and it s the biggest shareholder of republic services which for years has feuded with the international brotherhood of teamsters union whose members are employees loading gates has occasionally made it clear that larson has broad discretion to make investment decisions in a march ask me anything event on reddit a user asked about his purchases of farmland his response my investment group chose to do this
summer 2021 can be full of new experiences even with covid 19 restrictions in place photo via tourism victoria on tuesday may 25 the b c government released their plan for incrementally reopening the province after over a year of covid 19 and over 3 months of indefinite restrictions if you are anything like me you were already a recluse before the global pandemic isolated us all for over a year with an end in sight to restrictions however you are probably more than ready to get out and experience life beyond your front door again in an ideal world getting out and experiencing life would include getting out of the city to see other parts of vancouver island the rest of canada or other parts of the world unfortunately that doesn t look like it will be possible as travel is still going to be restricted this summer the province of b c is not allowing intraprovincial travel until june 15 and does not foresee even allowing travel across canada until july 1 at the earliest but don t worry this does not need to stop you from having an enjoyable summer even though the province is set to remain under such travel restrictions there is ample opportunity to experience the city we live in by becoming tourists in our own town there is so much to see and do in victoria it is really just a matter of knowing where to look here is a list of five different ways you can get out have fun and act like a tourist in victoria this summer 1 go to a market there are several notable markets in victoria the james bay and moss street markets are particularly great options they run every saturday markets are a great way to get outdoors learn about and chat with local artists farmers artisans and so much more there are also local art vendors on the lower causeway of the inner harbour every day one of my particular favourites is ray brunet and his wood whale carvings 2 try a new restaurant in the city victoria was declared the brunch capital of canada for a reason victoria is second only to san francisco in restaurants per capita there are so many great restaurants to try in victoria whether you re craving korean thai pub food all day breakfast or what have you victoria has something to offer everyone one of my personal favourite haunts is sült pierogi bar their pierogies are amazing and so are their homemade sausages some other good local spots are frankie s modern diner a diner with particularly amazing desserts and sookjai thai even if the pandemic has left you with increased social anxiety making it uncomfortable to sit in a restaurant you can still order food to go and enjoy an outdoor picnic in the sunshine 3 enjoy a nature spot you have never been to victoria is an amazing place for enjoying nature with intense hiking trails and scenic beach views within mere minutes of each other pkols mount doug is one of the more popular spots there are plenty of other great locations to go for hikes explore the woods or play in the water however a true hidden gem the christmas hill swan lake nature sanctuary is another spot that boasts it all and if hiking is just not for you that is fine relaxation on the beach is never far away and some of the easiest to access are arbutus cove beach as well as the several small beaches found along dallas road 4 go on a tour i have lived in victoria for three years and i still see new parts of the city every single day specialized tours are available throughout victoria for whatever you might be yearning to experience for example a taste of victoria is a food tour that highlights local restaurants a great way to blend food and tours together this tour emphasizes trying new restaurants while you learn more about the city one of my other personal favourites is the ghostly walks tour which presents the spookier side of victoria s history with a comedic twist to keep the mood light and entertaining the ghostly walks tour is so great that i have been on one almost once a year since i moved here even if you don t want to pay for a tour the city is a great spot to explore alone or with someone close to you 5 visit one of victoria s world famous attractions many of victoria s businesses and attractions are dependent on tourism particularly the cruise ships that dock here during the summer to survive with no cruise ships returning to the city any time soon and no b c based tourism until july at the earliest these businesses are in dire need of local support iconic destinations such as miniature world fisherman s wharf and the victoria bug zoo as well as all of the shops along government street face a desperate situation without their usual annual source of income in reality every local business artist and restaurant needs local support now more than ever in order to keep going so let s not allow the pandemic to take more than it already has even though no one is supposed to leave you can have fun while experiencing the city as if you just walked off of a cruise ship ready to explore so head on down to government street buy a kitschy victoria t shirt and go off to a new restaurant a tourist attraction or experience one of the many beautiful hiking areas in and around the city

uppermost strata of the ultrarich where investment horizons span generations and riskier bets often don t outweigh the value of a good reputation part of larson s job was to help bill gates uphold his image as a wonky billionaire devoted to fixing the world s challenges rather than make bold moves that could draw scrutiny the price some of these guys are willing to pay to stay out of the news is high said tayyab mohamed co founder of family office recruiting firm agreus group advertisement don t want to see this remove ads the divorce and recent revelations about cascade s workplace culture reported by the new york times raise questions about what s next for larson and the fortune he oversees a spokesman for cascade said bmgi is changing its name to allow for the evolving needs of the gates family and their philanthropic work and that the group s investment strategy and organizational structure won t change french gates whose name was added to bmgi in 2014 has been in focus after cascade transferred equity stakes worth more than 3 billion to her leading some in the industry to speculate she s in the process of claiming an even larger control of her share of the riches their combined wealth stands at more than 140 billion according to the bloomberg billionaires index advertisement don t want to see this remove ads larson 61 has admitted that he sometimes used harsh language as alleged in the times reporting but denied that he mistreated staff a cascade representative has said the matters were examined and didn t warrant his dismissal a representative for gates didn t respond to a request for comment mohamed said it s of little surprise that larson has remained in his role after the allegations given his decades long tenure with gates and the loyalty it has likely engendered had larson not had the professional impact he had it would be a simple yes he should resign said mohamed whose company helps family offices fill leadership positions larson often clad in a pink shirt shies from the limelight and rarely attends conferences for family office professionals a former bond fund manager he won gates s loyalty by delivering consistent returns and instilling in employees the notion that their primary focus was to protect their benefactor s good name according to people familiar with cascade who asked not to be named speaking about the company s inner workings the manager had broad leeway from gates on investment decisions they both have said french gates rarely attended meetings in cascade s early days aside from the annual in person gathering and when she did she tended to be a passive participant according to one of the people familiar with the firm advertisement don t want to see this remove ads she was unaware of most of the allegations involving larson given her lack of ownership of and control over bmgi her spokeswoman courtney wade said in a statement it s unclear where french gates is keeping her money including the more than 3 billion that has been transferred from cascade and whether she s now setting up a family office of her own she also runs pivotal ventures an investment and incubation firm founded in 2015 that focuses on gender and racial equality and employs roughly 90 people conservative mandate being the investment chief for one of the world s biggest family fortunes might seem like an enviable job for an investor mulling creative bets there s hardly a worry about fundraising client withdrawals or onerous regulations but it often instead involves simply keeping wealth steady aside from detracting attention from the gateses larson s main mandate has been to invest conservatively try to maximize returns but don t lose money one of the people said that reflects the typical investment approaches of big family offices and foundations said raphael amit professor of management at the university of pennsylvania s wharton school the no 1 objective is preservation of capital he said adding that s why family office portfolios are so diverse including not just public equities but also fixed income commodities and assets such as art in a fortune story from two decades ago larson explained that much of his strategy boiled down to countering the swings of microsoft stock at the time the portfolios both for the foundation and for the gateses personal money mostly consisted of bonds with some bets on private equity commodities florida real estate and british hotels that has shifted today cascade holds about 57 billion in public equities ranging from farm equipment maker deere co to track operator canadian national railway co to waste management firm republic services inc companies rooted in the physical world of making moving and selling goods and cleaning things up cascade also owns around 270 000 acres of land enough to make it the single biggest owner of u s farmland according to the land report the firm also has been involved in currency and commodities trading venture capital and the development of a property complex in downtown tampa the foundation s most recent tax returns also shows 804 million of corporate bonds and 5 8 billion of other investments like mortgage backed securities bank loans and sovereign debt stable returns cascade doesn t disclose its overall investment performance but financial reports from the foundation offer clues the foundation s assets under management have returned an average of about 8 6 per year since 2001 according to a person familiar with the matter beating the s p 500 index s average annual 7 5 gain over the past two decades that track record is broadly representative of cascade s overall returns another person said cascade s assets have periodically been boosted by proceeds from the sales of gates s microsoft stock and warren buffett the founder of berkshire hathaway inc has periodically given shares in the conglomerate worth billions of dollars to the foundation buffett is one of the gates foundation s three board members alongside gates and french gates but has no involvement in investment decisions of the endowment according to the foundation one remarkable feature of the portfolio is how little it changes of the 15 stocks listed in the foundation trust s most recent filing which discloses positions traded on u s exchanges 10 of them were in the portfolio a decade ago the holdings haven t uniformly jived with the gateses charitable endeavors or priorities which include global health and more recently climate change cascade held investments in oil and gas companies until 2019 gates said in his recent book about climate change it was long the biggest owner of signature aviation plc the world s largest operator of private jet bases before joining a consortium that took the company private this year and it s the biggest shareholder of republic services inc which for years has feuded with the international brotherhood of teamsters union whose members are employees gates has occasionally made it clear that larson has broad discretion to make investment decisions in a march ask me anything event on reddit a user asked about his purchases of farmland his response my investment group chose to do this two decades ago larson put it more bluntly when people find out that cascade has made an investment in something that s not bill gates he said in the fortune interview i wish everyone understood that
the sensitivity of highly indebted financial markets to even the hint of a rise in interest rates and a tapering of asset purchases by the fed was on display following the meeting of its policy making body last week a sign for a wall street building wednesday may 19 2021 in new york ap photo mark lennihan there were two main take aways from the meeting the majority of its policymakers consider rates could start to rise in 2023 as opposed to the previous forecast of 2024 and the central bank is now talking about cutting its purchases of financial assets the dow jones index had its worst week since october last year falling by more than 500 points on friday down 3 45 percent for the week while the s p 500 declined 1 3 percent for the day losing 1 9 percent for the week ending a three week stretch of gains after asian markets fell japan s nikkei 255 index lost 3 3 percent wall street rose on monday with indexes recovering most of their previous losses last week s decline came in the face of the fact that the fed took no action as a result of its meeting but merely indicated that it may be prepared to do so in the future and reassurances from fed chair jerome powell he said forecasts of rising rates contained in the so called dot plot in which members of the policy making body indicate where they think rates may go were not a policy commitment and had to be taken with a large grain of salt the nervousness increased on friday when st louis fed chair james bullard told the business channel cnbc he could see an interest rate rise happening in 2022 rather than 2023 bullard who is not currently a voting member of the federal open market committee but will be next year told cnbc that there was more inflation than we were expecting and it was natural that we ve tilted a little bit more hawkish here to contain inflationary pressures bullard indicated that by the end of 2022 there could be two to two and a half years of inflation running at around 3 percent this would meet the fed s new framework of allowing inflation to run above its target rate of 2 percent for some time after which it would take action to try to bring it down amid the gyrations the multibillion dollar question remains what effect will even a small rise in rates or a reduction of fed asset purchases have on highly indebted corporations and financial markets since the market collapse in march 2020 when the 21 trillion us treasury market the bedrock of the global financial system froze the fed has been purchasing financial assets at the rate of 120 billion a month and has kept interest rates at virtually zero the result is that the central bank has expanded its balance sheet from around 4 5 trillion at the start of 2020 to more than 8 trillion with the level set to rise to 9 trillion by 2022 this has brought about a debt binge in all areas of the us financial system with non financial corporate debt alone now standing at 11 2 trillion an amount equivalent to around 50 percent of us gdp the overall sentiment in the market as is the case in all speculative bubbles until they burst is that the good times will persist as the fed continues to pump out more money enabling the historically unprecedented enrichment of the financial oligarchy to continue the latest monthly survey of fund managers of the bank of america found that investors were bullishly positioned for permanent growth transitory inflation and a peaceful fed taper but some warnings are being sounded the chief economist for moody s analytics mark zandi told cnbc that there could be a significant market correction of between 10 and 20 percent the headwinds are building for the equity market the federal reserve has got to switch gears here because the economy is so strong he said however zandi maintained this would not bring about a recession because the downturn would be about over extended asset prices rather than more fundamental issues but this optimistic outlook ignores the fact that the broader economy as indicated by the escalating levels of debt has become completely dependent on the flow of ultra cheap money from the fed the truth is that if there is a significant fall in the financial markets no one least of all the fed knows where it could end up in remarks reported in the australian financial review last week citi s global market strategist matt king said there could be major market instability later in the year the standard view is that provided central banks exit slowly and taper slowly we should be fine i think it s harder than that and that we re now seeing the same underlying paradox that we saw in late 2018 in december of that year markets experienced an abrupt 20 percent fall when the fed indicated that it had more interest rate increases planned for 2019 after four rises each of 0 25 percentages points over the previous 12 months and that it would continue to wind down its asset holdings at the rate of 50 billion a month at that time king noted growth in the us economy was at 3 percent there was a big boost from the trump tax cuts and the s p was making record highs but suddenly there was a 20 percent drop in the s p 500 that threatened to destabilise the economy and the fed was forced to think again as a result of the market plunge powell backed away from further interest rates and announced cuts in july 2019 fully six months before the pandemic arrived and ended the asset wind down king said the paradox was that the more effective policymakers have been in driving up valuations the more dependent markets have become on the continuation of that same stimulus consequently they had become vulnerable not only to a shrinkage of central bank balance sheets or a rise in interest rates but just to a slow down in the stimulus these remarks point to one of the central contradictions of the financial system the more money that is poured into it raising the price of financial assets the less is the rate of return on them this forces investors into ever more risky assets to secure their desired returns creating the conditions for a crash should the money supply be reduced king noted that conventional economic theories hold that markets are an efficient mechanism which anticipate future dividends and then discount them to establish the present value of an asset he said it was simpler than that it s all about these money flows that being the case even a small reduction of these flows can precipitate a major crisis

the critical questions were and remain when it might act and by how much bringing forward the moment when us rates might start to edge up from 2024 to 2023 shouldn t have been a shock to investors who have been focused on inflation readings for much of this year the markets particularly sharemarkets will remain highly sensitive to even the most nuanced of comments from fed officials that relate to the scaling back of its asset purchases or the eventual lift off on interest rates that perhaps underscores how stretched sensitive and vulnerable to even the slightest hint of a change in monetary policy settings sharemarket valuations have become as the post pandemic reflation trade added another surge to the already stretched valuation metrics the most interesting and thought provoking reaction to the news that spooked sharemarkets last week came from the bond market bond yields could have been expected to spike and the yield curve to steepen at the prospect of the fed tapering its bond purchases and bringing forward the moment when it would start to raise rates they didn t earlier this year 10 year rates were climbing apparently inexorably towards two per cent and break even rates were blowing out as investors anticipated the surging inflation rates would force the fed s hand that trade however fell away amidst consistently dovish comments from the fed and that trend continued through last week s sharemarket turbulence bringing forward the moment when us rates might start to edge up from 2024 to 2023 shouldn t have been a shock to investors who have been focused on inflation readings for much of this year credit ap the 10 year bond yield has fallen from 1 58 per cent last wednesday to 1 48 per cent while the yields on two and five year notes rose flattening the yield curve inflation expectations measured by break even rates comparisons of the longer dated securities with their inflation protected counterparts have fallen back the bond market has bought the thesis the fed has been promoting that there will be a near term spike in inflation as the economy bounces back from its pandemic driven nadirs but it will decline relatively quickly once the economy has reopened and is functioning normally it also appears to be pricing in an assumption that the fed will be slow to move and that when it does it will be ultra cautious that fits with the change in the fed s policy framework last year from one which positioned it to act pre emptively to head off an anticipated outbreak of inflation to one where it responds to an inflation rate above its target of two per cent after the fact the break even rates are looking through the near term confusion created by the re opening of the economy amid supply chain bottlenecks travel and other restrictions residual risk aversion and their impacts on the economic data and see growth and inflation rates moderating and normalising in the medium term in quite modest levels the rebound in the sharemarket the dow jones followed up its worst week in eight months with a 1 8 per cent rise and the s p 500 was up 1 4 per cent came despite comments on monday from two federal reserve bank presidents st louis fed s james bullard and dallas fed s robert kaplan suggesting the fed needed to get its foot off the accelerator sooner rather than later their views were counter balanced by those of one of the most influential of fed bank presidents and vice chair of the open market committee new york s john williams williams said that while it was clear the us economy was improving at a rapid rate the data and conditions hadn t progressed enough for the fed to shift its monetary policy stance away from its strong support for economic recovery the markets particularly sharemarkets will remain highly sensitive to even the most nuanced of comments from fed officials that relate to the scaling back of its asset purchases or the eventual lift off on interest rates loading while there has historically been an inverse correlation between interest rates and equity markets the fancy multiples at which stocks are trading the s p 500 at about 30 times earnings and the big tech stocks at closer to 50 times can only be justified if the us economy does continue to rebound and maintains above average growth rates for at least the next couple of years
french gates whose name was added to bmgi in 2014 has been in focus after cascade transferred equity stakes worth more than us3 billion to her leading some in the industry to speculate she s in the process of claiming an even larger control of her share of the riches their combined wealth stands at more than us140 billion according to the bloomberg billionaires index loading larson 61 has admitted that he sometimes used harsh language in response to the times reporting but denied that he mistreated staff a cascade representative has said the matters were examined and didn t warrant his dismissal a representative for gates didn t respond to a request for comment mohamed said it s of little surprise that larson has remained in his role after the allegations given his decades long tenure with gates and the loyalty it has likely engendered had larson not had the professional impact he had it would be a simple yes he should resign said mohamed whose company helps family offices fill leadership positions larson often clad in a pink shirt shies from the limelight and rarely attends conferences for family office professionals a former bond fund manager he won gates s loyalty by delivering consistent returns and instilling in employees the notion that their primary focus was to protect their benefactor s good name according to people familiar with cascade who asked not to be named speaking about the company s inner workings being the investment chief for one of the world s biggest family fortunes might seem like an enviable job for an investor mulling creative bets there s hardly a worry about fundraising client withdrawals or onerous regulations but it often instead involves simply keeping wealth steady the manager had broad leeway from gates on investment decisions they both have said french gates rarely attended meetings in cascade s early days aside from the annual in person gathering and when she did she tended to be a passive participant according to one of the people familiar with the firm she was unaware of most of the allegations involving larson given her lack of ownership of and control over bmgi her spokeswoman courtney wade said in a statement it s unclear where french gates is keeping her money including the more than us3 billion that has been transferred from cascade and whether she s now setting up a family office of her own she also runs pivotal ventures an investment and incubation firm founded in 2015 that focuses on gender and racial equality and employs roughly 90 people conservative mandate being the investment chief for one of the world s biggest family fortunes might seem like an enviable job for an investor mulling creative bets there s hardly a worry about fundraising client withdrawals or onerous regulations but it often instead involves simply keeping wealth steady cascade s assets have periodically been boosted by proceeds from the sales of gates s microsoft stock credit ap aside from detracting attention from the gateses larson s main mandate has been to invest conservatively try to maximise returns but don t lose money one of the people said that reflects the typical investment approaches of big family offices and foundations said raphael amit professor of management at the university of pennsylvania s wharton school the no 1 objective is preservation of capital he said adding that s why family office portfolios are so diverse including not just public equities but also fixed income commodities and assets such as art in a fortune story from two decades ago larson explained that much of his strategy boiled down to countering the swings of microsoft stock at the time the portfolios both for the foundation and for the gateses personal money mostly consisted of bonds with some bets on private equity commodities florida real estate and british hotels that has shifted today cascade holds about us57 billion in public equities ranging from farm equipment maker deere co to track operator canadian national railway to waste management firm republic services companies rooted in the physical world of making moving and selling goods and cleaning things up cascade also owns around 270 000 acres of land enough to make it the single biggest owner of us farmland according to the land report the firm also has been involved in currency and commodities trading venture capital and the development of a property complex in downtown tampa the foundation s most recent tax returns also shows us804 million of corporate bonds and us5 8 billion of other investments like mortgage backed securities bank loans and sovereign debt stable returns cascade doesn t disclose its overall investment performance but financial reports from the foundation offer clues the foundation s assets under management have returned an average of about 8 6 per cent per year since 2001 according to a person familiar with the matter beating the s p 500 index s average annual 7 5 per cent gain over the past two decades that track record is broadly representative of cascade s overall returns another person said credit cascade s assets have periodically been boosted by proceeds from the sales of gates s microsoft stock and warren buffett the billionaire founder of berkshire hathaway has periodically given shares in the conglomerate worth billions of dollars to the foundation buffett is one of the gates foundation s three board members alongside gates and french gates but has no involvement in investment decisions of the endowment according to the foundation one remarkable feature of the portfolio is how little it changes of the 15 stocks listed in the foundation trust s most recent filing which discloses positions traded on us exchanges 10 of them were in the portfolio a decade ago the holdings haven t uniformly jived with the gateses charitable endeavours or priorities which include global health and more recently climate change cascade held investments in oil and gas companies until 2019 it was long the biggest owner of signature aviation the world s largest operator of private jet bases before joining a consortium that took the company private this year and it s the biggest shareholder of republic services which for years has feuded with the international brotherhood of teamsters union whose members are employees loading gates has occasionally made it clear that larson has broad discretion to make investment decisions in a march ask me anything event on reddit a user asked about his purchases of farmland his response my investment group chose to do this

the us dollar appreciated after the fed meeting june 21 2021 12 00 last week was marked by high volatility with the u s dollar rising significantly to more than 2 month highs in a matter of just few days this volatility was mainly driven by the rather unexpected comments from the u s federal reserve on future interest rate rises which forced stock markets to adjust temporarily and the u s dollar to strengthen against other currencies with the bank s tone being tighter than expected usd u s economic indicators remained positive and showed continued growth retail sales in may were 28 1 higher than at the same time a year ago industrial production was 16 4 higher than a year ago while the industrial price output index grew by 6 6 year on year suggesting continued upward pressure on prices especially for commodities the number of new jobless claims rose from 0 38 to 0 41 million a week the u s federal reserve held a meeting but did not make any important decisions the interest rate and bond repurchase program remained unchanged investors were somewhat frightened by the interest rate forecast provided by the bank which shows 2 raises in 2023 which led to a correction in the stock markets but bank chief jerome powell said at a news conference that the dot plot is not an accurate enough tool to assess future interest rates subtly easing market tensions and returning positive sentiment to the stock market the scale of the pandemic continued to slow as the global average for new cases per week fell from 386 to 345 thousand per day the situation in the u s continued to

french gates whose name was added to bmgi in 2014 has been in focus after cascade transferred equity stakes worth more than us3 billion to her leading some in the industry to speculate she s in the process of claiming an even larger control of her share of the riches their combined wealth stands at more than us140 billion according to the bloomberg billionaires index loading larson 61 has admitted that he sometimes used harsh language in response to the times reporting but denied that he mistreated staff a cascade representative has said the matters were examined and didn t warrant his dismissal a representative for gates didn t respond to a request for comment mohamed said it s of little surprise that larson has remained in his role after the allegations given his decades long tenure with gates and the loyalty it has likely engendered had larson not had the professional impact he had it would be a simple yes he should resign said mohamed whose company helps family offices fill leadership positions larson often clad in a pink shirt shies from the limelight and rarely attends conferences for family office professionals a former bond fund manager he won gates s loyalty by delivering consistent returns and instilling in employees the notion that their primary focus was to protect their benefactor s good name according to people familiar with cascade who asked not to be named speaking about the company s inner workings being the investment chief for one of the world s biggest family fortunes might seem like an enviable job for an investor mulling creative bets there s hardly a worry about fundraising client withdrawals or onerous regulations but it often instead involves simply keeping wealth steady the manager had broad leeway from gates on investment decisions they both have said french gates rarely attended meetings in cascade s early days aside from the annual in person gathering and when she did she tended to be a passive participant according to one of the people familiar with the firm she was unaware of most of the allegations involving larson given her lack of ownership of and control over bmgi her spokeswoman courtney wade said in a statement it s unclear where french gates is keeping her money including the more than us3 billion that has been transferred from cascade and whether she s now setting up a family office of her own she also runs pivotal ventures an investment and incubation firm founded in 2015 that focuses on gender and racial equality and employs roughly 90 people conservative mandate being the investment chief for one of the world s biggest family fortunes might seem like an enviable job for an investor mulling creative bets there s hardly a worry about fundraising client withdrawals or onerous regulations but it often instead involves simply keeping wealth steady cascade s assets have periodically been boosted by proceeds from the sales of gates s microsoft stock credit ap aside from detracting attention from the gateses larson s main mandate has been to invest conservatively try to maximise returns but don t lose money one of the people said that reflects the typical investment approaches of big family offices and foundations said raphael amit professor of management at the university of pennsylvania s wharton school the no 1 objective is preservation of capital he said adding that s why family office portfolios are so diverse including not just public equities but also fixed income commodities and assets such as art in a fortune story from two decades ago larson explained that much of his strategy boiled down to countering the swings of microsoft stock at the time the portfolios both for the foundation and for the gateses personal money mostly consisted of bonds with some bets on private equity commodities florida real estate and british hotels that has shifted today cascade holds about us57 billion in public equities ranging from farm equipment maker deere co to track operator canadian national railway to waste management firm republic services companies rooted in the physical world of making moving and selling goods and cleaning things up cascade also owns around 270 000 acres of land enough to make it the single biggest owner of us farmland according to the land report the firm also has been involved in currency and commodities trading venture capital and the development of a property complex in downtown tampa the foundation s most recent tax returns also shows us804 million of corporate bonds and us5 8 billion of other investments like mortgage backed securities bank loans and sovereign debt stable returns cascade doesn t disclose its overall investment performance but financial reports from the foundation offer clues the foundation s assets under management have returned an average of about 8 6 per cent per year since 2001 according to a person familiar with the matter beating the s p 500 index s average annual 7 5 per cent gain over the past two decades that track record is broadly representative of cascade s overall returns another person said credit cascade s assets have periodically been boosted by proceeds from the sales of gates s microsoft stock and warren buffett the billionaire founder of berkshire hathaway has periodically given shares in the conglomerate worth billions of dollars to the foundation buffett is one of the gates foundation s three board members alongside gates and french gates but has no involvement in investment decisions of the endowment according to the foundation one remarkable feature of the portfolio is how little it changes of the 15 stocks listed in the foundation trust s most recent filing which discloses positions traded on us exchanges 10 of them were in the portfolio a decade ago the holdings haven t uniformly jived with the gateses charitable endeavours or priorities which include global health and more recently climate change cascade held investments in oil and gas companies until 2019 it was long the biggest owner of signature aviation the world s largest operator of private jet bases before joining a consortium that took the company private this year and it s the biggest shareholder of republic services which for years has feuded with the international brotherhood of teamsters union whose members are employees loading gates has occasionally made it clear that larson has broad discretion to make investment decisions in a march ask me anything event on reddit a user asked about his purchases of farmland his response my investment group chose to do this
as we enter the 50th year of the war on drugs we need to not only end the policy but also give reparations to survivors for the enormous and politically motivated and strategically orchestrated harm they have endured especially black people to understand the urgent need for reparations we must understand the magnitude of the harm the incestuous relationship between the drug war policing and systemic racism has infiltrated every part of black life police officers with drug sniffing dogs in predominantly black schools but no supportive services that s the drug war black women being extorted for sex in exchange for not being charged with an offense that could destroy their lives that s the drug war immigrants ripped from the only home they have ever known all because of a simple drug possession charge that s the drug war black people like breonna taylor tarika wilson kathryn johnson and george floyd murdered on their blocks and in their homes that s the drug war when richard nixon declared the war on drugs on june 17 1971 it was another way to hold black people down john ehrlichman nixon s domestic policy chief admitted we knew we couldn t make it illegal to be either against the war or black but by getting the public to associate blacks with heroin and then criminalizing heavily we could disrupt those communities adobe stock image nixon s legacy has been successful black people are four times as likely as white people to be arrested on marijuana charges despite nearly identical usage rates across races and account for 30 of all drug arrests despite only making up 12 5 of substance users as a result black people are disproportionately saddled with the lifelong consequences of a criminal record including barriers in obtaining employment and housing lost educational opportunities denial of public benefits and losing custody of their children this systemic racism has been supported across party lines presidents including nixon ronald reagan george h w bush and bill clinton all signed laws and orders that expanded the drug war as an example under reagan drug testing and background checks became commonplace the anti drug abuse act passed in 1988 was the first of many federal directives to evict entire households from public housing if there was just a suspicion that one member used drugs by 2008 the private sector adopted these exclusionary practices with as many as 80 of large apartment companies screening prospective tenants for criminal records the damage that has been done to black communities over the last 50 years is irreversible deeply traumatic and immeasurable that is why we must adopt a reparations approach to begin reckoning with the harms of the drug war although black people in the u s have been fighting for reparations since before the end of slavery and have seen some localized victories we have not yet received large scale reparations for any of the many harms perpetrated against us however reparations are an internationally recognized mechanism to make amends and repair harms the generally accepted idea is that without addressing past harms we are destined to compound and repeat them under the united nations definition reparations includes five components guarantees of non repetition restitution compensation to the extent appropriate and proportional satisfaction and rehabilitation photo by justin sullivan getty images while reparations for the drug war would look different in different states and should be dictated by the communities who have survived it there are some basic tenants reparations for the drug war must start with cessation and guarantees of non repetition this is why decriminalizing all drugs is necessary taking a sledgehammer to the cornerstone of the drug war and removing the biggest excuse law enforcement has to surveil harass cage and even kill black people secondly reparations for the drug war would have to include restitution meaning reestablishing the situation that existed before the wrongful act occurred this means that the hundreds of thousands of people who lost their jobs housing right to vote children and property must get those things back to the extent possible it also means that people who have been convicted and have had to bear the brunt of a conviction will get their records vacated for all the things that the drug war took from people that can not be replaced they must be compensated or given money and resources to make amends for the harm satisfaction the fourth prong of the un definition for reparations addresses emotional injury mental suffering and harm to reputation under this requirement there would have to be an assessment of the range of emotional harms caused by the drug war and an attempt to address them through public acknowledgment honoring those lost public education and memorialization lastly reparations for the war on drugs would include rehabilitation including legal medical psychological and other care services for the communities impacted by the drug war at the least this would require free healthcare drug treatment and therapy the drug war has taken so much from us it s time to decriminalize all drugs and give reparations it s time to give black people what is rightly ours equitable access to employment housing education and healing

overview on may 28 2021 the us department of the treasury treasury released the fiscal year fy 2022 budget and green book which provides detailed insights into the proposals of us president joe biden s recently released american jobs plan and american families plan this article summarizes the key proposals affecting businesses and provides further insight on planning considerations in depth country by country regime to apply to gilti and foreign branch income the current global intangible low taxed income gilti regime operates on a global blended basis such that excess taxes paid in high tax jurisdictions may be used to offset residual us taxes on income earned in low tax jurisdictions the green book raises a concern that global blending incentivizes us companies that have operations in high tax jurisdictions to invest in low tax jurisdictions and us companies that have operations in low tax jurisdictions to invest in high tax jurisdictions in either case per the treasury us companies are encouraged to invest outside the united states whether the foreign tax rate is higher or lower than the us tax rate thus the green book proposes to create a new standard under which a us taxpayer s gilti inclusion and foreign tax credit limitation would be determined on a country by country cbc basis if enacted this proposal would constitute both a significant tax increase and a major compliance and tax administration burden for taxpayers and the internal revenue service irs similar to computing a us shareholder s gilti inclusion and foreign tax credit limitation on a cbc basis the green book would expand the cbc regime to foreign branch income citing the same global blending concerns that exist in the gilti context the treasury was presumably concerned that taxpayers might shift from gilti structures into branch structures if the cbc approach were to extend only to gilti however taking a cbc approach to foreign branch income will introduce additional complexity to foreign tax credit limitation determinations particularly where there is a foreign branch loss in a particular country repeal of subpart f and gilti high tax exceptions the green book proposes to repeal the subpart f and gilti high tax exceptions this proposal goes significantly further than simply revising the high tax threshold upward along with the proposed increase in us corporate tax rates many may criticize the green book proposal as overly burdensome on companies with overseas operations driven by business necessities as opposed to tax benefits the proposal to repeal the high tax exceptions would be especially impactful to companies that use these exceptions to mitigate residual us taxation on gilti or subpart f income where the application of the expense allocation and apportionment provisions results in a foreign tax credit limitation under section 904 principles or where the utilization of losses adversely impacts the section 250 taxable income limitation replacing beat with shield additionally the green book proposes to replace the existing base erosion and anti abuse tax beat with a new tax regime stopping harmful inversions and ending low tax developments shield according to the green book the current beat regime does not adequately address the concern of erosion of the us corporate tax base by inefficiently favoring certain activities over others instead of imposing a minimum tax shield would disallow deductions to domestic corporations or branches with respect to gross payments made to low taxed members of the same financial reporting group as in the case of the proposed excess indebtedness interest disallowance rule a financial reporting group is any group of business entities that prepares consolidated financial statements as determined in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap international financial reporting standards ifrs or other method authorized by the us secretary of the treasury secretary and includes at least one domestic corporation domestic partnership or foreign entity with a us trade or business accordingly the majority of multinational enterprises with us presence would be treated as one or more financial reporting groups for this purpose low taxed members generally means any members of a financial reporting group whose income is subject to an effective tax rate that is below a designated minimum tax rate the designated minimum tax rate is either the rate agreed to under pillar two of the organisation for economic co operation and development oecd g20 inclusive framework on base erosion and profit shifting beps project pillar two agreement or before a pillar two agreement is reached the us global minimum tax would be 21 under the green book proposal this means us parented multinational groups would not be subject to shield as gilti prevents any relevant payments from being low taxed thus this element of president biden s plan would be a rare win for us based multinationals in that beat concerns would be eliminated without any need to contend with the beat replacement regime similar to beat shield provides a de minimis exception under which shield does not apply to financial reporting groups with global annual revenues that do not exceed 500 million notably while beat does not treat cost of goods sold cogs as base eroding payments the green book specifically indicates that under shield other types of costs such as cogs would be disallowed up to the amount of the payment made to low taxed members which would be an extremely harsh outcome for those subject to the new regime in addition shield includes rules that apply to disallow deductions of domestic corporations on an aggregate basis with respect to the entire financial reporting group these rules would treat a portion of payments made to members that are not low taxed as payments made based on the aggregate ratio of the financial reporting group s low taxed profits to its total profits in other words if the financial reporting group as a whole is subject to an effective tax rate lower than the designated minimum tax rate all deductible payments made to other members of the financial reporting group would be subject to shield finally shield provides the secretary with authority to exempt from shield payments that meet a minimum effective level of taxation on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis expansion of section 265 to disallow partial deductions under sections 245a and 250 section 265 a 1 generally disallows a deduction for any amount that is allocable to certain classes of income that is wholly exempt from us taxation this rule does not apply to the 100 dividend received deduction for the foreign sourced portion of certain dividends under section 245a or the 50 deduction of foreign derived intangible income fdii under section 250 because those provisions constitute deductions as opposed to rendering any income wholly exempt from us taxation the existence of section 904 b 4 which the green book would repeal as no longer relevant demonstrates that congress understood that present law section 265 does not apply to deny these deductions the green book includes an interesting footnote that implies present law section 265 could be interpreted as already applying to disallow these deductions but there appears to be no basis for that statement under the current code and regulations the green book describes the current rules as effectively providing a tax subsidy for multinationals foreign investments by allowing a domestic corporation or a foreign corporation with us corporate subsidiaries to receive a deduction against us taxation with respect to certain income derived outside the united states thus the green book proposes to reduce the 50 deduction under section 250 to 25 further the proposal would expand the application of section 265 to disallow deductions allocable to income taxed at a preferential rate through a deduction in addition to deductions allocable to wholly exempt income with respect to such partially exempt income the new section 265 under the proposal would disallow a portion of the deductions under sections 245a and 250 and provide rules for determining the amount disallowed as noted above the green book would also repeal section 904 b 4 which applies to disregard deductions allocable to income from foreign stock other than gilti or subpart f income inclusions for determining a taxpayer s section 904 foreign tax credit limitation excess indebtedness interest disallowance rule originally proposed but not enacted as part of the tax cuts and jobs act tcja legislative process section 163 n would limit interest deductions of multinational corporations specifically members of multinational groups that prepare consolidated financial statements financial reporting groups the green book revisits this concept and proposes a limitation on a financial reporting group member s deduction for interest expense generally the limitation would apply where the member s net interest expense for financial reporting purposes exceeds the member s proportionate share of the financial reporting group s net interest expense reported on the group s consolidated financial statements recognizing some groups may have an administrative burden in calculating and or substantiating their relative us and international interest expense the proposal provides an alternative calculation under this alternative the member s interest deduction would be limited to the member s interest income plus 10 of their adjusted taxable income either limitation would apply in addition to a taxpayer s limitation under section 163 j which was introduced by the tcja section 163 j generally limits a taxpayer s business interest expense deduction to business interest income 30 of their adjusted taxable income and floor plan financing interest the green book describes this change as a way to prevent multinationals from reducing their us tax on income earned from us operations by incurring a disproportionate amount of their debt financing in the united states multinationals may respond by asserting numerous non tax motivated reasons for why their us operations and non us operations might require differing amounts of leverage more importantly unlike earlier versions of the proposal the green book version would not apply to us based multinationals fdii repeal and introduction of r d regime the green book proposes to repeal the fdii deduction and use the resulting revenue to expand on more effective research and development r d incentives but provides no details on what those incentives might be 15 book tentative minimum tax on large corporations as part of his campaign president biden proposed a 15 alternative minimum tax on book earnings of large corporations the green book proposes to impose a book tentative minimum tax btmt on corporations with an income over 2 billion a corporation s btmt equals 1 15 of the corporation s worldwide pre tax book income minus 2 certain business credits such as r d clean energy and housing tax credits it remains to be seen whether there will be any appetite in congress for allowing such an unprecedented encroachment of financial accounting principles to override provisions of the tax code and adopting a new regime that would be tremendously complex and controversial internationally new tax incentives to create job opportunities in the united states according to the green book the current tax regime encourages offshoring us jobs while providing limited tax incentive to onshore foreign job opportunities to provide a tax incentive for relocating foreign jobs to the united states the green book proposes to create a new general business credit equal to 10 of the eligible expenses incurred in connection with onshoring a us trade or business onshoring a us trade or business means reducing or eliminating a trade or business currently conducted outside the united states and moving the same trade or business within the united sates to the extent that this action results in an increase in us jobs in the event the eligible expenses are incurred by a foreign affiliate of a us taxpayer the business credit can be claimed by the us taxpayer for the expenses additionally to address offshoring concerns the green book proposes to disallow deductions for expenses incurred in connection with offshoring a us trade or business for this purpose offshoring a us trade or business means reducing or eliminating a trade or business currently conducted inside the united states and moving the same trade or business outside the united states to the extent that this action results in a loss of us jobs for example in determining a us shareholder s subpart f inclusion or gilti no deduction would be allowed for expenses a controlled foreign corporation cfc incurred in moving a us trade or business outside the united states to the extent offshoring results in a loss of us jobs significant expansion of anti inversion rules the green book proposes to modify the anti inversion rules in several ways first the current inversion rules would be modified to treat a foreign corporation as a domestic corporation based upon a 50 continuity ownership threshold as opposed to the existing 80 threshold second the green book proposes that regardless of the level of shareholder continuity an inversion transaction would occur if 1 immediately prior to the acquisition the fair market value of the domestic entity is greater than the fair market value of the foreign acquiring corporation 2 after the acquisition the expanded affiliated group eag is primarily managed and controlled in the united states and 3 the eag does not conduct substantial business activities in the country in which the foreign acquiring corporation is created or organized the green book would expand the scope of an acquisition to also include a direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the us trade or business assets of a foreign partnership furthermore the green book also proposes to cause a distribution of stock of a foreign corporation by a domestic corporation or a partnership that represents either substantially all of the assets or substantially all of the assets constituting a trade or business of the distributing corporation or partnership to be treated as a direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of such assets effective dates in general most of the proposals of the american jobs plan and american families plan take effect for taxable years beginning after december 31 2021 but there are a few notable exceptions the beat repeal and shield enactment would take effect for taxable years beginning after december 31 2022 for calendar year taxpayers the us corporate tax rate would increase to 28 beginning after december 31 2021 however for fiscal taxable years beginning after january 1 2021 and before january 1 2022 the current rate would apply to that portion of the taxable year occurring in calendar 2021 and the new rate would apply to that portion
