national treasure isn t a film about some random guy stealing the declaration of independence it s about nicolas cage stealing it if you remove the inimitable cage from the equation you negate the entire point of the indiana jones lite franchise that unfortunately is precisely the tack taken by national treasure edge of history the latest revival of a popular movie series as a lamer disney affair which takes its predecessors historical treasure hunting adventure and gives it an insufferable tween spin cage s benjamin franklin gates and his signature feat are mentioned multiple times in national treasure edge of history december 14 but this saga s prime focus is jess valenzuela lisette alexis a young mexican american girl who works at a storage company in baton rouge louisiana and is just about the world s most talented riddle solver jess is also an undocumented daca immigrant whose parents are both dead in a prologue we learn that her dad perished while on the trail of treasure albeit not before bequeathing her the symbol marked necklace that she wears to this day even before that an opening expository passage recounts the spanish conquistadors 1519 invasion of mexico and the emergence of an underground network of indigenous women who secreted away montezuma s riches all of which could be found via a map that was split up into three relics that were given to the incas mayans and aztecs this is all a lot of convoluted fake history mumbo jumbo that winds up having to do with elvis and it s made more amusing by the fact that the relics in question resemble the types of mechanized puzzle boxes favored by pinhead nonetheless this conspiracy becomes the guiding preoccupation of jess when she s tasked by her boss to figure out who owns an abandoned storage unit disney she winds up on the doorstep of peter sadusky harvey keitel the former fbi agent from both national treasure films peter is now a dementia addled crackpot or at least that s what everyone says as soon as she meets him though jess proves her worth as a fearsomely clever girl and thus receives an envelope originally intended for peter s estranged grandson liam jake austin walker that she deduces is a clue involving the freemasons and the aforementioned mexican treasure jess can t resist looking into this mystery and she s aided in her efforts by her roommate tasha zuri reed best friend ethan jordan rodrigues and tasha s ex oren antonio cipriano spunky wisecracking and mugging for the camera with reckless abandon these kids would be right at home on a typical disney channel made for tv movie the 10 craziest nicolas cage stories ever from being stalked by a mime to shrooming with his cat oren is a particularly egregious clown lowlighted by him moaning and rolling his eyes in ecstasy over the fact that someone bought him some pizza tasha however takes the title of most unbearable series participant sassily spouting off about typical patriarchy gender stereotypes and binary systems of oppression like a human buzzword generator every time such stuff is uttered it s as if an 11 year old s twitter feed threw up on the scripts national treasure edge of history wants to be relevant by making jess immigration status a pressing plot point since the threat of deportation is a constant concern but that gesture merely feels like superficial pandering then again most everything about these proceedings comes off as cheap and mechanical disney executive producer and acclaimed feature director mira nair helms the premiere with a surprising lack of personality coating the action in glossy bright colors that go hand in hand with the overly busy set design including with regards to peter s artifact decorated office as imagined by creators cormac and marianne wibberley the series is aesthetically flat and narratively corny and its cutesiness ramps up once jess meets liam an aspiring guitarist whose father also died in search of the mexican bounty jess and company s quest is complicated by an evil treasure hunter named billie who s embodied by catherine zeta jones in a blonde straight haired wig that s the height of ridiculousness billie is a stock villain who sneers and threatens on cue and she turns out to be zeta jones ticket to a second consecutive middling streaming project following netflix s wednesday for the most part though she s a peripheral presence ceding the spotlight to the blandly determined jess and woodenly hunky liam whose paths eventually cross with riley poole justin bartha the national treasure movies grating comedic relief sidekick now a famous podcaster riley is around to provide some nostalgic flavor via his usual unfunny schtick as well as to validate jess as a worthy protagonist by telling her and the audience that she reminds him of ben disney jess solves puzzles with borderline superhuman intuitiveness and her intellectual acuity negates most of national treasure edge of history s suspense the series conundrums are wildly intricate and totally absurd and without cage selling them with gonzo enthusiasm they resonate as ignorable flimflam it doesn t matter precisely how jess and her friends get from point a to b because it rarely makes sense and it s inconsequential to their overriding mission that mission it s suggested will be made trickier by an fbi agent lyndon smith on the case as well as salazar an imprisoned baddie who may have been responsible for the murder of jess dad salazar is only seen in shadows during the show s first four episodes which were all that were provided to press but he ll undoubtedly emerge as another obstacle for jess to overcome by using her formidable brainpower there s an easy explanation for why national treasure edge of history is cartoonishly exaggerated and clichéd it s been designed for pre teens yet that doesn t make its broad performances and faux clever storytelling any more excusable or bearable ya fare need not by definition be this clunky just as ip exploitation doesn t have to play this unimaginatively a shortcoming that extends to its meaningless subtitle disney however has gotten this film to tv reboot playbook down pat and it adheres to it zealously bringing together new and legacy characters for an undertaking that s a pale imitation of its only mediocre to begin with ancestors so dreary is this endeavor that it s

think of donald trump as a financial stock he made a big bet on djt shares just as they were about to tank he has gambled on brilliant prospects at the very moment they could go out like a light trump was already a long term investor but he massively upped his stake when he announced his third bid for the presidency it was an in your face purchase a statement buy supposedly showing confidence that the stock was going to fly for the next two years right up until election day 2024 latest poll has trump losing bigly to desantis and biden but his flat and dreary launch not the glitz surrounding it told a very different truth it was a profoundly unpropitious start to put it mildly trump was meandering purposeless he looked like the chairman of a company struggling to explain to skeptical shareholders why he had just made a questionable strategic acquisition the shareholders supporters gathered in mar a lago s great room to listen to their erstwhile hero got bored and started chatting among themselves some tried to leave the room and had to be barred from doing so by security staff the former president s campaign launch was no act of confidence but was rather an act of bravado made from weakness the congressional and gubernatorial candidates trump had endorsed in the midterm elections had just been demolished in consequence the former president himself had been exposed as a drag on the republican party its once but not its future leader stumbling through the rubble of his midterm hopes trump seems to have decided he needed a bold gesture to show he wasn t rattled his answer was to declare for the white house earlier than anyone had in modern times as though there was a popular clamor for another four years that had gathered irresistible momentum and could no longer be assuaged but it was an unpersuasive conjuring trick the sort where you can see the hapless magician s clumsy sleight of hand almost as soon as trump left the mar a lago stage setbacks tumbled down on him in an avalanche his communications with state officials to overturn the 2020 election were subpoenaed the trump organization was convicted of fraud and a federal court nixed the special master he wanted to look into the fbi raid on his florida resort home it felt as though these setbacks had been held in waiting and were then released in a flood for maximum embarrassment after trump had crossed the rubicon with his launch and couldn t go back then he went from awful to worse by lunching with kanye west an outspoken antisemite and nick fuentes a white supremacist whose character may be best captured by his oleaginous joke doubting that it s bad to be compared to hitler trump appears to believe that because his supporters admire his willingness to punch back rather than cower when faced with criticism all he has to do is to show defiance in every circumstance no matter how egregious it is as though any outrage will do but ugliness alone to put it tautologically is not appealing being repellent is not a strategy at least not a vote winning one when trump s schtick worked it was because it was backed by popular substance on immigration for example or on confronting china if trump doesn t own his policies exclusively his sole defining quality is his aggressive defiance and embrace of the unpersuasive it is in this light that one must look at new polling that shows how far trump s stock has sunk a new usa today suffolk university survey shows him 23 percentage points behind gov ron desantis r fl among gop voters 56 33 only 31 want the former president to run again for the presidency compared to 61 who want someone else to carry on his policies and 65 want desantis to run in a hypothetical matchup president joe biden beats trump 47 40 among all voters but loses 47 43 to desantis republican and conservative independents increasingly want trumpism without trump david paleologos the director of the suffolk university political research center told usa today desantis is already seen as a possible successor and the danger for him is that he may have come to prominence too early months before he emerges probably in february or march as an official candidate for the gop presidential nomination but he has hardly put a foot wrong politically for two years or more and perhaps he can do the same for the next two years that s to be seen but what already seems clear is that trump s political stock is in bear market territory sellers are growing in number perhaps he can turn it around but the bust is staring him in the face click here to read more from the washington examiner

it has been a bad couple of months for blackrock and its ceo larry fink earlier this quarter one analyst downgraded its stock due to the risk posed by environmental social and governance esg investing several states have announced they will remove pensions and other state treasury funds from the asset manager last week the firm was subpoenaed by the texas state senate finally on friday north carolina treasurer dale folwell called for blackrock ceo larry fink to step down in a bombshell letter addressed to the investment company s board of directors which includes fink advertisement while several states have withdrawn proxy votes and divested state funds from blackrock folwell is the first to take this bold step given his dogged pursuit of these political objectives over a number of years i m skeptical that he would or could lead the necessary course correction having lost confidence in his leadership to responsibly steward investors resources i request quite simply that he resign or be removed from the asset management firm s leadership team immediately the letter closes according to folwell fink s obsession with driving esg investing and net zero objectives is at odds with blackrock s fiduciary duty and may impart liabilities on keepers of state funds like himself as the sole fiduciary of the 111 4 billion in the north carolina retirement system ncrs folwell is not merely posturing ncrs s current investment portfolio includes 14 billion in active and passive funds and 55 million passively invested in blackrock stocks or bonds that makes the state of north carolina a blackrock shareholder and a client folwell expects blackrock to take its responsibility for managing north carolina s investments as seriously as folwell takes his own that duty of care is not evident to folwell related texas legislative committee subpoenas blackrock over esg investing unfortunately larry fink s pursuit of a political agenda has gotten in the way of blackrock s same fiduciary duty a focus on esg is not a focus on returns and potentially could force us to violate our own fiduciary duty ultimately fink s continued ideological pressure could result in using esg scores against states and local governments lowering their credit ratings and thus driving up their cost of borrowing at taxpayers expense folwell wrote advertisement folwell holds broad responsibilities in the state as chair of the north carolina state banking commission and the local government commission from that perspective he wants people to understand that esg scores and questionnaires are being used everywhere not just in managing retirement funds local governments are getting pressed to make esg commitments when they seek funding eventually failure to meet these criteria could prevent them from accessing capital or raising their interest rates this will impact taxpayers through higher taxes or reduced services he gave me a relevant example when i talk to some of my lower income communities they get asked how many electric vehicles they have and how many they forecast they will have these counties are just trying to issue a bond to get a road built folwell was also not shy about pointing out in his letter that fink pursues his political agenda using other people s money at larry fink s direction blackrock has used the financial power of its clients to force the global warming agenda using proxy voting authority to push companies to net zero often in conflict with its fiduciary responsibilities folwell pointed out he also highlighted where blackrock had recently failed to put returns for its clients first for example in 2020 used blackrock s clients votes against two management supported board members of exxonmobil because of insignificant progress towards green energy yet exxonmobil stock rose 60 in the 12 months since the board member election because of an increase in the demand for oil berkshire hathaway s charlie munger had it right when he said we don t need emperors voting shares in index funds based on their social agendas folwell charged advertisement related florida withdraws 2 billion from blackrock over esg investing because of fink s ideological drive folwell signed an agreement enabling ncrs to vote the shares blackrock manages for it that would include board elections and votes on shareholder proposals these are two ways activist investors are trying to push esg policies on companies they submit proposals on climate change and social issues like equity and abortion and put up activist candidates for board positions then they rely on ideological asset managers like blackrock to use their proxy power to vote for them folwell just took his state s shares back under a new agreement it would be easy to think that with all this pressure from state treasurers to stop focusing so intensely on esg investing fink would be popular with activist investors however at least one activist investor from the u k which holds a small stake in blackrock is calling fink s response to criticism amateurish and saying that blackrock s actions on climate are hypocritical london based bluebell is looking for a management restructure to split the chairperson and chief executive officer roles and appoint a new ceo fink currently holds both posts bluebell is also saying blackrock s commitments don t match its actions bivona also took aim at blackrock s 2020 promise to clients to exit thermal coal investments which it says in its client letter on sustainability that the long term economic or investment rationale no longer justifies bluebell noted that this commitment excludes passive funds such as index trackers and etfs which constitute 64 of blackrock s more than 10 trillion in assets under management advertisement bluebell also hit blackrock for getting caught pushing ideological investing bluebell s letter also took aim at blackrock for having politicized the esg debate after its public advocacy led to a swathe of republican controlled u s states divesting assets managed by blackrock in protest at the asset manager s esg policies perhaps blackrock is a study in businesses confining their mission to their core operations maybe levi s should make fantastic jeans and coca cola should make exceptional beverages could it be that disney should make movies for kids that don t expose them to adult themes and it s possible that blackrock as folwell suggests should concentrate on making as much money as they possibly can when investing on behalf of their clients

a deep white bowl mounded with elbow noodles wrapped in a blanket of jarlsberg grana padano and sharp white cheddar graces every third table the blackboard menu on the wall above red vinyl booths lists macaroni au gratin as a side dish that s ungenerous at poole s ashley christensen s bistro meets diner in downtown raleigh that macaroni is appetizer entree side dessert and talisman gone craggy and brown beneath the broiler it s a marker of the goodness this restaurant puts on tables and reflects back to its community before december 2007 when poole s opened the outside world often saw raleigh as the cultural and culinary also ran in a triad of north carolina cities dominated by chapel hill and durham red mud coursed downtown streets runoff from construction of the nearby convention center too few people walked those streets then came poole s at its tables forking into vinaigrette dressed salads of bibb lettuce topped with fluffy white bonnets of shredded parmesan raleigh people learned to expect more from a restaurant and more from their city photo lissa gotwals christensen revived a space with a history poole s began in 1945 as a pie shop that then morphed into a luncheonette generations of college students and factory workers came here to eat meat and three plates when robert fox christensen ashley s late father moved to raleigh after high school to sell newspaper ads he stood in line here to grab a chrome and red leather stool at one of the two horseshoe counters by the door the bones of the restaurant that fox christensen knew remain topped in green formica now faded to chambray those old fashioned counters still draw but poole s is not a throwback fifteen years ago when christensen opened she painted the ceiling tiles bright silver and the trim a glossy black built a playlist around indie phenoms like neko case and replaced the back bar coffeepots and tea urns with stocks of burgundy and bourbon seen through her eyes and aspirations this old diner in her old college town would become a laboratory for progress a place with a past ideal for imagining a future christensen wrote an opening menu that revolved around gently reinvented classics like a roasted half chicken served atop whipped potatoes swaddled in a sauce made of double reduced chicken stock that dish along with that macaroni and that salad shows on the blackboard today on a recent saturday night i joined christensen and kaitlyn goalen her spouse and the executive director of their company for dinner at poole s photo lissa gotwals they ordered everything that remains from the opening menu and a whole bunch of newer dishes beef tenderloin carpaccio dressed with tarragon horseradish buttermilk crowned by fried matchstick potatoes braised greens spiked with chile flakes and garlic black tea brined pork chops served atop rice grits bound by sweet corn and a roasted banana crème caramel showered with crumbled vanilla cookies a smile on my face i watched them watch their flagship come alive and i listened as regulars stopped by our table to reminisce about beloved dishes and dinners photo lissa gotwals the raleigh skyline has soared in the years since poole s opened and so has christensen she s won the big food world awards and picked up an honorary doctorate from nc state her old university for her work in the kitchen and as an inspired fundraiser for local and national causes christensen has earned the respect of chef peers across the nation the ac restaurants portfolio now includes three more restaurants a bar and a catering company chefs run risks when they expand beyond the restaurant on which they built an audience regulars fret wondering if they ll get lost in the shuffle pilgrims on the trail of the next great restaurant worry they ve arrived too late to the party christensen has sidestepped those concerns by growing poole s from a chef driven experiment into a classic restaurant devoted to repertory cooking and to the guests who gather at those horseshoe counters photo lissa gotwals i first dined at poole s a few weeks after it opened i ve returned a couple dozen times despite living two flights and seven hundred plus miles away in those lipstick red booths i ve begun raucous dinners with bourbon and macaroni au gratin and ended with calvados and late night karaoke what began at poole s has tentacled through my life as i worked to grow the southern foodways alliance in the 2010s christensen emerged as a generous benefactor and connector when christensen and goalen married in 2019 i stood proud before them and their loved ones as officiant this is a roundabout way of saying i m not an impartial observer i deeply connect to this restaurant the people who run it and the many people who love it in january people like me from all kinds of places will converge in raleigh to celebrate what poole s has accomplished and where it s headed the restaurant will stage panel discussions about the hospitality industry and host guest chef dinners to get ready poole s will prep bowl upon bowl of macaroni au gratin each will emerge from the broiler capped by a rumpled shag of brown and bubbling cheese but just five diners will pick up a bowl to find a willy wonka style golden ticket taped to the bottom entitling the bearer to a year of gratins instead of fizzy lifting drink poole s will pour champagne
by alison frankel reuters federal prosecutors and regulators from the u s securities and exchange commission and u s commodity futures trading commission all told a similar story on tuesday about sam bankman fried s alleged scheme to divert billions of dollars of customers money from the ftx crypto exchange to alameda research llc they all accused bankman fried of fraud asserting that he repeatedly lied when he insisted that ftx customers money was safe secure and completely segregated from the affiliated but purportedly independent alameda according to the indictment unsealed on tuesday in federal court in manhattan and separate complaints filed on tuesday by the sec and the cftc bankman fried knew or should have known that money was being siphoned from ftx customer accounts to fund alameda s speculative trading and that despite its repeated protestations to the contrary ftx gave alameda special trading privileges that ultimately proved disastrous for the platform and its customers who were the victims of this alleged fraud the cftc s complaint highlighted the deception of ftx users who in the regulator s telling were duped into believing that their money was safe the manhattan u s attorney s indictment also cited ftx customers as the victims of wire fraud and commodities fraud charges against bankman fried but the sec s lawsuit focused on a different group of alleged victims the investors that plowed 1 8 billion into ftx in a series of stock purchases between 2019 and 2022 the 90 u s based ftx shareholders held a 1 1 billion stake the sec said reuters has reported that ftx s equity investors included such firms as sequoia capital softbank group corp blackrock inc and temasek not exactly small time crypto customers who wanted to trade on the ftx platform and trusted bankman fried s promises that their money would be secure an important note here bankman fried s lawyer mark cohen of cohen gresser told reuters on tuesday that his client is reviewing the charges with his legal team and considering all of his legal options the sec meanwhile did not respond to my query about the framing of its lawsuit and to be fair the sec s complaint as i mentioned cast ftx customers as victims too albeit parenthetically i m being literal the second sentence of the sec s complaint says unbeknownst to those investors and to ftx s trading customers bankman fried was orchestrating a massive years long fraud diverting billions of dollars of the trading platform s customer funds for his own personal benefit and to help grow his crypto empire my point is that the sec s pleading strategy in tuesday s lawsuit shows that crypto remains a big challenge for u s regulators an alleged fraudster is accused of misappropriating billions of dollars from customers who wanted to buy and sell crypto yet the foremost investor protection agency in the united states is not claiming securities fraud on behalf of those customers securities law professor ann lipton of tulane university school of law said that s probably because of regulatory uncertainty about which crypto assets meet the definition of a security as you know that question in turn is the subject of intense litigation between the sec and ripple labs inc the sec is limited to suing over securities fraud and that requires the existence of a security lipton said by email at the very least each crypto asset would have to be analyzed individually to determine whether it was a security which is presumably not feasible for customers who traded many different kinds of assets by focusing instead on the individuals and funds that acquired an equity stake in ftx lipton said the sec ducks that issue those investors certainly bought securities in the form of stock former manhattan federal prosecutor timothy howard of freshfields bruckhaus deringer agreed it s easier and more straightforward for the sec to focus on equity investors unlike private shareholders who sue for securities fraud the sec does not have to prove that investors relied on alleged misrepresentations the u s justice department which has charged bankman fried with defrauding ftx equity investors in addition to ftx customers similarly does not have to show reliance to prove securities fraud this greatly eases the sec s and doj s prosecutions because it takes off the table all questions associated with the adequacy of investors due diligence stanford law school professor joseph grundfest said via email many of the sec s allegations involve claims that ftx lied in publicly issued statements and reports on its websites but perhaps anticipating arguments from bankman fried that he cannot be liable for general corporate statements the sec complaint did cite two instances in which ftx investors were allegedly misled by bankman fried himself he gave a u s investor who had bought 35 million in ftx shares in july 2021 a document promising that ftx and alameda did not comingle funds according to the sec and in the late summer of 2021 the complaint alleged bankman fried told a potential u s investor who ultimately acquired a 30 million stake that ftx did not hold its native cryptocurrency tokens known as ftt bankman fried according to the sec knew or should have known that his statement to the investor was false those specific allegations said freshfield s howard seem intended to show bankman fried that ftx investors are cooperating with the government and that he can t evade liability simply by claiming he wasn t aware of ftx s public statements looking way down the road at the potential fallout from ftx s collapse i ll be interested to see if any ftx customers or creditors attempt to pin blame on the equity investors that are cast as victims in tuesday s sec complaint arguing that their due diligence failures enabled the platform s subsequent alleged misconduct if that happens it will be even more interesting to see if ftx s equity investors point to their depiction in the sec complaint as evidence that they too were victimized by sam bankman fried editing by leigh jones and himani sarkar

a wolf administration standing order allows anyone to pick up the opioid overdose reversal drug naloxone from a pharmacy without a prescription state officials expanded that order earlier this year to include four different forms of the drug including a nasal spray and a syringe option with two injectable single dose vials of naloxone speaking to 90 5 wesa s the confluence on tuesday drug and alcohol programs secretary jen smith said the state recognizes how the market for the life saving drug is evolving what we re trying to do is keep that standing order up to speed with all the different versions that are available so that people have access to a wide variety of types of naloxone smith explained according to smith the highly potent opioid fentanyl has become prevalent in cocaine and other stimulants across the commonwealth more than 5 300 pennsylvanians died from a drug overdose in 2021 including 719 people in allegheny county the department of health confirmed 84 of fatalities were opioid related of those 47 involved a stimulant such as cocaine or methamphetamine up from 10 in 2020 so our messaging has shifted a little bit in this space to say even individuals who are typically stimulant users must have access to naloxone because we are hearing that there are overdose deaths related to individuals who are typically using methamphetamine or cocaine but actually overdosed as a result of the opioid contained in the substance smith said the standing order covers any resident who asks for naloxone at a pharmacy in the commonwealth not all pharmacies however stock every form of the drug and insurance coverage can vary by the type purchased and insurance plan the state recommends people check with their insurance to determine whether naloxone is covered by their particular plan or requires an out of pocket cost in the case cost is a barrier residents can get the overdose reversal drug by mail through the state s free naloxone distribution program in partnership with next distro and prevention point pittsburgh you fill out your name and mailing address and we will provide you a free dose of naloxone directly to your home smith said so there s no reason that any pennsylvanian should go without access to naloxone to qualify residents must also view a training video and answer a short quiz available in both english and spanish on how to administer naloxone the pennsylvania commission on crime and delinquency also distributes naloxone for free to organizations and individuals the commission s naloxone for first responders program has distributed more than 181 000 kits of narcan the brand name version of the medication s nasal spray form and over 265 300 kits to organizations serving high need communities since 2017 more than 22 815 overdose reversals have been reported using state purchased narcan still many harm reduction advocates say reducing fatal overdoses requires more than access to naloxone heeding that call gov tom wolf signed a bill last month that decriminalizes fentanyl test strips it updated a law that classified the strips as drug paraphernalia and imposed significant penalties on those possessing them smith who is among those calling for additional measures said she would like to see the legislature pass legislation that legalizes syringe service programs in the state the distribution of sterile syringes for drug use can incur a felony offense throughout most of pennsylvania even though the biden administration provides funding to support such harm reduction efforts in january state rep sara innamorato a democrat from allegheny county and state rep jim struzzi an indiana county republican introduced legislation that would decriminalize the service currently under the jurisdiction of municipal public health authorities syringe services legally operate in allegheny county and philadelphia those are programs that have proven to improve health outcomes by reducing the spread of hepatitis c and hiv smith said so i would like to see that as our next step
federal prosecutors and regulators from the u s securities and exchange commission and u s commodity futures trading commission all told a similar story on tuesday about sam bankman fried s alleged scheme to divert billions of dollars of customers money from the ftx crypto exchange to alameda research llc they all accused bankman fried of fraud asserting that he repeatedly lied when he insisted that ftx customers money was safe secure and completely segregated from the affiliated but purportedly independent alameda according to the indictment unsealed on tuesday in federal court in manhattan and separate complaints filed on tuesday by the sec and the cftc bankman fried knew or should have known that money was being siphoned from ftx customer accounts to fund alameda s speculative trading and that despite its repeated protestations to the contrary ftx gave alameda special trading privileges that ultimately proved disastrous for the platform and its customers who were the victims of this alleged fraud the cftc s complaint highlighted the deception of ftx users who in the regulator s telling were duped into believing that their money was safe the manhattan u s attorney s indictment also cited ftx customers as the victims of wire fraud and commodities fraud charges against bankman fried but the sec s lawsuit focused on a different group of alleged victims the investors that plowed 1 8 billion into ftx in a series of stock purchases between 2019 and 2022 the 90 u s based ftx shareholders held a 1 1 billion stake the sec said reuters has reported that ftx s equity investors included such firms as sequoia capital softbank group corp blackrock inc and temasek not exactly small time crypto customers who wanted to trade on the ftx platform and trusted bankman fried s promises that their money would be secure an important note here bankman fried s lawyer mark cohen of cohen gresser told reuters on tuesday that his client is reviewing the charges with his legal team and considering all of his legal options the sec meanwhile did not respond to my query about the framing of its lawsuit and to be fair the sec s complaint as i mentioned cast ftx customers as victims too albeit parenthetically i m being literal the second sentence of the sec s complaint says unbeknownst to those investors and to ftx s trading customers bankman fried was orchestrating a massive years long fraud diverting billions of dollars of the trading platform s customer funds for his own personal benefit and to help grow his crypto empire my point is that the sec s pleading strategy in tuesday s lawsuit shows that crypto remains a big challenge for u s regulators an alleged fraudster is accused of misappropriating billions of dollars from customers who wanted to buy and sell crypto yet the foremost investor protection agency in the united states is not claiming securities fraud on behalf of those customers securities law professor ann lipton of tulane university school of law said that s probably because of regulatory uncertainty about which crypto assets meet the definition of a security as you know that question in turn is the subject of intense litigation between the sec and ripple labs inc the sec is limited to suing over securities fraud and that requires the existence of a security lipton said by email at the very least each crypto asset would have to be analyzed individually to determine whether it was a security which is presumably not feasible for customers who traded many different kinds of assets by focusing instead on the individuals and funds that acquired an equity stake in ftx lipton said the sec ducks that issue those investors certainly bought securities in the form of stock former manhattan federal prosecutor timothy howard of freshfields bruckhaus deringer agreed it s easier and more straightforward for the sec to focus on equity investors unlike private shareholders who sue for securities fraud the sec does not have to prove that investors relied on alleged misrepresentations the u s justice department which has charged bankman fried with defrauding ftx equity investors in addition to ftx customers similarly does not have to show reliance to prove securities fraud this greatly eases the sec s and doj s prosecutions because it takes off the table all questions associated with the adequacy of investors due diligence stanford law school professor joseph grundfest said via email many of the sec s allegations involve claims that ftx lied in publicly issued statements and reports on its websites but perhaps anticipating arguments from bankman fried that he cannot be liable for general corporate statements the sec complaint did cite two instances in which ftx investors were allegedly misled by bankman fried himself he gave a u s investor who had bought 35 million in ftx shares in july 2021 a document promising that ftx and alameda did not comingle funds according to the sec and in the late summer of 2021 the complaint alleged bankman fried told a potential u s investor who ultimately acquired a 30 million stake that ftx did not hold its native cryptocurrency tokens known as ftt bankman fried according to the sec knew or should have known that his statement to the investor was false those specific allegations said freshfield s howard seem intended to show bankman fried that ftx investors are cooperating with the government and that he can t evade liability simply by claiming he wasn t aware of ftx s public statements looking way down the road at the potential fallout from ftx s collapse i ll be interested to see if any ftx customers or creditors attempt to pin blame on the equity investors that are cast as victims in tuesday s sec complaint arguing that their due diligence failures enabled the platform s subsequent alleged misconduct if that happens it will be even more interesting to see if ftx s equity investors point to their depiction in the sec complaint as evidence that they too were victimized by sam bankman fried editing by leigh jones and himani sarkar

prosecutor timothy howard of freshfields bruckhaus deringer agreed it s easier and more straightforward for the sec to focus on equity investors unlike private shareholders who sue for securities fraud the sec does not have to prove that investors relied on alleged misrepresentations the u s justice department which has charged bankman fried with defrauding ftx equity investors in addition to ftx customers similarly does not have to show reliance to prove securities fraud this greatly eases the sec s and doj s prosecutions because it takes off the table all questions associated with the adequacy of investors due diligence stanford law school professor joseph grundfest said via email many of the sec s allegations involve claims that ftx lied in publicly issued statements and reports on its websites but perhaps anticipating arguments from bankman fried that he cannot be liable for general corporate statements the sec complaint did cite two instances in which ftx investors were allegedly misled by bankman fried himself he gave a u s investor who had bought 35 million in ftx shares in july 2021 a document promising that ftx and alameda did not comingle funds according to the sec and in the late summer of 2021 the complaint alleged bankman fried told a potential u s investor who ultimately acquired a 30 million stake that ftx did not hold its native cryptocurrency tokens known as ftt bankman fried according to the sec knew or should have known that his statement to the investor was false those specific allegations said freshfield s howard seem intended to show bankman fried that ftx investors are cooperating with the government and that he can t evade liability simply by claiming he wasn t aware of ftx s public statements looking way down the road at the potential fallout from ftx s collapse i ll be interested to see if any ftx customers or creditors attempt to pin blame on the equity investors that are cast as victims in tuesday s sec complaint arguing that their due diligence failures enabled the platform s subsequent alleged misconduct if that happens it will be even more interesting to see if ftx s equity investors point to their depiction in the sec complaint as evidence that they too were victimized by sam bankman fried editing by leigh jones and himani sarkar

by rod smyth chairman of the board of directors in a world where most people do not enjoy the benefit of a guaranteed pension retirement becomes a personal responsibility the goal for many investors is to maintain their standard of living in retirement with the peace of mind that their money will not run out this is especially challenging in a higher inflation environment furthermore we believe retirees do not want to spend their golden years worrying about the monthly fluctuations in the stock market this piece is designed to provide information to retirees taking distributions from their portfolio what we call the distribute investor more challenging is the current rate of inflation throughout 2022 inflation has been considerably higher than the yields on bonds or cash and so although interest rates are higher investors have lost purchasing power we think inflation will remain above investment grade bond yields for at least the first half of 2023 good news interest rates are higher bad news they are still below the current rate of inflation when we last updated this piece in june of 2021 the yield on the 10 year treasury bond was roughly 1 5 since then the federal reserve has raised interest rates to around 4 and currently 10 year treasury yields are roughly two percentage points higher at around 3 5 this is good news for retirees as bonds can now provide some cash flow and yields are above the fed s long term inflation target investors concerned about inflation can now get a positive yield on the treasury s inflation protected bonds known by the acronym tips but they offer only around 1 over inflation and the price of these securities like other bonds fall when interest rates rise and so are not a protection against rising rates it seems logical that longer term investors should be more concerned about longer term inflation trends one of our rules at riverfront is don t fight the fed and so with the fed now committed to getting inflation down to more normal levels we believe they will achieve this this on a 3 5 year view the important question to us is whether they will be resolute about 2 or will be satisfied with a somewhat higher average market participants seem to be confident that inflation can average 2 5 3 over the next 7 10 years and we broadly agree since inflation is a critical ingredient for financial planning distribute investors should think about what level to put in their plan chart 1 shows annual and monthly data for core inflation excluding food and energy the inflation data is expressed by the line in the top panel you can see how it took off in 2021 and is still rising at a year on year pace of 6 3 the line in the bottom panel as of the october data well above the fed s 2 target to get a sense of recent trends we also like to look at the monthly data shown in the panel on the bottom the bars represent month on month changes here the october data gives some hope for optimism that inflation is no longer accelerating and may be peaking in our view but it is in its early days the federal reserve is now fully committed to bringing inflation down as their number one priority something that has been repeated by fed chairman powell at every opportunity for many months we believe the fed will ultimately succeed and we have seen leading indicators of inflation are already declining however it may take a recession to bring inflation down to the fed s target by their own admission the fed was slow to realize that inflation was not a transitory problem as they thought in 2021 in early 2022 the fed started to realize that inflation was sticky and that it was spreading from manufactured goods prices to services and rents as reflected in core cpi which excludes food and energy see chart 1 right then came the war in ukraine a major wheat producer for the world the sanctions on russian oil and covid 19 lockdowns in china by may the fed realized they had made a mistake and started raising rates aggressively us stocks with dividends reinvested have a return history relative to inflation going back to 1926 see chart 2 below the trend rate of return is 6 4 over the rate of inflation see trend line rising at 6 4 per annum stock s ability to outpace inflation comes in part due to companies ability to adapt to changing conditions this is tremendous news for all investors but particularly for the accumulate investor especially if they are adding to their portfolio on a regular basis prolonged bear markets such as those seen in the 1930s 1970s and the first decade of the 2000s provide an opportunity for the accumulate investor to add stocks at below trend prices we define the accumulate investor as one focused on long term growth of capital and a time horizon of 10 years or more we believe a retiree seeking to generate a 3 6 return after inflation with consistent monthly income will need to invest a sizable portion of their assets in more volatile investments to get the higher returns they seek let s call these risk assets which can include stocks investment grade bonds higher yield junk bonds real estate and other investments source riverfront investment

potentially long distribute phase as life expectancy continues to increase with the help of a financial advisor a professionally crafted retirement plan can be tailored to investors needs and risk tolerances we think our focus on portfolio construction risk management transparency and consistent communication are critical elements in giving financial advisors and their clients the peace of mind to stick with the agreed plan a balanced structure we believe investors should ensure the portfolio has not only a stream of fixed income payments but also a mixture of stocks that produce a combination of growing dividends and earnings we tend to prefer companies with the greatest potential to grow dividends rather than those with the highest starting yield as we believe growth of income is important in the distribute phase also companies in faster growing sectors often reinvest their excess cash flow to expand and do not necessarily pay dividends we do not want to exclude these stocks as we think they can play an important role in growing the retirees asset base risk assets when constructing a retirement plan we believe investors should use enough risk assets to provide the required returns while taking emotional tolerance into consideration we have discussed stocks at length and note that riskier assets require more careful selection and closer scrutiny with stocks and other assets such as high yield bonds we think it is important to understand their specific risks which may not be obvious upon cursory review we believe higher yielding bonds can play an important role in boosting cash flow but we also believe this is a decision like stocks that should be actively managed and monitored risk discussion all investments in securities including the strategies

investment back at the end of that time period along with the interest earned investment risk is repayment of the principal amount invested in the event of a bankruptcy or other corporate disruption bonds are senior to stocks investors should be aware of these differences prior to investing in general the bond market is volatile and fixed income securities carry interest rate risk as interest rates rise bond prices usually fall and vice versa this effect is usually more pronounced for longer term securities fixed income securities also carry inflation risk liquidity risk call risk and

weather forecasts and entertainment stories to your inbox sign up for nbc connecticut newsletters the inflation data received so far for october and november show a welcome reduction in the monthly pace of price increases but it will take substantially more evidence to give confidence that inflation is on a sustained downward path said powell the fed delivered a widely anticipated 50 basis point rate hike at the conclusion of its december policy meeting it s a smaller bump from the prior four consecutive rate hikes of 75 basis points a basis point is equal to one hundredth of one percent fed officials also forecast raising rates through next year not lowering rates until 2024 the central bank ultimately sees itself taking rates to 5 1 before it stops hiking a so called terminal rate that is higher than the 4 6 level it forecast in september notably the federal open markets committee left in a key part of the policy statement that it anticipates that ongoing increases in the target range will be appropriate the big issue that makes it hawkish is that the fed s forecasts put the terminal rate at 5 1 for 2023 from 4 6 at the september meeting said jim caron of morgan stanley investment management there s no tip of the hat to the notion that inflation is starting to decline they just completely ignored it treasury yields fluctuated during powell s press conference as the

tone bolvin likened powell s remarks to his august speech in jackson hole wyoming when he said there would be some pain ahead as the central bank attempted to bat down inflation realizing the fed isn t going to pivot any time soon recession jitters immediately sent the markets tumbling bolvin said this is jackson hole all over again alex harring hey big spender where are you this holiday season barclays said the pace of holiday gift buying has picked up but spending season to date remains down year over year based on its research which draws from surveys and credit card data some of the most dramatic declines from last year have occurred in the luxury category with spending down 12 on cyber monday an acceleration from black friday s 8 drop based on the trends it s seeing barclays analysts said they think shoppers are using big sales events to buy the goods they need not just gifts which has helped discount categories see gains from last year the pullback by luxury consumers may be because they have more flexibility in adjusting their spending than discount consumers as prices rise the rise in discount consumers may show their proclivity toward holiday deals especially e

not help investors looking for signs of a pivot investing officer says the federal open market committee s statement did not provide signals of an actual pivot coming on interest rate policy rather than simply a slowdown according to jason pride glenmede s chief investment officer of private wealth and he said that doesn t spur optimism among investors investors hoping for hints of an imminent fed pivot embedded within the post release statement were likely disappointed which contained language virtually unchanged relative to the november meeting pride said in particular the recognition that ongoing increases in the target range will be appropriate suggests that the fed has no immediate plans to halt its rate hike campaign pride said investors should expect the fed to become less prescriptive and increasingly reactive to inflation trends when making decisions on rates in 2023 he said to expect rate hikes of 50 to 75 basis points for the first quarter until settling at a terminal rate of around 5 then he said the central bank is likely to let rates plateau until they are sufficiently confident that the inflation menace has been eradicated pride said that process should take a large amount of if not the entire next year alex harring powell wants substantially more evidence that inflation is cooling federal reserve chairman jerome powell said wednesday the recent positive signs for inflation aren t enough for the central bank to ease back on interest rate increases it will take substantially more evidence to have confidence that inflation is on a sustained downward path powell said during his post meeting news conference the comments came as the fed raised its benchmark rate another half percentage point and indicated at least another three quarters of a point in hikes are coming the decision also occurs a day after november s consumer price index reading was up just 0 1 an indication that inflation may have peaked however powell said inflation remains a problem price pressures remain evident across a broad range of goods and services powell added jeff cox fed s dot plot expectations contributing to negative market reaction says lpl financial s krosby plans to take interest rates as high as 5 1 in 2023 are weighing on markets after the federal reserve s latest interest rate decisions according to lpl financial s quincy krosby the expected 50 basis point hike in rates is not what is causing the sell off in the market rather it is dot plot expectations that the fed will hold rates throughout 2023 and not begin rate cuts until 2024 she said the 50 basis point rate hike brings the borrowing rate to a targeted range between 4 25 and 4 5 and the highest level in 15 years samantha subin how the major indexes reacted to the fed s decision the stock market responded to the fed s widely anticipated 50 basis point rate hike see how the major indexes moved from 30 minutes before the decision to 30 minutes after alex

marking an end to the pattern of 75 point hikes seen in recent months before this move the fed had raised rates by 75 basis points at the last four meetings a basis point is equivalent to 0 01 the 50 basis point hike was widely expected ahead of the meeting it s the final policy decision expected from the central bank in 2022 alex harring amazon is the safest place in e commerce bernstein says

once the pixie dust kind of wears off the value proposition doesn t look so hot paul brody head of blockchain at global consulting giant ernst young told coindesk in a previous article this is on top

clear how the powers that be in busan will do anything differently that could change the equation on enterprise blockchain it s probably that they can t blockchain remains slow the reason why there

should be a very simple project even if it s built will anyone want to use it there will certainly be benefits for traders when it comes to korean won on ramps and expedited know your customer

advertisement busan might also be opening itself to some major headaches via liabilities what if the exchange is hacked or what if a listed token is the victim of a rug pull when dealing with offshore

early indications of 2023 spending show that producers are planning for growth of up to 20 mostly to beat back rising inflation costs covid 19 severely reduced consumption of petroleum products worldwide for most of 2020 according to the u s energy information administration eia wti spot price bottomed at an average of 16 55 bbl in april 2020 and strengthened to an average of 52 bbl in january of 2021 this trend continued and reached a peak average price of 114 84 bbl in june rig at christen pad courtesy of irene haas this improvement in crude prices was driven by a world economy that began to recover from covid 19 and as such energy consumption also began to recover accordingly but a lack of investment in the oil patch led to anemic production growth and this mismatch drove energy costs higher and continues to contribute to inflation russia s invasion of ukraine in early 2022 induced further price spikes and created an energy crisis in europe subsequent dislocations of various commodity markets still cast a long shadow on the european economy and on global energy security well beyond the continent case and point u s natural gas u s henry hub natural gas spot price averaged at a low of 1 63 mmbtu in june 2020 according to the eia and gradually improved to an average of 4 38 mmbtu in january of 2022 as russian supply of natural gas to europe became restricted as the war progressed during the spring demand for lng in europe spiked the u s is one of the largest exporters of lng and the incremental demand for lng led to a spike in u s natural gas price henry hub average gas price peaked at 8 14 mmbtu in may of 2022 despite prolific shale oil and gas reserves and production that has made the u s a net total energy exporter since 2019 the country s producers and consumers are not immune to commodity price volatility u s consumers and businesses have enjoyed an unprecedented period of secure and affordable energy for almost a decade but higher energy prices and higher interest rates meant to quell inflationary pressure are dragging down the economy and hitting consumers pocketbooks directly resurgent demand following the fading of the pandemic lockdown has run into a constrained supply side somewhat surprisingly the oil and gas extraction and petroleum industry has shown the least amount of recovery of any sector in the economy producing at 60 of their pre pandemic levels said esther l george president and ceo of federal reserve kansas city branch during a november conference in houston organized by the federal reserve teams in dallas and kansas city that performance was worse than the recovery in the automotive sector where output is running at about 70 of pre pandemic levels she said it comes as no surprise that the imbalance between supply and demand in the oil and gas sectors has pushed up prices but muted oil and gas investment is different this time she said it has been the case that the negative effect of higher energy prices on consumption in the past would be offset by a positive effect on capital investment in the energy sector george said in this cycle however the response of energy investment to higher prices has been lackluster and is offering less of an offset to those negative consumption effects compounding capital barton bart brookman jr president and ceo of pdc energy inc runs a 7 billion market cap e p the denver based company holds 255 000 net acres combined in wattenberg field in colorado and the delaware basin in west texas as of the third quarter of 2022 pdc energy produced 250 000 boe d with a production mix of 32 crude oil the production level represents 23 year over year growth partially driven by acquisition the company ended third quarter 2022 with trailing 12 month net debt ratio of 0 5x to ebitda a record low for the firm pdc energy is poised to generate approximately 1 5 billion of free cash flow in 2022 and is on track to return more than 60 of this to shareholders in the form of share buybacks and dividends management said toby rice is the president and ceo of eqt corp the largest natural gas producer in the u s with a market capitalization of 15 billion this pittsburgh based company holds about 1 1 million net acres in the marcellus and the utica plays in the appalachia the company produced 5 3 bcfe d in the third quarter of 2022 the firm also ended the quarter with trailing 12 months net debt ratio of 1 2x ebitda billy bailey founder of dallas based saltstone capital management scm said the traditional energy business in the past 36 months has been through an incredibly dynamic period of time for a myriad of reasons rewinding to 2014 2015 2016 an abundance of capital was raised for exploration and production companies investors were ecstatic about the opportunity that u s shale could provide he said this exuberance created a massive supply overhang translated into poor returns on capital poor performing stock prices and ultimately a consolidation and restructuring phase just before covid shocked the world investors began honing in on their desire for shareholder returns rather than growth the global shutdown commingled with investor demands was the enforcement mechanism for management team discipline courtesy of irene haas the downturn hastened consolidations both eqt and pdc energy have emerged as consolidators pdc energy closed the src energy merger in january 2020 right before covid 19 related lock downs management said the success of the transaction was overshadowed by the depths of the pandemic however brookman said it was the right deal for the company because it was accretive strengthened inventory and made the company s footprint more contiguous in the denver julesburg d j basin on top of that you throw in the strength of our balance sheet our hedge book the quality and execution of our team and the resiliency of d j basin projects and you have the foundation for a great deal even with the backdrop of the pandemic which began shortly after closing the deal brookman said while it did not take away the pain and how tough 2020 was not just for pdc energy but for everybody in this industry it resulted in us being more resilient than most and propelled us into 2021 in a stronger fashion brookman said the company emerged more attractive as a consolidator in the d j basin and set pdc energy up for the 1 3 billion acquisition of great western petroleum gwp which was announced in february of 2022 this added significant scale to pdc energy s core wattenberg field position eqt took on the consolidator role in appalachia in 2020 guided by the new management team put in place in mid 2019 leveraging on its strong balance sheet and a valuable stock as currency the company acquired the midstream and upstream operations of alta resources development llc in mid 2020 for about 2 9 billion eqt s production went from about 4 bcfe d 4 liquid in the fourth quarter of 2019 to roughly 5 3 bcfe d 5 liquid by the third quarter of 2022 in september of 2022 eqt announced a 5 2 billion bolt on acquisition of tug hill and xcl midstream deals that should add 800 mmcf d of production with a 20 liquid mix the transaction was financed by half debt and half equity management anticipated the deal would boost eqt s free cash flow yield significantly working capital for companies well positioned to be consolidators some of the cash flow generated in the past few years was deployed on strategic acquisitions some insiders expect that in 2023 more cash could be deployed toward gaining organic growth for eqt despite a pro forma 2023 free cash flow estimate of more than 6 billion the company leadership said its capital spending growth will be on the lower end of industry average of 10 to 20 in the third quarter 2022 conference call cfo david khani said he expects inflation to be on the lower end of industry average because of eqt s supply chain contracting strategy and its multiyear sand and frac crew contracts given a commanding appalachian footprint strong balance sheet and higher free cash flow yield boosted by the merger there is some question about why eqt is not ramping up activities you want more supply we need more pipeline infrastructure the environmental movement has been the reason why we are out of pipeline infrastructure capacity because of that we are forced to stay in maintenance mode rice said we are not growing production despite having the price signal despite having an inventory with an estimated 1 tcf of economic projects for pdc energy the management intended to end 2022 with approximately 1 075 billion spending at the high end of its guidance anticipating 2023 the company expects 10 to 12 spending growth after accounting for the increased activity associated with the gwp transaction the company is targeting annualized production growth of 4 to 5 after accounting for the gwp merger in the past two years capital discipline has been solid and most overspending can be attributed to inflation several executives told hart energy that has impacted steel tubular and oil service costs labor supply has been a challenge in the past 12 months while esg has become a key part of its operation after two recent mergers pdc energy operates with greater scope and scale and is able to build in more esg related functions while minimizing impact to its per unit operating and general and administrative costs pdc energy is hesitant to invest more money to rapidly increase organic growth right now we have no tactical plans to accelerate even if the market was asking pdc for more growth through the drill bit which it is not today there would be some real constraints to work through brookman said we are not growing production despite having the price signal despite having an inventory with an estimated 1 tcf of economic projects toby rice eqt corp the regulatory environment is only a part of that equation as experienced field labor and fit for purpose services may also prove to be a challenge sure we may be able to go get another rig but it may not be as efficient or as safe as the equipment that we have running in our steady state operations the company is focused on running a safe operation generating mid single digit production growth to maximize capital efficiency and free cash flow for its shareholder returns brookman said scm s bailey said his expectations for industry spending being 10 to 15 higher this is less driven by increased drilling but inflationary pressure from oil service this continues to be a theme the oil service sector has been tattered beaten consolidated and needs pricing power to survive at today s demand levels he said producing the world s cleanest molecules for most producers the operating environment has changed significantly in the past few years esg considerations have become more prominent in the planning and execution of capital spending plans esg concerns are front and center for pdc energy s day to day operations and is well integrated into its long term plans the company has committed to reducing greenhouse gas and methane intensity by 60 and 50 respectively from 2020 to 2025 the company is actively plugging vertical wells monitoring emissions to ensure compliance within its operational footprint and identifying operational enhancements to help achieve its reduction targets scale in the e p sector is absolutely necessary in today s world barton bart brookman jr pdc energy inc scale in the e p sector is absolutely necessary in today s world scale allows us to realize efficiencies across our cost structure as well as appropriately build on our esg program brookman said our esg journey has been one characterized by thoughtful and incremental progress and it s clear that 2021 and early 2022 marked a significant leap forward in our emergence as a forward looking leader in this space when rice took over at eqt his team launched an ambitious plan to simplify its corporate structure overhaul its operations and restructure its debt in addition to integrating esg into its entire operation i don t care what type of energy you are producing energy needs to be cheap reliable and clean this is really important we have lowered our emissions significantly he told hart energy but all of the things that we are doing to address the public concerns over emissions associated with the production of our products are going to be encapsulated by a net zero commitment by 2025 all of the above bailey started his buy side career working for the late t boone pickens an industry icon who believed that the world needs to use every single resource bailey said that the current energy crisis is a wakeup call the world still uses fossil fuels to supply 82 of its power generation transportation and industrial activities energy is the lifeblood of the world not just fossil fuels but solar and wind too bailey said i think all sources are fantastic i think we need everything rice said the u s has largely been on the sidelines of the energy transition the signs are clear that change is coming but the new mix will include fossils not exclude them solar and wind cannot handle this transition themselves in the last 12 months coal emission has skyrocketed over 500 million tons because of solar and wind inability to meet the need for energy rice said in just 12 months our inability to address foreign coal has wiped out all the environmental benefits of solar and wind for the last 15 years clearly emissions are a big issue you need a big champion to solve this the champion is the oil and gas industry taking over transition reaching out to the consumers public perception matters in policymaking and energy is a complicated sector for much of the general public to grasp nobody is going to take the time to learn it until it hurts their bottom line nobody is going to take the time to learn about it until it hurts their back pocket nobody cares to learn how they re able to pump gasoline into their car bailey said but they ll definitely be complaining once the cost of pumping hurts them financially once that financial burden sets in it is easier to chastise the industry rather than learn about it bailey said at some point in the future when the valuation is there and when the energy markets are screaming for more u s barrels only then will there be a massive reinvestment cycle happening globally led by the u s for multiple reasons bailey said he s expecting oil and gas prices to be higher for longer things are coming together and are coalescing toward a constructive period in energy we are going through a period of underinvestment which sets the stage for a sustainable cycle in the last five years in north america versus the previous five years before that spending is down by 40 we are in an undersupply situation with limited global spare capacity opec is protecting their downside which is good for the bottom line that will translate into likely investment in the future things are coming together and are coalescing toward a constructive period in energy we are going through a period of underinvestment which sets the stage for a sustainable cycle billy bailey saltstone capital management as more and more investors start to realize the amount of free cash flows that these companies are generating and how enticing that yield is relative to the yield on treasuries a tsunami of cash being rotated into the traditional energy sector will occur dollars flowing into the oil and gas sector with a finite number of publicly traded companies to choose from should bode well for higher stock prices we are in the early innings bailey said free cash flow and returns of capital are pivotal for enticing the incremental dollar to the energy sector at the precipice of a new regime the reasons for subdued 2023 spending increases despite higher prices and cash flows are multiple and complex the reasons seem to have little to do with a lack of funding the anemic responses of the u s oil and gas sector to higher prices reflects years of relatively low investment due partly to a shift in investment toward other sources of energy as well as increased capital discipline following the industry s poor returns during the previous boom bust cycle the kansas city s fed ceo george said in addition to capital discipline and a focus on return to shareholders other factors such as a tight labor market and the consolidation to fewer operating entities also play a part environmental concerns amid the energy transition also impacts how efficiently producers can operate environmental activism that constrains infrastructure capacity growth the need to meet regulatory compliance or voluntary targets and esg performance levels coming out of this period of market turmoil the industry is adapting insiders say companies are emerging more resilient more disciplined and more proactive on environmental challenges multiple factors contributed to muted spending growth and muted supply growth which should lend support to the thesis of higher prices for longer providing that global demand does not deteriorate

big spending items include health department jail fence and law enforcement firearms the la plata county commissioners have unanimously approved the county s 2023 budget which calls for a 22 increase in expenditures for a total of 145 356 619 the county is expecting 101 708 412 in revenue next year with the remainder of the balance being made up from existing fund balances director of finance adam rogers said he anticipates 2023 will begin with 113 180 907 in the bank rogers told commissioners the spending increase is in response to an expressed desire on the part of the community part of that increase will include an additional 11½ full time equivalent positions next year the planning department which is often criticized for the pace of its work will receive a new planning engineer and a planner i we take a lot of pressure from the community because they feel that our planning department is not as fast as it should be some of that is perceived to be part of our code some of it is just pure staffing county manager chuck stevens said so we re trying to expand and enhance that department so that it can provide the levels of service that our residents expect stevens said the county will once again direct 5 million in sales tax revenue directly to the road and bridge fund because state law prohibits counties from using general fund balance for road and bridge projects of the 145 4 million in next year s budget 42 will be spent on general government expenses 25 will go to public safety 15 to public works 12 to health and welfare and 6 for recreation and culture the allocation represents a slight shift from last year general government will receive a slice of the pie that is 4 larger than in 2022 and public safety s slice will shrink by 3 however all five major function categories will receive more money than last year rogers told the board that the budget includes ample contingency funds and more than enough funding to complete the capital projects included within it it s there in case we need to do it rather than come back and see you and ask for more money midyear rogers said in recent years the county has spent drastically less than expected as a result of the ongoing challenge of finding labor for capital projects la plata county budgeted versus actual expenditures estimated actual 2020 95 101 089 73 766 597 2021 115 202 100 82 554 782 2022 119 427 405 80 433 301 estimate stevens said the county is poised to begin next year s capital projects and hopes that changes to the bidding process may lure numerous and competitive bids the county set aside 3 million for the purchase and installation of a weather radar system 1 7 million of which will be funded by an energy impact grant from the colorado department of local affairs a vendor is under contract for that project a number of projects will address county facilities including a comprehensive plan for the gun range and a series of building remodels and upgrades the county has once again set aside 440 000 to replace a fence around the la plata county jail the county first set aside the funds in the 2022 budget after two inmates escaped by scaling the aging fence stevens said the project was not completed in 2022 because of issues finding skilled labor to complete the project we have someone now that s doing the work stevens said it s taken a lot longer than we thought it s been a challenge with concrete we re gonna keep plugging away with an increase in mass shootings across the country the la plata county sheriff wants to prepare the county is projected to spend 190 000 on new firearms next year to replace the department s aging stock of handguns sheriff sean smith requested 53 new 9 mm glock 17s as well as 19 new ar 15 assault rifles with suppressors we began conducting research and decided that we wanted to provide a suppressed short barrel ar 15 that would be used in these types of active shooter situations the project description reads the suppressed version reduces the decibels from about 165 to 138 which is much more likely to limit ear damage to deputies and civilians when fired indoors while not the largest expenditure in the budget the 950 000 set aside for the establishment of the la plata county public health department is a noteworthy addition after la plata and archuleta counties voted in november to dissolve the public health district that the two have jointly operated for the last 74 years the county must stand up its own department commissioner marsha porter norton who sits on the sjbph board of health has stressed that the expenditure will come back to the county rogers also highlighted that upon the dissolution the county will receive several million dollars in cash as well as a building the taxpayer money is i think being well spent and we re getting something in return rogers told the board stevens said the 2023 budget reflects the county s work to meet needs expressed by taxpayers we re just trying to be good stewards of taxpayer dollars he said we re being lean and as efficient as we can with our operating expenditures so that we can invest to try and increase service levels to meet the residents

the u s energy sector has enjoyed bumper profits in the current year with big oil companies setting records left right and center and wall street is saying the party is set to continue in the coming year according to a recent moody s research report u s industry earnings will stabilize overall in 2023 but remain relatively high the analysts note that commodity prices have declined from very high levels earlier in 2022 but have predicted that prices are likely to remain cyclically strong through 2023 this combined with modest growth in volumes will support strong cash flow generation for oil

artificial intelligence powered image generators have exploded into the mainstream thanks to support from major stock sites they are also an approachable route to making money but as is almost always the case when money gets involved the situation quickly becomes far more complicated earlier this month adobe joined shutterstock by announcing official support for images created using artificial intelligence ai which opened the door for artists to start making a living by selling ai generated art but the support for ai generated imagery may be outpacing the established set of rules that regulate how artists interact with each other and as a result disagreements and accusations of theft are bubbling to the surface as they grapple over what about these ai generated images they actually own a tale of two ai artists last september brian penny and kris kashtanova met online through a facebook group that was established to discuss the growing generative ai landscape penny who started working with ai image generators soon after they became available shared his work and some tips with the group that were based on his experience in this emerging field kashtanova looking to help other artists get into generative ai worked with penny to create content she would later turn into videos on youtube both kashtanova and penny were extremely active on the facebook group and both eventually joined an adobe hosted discord server that discussed the topic of generative ai that could be listed on stock sites namely adobe stock after publishing a few videos kashtanova s tips caught the eye of adobe who began working directly with the artist with the goal of making more videos and content to help others submit more content for stock through this process kashtanova learned what adobe was looking for how they would market certain images and that the company intended to feature certain artists and images seasonally all of this led up to the official support for ai generated artwork on adobe stock that the company announced on december 5 at this point as is often the case with disagreements the two stories get a bit murky kashtanova says she was just trying to help penny make his adobe stock library more appealing while penny believes she was actively trying to get his account to be less competitive by asking him to remove certain content specifically penny s library apparently has too much content that looks too close to pixar characters an issue adobe wanted to skirt around whatever the case this served as the breaking point between kashtanova adobe and penny and penny lashed out penny tells petapixel that he is upset that kashtanova is the one who ended up with the direct relationship with adobe and when he attempted to point out that it was actually his idea to adobe stock s discord his posts were deleted and he was eventually banned brian penny posted screenshots of private conversations on one of stock s public discord channels which has led to these posts being removed as per our guidelines regarding personal privacy an adobe stock representative tells petapixel brian was immediately warned that this practice was not allowed but continued this behavior and was subsequently suspended from the discord server penny shared a long list of screenshots from the ai generative facebook group as well as private messages between him and kashtanova with petapixel with the goal of backing up his side of the story he claims that he is the progenitor of ai generated images as a form of stock imagery taught kashtanova everything she knows and because of the tutorial she made based on his knowledge gained adobe s favor he then claims adobe used that to create the terms of service to manage the newly announced rules for ai generated art on adobe stock and shut him out including refusing to feature him prominently which he says results in far fewer stock image sales from my perspective adobe essentially stole the entire idea of using generative ai as images from me without giving me any credit penny tells petapixel i have clear documentation that i self identified as an ai artist with them over 2 700 times i have clear documentation that i directly impacted the adobe generative ai terms of service by teaching kris how to do what they did in the video adobe watched in order to create them he continues not only that but i feel that i inspired every ai artist s work on adobe stock i am the one who can prove i shared the idea with both the ai art community and directly to adobe multiple times in the 90 days leading to the creation of the generative ai terms and conditions penny claims that not being featured is akin to being shadow banned by adobe that term might be too strong to encompass what has happened here as his account and images are still visible and come up in searches on adobe stock furthermore adobe stock denies the claim no brian penny s content and portfolio are not shadow banned nor has he ever been shadow banned from the adobe stock marketplace the company says in conversations with petapixel penny claims that kashtanova stole the exact text prompts he used to create his ai generated imagery which are arguably the perfect recipes for making his very specific and highly desirable images kashtanova doesn t deny to petapixel that she used the same prompts but stipulates that he shared those text prompts publicly and as such it was not possible for her to steal them since they were freely given regardless this disagreement does bring up a very important question about ai generated imagery what is actually owned by the artist there may not be an answer at least not yet the new wild west regardless of the outcome of this he said she said disagreement the core of the issue that has been brought up by it is copyright and how that relates to ai generated imagery unfortunately the advent of this new technology has accelerated far faster than protections for the art have been established the law has to catch up to technology mickey h osterreicher the general counsel for the national press photographers association nppa tells petapixel thomas maddrey chief legal officer for the american society of media photographers asmp agrees copyright law is not prepared and is not set up to protect the artists or the users at this moment in time he says a lot of it is not going to be determined under copyright statute but rather unfortunately in litigation at its core copyright law covers original works of authorship that are fixed in a tangible format that includes literary works which includes text maddrey says there is a dividing line though so i can t copyright the word red but if i write an essay about the color red that is copyrightable because that is an original work of authorship you can t necessarily copyright an idea osterreicher adds there has to be something that has a tangible form that can be perceived by someone else that is the way the law reads maddrey says that just like with nfts in this past year there are so many open questions about copyright law that simply don t have answers should ai generated images be subject to copyright protection here we have a little more guidance he says a number of years ago there was the case of the monkey that took a photograph and the answer was no it could not be copyrighted because it has to be a human author just in the last week or two the copyright office rescinded a copyright registration they approved because it was an ai based work that ai based work he is referring to was a comic that was coincidently created by kris kashtanova kashtanova was originally granted a copyright for the work in september and was the first example of the copyright office recognizing an ai generated work as copyrightable but in october the copyright office returned the registration to pending and asked that she provide details of the process to show that there was substantial human involvement in its creation that case is still ongoing i am excited we are working with icreatelife to respond to the copyright office about zarya of the dawn we argue that artists using ai tools should be recognized as authors and allowed to copyright their work the response vanl vanl december 1 2022 that is the current metric that the copyright office uses whether that human author was involved such that copyright applies maddrey says if the copyright office is not convinced that substantial human involvement was involved in the creation they will not grant a certificate to something that was made solely with ai at this point i don t think this is likely to change any time soon there already is an ai caucus in congress that is starting to look at some of these issues but the copyright office itself is going to continue to ask questions if they believe that a work is for whatever reason not generated by a human author so what does an artist who uses ai to generate images own right now copyright law makes no determinations one way or the other adobe stock won t either adobe takes the same approach with generative ai content as with other types of content since contributors are submitting generative ai content developed using a range of third party tools adobe is not able to weigh in on the ownership rights involved in the content an adobe stock representative says however when submitting content contributors represent that they either own the content or have the necessary rights to allow adobe stock to use the content as described in the adobe stock contributor terms e g commercial use in all media and that the content does not infringe any third party rights basically adobe stock isn t prepared to make a determination on ownership any more than the copyright office is i think that someone making a copyright infringement claim over the text prompt or a search string that is put into an ai image generator might have trouble at this moment in time claiming that piece of it is subject to copyright protection it would depend entirely on how specific and how original those text prompts were maddrey says answers aren t coming soon so much of what we see are not legal questions right now but ethical questions is an image clearly someone s style if so that s not a violation of copyright law maddrey explains you can t copyright a brush stroke element so just saying that something is done in my style is not a legal argument it s an ethical one as maddrey pointed out most of these rules won t be set in stone until someone sues someone else and a court is forced to make a decision even after litigation after that first case where a court is going to have to say something they re probably going to look at the copyright office and ask for help regardless of the outcome i can t imagine that it isn t going to get appealed osterreicher adds that process will take years whenever it even starts and there will no doubt be new technologies that will come along that will add to the confusion don t think photographers are off the hook here either ai is everywhere and if a camera is set to program and it uses ai to track a subject don t believe for a second that a defense lawyer who figures they can win a case won t call that out as a reason why the photographer doesn t deserve copyright credit for the image it s affecting illustrators more than photographers right now but photographers are up next maddrey says this is something that the copyright office is obviously aware of but i see nothing in the law or regulations that would allow us to give guidance to creators related to copyright law and ai art what is clear is that without substantial human involvement the office won t grant registrations or they ll rescind it as what happened with kris kashtanova coincidently both maddrey and osterreicher were in washington d c this week to engage with other lawyers and lawmakers about this very issue the two believe that in the very near future there will be a need for photographers to include clauses in their commercial contracts that cover the license to use photos to train generative ai i think it s important to note that very few artists photographers or any creators have been paying attention to this such that their licenses or their agreement even conceive of this as an option maddrey says stay tuned osterreicher adds update 12 13 added a tweet regarding the ai generated comic book copyright case and clarified that the case is pending not fully rescinded image credits header photo

in summary on thursday the california public utilities commission will vote on a controversial reform of the stateâ s rooftop solar program proponents who want to scale back subsidies and eliminate the â cost shiftâ on poorer households argue that the revised proposal doesnâ t go far enough itâ s critical that california stands up to regressive policies that harm low income residents one such policy that desperately needs reform is the subsidy program for rooftop solar which benefits wealthier californians at the expense of disadvantaged and low income households including seniors â unfortunately the california public utilities commission looks unlikely to make the necessary reforms to ensure the net energy metering program is equitable for all to put it plainly the latest proposal does not go far enough the current nem program is robin hood in reverse those who donâ t have or cannot afford rooftop solar panels and are paying hundreds of dollars more each year in their electricity bills to cover subsidies that historically have benefited wealthy homeowners â the benefits for rooftop solar users has resulted in nominal or sometimes even negative electricity bills each month as a result homeowners with rooftop solar avoid paying their fair share of costs everyone else pays to maintain the electric grid and to fund other policy mandates such as energy efficiency programs as a result these costs unfairly get shifted to non solar customers creating a hidden solar subsidy tax that hurts those least able to afford it the programâ s unfair cost shift is regressive and environmental groups academics and even the cpucâ s public advocates office have sounded the alarm â unfortunately the revised proposal released by the cpuc last month does not eliminate the cost shift it makes only very modest changes â in fact the proposal permanently locks in the excessive subsidies for the existing 1 5 million solar customers in california these subsidies cost non solar customers more than 3 billion last year alone itâ s a disheartening development and a missed opportunity if the cpuc adopts the proposal without any changes on thursday the big winners are large solar corporations not consumers â just follow the money after the revised proposal was released last month shares of rooftop solar companies surged sunrun stock increased as much as 31 sunpower jumped as much as 21 and sunnova energy climbed as much as 29 the solar industry benefits from high subsidies they sell more solar panels their stock price goes up and their executives get higher pay â generous subsidies may have been needed 27 years ago when the nem program was first introduced since then costs have come down dramatically â yet none of that has been factored into the program â still residential rooftop solar is the most expensive form of renewable energy â we are strong believers in clean energy and want to see more rooftop solar on homes in california but not at the expense of low income customers california can reform its nem program to bolster equity and increase rooftop solar adoption when the cpuc votes on the proposal this week other states have done it and california can too â â the vote by cpuc commissioners on thursday will have lasting effects on the growth of rooftop solar in california opponents argue that the revised proposal will derail widespread adoption while some proponents believe it strikes a necessary balance
san diego s silvergate capital made its name in recent years as one of a few traditional banks providing deposit fund transfer security and other services for the cryptocurrency trading market but two high profile crypto exchange bankruptcies one of which is alleged to involve fraud have sent the small financial institution s shares reeling and drawn the scrutiny of lawmakers silvergate s stock price has plunged nearly 89 from a 12 month peak of 162 87 last december closing tuesday at 18 73 on the new york stock exchange advertisement sen elizabeth warren d mass and two other senators sent a letter to silvergate chief executive alan lane last week raising questions about the california chartered bank s safeguards around accounts of crypto exchange ftx and its sister trading firm alameda research your bank s involvement in the transfer of ftx customer funds to alameda reveals what appears to be an egregious failure of your bank s responsibility to monitor for and report suspicious financial activity carried out by its clients said the letter which was also signed by republicans john kennedy of louisiana and roger marshall of kansas warren and kennedy are members of the senate banking committee the public is owed a full accounting of the financial activities that may have led to the loss of billions in customer assets and any role that silvergate may have played in these losses the senators said the letter calls for silvergate to provide answers to a series of specific questions by dec 19 in a statement silvergate responded that it plans to comply with the senators demands within its legal limits as a regulated bank we remain committed to complying with our bank secrecy act anti money laundering obligations and look forward to answering senator warren s questions as openly and transparently as possible advertisement lane also responded separately in a dec 5 letter to the bank s shareholders it has been a very difficult few weeks for the digital asset industry as we have all come to terms with the apparent misuse of customer assets and other lapses of judgment by ftx and alameda research but lane contends silvergate did significant due diligence and ongoing monitoring of ftx and alameda research accounts at the bank handling wire transfers per the senders instructions and industry practice he added that short sellers are spreading misinformation about the bank s role in spotting the ftx alameda problems interest in the stock by short sellers who bet that the price will go down was up 97 in november compared with october ftx collapsed last month and filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy its financial health came into question after revelations alleging poor financial controls that led to customer funds being funneled into risky investments made by alameda research without their knowledge potential losses for investors are unclear but could be in the billions ftx s founder sam bankman fried was arrested monday in the bahamas on tuesday u s prosecutors charged bankman fried with a variety of financial crimes and campaign finance violations alleging that he played a central role in ftx s collapse and hid its problems from the public and investors the u s securities and exchange commission also filed civil fraud charges against bankman fried on tuesday david chiaverini an analyst with wedbush securities says silvergate could face a fine from regulators as well as a class action lawsuit from ftx customers or investors who lost money but he thinks these possible scenarios could be costly but should be manageable for the bank advertisement already at least two lawsuits have been filed by silvergate shareholders alleging the bank made misleading statements to its investors both seek class action status silvergate s main business is facilitating payments between crypto hedge funds and crypto exchanges in a research report issued last month chiaverini wrote that he doesn t think silvergate is at fault for ftx s handling of funds silvergate did what banks do it facilitated payments between two willing parties in which neither transacting party was on sanctions list or other restriction list nor were the payments abnormal for the businesses in which the parties operate chiaverini wrote alameda research is a large crypto hedge fund and ftx is a large crypto exchange he said so it s natural for silvergate to provide payment services to each volatility in crypto markets started last summer as investors sought to reduce risk amid economic headwinds and prices of digital currencies fell sharply bitcoin the best known digital currency has seen its value plunge 64 from its 2022 high digital currency lender blockfi went bankrupt on the heels of ftx s implosion advertisement silvergate doesn t own or trade cryptocurrency itself it provides many traditional banking services including deposit services fund transfers 24 7 u s dollar transaction facilitation customer account controls and security needed to enable digital currency trading the result has been a growing pool of no interest deposits that the bank can then use to fund loans or invest in other interest bearing instruments largely from institutional traders at their peak silvergate s deposits reached about 12 billion with the bankruptcies and other turmoil about 1 9 billion of silvergate s deposits had left the bank as of the end of the september quarter silvergate says it has ample liquidity to deal with the falloff its total deposits stood at 9 8 billion as of mid november daily use of its u s dollar exchange services for crypto traders hasn t slowed down according to the bank we intentionally carry cash and securities in excess of our digital asset related deposit liabilities lane said in a statement we purpose built this business to support our customers not only during periods of growth but also in periods of volatility that is our business is designed to accommodate deposit inflows and outflows under a range of market conditions

kris connor getty images entertainment editorâ s note the original article incorrectly stated that constellation and coca cola were partnering to develop alcoholic drinks under the fanta brand when it is the fresca brand that is involved my positive thesis on constellation brands nyse stz back in august of 2021 was predicated on meaningful volume share growth potential for the companyâ s modelo and corona brands as well as further improvement potential in the wine business and this has played out well over the last 16 months with constellation continuing to gain share in the u s market while the shares have outperformed up almost 11 other beer rivals like molson coors tap by 300bp abi bud by about 1 100bp heineken otcqx heiny by over 2 300bp and carlsberg otcpk cabgy by about 2 700bp as well as the broader consumer staples space constellation is still under leveraged on national distribution and under leveraged to on premises but management continues to work at both with evident progress over the last year and beyond while trade down and tougher comps are an emerging risk and i do see some margin vulnerability in the short term constellation still looks undervalued to me and worth a closer look a little vulnerability in fq3 but the core remains strong constellation has been executed well relative to sell side expectations in recent quarters but there are a couple of items i think are worth watching into the next earnings report scheduled for early january first the most recently reported data on beer imports from mexico october data showed a year over year decline of 1 1 the first decline in 20 months recent nielsen scanner data has also shown a little flagging in growth with constellationâ s beer growth slowing from 12 5 to 8 9 over the last month and from 15 9 to 14 7 over the last three months those are sharper declines relative to overall beer sector suggesting there may be some slowing of momentum still i think perspective is in order yes there have been some slowdowns in the scanner data but double digit growth over the last 12 weeks is still more than double the overall beer category and the double digit growth over the past year is well ahead of the low single digit category growth including 8 volume growth for constellation against 3 category contraction constellation has been routinely beating street expectations for depletions in beer but this upcoming comp is a tougher one 8 4 and there are concerns about on premises weakness i still think thereâ s some upside to the 7 3 average estimate but likely not a lot iâ m a little more concerned about margins pricing has been running about 4 5 lately ahead of management targets but input cost inflation is still an issue and constellation has been upping its ad spending with that i could see some downside risk to the 37 3 sell side average estimate down 400bp from the year ago level and the street has a tendency to overreact to margin misses continuing to leverage a real growth opportunity i donâ t want to make too much of a potential modest shortfall in fyq3 results though i do think there is a risk of a miss and lower report in an already twitchy market beyond this short term noise though i remain bullish on the ongoing opportunity for constellation to grow the beer category continues to see consumption and preference declines with more drinkers turning to spirits over beer over the last decade though constellation has managed over 600bp of share growth while abi and molson coors have seen around 800bp of share erosion but why should a reader think constellation can continue to grow for starters constellationâ s key brands remain under penetrated and underrepresented on national store shelves modelo especial already has around 5 national share of the market but only around 11 national distribution and it has approximately 60 of the distribution points of abiâ s bud light with the overall modelo brand family having around 75 80 retail penetration the pandemic was definitely a setback as retailers were loath to mess with their in store assortments but this is an ongoing area of focus for management likewise with on premises consumption prior to constellationâ s ownership the modelo business was basically just a bottled beer business with the management supporting neither canning nor draft since then constellation has grown the canning share to 34 of total volumes and while draft is still a small part of the business around 3 versus 10 for well known imports and 15 for most leading domestics itâ s another area where management is focusing their marketing attention product innovation development also remains a potential growth driver and polling surveying consistently shows that product innovation drives consumer behavior and particularly among younger consumers who donâ t have established tastes while the seltzer category once the hottest area of the business has cooled considerably with volumes down double digits over the last year there are still growth opportunities in the read to drink category and the companyâ s partnership with coca cola ko to develop alcoholic drinks based on the fresca franchise looks like a worthwhile opportunity at the same time though the company continues to develop follow on brands in its core portfolio including a new premium light beer modelo oro and new modelo chelada flavors iâ d also argue that the ongoing expansion of pacifico is almost the same as brand innovation â while popular in california a top 10 brand there that supposedly outsells coors light in la the national distribution here is even weaker than for the other brands and simply getting this existing brand into more retail locations could offer attractive leverage mopping up some issues since my last update constellation has also dealt with two business items that i viewed as drawbacks in the bigger picture canopy growth cgc is consolidating its u s cannabis operations into a new entity canopy usa and constellation has already indicated that it intends to transition its ownership to the non voting non participating exchangeable canopy usa shares with that constellation wonâ t have further involvement with canopy growthâ s board and it will switch from equity method to fair value accounting moreover it should lay to rest concerns that the company will substantially increase its investment in and capital commitment to a business venture that hasnâ t worked out so far the company also executed on a share exchange with the sands family that terminates the dual share structure and unwinds that familyâ s privileged voting position this comes at the cost of near term debt but i believe simplifying and democratizing the ownership structure is better for the company over the long term the outlook my expectations for constellationâ s revenue are basically in line with the street for the next two years but my fyâ 25 and fyâ 26 numbers are a little higher about 1 and 4 higher respectively as i do believe the company will continue to gain share in the u s market through improved distribution and market awareness i do see some near term risk to margins as mentioned above and iâ m looking for ebitda margins around 37 for fyâ 23 and fyâ 24 but i believe margins will start heading toward 40 in fyâ 25 and fyâ 26 as the company leverages investments in distribution and brand building as well as new capacity speaking of capacity i have modest concerns that the street isnâ t fully modeling in elevated capex tied to announced intentions to add more production capacity in mexico i expect this to keep free cash flow margins in the mid to high teens for a few years but i still expect mid 20 â s margins over time driving normalized fcf growth in the high single digits on around 6 to 7 revenue growth discounting those cash flows back i believe constellation is still priced for a high single digit annualized return multiples based approaches are more challenging with alcohol companies but i do believe the margins returns of the business can support a forward ebitda multiple of 15 75x or a fair value of around 245 on my 12 month ebitda estimate the bottom line while that ebitda based approach doesnâ t suggest a lot of upside i also donâ t have all that much faith in multiple based valuation with alcohol companies and i find that discounted cash flow works better to that end i find that constellation offers a good risk adjusted return i do see some risk of trading down in 2023 stressed customers choosing cheaper brands but given the demonstrated strength and momentum in the core brands and the open space left to claim from increased distribution i believe these shares are worth a serious look

organize2harmonize and president of the board of certification for professional organizers if you can t offer your bedroom try enclosing a common space for your guest especially if people have to pass

national association of black professional organizers add fluffy pillows and clean cozy blankets or throws to make the sofa more comfortable for sleeping consider their background take note of your guests cultural background and make them feel welcome by acknowledging any related needs and preferences they may want to do zoom church in their room before they come out in the morning or they may not eat at the same time or eat the same foods that you eat said lyndsey dianne blogger and owner of diannedecor com an american breakfast is very different from what you might eat if you re nigerian so know what you re offering people advertisement put together a welcome basket stock up on water bottles your guest s favorite snacks a phone charger a scented candle comfy socks earplugs and a sleep mask anything that would make it feel a bit more homey for that person reynolds said and it could literally be in some sort of basket or container whatever it is that you may have around the house prepare toiletries and bedding gather toiletry items such as a towel washcloth soap toothpaste lotion and shampoo i would put them out even if they re not going to use them so that you don t have to quiz them on a checklist of items that they ve brought or haven t brought dianne said this also alleviates the need for guests to ask for something they forgot if possible make your guest s bed before they arrive so they won t have to wait for you to decide that the end of the day has come now you re setting up the bedding and they re standing there watching you put fitted sheets on it s uncomfortable dianne said also provide extra blankets in case they get cold in the middle of the night goldson said address newsletter get the latest news on buying selling renting home design and more submit your email enter your email address sign up make space for their clothes give guests somewhere to put their clothes so they re not living out of their suitcase whether it s a few hangers in your bedroom closet or space in a dresser drawer no room to spare be resourceful you may have a plastic bin that they could put their clothes in that would sit somewhere in the room where they re staying reynolds said advertisement depending on the weather you should also make space for outerwear so they aren t hanging onto their coat or bringing it back to the bedroom every time they enter the house dianne said give them a house tour when your guests arrive take time to show them around it doesn t have to be every nook and cranny of the house but at least cover the spots where they ll spend the most time including the sleeping area bathroom and kitchen post your wi fi information on a card or sticky note dianne said so guests can find it easily and when it s convenient so they re not walking in the house and you re like ok here s the wi fi information and they haven t even put their bags down yet also provide a power strip with adequate free outlets for them to charge multiple items after the tour give them some privacy to unwind and get settled dianne added feed them if your guest is arriving late in the evening set aside food for them i would preorder takeout so that when they get back from the airport or wherever it s there and they don t have to be like hey can we stop at mcdonald s on the way home let them know i ordered a bunch of stuff and you re welcome to it dianne said take it a step further by stocking your kitchen with food and drinks they can consume throughout their stay if they re a pepsi drinker but you re a coke person have a couple cans of pepsi to make them happy if they re vegetarian have some options there so they have something to snack on even if they re not going to make full meals reynolds said advertisement dianne suggested having at least six water bottles in the fridge that way she said guests are more likely to feel comfortable taking one because they won t be concerned about leaving you without enough and leave disposable plates cups and cutlery on the counter if somebody wants to get something to eat they can easily do that and not feel like oh well i have to wash these dishes or put them in the dishwasher dianne said respect their time your guest may have had a long journey or prefer to go to bed earlier than you do so if you re a night owl consider shutting things down at a more reasonable hour so they have time to unwind and they don t feel like they have to stay up because the host is staying up when they really want to go to sleep goldson said have the same consideration in the morning i never wake anybody up ever dianne said you don t know how they slept the night before and if they re out of town odds are they either drove a ways took a bus or took a flight and these days that can be a lot

indonesia and danville ca dec 13 2022 globe newswire indonesia energy corporation nyse american indo iec an oil and gas exploration and production company focused on indonesia today announced production updates on its kruh 27 and kruh 28 wells these two back to back discovery wells were drilled by iec during 2022 at its 63 000 acre kruh block fracture stimulation of the already oil producing kruh 27 well has been completed with 80 thousand pounds of proppants having been injected into the sand producing reservoir with the goal of increasing production productivity a previous fracturing program conducted in iec s kruh 26 well brought the original production of 18 barrels of oil per day bopd to a post fracturing rate of 75 bopd iec anticipates that the stimulation work at kruh 27 could provide similar production enhancement after the well begins production again expected in january 2023 for kruh 28 iec plans to conduct a drill stem test in the new oil and gas bearing sand at a depth of 1 000 feet depth in january 2023 during drilling of kruh 28 more than 28 hydrocarbon gas was recorded with composition up to c5 an indication of the presence of liquid hydrocarbons suggesting a potential new oil and gas bearing formation production from the kruh 28 well is expected in the first quarter of 2023 as previously announced iec unexpectedly found evidence of a potential natural gas bearing reservoir between the 976 and 1 006 feet interval with 30 feet net thickness this initial evidence was supported by both wireline logging and geologic logging data and subsequent gas flaring further iec announced that it is currently in negotiations with pertamina the indonesian state owned oil and gas company for a five year extension of iec s contract for kruh block instead of the current may 2030 expiration of this contract this extension would move the expiration date to may 2035 this extension would effectively give iec 13 years to fully develop the existing 3 oil fields and 5 other undeveloped oil and gas bearing structures at kruh block in order to maximize the potential of kruh block after several encouraging new oil discoveries made by iec during 2021 and 2022 iec is planning to conduct significant new seismic operations across the entire kruh block iec believes that this new work together with what has been learned from recent oil and gas discoveries will greatly assist iec in ascertaining the best locations conduct a continuous drilling campaign at kruh block that will look to develop not only the one formation currently being targeted but to look to develop what appears to be at least three additional oil formations that could contain significant commercial quantites of oil and natural gas completion and full interpretation of this seismic operations will take approximately 12 months after which iec plans to re start its continuous drilling campaign at kruh block iec still plans on drilling a total of 18 new wells at kruh block four of which have already been completed by the end of 2025 iec can conduct this new potential maximizing seismic work based on its fundraising efforts during 2022 where iec raised approximately 12 million net of fees and expenses from investors mr frank ingriselli iec s president commented we are pleased with the significant achievements our company has made in 2022 with the two back to back oil discoveries and the potential new gas find additionally we are pleased with the carrying out of our stimulation work on kruh 27 well which will also be applied to the kruh 28 well to maximize production as was demonstrated in the kruh 26 well we believe that kruh block is a world class asset and in order to maximize future production capability we are planning on conducting significant seismic operations across the entire kruh block so that based on what we have learned from our recent discoveries including our gas discovery we can determine the best locations to start our continuous drilling campaign that is why we have commenced negotiations with the government to extend the contract term of the kruh block additionally we will also be moving forward during 2023 with developmental activities at our potential billion barrel equivalent natural gas 1 000 000 acre citarum block where the previous operator drilled a few gas discoveries in short we ve

triblive s daily and weekly email newsletters deliver the news you want and information you need right to your inbox wawa is scouting new store sites in ohio kentucky and indiana with the first gas and sandwich convenience stores under the flying goose signs to be announced next year and opened after 2025 the company said recently it also plans to move into tennessee alabama north carolina and georgia by 2024 the company has nearly 1 000 stores with roughly one quarter each in new jersey pennsylvania and florida and most of the rest in the counties around washington d c at wawa growth means strengthening our existing markets as well as expanding chief executive chris gheysens said in a statement which referred to the new states as future wawalands the company plans 70 new stores next year including sites near penn state and pensacola fla after adding more than 40 this year it has also closed smaller or less profitable stores including some in philadelphia once a corner dairy store where customers could buy rolls and cold cuts to make their own sandwiches wawa has boasted that it is now the biggest seller of philadelphia style hoagies which can be ordered online in store or remotely the sandwiches are made from rolls and other ingredients prepared by vendors at wawa supply centers and finished to order in stores as are many other breakfast lunch dinner and snack products on wawa menus while some local economic development officials have welcomed the stores the scale of recent super wawa stores has also fed neighborhood opposition wawa opponents in holland bucks county celebrated a state court ruling they said would have the effect of reversing a northampton township zoning approval for a store and gas station they contend is too big for the location in august the company canceled plans for one coral gables fla location after sustained opposition from neighbors and school parents the miami herald reported the new state announcements follow wawa s steady expansion starting in 2012 into south and central florida the chain expects it will soon have more stores in the sunshine state than anywhere else though chief executive chris gheysens has so far resisted florida officials occasional attempts to persuade the company to move its offices down there as it spreads geographically wawa has tweaked its mid atlantic formula in florida the company installed more outdoor seating and added local specialities including pastelillos empanadas black beans and cubano sandwiches lined with pork and ham as it enters the mid south there s no shortage of southern fried foods and sides for wawa to test but what could it add that is special to the midwest it s too soon to tell said wawa spokeswoman lori doyle to be sure we work to align our offerings with the food cultures and traditions of each new market but the company does best offering custom versions to its standard italian hoagies paninis breakfast bowls dave mccoy a retired newspaper editor cincinnati native and descendant of the feuding mccoy clan from the nearby appalachians notes the ohio valley is full of food specialties that may fly under the national radar but would be welcome if well made and wawa available these include five way chili with spaghetti cheese onions beef and beans which mccoy says is tough to get just right other regional favorites include bratwurst deep fried pork loin sandwiches pawpaws a native mango like fruit highly perishable but readily blended into baked goods and milkshakes and goetta a midwestern scrapple made with the parts of the cow or pig you don t see in supermarket cases plus oats instead of lancaster style cornmeal goetta could be tough despite local customer requests wawa still doesn t offer scrapple which is trickier to grill than sausage and might not lend itself to off site centralized preparation scrapple also isn t on the menu at sheetz wawa s western pennsylvania counterpart both are family run chains started with the first generation of dairies to buy delivery trucks in the early 1900s as for strong regional competitors like sheetz a pennsylvania based company like us we continue to have the utmost respect for them and have already been competing with them in several markets for quite a long time doyle said by moving south and west wawa bypasses and surrounds sheetz s pittsburgh area heartland why the sudden rush of new states wawa still controlled by members of the founding wood family has been growing incrementally for decades it slowed during the pandemic but is now ready for these larger moves the company says it employs more than 35 000 forbes estimates sales at 15 billion last year and growing rapidly employees and outsiders hold a minority of private shares a growing chain covering more states would presumably command a higher price if the next generation of woods decides it s time to put the company up for sale or take it public in an initial stock offering a deal it has contemplated but not taken in years past or as a bigger company wawa might find it attractive to remain independent wawa is and remains a privately held company with no plans to change that doyle said

photo john baggaley getty images u s senator elizabeth warren d mass and representative pramila jayapal d wash are spearheading an effort by lawmakers to compel the centers for medicare and medicaid services to look at the aco reach model with an eye toward preventing program participation in 2023 for organizations with a history of fraud according to cms the aco reach model will replace the global and professional direct contracting model beginning in january with participants in the latter allowed to enroll in the former if they agree to meet the compliance requirements warren jayapal and others wrote a letter to the agency expressing reservations about the model saying it may allow insurers and providers to harm the medicare system according to the letter a preliminary review of these direct contracting entities dces participating in the gpdc found at least 10 of these organizations have records in some cases extensive records of healthcare fraud abuse and violations of healthcare laws prior to 2021 these entities were accepted into the gpdc program in 2021 and have continued to operate in the program even as cms pushes for additional oversight vetting and transparency lawmakers wrote they re particularly alarmed by the findings of a preliminary review of the dces conducted by physicians for a national health program pnhp which lawmakers said identified at least 10 participating organizations that have documented cases of defrauding medicare and other government health programs the inclusion of these dces in the global and professional direct contracting model is a significant concern after these companies previous failures to follow the law they wrote the ability of organizations with known histories of fraud and abuse to take part in the program increases the risks for medicare beneficiaries and raises concerns that cms screening procedures for participants are inadequate putting taxpayer dollars at risk what s the impact the letter singled out several major insurers by name in citing cases of fraud and abuse for instance they cite an audit by the department of health and human services office of inspector general finding that humana which operates a dce in 13 states improperly collected nearly 200 million in 2015 through upcoding and overstating how sick some patients were clover health meanwhile was investigated by congress for allegedly giving wall street insiders opportunities to make millions while retail investors lost over 65 of their stock value lawmakers said and bright health the parent company to multiple dces described the medicare fee for service market as a 430 billion opportunity in a 2021 regulatory filing the colorado division of insurance received over 100 consumer and healthcare provider complaints regarding bright health since 2021 leading to a 1 million fine and a formal agreement with the company to address operational improvements according to the wall street journal the aco reach model s 2022 request for applications includes required disclosures of any sanctions corrective actions and fraud investigations faced by the organization or any individuals with ownership interests but similar requirements did not appear to be able to keep these organizations out of the predecessor direct contracting program lawmakers wrote in addition if these organizations are automatically included in the aco reach program without further review of their histories of fraud and abuse will further undercut these requirements they suggest that before the aco reach program begins cms should halt participation by any organizations that have committed healthcare fraud and terminate dces that don t meet the new standards for the program the larger trend the aco reach model will require all participating acos to have a robust plan describing how they will meet the needs of people with traditional medicare in underserved communities and make measurable changes to address health disparities this includes greater access to enhanced benefits such as telehealth visits home care after leaving the hospital and help with copays cms said in february cms said it would use an innovative payment approach to better support care delivery and coordination for people in underserved communities reach acos can include primary and specialty care physicians the global and professional direct contracting model was controversial because opponents including progressive democrats believed it would lead to the privatization of medicare physicians for a national health program an organization of 25 000 doctors who support medicare for all and oppose medicare privatization has rejected the aco reach model as it did the gpdc others applauded cms s redesign including premier and the national association of acos twitter jelagasse email the writer jeff lagasse himssmedia com

more affordable housing options austin runoff election results who won race for mayor city council seats more austin mayor council runoffs may dictate future of city s housing policies district 3 in council district 3 vela squez finished ahead of daniela silva claiming 53 32 of the vote to silva s 46 68 according to unofficial results vela squez will replace retiring two term council member sabino pio renteria the district encompasses portions of east austin southeast austin and eastern central austin an area that has seen major redevelopment that has forced some residents many of them families of color out of their homes due to affordability issues vela squez has told the american statesman that he wants to protect existing affordable housing stock and build more by expediting the permitting process he said what sets him apart as a candidate is his life experience and record as a coalition builder who has worked to bridge the divide between new and old austin silva said she supports eliminating single family zoning at the municipal level and incentivizing smart housing a program that provides fee waivers for development permits in exchange for on site income restricted units she also wants to expand opportunities for homeownership especially as a way to close the racial wealth gap vela squez thanked his supporters on tuesday saying after a long year of campaigning he earned a meaningful victory for the people of his community mi familia we did it he said it is my life s honor to represent you in austin city hall and i look forward to bringing our community together to deliver wins for the people in need of them district 5 ryan alter held on to a large early lead over stephanie bazan capturing 59 63 of the vote unofficial results showed district 5 which includes portions of south austin and southeast austin has been represented by longtime council member ann kitchen housing in south austin can be competitive with some of the last remaining affordable housing options that provide easy access to downtown alter says he wants to change city policy that he thinks incentivizes single family homes and discourages everything else his plan calls for 75 of new home construction or rentals to be affordable for the majority of residents alter said he was feeling excited relieved and honored to be elected as the district 5 representative i am ready to get to work on actually making austin affordable for people alter told the statesman it is time for real progress alter said addressing the city s homelessness crisis will also be a priority right now no

focus on protecting single family neighborhoods from multifamily developments guerrero on tuesday night said that she was proud and grateful for the work she and her team did in listening to the community and learning what was important to them this was a grassroots campaign driven by people who worked and lived in district 9 guerrero told the statesman we ran a respectable campaign based on the many concerns and issues brought forward from district 9 voters i congratulate zo and wish him all the best qadri s housing policies were at odds with guerrero s calling for zoning reform that encourages density public transit and climate friendly growth he said housing is a human right and plans to push for accessible and sustainable multimodal infrastructure to help decrease the cost of living he told the statesman that upon taking office he plans to make the lack of affordable housing a priority and believes providing a diversity of affordable housing options will increase the diversity of people living in the city and allow people who want to live in austin to stay austin has now spoken and the call for action on our affordability crisis could not be more clear qadri said it is now on all the council to listen and to act with urgency that the moment demands
