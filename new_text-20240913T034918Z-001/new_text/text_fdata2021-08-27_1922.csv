this bargain marijuana stock comes with a huge twist trulieve cannabis tcnnf 3 35 trul 2 73 has led its shareholders on a wild ride the stock is up 35 year over year but now down nearly 50 from its february highs that s despite the company growing its revenue and operating income less non cash items ebitda by 78 and 55 respectively to 215 1 million and 94 8 million in the second quarter of 2021 so what gives as it turns out trulieve faces several stumbling blocks ahead with its growth looking poised to fall off a cliff so is this a good time to open a stake a promising acquisition because of its sheer size trulieve is having difficulties sustaining historical rates of growth its revenue and ebitda increases are lower than last year when they roughly doubled so it s going ahead with its 2 1 billion acquisition of harvest health hrvsf to make up for the shortfall the deal has received approval from the supreme court of british columbia where harvest health is domiciled once it is finalized trulieve will add 42 more dispensaries to its roster which it is focusing around three cannabis hubs in the east west and gulf coast during q2 2021 harvest health grew its revenue 84 over the prior year s quarter to 102 5 million mainly thanks to skyrocketing cannabis sales in arizona but don t get too excited about trulieve s prospects just yet the major red flag it s quite clear to any outside observer that trulieve holds the dominant position in the florida medical marijuana industry it operates 88 of its 98 total stores in the sunshine state where it commands a 46 market share however don t assume that the company attained this success due to sheer perseverance and hard work earlier this month a secretly recorded conversation between former state representative halsey beshears and j t burnette a businessman and the husband of trulieve s ceo kim rivers came to light during the recording burnette bragged about working with beshears to grant his then girlfriend rivers and beshears s brother thad who is now on trulieve s board of directors an advantage in their application for one of five medical marijuana licenses in the state after the conversation criteria including requirements for dispensaries to put up multi million dollar bonds have an inventory of 400 000 cannabis plants and be incorporated while conducting non cannabis operations for 30 consecutive years were added at the last minute to florida s medical marijuana bill this made it impossible for trulieve s competitors to qualify for a dispensary license on aug 15 burnette was found guilty of five charges involving extortion and lying to the fbi in unrelated cases trulieve is currently not under investigation for alleged past misconduct so should i invest now trulieve could be in major trouble if it does come under federal investigation for alleged uncompetitive behavior in addition the company was dealt a serious blow after president biden backtracked on his campaign promises by opposing the legalization of marijuana while decriminalization is still possible that would still leave marijuana as illegal to transport or ship across state lines that means trulieve would not be able to leverage the centralized hubs it created with its recent harvest health acquisition to save costs and there are challenges facing biden or any president who moves forward with federal legalization for one thing the u s government would then need to answer for why it put hundreds of thousands if not millions of people in prison over the past decades for growing using and or distributing a drug with multiple medical benefits opening it up to a wave of litigation this wasn t much of an issue in canada as penalties for marijuana possession were never that harsh even during the height of the war on drugs on the other hand federal u s legislation in 1986 mandated judges to hand out five to 40 year sentences for first time offenders convicted of possession with intent to distribute small quantities of designated substances including marijuana with no chance of probation or parole the penalties have been watered down since then but many of the felony sentencing guidelines still remain to this day overall it s important to understand that trulieve could be in line for major legal liabilities is seeing its growth slow down and won t synergize that well with harvest health until cannabis is legalized on the federal level all that said these things are priced into the stock which is trading at just 3 8 times forward revenue and 20 7 times earnings these metrics are only a fraction of what its competitors like green thumb gtbif 2 60 and curaleaf curlf 3 35 stocks are fetching so if you have a big appetite for contrarian investments consider buying trulieve stock on the dip

across the us that threatens to weigh on economic activity in the coming months craig erlam senior market analyst uk emea at oanda wrote in a morning market note erlam went on to note that in light of recent global events including the growing number of coronavirus covid 19 delta variant cases may prompt the fed to hold back on its proposed tapering plans both would get very different reactions in the markets but they would also be out of character for the fed chairman and while he may lean more towards the dovish side of the argument on this policymakers since the last meeting have erred more

funds actively managed funds rely on money managers who buy and sell securities on your behalf provided that those investments align with the funds strategy these professionals conduct a great deal of research before deciding on the securities and assets to include in the fund the primary goal of fund managers is to earn investors higher returns as much as possible as a result actively managed funds tend to come with higher fees passively managed funds passively managed funds often referred to as index funds seek to replicate the performance of a benchmark index like the s p 500 these

portfolio with specific features bond funds another most popular type of mutual fund is bond funds sometimes called fixed income funds these funds invest in different types of bonds such as government bonds corporate bonds municipal bonds and other debt instruments unlike stock funds bond funds are typically less risky and tend to offer better returns index funds index funds seek to match the performance of a benchmark index like the s p 500 nasdaq 100 or the russell 2000 these investments don t rely on fund managers to pick securities instead they buy securities corresponding to a major market index for this reason index funds carry lower fees money market funds money market funds invest in short term securities issued by the u s government this can include treasury bills certificates of deposit and other cash equivalents these funds often carry the lowest risk and as a result lower returns the returns are however better than typical savings accounts balanced funds

as past performance expense ratios load fees and management fees 3 outline your asset mix before you invest prepare a list of the assets you d like to own and how you want to allocate those funds balance these specific wants with the golden rule of investing always diversify your portfolio 4 decide where to buy mutual funds you can purchase mutual funds directly from the company that created the fund or open a brokerage account however if you contribute to an employer sponsored retirement account such as 401 k or 403 b you likely have access to mutual funds 5 manage your portfolio once

the attacks have long been as puzzling as they are disturbing strange high pitched sounds that victims have sometimes described as a loud ringing or scraping and at other times as electronic or even like the chirping of a particularly insistent cricket they can be ear splittingly loud or barely audible just as the symptoms have been in some cases minor and in others devastating but there is rather more clarity over who is being targeted u s government spies diplomats and their families more than 130 of them across the world have succumbed to what has been dubbed havana syndrome after the place where it began five years ago about 100 cia agents and their loved ones are reportedly among the victims and if the mystery assault which has been attributed to a microwave or a sonic weapon really is as washington believes an attack by a hostile power it has finally scored a top level hit on wednesday it emerged that vice president kamala harris s trip to vietnam had been disrupted over fears of havana syndrome on wednesday it emerged that vice president kamala harris s trip to vietnam had been disrupted over fears of havana syndrome at least two u s officials in hanoi the vietnamese capital fell sick over the weekend and had to be evacuated just before ms harris headed there to reassure the locals that it would help them stand up to chinese aggression in the south china sea her flight from singapore was delayed by more than three hours without explanation and reporters travelling with ms harris had suspicions when her spokesman reassured them unprompted that the vice president was well her flight went ahead after an assessment of the threat officials said given the growing questions over joe biden s mental fitness for the presidency as he flails around in interviews and press conferences there is raised concern about his deputy s capacity to step into the breach if needed many victims of havana syndrome have reported experiencing a cognitive fog if the mystery assault which has been attributed to a microwave or a sonic weapon really is as washington believes an attack by a hostile power it has finally scored a top level hit stock picture of a radio telescope in new mexico if the sinister forces behind the syndrome whoever they are were warming up in vietnam like cuba a former inveterate u s foe and one of the world s few remaining communist countries for an attack on the vice president that would signify an alarming escalation in its use certainly china like russia another clear suspect didn t want ms harris to go to vietnam its state run media accusing her of seeking to drive a wedge between china and its south east asian neighbours and if the havana syndrome scare was intended to damage her visit it worked ms harris was going to hanoi to announce among other things a donation of a million coronavirus vaccine doses to the pandemic hit country but the three hour delay allowed china to rush its own envoy to the city and trump the americans with a chinese pledge of two million vaccines the united states embassy in havana cuba the u s officially refers to outbreaks of havana syndrome as anomalous health incidents but under that bland euphemism swirl myriad dark theories about what is causing it and who is responsible victims have also fallen ill as far afield as china berlin vienna and even washington dc the mystery began in late 2016 when u s diplomats and their families as well as canadian officials started falling ill in havana victims said the attacks usually came at night they would at times hear strange noises which some described as a scraping sound or similar to the chirping of cicadas or crickets others said the noises came in minute long bursts some said they heard nothing at all or just felt unusual vibrations the incidents didn t only take place in official embassy property one diplomat described being jolted awake in a havana hotel room by a grinding blaring cacophony exterior view of the embassy of the united states of america at pariser platz in berlin when he moved a few feet across the room the noise stopped when he returned to bed the agonising sound hit him again as if he had walked through some invisible wall symptoms included nosebleeds nausea dizziness and headaches but for some were as serious as mild brain damage and permanent hearing or memory loss as soon as some victims left cuba they stopped hearing noises a 2019 u s academic study found brain abnormalities in the diplomats who had fallen ill but cuba dismissed the report initial theories suggested a secret sonic weapon although that soon gave way to the idea that someone was shooting microwave energy at the americans analysts confirmed that a portable microwave weapon using the same basic technology as a microwave oven that heats food from inside and capable of causing the symptoms described has in recent years been developed by several countries including the u s russia and china and while the americans had baulked at testing on human subjects and shelved such research their opponents are not thought to have had any ethical qualms sceptics have countered that a weapon capable of damaging the human brain from a distance would need to be far too big to be used in a city pictured is the united states embassy located in vienna however some microwave experts say it is entirely possible for a relatively small device fitting inside two big suitcases to focus microwave energy on a small area of the brain rapid microwave pulses can heat soft tissue in the brain just enough to cause a thermoelastic pressure wave inside the skull and that pressure wave will initially be felt as sounds the russians or rather the soviets in the 1960s and 1970s have been developing microwave weapons for decades to use against u s diplomats on their territory by flooding a building with microwaves they would try to recreate documents by detecting the emissions of typewriters and later computer keyboards as well as pick up mobile phone conversations the cia and pentagon have likewise thrown money at such research however microwave theory sceptics say that after years of disappointing results in the laboratory there is little chance anyone could have produced a weapon capable of inflicting this sort of damage a string of other theories have been advanced for what happened in cuba they include ultrasound using sound frequencies too high for human hearing that could have come from covert listening devices the noise of a rare jungle cricket the effect of local pesticides and even a mass hysteria in which victims imagined it all but most of these theories don t explain why u s officials have been affected far beyond cuba four years ago a cia agent in moscow was targeted waking up in a hotel room with severe vertigo and in 2018 u s diplomats stationed at the large consulate in guangzhou china began reporting similar symptoms in 2019 two white house officials reported debilitating symptoms while staying in a london hotel room during a state visit by president trump one of them said she then experienced them again while walking her dog near her home in virginia another incident occurred the following year on a lawn close to the white house last month more than 20 u s diplomats and support staff at the embassy in vienna were affected america like many countries has a large presence in the austrian capital which since the cold war has been known as an espionage hotspot most of those affected were spies only a week ago it emerged that at least two officials at the u s embassy in berlin were being treated for the effects of havana syndrome and diplomatic sources say similar incidents have occurred among u s officials in other unnamed european countries with some victims being intelligence officers or diplomats working on russia related issues there have also been unconfirmed cases of the syndrome in poland taiwan georgia colombia and uzbekistan targets appear to have been followed as the symptoms persisted even after they were moved to new accommodation one victim in europe was reportedly diagnosed with the sort of brain injury seen in people exposed to the shockwaves from explosions the target described piercing ear pain high pitched electronic sounding noise and pressure in the ears there is no evidence about what happened to us but it is striking that some of us had worked on russia related issues the victim told the wall street journal adding whatever it is it is a form of terrorism in washington the issue has become one of national security importance the cia has reportedly appointed one of the spooks who helped find osama bin laden to discover who and what is causing havana syndrome the current consensus is that it is probably caused by microwave energy and the work of the russians moscow denies this although the hanoi outbreak may switch attention to china defence experts wouldn t be surprised if either country were behind it while the u s remains top dog in conventional weapons her two main enemies instead resort to more subtle measures that would not be considered an act of war in this case to literally get inside their opponent s head and wear her down

while inflation has been on investors minds for some time now the timeframe for the fed to make those dreaded adjustments may come sooner than expected according to dallas federal reserve president robert kaplan kaplan would like the fed to state in september that it will start to adjust its monetary policy citing that that the economy can be more autonomous at the same time however the dallas federal reserve president is also worried about inflation and excess risk taking that has led to distortions in financial markets particularly in bonds a sentiment that other investors likely agree with as well based on everything i ve seen i don t see anything at this point that would cause me to materially change my outlook kaplan told cnbc it would continue to be my view that when we get to the september meeting we would be well served to announce a plan for adjusting purchases and begin to execute that plan in october or shortly thereafter kaplan discussed the pivotal question of when it will be appropriate to taper the 120 billion a month of bond purchases that has been occurring since the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic fed chairman jerome powell may address these issues as well when he speaks as part of the virtual jackson hole symposium this week the federal reserve went on a massive bond buying spree that included purchases of bond exchange traded funds etfs at the height of the pandemic last year in an attempt to shore up the economy and offer protection peter duffy chief investment officer at penn capital is therefore looking for a relaxed noncommittal plan and believes that powell may proffer a more modest tapering than investors expect something less frequent than the projected monthly basis this additional caution could be due to the delta variant of the coronavirus which has become much more rampant spreading throughout the u s this summer and stymieing the planned return to the office for many companies and industries it s unfolding rapidly kaplan said on fox business network last week adding that the delta variant is slowing down a return to the office and hiring and limiting production which is exacerbating supply constraints the thing that i am going to be watching very carefully over the next month before the next meeting is it is having a more material impact on slowing demand and slowing gdp growth i m going to keep an open mind on that and if it is having a more negative effect that might cause me to adjust my views somewhat from ones that i ve stated he said despite climbing delta variant cases kaplan believes this isn t currently having a broad or dramatic impact on the economy what we re seeing is businesses and consumers are learning to adapt and go on with their lives and they re realizing that this is not going to be neat and clean or a straight line kaplan said it s going to go in fits and starts and they re getting adjusted to that reality

dive brief gilead does not owe bristol myers squibb 1 2 billion in damages related to a key cancer drug patent a federal appeals court ruled thursday overturning a prior judgment that would have forced the california biotech to pay sizable royalties to its new york rival a three judge panel for the u s court of appeals for the federal circuit determined that the claims contained in bristol myers patent were not specific enough for gilead to infringe upon with its cancer cell therapy yescarta in reaching their ruling the judges threw out a district court verdict in favor of bristol myers which gilead had appealed bristol myers disagrees with the appeals court s ruling a company spokesperson said in an emailed statement and intends to seek review of the decision in an emailed statement gilead said it was pleased with the court s decision dive insight the appeals court ruling is a significant one for the field of cancer cell therapy and for the two pharmaceutical companies both of which inherited the patent dispute after absorbing pioneering biotech developers of the complex medicines bristol myers involvement in the case comes from its 2019 acquisition of celgene which one year earlier had bought the seattle based biotech company juno therapeutics and its cancer drug research for 9 billion juno which licensed the patent in question from memorial sloan kettering cancer center had previously sued kite pharma for alleged infringement on oct 18 2017 the day the food and drug administration approved kite s lymphoma treatment yescarta six weeks before juno filed the lawsuit gilead agreed to buy kite in a 12 billion deal that accelerated a technological arms race between large cancer drugmakers at issue were blueprints for how to construct a cancer therapy by reengineering a patient s own immune cells the juno patent known in shorthand as the 190 patent describes three components that together make up what s known as a chimeric antigen receptor or car researchers can reprogram immune cells to express these cars on their surface guiding them to proteins commonly found on certain cancer cells particularly those in lymphoma and in leukemia juno alleged yescarta used the same blueprint and that kite was therefore violating its patent a claim upheld in a two week jury trial in federal court in california juno was initially awarded 585 million in damages an amount that was later upgraded to 1 2 billion gilead can now escape paying that sizable sum with the appeals court reversal the judges ruling centered on a legal test for patent claims known as written description a full written accounting of the claimed invention gilead s lawyers argued juno s patent did not contain enough information for a skilled practitioner to actually construct a car that could bind to the right cancer cells the appeals court judges largely agreed finding the patent provided scant details about which car components would bind to which cancer targets we agree with kite that no reasonable jury could find the 190 patent s written description sufficiently demonstrates that the inventors possessed the full scope of the claimed invention the judges wrote in addition to striking the 1 2 penalty the ruling also reverses the previous judgment that gilead would owe bristol myers squibb and memorial sloan kettering royalties on sales of yescarta which totaled 338 million in the first six months of 2021 bristol myers now also sells a rival car t cell therapy originally developed by juno called breyanzi and also for lymphoma gilead shares were little changed in thursday trading while bristol myers stock fell by nearly 1 in the emailed statement the bristol myers spokesperson added the appeals court s decision does not have any impact on the development of the company s car t therapies note this story has been updated to include comment from gilead

when users visit the telemedicine website speakwithanmd com they are immediately hit with a warning due to overwhelming demand we are experiencing longer than usual wait times the demand is for ivermectin a drug primarily used to deworm animals that has become the latest false cure for covid 19 and the website in partnership with the organization america s frontline doctors whose founder stormed the u s capitol on jan 6 has become well known in the facebook groups and reddit communities where anti vaccination sentiment thrives in those groups people trade dosing directions and purchasing advice for ivermectin please consider that even if you can get an rx for ivm the pharmacy may not fill it for 1 3 days claiming they don t have it in stock which is pure bulls a reddit user wrote in the ivermectin community this month have some horse paste on hand the user added referring to the tube form that ivermectin meant for horses comes in originally introduced as a veterinary drug for livestock animals in the late 1970s ivermectin quickly proved useful in combating certain human diseases caused by parasites a discovery that won the nobel prize for medicine in 2015 it comes in pills and pastes in versions meant for humans and for animals ivermectin has been called a wonder drug because of its use in treating parasitic diseases but it has not shown the same results in studies against viruses the drug was the subject of research into possible use as a covid 19 treatment including a promising non peer reviewed study that was later determined to be flawed and taken down by the website research square which hosts preprints of research papers that have not yet been published in academic journals the groups highlight the challenge public health officials and tech companies face in cracking down on covid 19 misinformation and the lengths some people will go to embrace fringe and misleading covid advice nbc news obtained access to several groups that are dedicated to ivermectin or have recently embraced the drug some groups have tens of thousands of members and can easily be found through facebook s search feature more than a year and a half into the coronavirus pandemic various drugs have had their moments in anti vaccination communities and among some conservatives in the u s and ivermectin is not particularly different but it comes at a time when parts of the country are in another covid wave this one fueled by the delta variant of the virus and with a safe and effective option available the vaccines it s hard to understand why people would turn down an fda approved covid preventative in favor of a treatment that s not only unapproved but has a large body of evidence showing it doesn t work said dr nathan boonstra a pediatrician at blank children s hospital in des moines iowa and co host of the podcast voices for vaccines but antivax groups will eat up any opportunity to make it seem like a vaccine isn t needed this has been true about anti vaccine groups long before the pandemic there is a lot of shared space between pro ivermectin and anti vaccine groups he added the centers for disease control and prevention issued a health advisory thursday warning of a rapid increase in ivermectin prescriptions and reports of severe illness by people using ivermectin products data from the national prescription audit showed a dramatic spike in ivermectin prescriptions in recent weeks more than nine times pre pandemic levels facebook spokesperson aaron simpson said in an emailed statement that the company removes any content that attempts to buy sell donate or ask for ivermectin we also enforce against any account or group that violates our covid 19 and vaccine policies including claims that ivermectin is a guaranteed cure or guaranteed prevention and we don t allow ads promoting ivermectin as a treatment for covid 19 he wrote since the beginning of the pandemic we have removed 20 million pieces of covid misinformation labeled more than 190 million pieces of covid content rated by our fact checking partners and connected over 2 billion people with authoritative information through tools like our covid information center reddit is reviewing the ivermectin communities spokesperson cameron njaa said in an emailed statement that underscored its commitment to providing accurate information resources and support to its users the groups suggest ways to buy ivermectin and plenty of encouragement to do so some commenters push users to online cattle supply companies or pet stores others recommend speakwithanmd com the website advertises consultations for 90 and fills prescriptions through ravkoo pharmacy an online pharmacy that america s frontline doctors advertises as partners who provide the option to have that prescription delivered right to your door the same day on a speakwithanmd com intake form viewed by nbc news prospective patients are asked what medication do you prefer the user is then presented with three options ivermectin hydroxychloroquine or not sure a user visiting for other reasons may not have much luck the website makes it clear controlled substances such as narcotics will never be prescribed reached by phone ravkoo pharmacy ceo alpesh patel declined to comment about the relationship with america s frontline doctors and hung up america s frontline doctors and speakwithanmd did not respond to requests for comment from hydroxychloroquine to ivermectin much as the anti malaria drug hydroxychloroquine became an unproven remedy for covid deniers after former president donald trump embraced it ivermectin has emerged in recent weeks as a favorite treatment of some conservatives and anti vaccination activists ivermectin first drew some attention late last year as a possible covid treatment with interest remaining reasonably low until july according to google search data in recent weeks a variety of conservative figures and anti vaccination activists have embraced the drug fox news hosts laura ingraham sean hannity and tucker carlson have mentioned it phil valentine the conservative radio host who died from covid 19 this week also turned to ivermectin after his diagnosis and urged his listeners to do the same he later encouraged listeners to get vaccinated have a doctor on speed dial who will write you a prescription for ivermectin he wrote on facebook public health officials have scrambled to respond while ivermectin is generally safe in low doses high doses can be toxic in humans the food and drug administration warned that ivermectin in large doses can cause side effects including skin rash nausea vomiting diarrhea stomach pain facial or limb swelling neurologic adverse events sudden drop in blood pressure severe skin rash potentially requiring hospitalization and liver injury the state health department in mississippi where at least two people had been hospitalized for ivermectin toxicity warned residents against taking the medicine this week and in perhaps a prime example of the exhaustion with which some public health professionals have confronted ivermectin the fda recently tweeted you are not a horse you are not a cow seriously y all stop it moo juice the warnings have done little to stunt enthusiasm for ivermectin in some facebook groups and reddit communities after self medicating some community members report back to the group with side effects like gastrointestinal upset or dizziness or wonder whether they have overdosed the link to the speakwithanmd website has been shared in dozens of public facebook groups including unmask our kids nevada it has also been shared by prominent anti vaccination influencers including dr christiane northrup who posted the link to her 550 000 followers on facebook with the caption to get the right treatment or prevention no need for fear many of us have known this all along america s frontline doctors is not speakwithanmd s only link to the far right conspiracy theorist jerome corsi also provides his audience with a vanity link to the website which was created in march 2020 and offers no information about its ownership speakwithanmd is closely tied with america s frontline doctors a group that went viral last year when its makeshift news conference in washington got millions of views after one of the physicians dr stella immanuel falsely called hydroxychloroquine a cure for covid 19 trump retweeted a video of the news conference pushed on social media by the conservative media site breitbart the website for america s frontline doctors directs people to speakwithanmd through a button that reads contact a physician and the america s frontline doctors logo is prominent on the speakwithanmd homepage simone gold founder of america s frontline doctors was arrested and charged with violent entry and disorderly conduct after she entered the capitol during the riot on jan 6 she pleaded not guilty to all charges gold who is awaiting trial spoke at an anti vaccination protest in santa monica california last weekend gold has spent the last year barnstorming churches schools and event spaces throughout the u s on the uncensored truth tour in which she gives a presentation sowing doubt about covid vaccines gold did not respond to requests for comment the popularity of the site has sent some facebook users back to the feed store losing patience with speakwithanmd s wait times users on facebook s ivermectin groups sometimes share anecdotes about other telemedicine apps on which doctors have prescribed the drug prophylactically or they try to persuade one another to buy it over the counter at pet stores the facebook groups which have names like ivermectin md team lead some users to believe they are talking to medical experts and doctors but any one of the 25 000 members can post advice or suggestions about taking the deworming drug the communities are filled with advice for off label drug cocktails featuring the dewormer the pages frequently feature ways to make the paste more palatable such as mixing it with jellies or eating it as a sandwich the flavor frequently has users wondering how to hide its pungent taste i take it by hiding it in a banana or bread a reddit user wrote the flavor sort of bothers me some users sell what they claim to be ivermectin in the comments sections desperate for what they believe is a miracle drug commenters frequently oblige often leaving their whatsapp addresses or phone numbers in replies to complete transactions worried about crackdowns due to increasingly bad publicity moderators of the facebook groups are also creating backup channels on smaller social media channels like mewe and telegram in case they are banned from facebook users have also cut back on the use of the words vaccine and ivermectin calling them v and ivm respectively some users have begun to call ivermectin more colloquial names like moo juice because many have been ingesting the gel version others ask users how much their horse weighs when they dole out advice for dosages i identify as a horse and can report no ill effects from the directed dosage as recommended by professionals taken on a weekly basis a reddit user wrote i like mine with a side of strawberry jam clarification aug 26 2021 9 35 p m e t a previous version of this article inadvertently included a quote from a facebook group about possible side effects from ivermectin that was later determined to be in jest it has been removed

friday s speech by federal reserve board chair jerome powell is the highlight of the jackson hole symposium two federal reserve bank presidents on thursday renewed the call for tapering in televised interviews kansas city fed president esther george said the panel should begin tapering its asset purchases sooner rather than later this year despite the issues the delta variant may cause i don t think changes my own calculus that it is time to begin to make those adjustments given the gains we have seen so far she said during an interview on bloomberg tv the key she said was to get started with details including about exact start date and pace less important separately federal reserve bank of st louis president james bullard told cnbc the asset purchases are no longer necessary and he expects the federal open market committee will agree on a wind down plan although he did not provide a timeline it does seem that we are coalescing around a plan powell seems to be less eager to begin tapering although since the meeting and his semiannual monetary report to congress a strong employment report was released at that time the chair still believed the employment goal was a ways away members of the fed seem to be divided among those who are ready to taper now those who want to see one more good employment report and those looking for two more big gains in nonfarm payrolls before cutting back asset purchases the market will be keyed on powell s speech to see if his stance has changed and if he gives any definitions timeline or hints about substantial further progress toward its employment goal george also spoke to fox business where she said the baseline outlook is for more jobs and strong economic growth adding delta may trim employment gains but it shouldn t derail the economy indeed the preliminary second quarter gross domestic product read showed 6 6 growth in the three month period better than the 6 5 gain in the advance read and the 6 3 climb in the first quarter economists polled by ifr markets expected a 6 7 gain there were no surprises in today s release but merely a reminder that the economy is recovering robustly from the economic disruptions of last year said matt peron director of research at janus henderson investors the data continue to show that gdp growth was driven primarily by consumer spending although business fixed investment spending also made a positive contribution to topline gdp growth said wells fargo securities chief economist jay bryson and economist shannon seery corporate profits were at record levels in the period they noted wide profit margins suggest that businesses may have the ability to avoid passing on all cost increases to customers also released thursday initial jobless claims crept to 353 000 in the week ended aug 21 from a revised 349 000 a week earlier first reported as 348 000 economists expected 350 000 claims continuing claims slid to 2 862 million in the week ended aug 14 from 2 865 million the week before the pandemic has demonstrated that few things move in a straight line and the latest snapshot of jobless claims is consistent with that said bankrate senior economic analyst mark hamrick the nation s unemployment rate has dropped significantly from last year s peak and may be poised to move lower the four week moving average fell to 366 500 a pandemic low in the week ended aug 21 from 378 000 a week earlier this suggests the labor market continues to gradually recover said scott anderson chief economist at bank of the west chip barnett contributed to this report

several years working and exhibiting in europe and asia and is now studying for a bfa in image arts photography studies at ryerson university in toronto ilina s entry david is taken from a series of portraits that celebrates positive body image and questions notions of masculinity and femininity by highlighting their fluidity themes of identity and gender expression are central to ilina s work and the series entitled rosemary thyme subverts time honoured tropes of representation in western art by depicting male sitters in poses traditionally found in portraits of females from velázquez to ingres painters have portrayed men in positions of power or as muscular heroes in battle whereas females are often pictured naked and reclining communicating softness weakness and openness to gaze explains ilina i wanted to borrow the so called feminine body language from those paintings and juxtapose it with male sitters being physically and emotionally strong still dominates western ideologies and expectations of real men but it s important that contemporary men have the right to be vulnerable and gentle and not feel ashamed of that also on artdaily paul holberton publishes titian the della rovere dynasty his portrait of guidobaldo ii and his son pierre elie de pibrac for the series hakanai sonzai pierre elie de pibrac was born in paris france in 1983 pibrac graduated

movement as if they are trapped by their surroundings with no visible escape says pibrac the series title hakanai sonzai translates as i myself feel like an ephemeral creature it reflects pibrac s

born in the russian city of perm in 1990 katya ilina bought her first camera as a teenager during a summer exchange in small town montana where she encountered the local cowboy culture since then she has spent several years working and exhibiting in europe and asia and is now studying for a bfa in image arts photography studies at ryerson university in toronto ilina s entry david is taken from a series of portraits that celebrates positive body image and questions notions of masculinity and femininity by highlighting their fluidity themes of identity and gender expression are central to ilina s work and the series entitled rosemary thyme subverts time honoured tropes of representation in western art by depicting male sitters in poses traditionally found in portraits of females from velázquez to ingres painters have portrayed men in positions of power or as muscular heroes in battle whereas females are often pictured naked and reclining communicating softness weakness and openness to gaze explains ilina i wanted to borrow the so called feminine body language from those paintings and juxtapose it with male sitters being physically and emotionally strong still dominates western ideologies and expectations of real men but it s important that contemporary men have the right to be vulnerable and gentle and not feel ashamed of that pierre elie de pibrac was born in paris france in 1983 pibrac graduated from business school in 2009 only to turn his back on a lucrative future in finance when his first photographic portraits taken on a trip to myanmar received immediate recognition he has since become a much celebrated and prolific visual artist exhibiting widely and publishing several monographs pilbrac s shortlisted large format portraits were taken in japan where he spent eight months accompanied by his wife and children travelling to the country s most troubled regions he focused his lens on people who exhibited fortitude in the face of adversity in fukushima he photographed residents still exiled from their contaminated homes following the nuclear meltdown a decade ago other portraits were taken in the former mining town yubari once known as the country s capital of coal now devastated by colliery closures and depopulation each portrait emanates from long discussions i had with my subjects about a painful event in their lives he says in all the pictures i forbid any movement as if they are trapped by their surroundings with no visible escape says pibrac the series title hakanai sonzai translates as i myself feel like an ephemeral creature it reflects pibrac s belief that his sitters forbearance is rooted in a national culture of fatality and awareness of impermanence sydney based photographer david prichard s entry is a series of portraits of first nation women who spent most of their working lives as stock women on cattle stations in far north queensland their physically demanding work involved a range of duties from cooking and other homestead chores to maintaining the welfare of the livestock often on horseback born in sydney australia in 1966 prichard has documented indigenous peoples for much of his career and was commissioned to create the series by normanton council in queensland following a well received 2019 exhibition that showcased first nation rodeo riders in the region the cultural and social history of stock women has gone almost completely unrecorded and prichard welcomed the opportunity to help their voices be heard any level of investigation into australian history reveals the years of trauma that indigenous people have suffered prichard says one can only imagine what stock women endured living in remote areas in a world dominated by white colonial culture and law i wanted to produce portraits that were dignified strong and beautiful and worthy to represent these women today and into the future the prize winning photographs and those selected for inclusion in the exhibition were chosen from 5 392 submissions entered by 2 215 photographers from 62 countries a total of 55 portraits from 26 artists have been selected for display in the taylor wessing photographic portrait prize

with that i ll turn it over to our co ceo chano fernandez over to you chano chano fernandez co chief executive officer thank you aneel and thank you to everyone for joining us today as aneel mentioned we had a fantastic q2 driven by very strong execution which combined with a rapidly improving demand environment for enterprise management cloud solutions is causing our net new business to accelerate at an even faster pace than we expected the strength in q2 was broad based highlighted by large enterprise outperformance and solid growth in landing new core hr and fins customers we also saw a strength in landing new customers across our expanded portfolio solutions targeting the office of the cfo and chro for example our planning and workday strategic sourcing businesses drove significant strength in winning new large enterprise customers in q2 including the largest planning first deal in our history and peakon drove significant new logo of activity in emea providing us a gateway into selling core hcm and fins solutions over time in addition to solid performance from our land sales team the momentum we ve been seeing with our customer base team also continued in q2 as companies look to workday as a trusted strategic partner we had another quarter of strong renewal performance and our customer base drove strength cross selling a number of solutions such as core fins planning spend management health peakon extend and our talent portfolio for example in planning we signed add on deals with google with one of the world s largest telecommunication companies and a fortune 100 distribution company and in spend management we had a number of add on wins with companies such as loan secure mercy health cme group and ralph lauren we also had a number of notable extended customer space wins in the quarter including a fortune 100 manufacturer a fortune 50 energy company and one of the world s largest banks and peakon isn t just landing new logos it is a powerful solution to sell back to our customers we had notable add on deals this quarter including uptake and perkinelmer from a geographic standpoint our performance was strong globally with north america outperforming across all segments including significant strength from our large and medium enterprise teams and from industries such as healthcare and higher education in international market emea was a standout driving healthy acceleration in new acv bookings with particular outperformance in continental europe including outstanding performance in france and in spain we are seeing improving market dynamics and pipeline momentum across our rest of world regions and we expect those trends to continue as we move into the back half of the year as we ve discussed over the last few quarters we re investing aggressively in our go to market exports our largest area of headcount investment in the first half of fy 22 was in sales and marketing as we added significant new global sales capacity across both our net new and install base teams including a doubling down in international markets we re also accelerating our spend across key brand and marketing initiatives these investments which we expect will continue in the second half of the year are focused on driving growth in fy 23 and beyond and we re very pleased with the evolution we re seeing in our pipeline which again saw solid growth in q2 in closing i would like to thank the more than 13 000 global workmates who have enabled us to drive such a strong q2 on the first half results our growth and differentiated suite of solutions is winning in the market and we re incredibly well positioned as we enter the second half of the year let s keep the momentum going and now i will turn it over to our president and cfo robynne sisco over to you robynne robynne sisco president and chief financial officer thanks chano and good afternoon everyone as aneel and chano mentioned we delivered an incredibly strong q2 driven by exceptional execution against a rapidly improving market backdrop as organizations accelerate the pace of digital transformation across hr and finance subscription revenue in the second quarter was 1 11 billion up 20 year over year driven by very strong new business sales favorable in quarter linearity and an over performance on customer renewals with gross retention once again over 95 professional services revenue was 147 million resulting in total revenue of 1 26 billion revenue outside the u s was 318 million up 24 year over year and representing 25 of the total 24 month backlog at the end of the second quarter was 6 88 billion growth of 19 total subscription revenue backlog was 10 58 billion up 23 our non gaap operating income for the second quarter was 292 million resulting in a non gaap operating margin of 23 margin overachievement was driven by a combination of top line outperformance and favorable expense variances operating cash flow in q2 was 198 million growth of 26 in addition to strong profitability from our core operations during q2 we also recognized a nearly 100 million mark to market gain from the successful ipo of one of our venture s portfolio companies we will continue to see mark to market adjustments from our equity investments but we expect gains of this magnitude will be extremely rare our largest investments continue to be in our people and in attracting top talent to workday in the first half of the year we successfully added and integrated more than 900 net new employees bringing our total employee count to over 13 400 at the end of q2 we ve made important progress toward our full year target of adding 2 500 employees and expect the pace of hiring to increase throughout the back half of fy 22 overall we re extremely pleased with the momentum we saw in q2 and we re very well positioned as we enter the important back half of the year now turning to guidance based on our strong q2 and the momentum we re seeing in our business we are raising our fy 22 outlook and providing q3 guidance as follows for subscription revenue we re raising our full year estimate to be in the range of 4 50 billion to 4 51 billion 19 growth for q3 we expect subscription revenue of 1 156 billion to 1 158 billion 20 growth at the high end and we expect 24 month backlog growth of 19 we still expect professional services revenue to be 590 million in fy 22 as we continue to prioritize driving the highest level of customers success for q3 we expect professional services revenue of 150 million investing for growth remains our number one priority in addition to the increased pace of hiring in the back half of fy 22 we also expect to ramp non headcount spending with investments specifically targeted at accelerating demand generation enhancing our market position and advancing our strategic product roadmap additionally the new bonus plan aneel mentioned will take effect on november 1 and is expected to impact our q4 margins by approximately 300 basis points given that backdrop we expect non gaap operating margins of 21 in q3 16 in q4 and 21 for the full year the gaap operating margin is expected to be lower than the non gaap margin by approximately 24 percentage points in q3 and 25 percentage points in q4 and for the full year given our strong performance we are also raising our fy 22 operating cash flow guidance to 1 5 billion we continue to expect 270 million of other capital investments to support our customer growth and continued business expansion i ll close by thanking our amazing employees customers and partners for their continued support and hard work we re off to a very strong start in the first half of the year and our focus remains on driving accelerated bookings growth we look forward to hosting our virtual analyst day on september 21 where we will share insights on our strategic innovation and growth initiatives as we look ahead to fy 23 and beyond with that i ll turn it over to the operator to begin q a questions and answers operator thank you your first question comes from the line of kirk materne with evercore isi please proceed with your question kirk materne evercore group llc analyst thanks very much and congrats on a really good quarter great to see the acceleration in acv growth aneel and chano i was wondering could you just talk a little bit more about what you ve seen over the last six months i know you re both more upbeat about the pipeline heading into this year but when you talk about a quarter of this magnitude from a growth perspective could you talk about maybe what happened in the quarter that you weren t expect whether it was deals coming in at a faster cadence deal cycles getting shorter deals growing perhaps at the end of the deal meaning more add ons more multiproduct deals i was wondering if you could add just a little bit more color to that and kind of why do you see that continuing into the back half of the year what gives you confidence around the pipeline thanks aneel bhusri co founder co chief executive officer and chairman i ll just make a couple of comments about what i hear from other ceos and then i ll turn it over to chano for the most part ceos are pretty optimistic about the future of their business and they also realize that they have to jump onboard of digital transformation for both hr and finance so despite what s been going on with the pandemic the mindset is back to business and so we saw that in the pipeline and we saw it in people taking actions they re not sitting on the sidelines anymore and maybe chano can add to that chano fernandez co chief executive officer hi kirk hope you re well i think to unpack a little bit the strength in q2 was truly broad based highlighted by solid growth in landing new core hr customers and we have significant strength across the business as we mentioned but i would call out the large enterprise theme as a key outperformer there was also a strong performance across regions particularly with the healthy bounce back in emea and continental europe and we also saw good dynamic in terms of landing new products within the office of the cfo and fins and fins splash were good contributors as well and last but not least there was solid performance in our install base themes and renewal so as a whole it was right across the board very positive and i would just highlight what aneel said like this acceleration of digital transformation initiatives coming back to the table and really is coming back across the financials and hcm that at least is what we re seeing but it is reflected in the pipeline when we look at the second half kirk materne evercore group llc analyst if i could just have one follow up for robynne robynne obviously a really impressive quarter across the board when we look at the crpo growth 24 month backlog i assume that still has some of that headwind from the expiry base on it so if we look at the apples to apples it that would probably have been above 20 on this quarter if we tried to normalize for that is that fair and i assume that expiry base headwind should dissipate a little bit as we get into fiscal 23 thanks robynne sisco president and chief financial officer yeah kirk what we discussed last quarter still holds which is that we re seeing an impact of roughly a couple of points to the 24 month backlog throughout fy 22 and you re correct that we don t expect that dynamic in fy 23 at all and just as a reminder this dynamic has no impact on new acv bookings subscription revenue or how we run the business and our focus continues to be on accelerating our new acv bookings we re really pleased with our progress on that front and you re seeing that show up in the backlog growth numbers even despite the headwinds that we have this year on renewals kirk materne evercore group llc analyst great thank you all operator your next question comes from the line of brad sills with bank of america please proceed with your question brad sills bank of america merrill lynch analyst oh great thanks so much for taking my question and congratulations on a real nice q2 i wanted to ask a question that kind of goes back to comments you ve made last quarter aneel around really the strategy within to surround the account surround the transactional system with some of these peripheral systems you re seeing real strength in planning it sounds like procurement is really ramping at what point is there a potential migration that happens when you have one or two of these modules they re running for a year or more is there a certain tipping point when you might expect some of those conversions on the core transactional system over time thank you aneel bhusri co founder co chief executive officer and chairman well it definitely doesn t hurt to have a combination of hcm maybe a few financial modules in there but i think the more important dynamic is that as we exit running the businesses for the pandemic and try to run business in a more normalized way the demand for core financial systems is coming back and we saw that this quarter it was a strong quarter for core financial systems we saw the entry point with planning being up over 50 as a really strong indicator of what we might see over the next few quarters so it s really it s more than just one dynamic it s across the board so we saw strength in the add on modules we also did see strength in core accounting as well i d like to highlight that accounting center has a really important product for some of the large volume customers we have out there in particular in areas like financial services a product that continues to get great traction and great reviews just opening up more doors for us for core accounting brad sills bank of america merrill lynch analyst that s great to hear and one more if i may please in the past about a year ago you talked about some pandemic headwinds since then you ve obviously seen those improve what are you hearing from the office of the hr manager and the office of the cfo in terms of willingness to make investments now in digital transformation now that we re kind of exiting things clearly your results are showing that those prices are coming back in the back office aneel bhusri co founder co chief executive officer and chairman yeah i think the mindset for companies that hadn t gone through the transformation was that it was really hard to run their business with the remote workforce or a hybrid workforce or whatever model they had to go to without the flexibility and ability to work from home with that could systems like workday offer if you re on legacy systems it was a really hard time and so i think folks have said hey even if we are still dealing with some of the issues around the pandemic we got to get on with it we got to move on to the modern system and that s been a real big driver for us brad sills bank of america merrill lynch analyst great to hear thanks so much aneel operator your next question comes from the line of keith weiss with morgan stanley please proceed with your question keith weiss morgan stanley co llc analyst excellent thank you guys for taking the question and a very nice quarter a couple of questions kind of multi part question digging into kind of the nature of the strength that you guys have been seeing in the first half of the year and it s really in two parts one in terms of is what you re seeing just kind of a release of pent up demand like last year was 2020 was very difficult year to get these big enterprise transactions across the line so i m assuming a lot of it kind of ends up in the pipeline or is there more of a combination of sort of pent up demand and sort of new business coming into the pipe or sort of a new digital transformation initiatives getting an extra boost given what happened last year and then similarly last year one of the real bright spots was how well the upsell motion the base motion propped up overall growth for the company has that sustained with sort of new business ramping up have you been able to keep that good balance of new business in the door as well as upsell into fy 22 thank you aneel bhusri co founder co chief executive officer and chairman i ll take the first part i think it is a bit of both there s no question there was some pent up demand that s impacted the first half of the year but i really think the pandemic forced a key change and a change in mindset about how quickly people had to get into the cloud and move into the digital transformation project for hr and finance so while it might have slowed down last year i think it s picked up but now i think it s going to be that way going forward and even companies that had waited for a long time are now acting today so a bit of pent up demand but i think more a positive change in the marketplace going forward chano you want to add to that chano fernandez co chief executive officer i would just say that jointly with healthy new global activity to your question keith we re seeing a very solid quarter with significant growth rates on our install base and it is not just one single solution right when you look across accounting center or health or extend or peakon i mean people analytics they re all contributing so the upselling and cross selling within a satisfied customer base remains very healthy so it s really building the business having good momentum on all engines keith weiss morgan stanley co llc analyst excellent nice job guys thank you operator your next question comes from the line of mark murphy with j p morgan please proceed with your question mark murphy j p morgan analyst yes thank you and i ll add my congrats so robynne our thinking was that the pipeline inflection that you saw a couple of quarters back would not convert to bookings really until later this year and into next year so just given the upside did you see a bit faster cycle of pipeline conversion than normal or did you kind of still see it lining up relatively more toward year end robynne sisco president and chief financial officer yeah well as you know we always have a really important and strong back half of the year and that s not changing this year we did have very very good pipeline conversion rate in q2 and maybe chano i ll let you comment on that being on the frontline there chano fernandez co chief executive officer hi mark clearly some of the land motions convert faster right the quarterly strategic sourcing or some of the planning or peakon stand alone motions those will convert faster than the core hcm and core financials products but obviously there s strength coming already from the pipeline that it was built during the second half last year it has already started to play out and will play out more during the second half this year mark murphy j p morgan analyst okay understood thank you and then just aneel a quick follow up for you i was wondering about the cadence of financing we know that they paused their spending during the pandemic and now they ve been wanting to accelerate their move to the cloud do you think that is the part of this kind of remaining consistent where they might pull in some of the projects they had planned in 2024 2025 i m sort of wondering with the delta variant headlines in the news is that going to intensify that or defer that a bit or more of a zero issue from the delta variant aneel bhusri co founder co chief executive officer and chairman time will tell right when we thought we were coming out of the pandemic we get hit with the delta variant so it s just such a changing unpredictable world right now the last data that i saw from gartner suggested that projects from this year and for some of next year would be pushed out and projects from 24 would be pulled into 23 and i think our pipeline suggests that the pipeline s getting better for financials and it should continue to get better and i think going into next year more projects will get pulled into next year mark murphy j p morgan analyst understood thank you operator your next question comes from the line of d j hynes with canaccord please proceed with your question david hynes canaccord genuity llc analyst hey thanks guys and congrats on the nice start here for the first half of the year i wanted to ask about the hiring environment and progress on that front two questions maybe one for robynne and one for chano so robynne you re at 900 net new employees of i think you said 2 500 targeted how does this seasonality right 35 in the first half 65 in the second half compare to kind of internal plans as well as prior years and then chano just given the headcount ramp expected in the second half if i gave you 10 new sales reps how would you allocate them between hunters versus back to base reps and maybe you could talk about maybe how that might be different than it would have been in a year or two ago robynne sisco president and chief financial officer so on over our overall hiring d j so as you know we game the year with really really aggressive hiring plans i would have hoped it would have been further along than 900 at this point but it took us some time to really ramp the recruiting engine because as you know we had paused hiring a lot of last year so we had to get that going so it s not surprising that we are going be back end loaded we feel really good about our recruiting engine right now we feel good that we re going to be able to accelerate hiring into the back half of the year and we re still targeting those 2 500 hires that we feel good about where we are but maybe a little bit of a slower start than what we had hoped coming into the year david hynes canaccord genuity llc analyst okay chano fernandez co chief executive officer d j thank god robynne is more generous than you and not giving me some more headcount that came if i would be to play out with the team i would say that the first thing kind of angle i will be looking at geographically and clearly we re allocating more sales capacity today in international markets where we see a significant opportunity ahead this is not just for second half this year but clearly it s fy 23 and beyond as well so that would be first i mention the second one would be clearly yes between the balance between net new logo and install base but also you need to consider we have some of the land first motions across peakon or planning or strategic sourcing so those plays into account as well and we see opportunity clearly across net new logo activity across install base and some of the land motion so balanced picture across those and clearly with a more pivot investment within our international markets within north america today david hynes canaccord genuity llc analyst yeah okay perfect that s helpful color thank you guys operator your next question comes from the line of brad reback of stifel please proceed with your question brad reback stifel nicolaus analyst great thanks very much if we think about the 1 1 billion of 24 month backlog increase year over year are we at a point now where half of that s from new customers versus growth at existing any sort of color on that would be super helpful robynne sisco president and chief financial officer yeah brad so as you can imagine the bigger we get and the longer we ve been in business it will shift that backlog component more toward renewals than net new so that shift has been something that has been in process for quite some time this year is different as we pointed out earlier that we actually have flat renewals year over year and so we re getting a little bit more of a proportion toward net new this year but we expect that that trend will reverse again next year as we get back to more normalized renewals growth brad reback stifel nicolaus analyst great thanks very much operator your next question comes from the line of michael turits with keybanc please proceed with your question michael turits keybanc capital markets inc analyst hey guys great congrats on the quarter very nice robynne it s a nice margin beat and a raise on the year it seems like it s more than just revenue upside and this is despite what it has been very aggressive hiring and lots of discussions of investment so is this a change at all in your operating philosophy or structure such that you re able to get this margin upside and where accelerating revenue came robynne sisco president and chief financial officer well good part of our margin race was the over performance on the top line so that s a very big chunk of it we had some expenses slip from q2 into the back half of the year some of our programmatic spend and as i just mentioned before we were hoping to do a little faster hiring so we have some savings from that as well as we look at next year though keep in mind that a lot of the hiring we re doing this year is going have a full year impact next year some of the programs we re going to put in place in the back half of this year will roll into next year we also expect that certain costs will layer back in such as travel return to office and hopefully in person events that we can start doing again additionally the bonus program that aneel talked about with about a 300 basis point impact on margin that will continue into next year and beyond and so it s a performance based plan so it could vary with our results but we expect that impact to remain fairly consistent through next year if we achieve our targets keep in mind though that the impact from the plan on margins will vary over time based on top line growth hiring and performance against our goals so just keep all of those things in mind when you think about longer term margins michael turits keybanc capital markets inc analyst great that s really helpful thanks and then sounds like business is going very well can you give us some sense of where fins acv is coming in relative to hcm acv robynne sisco president and chief financial officer so we saw growth in both fins and hcm acv and both contributed to our overachievement in this year both contributed to our guidance raise and we re seeing really strong growth across both of those in our pipeline as well michael turits keybanc capital markets inc analyst i guess i didn t mean a total i m not trying to pull that out of you i m just saying in terms of individual deals is it coming in at larger levels than hcm for individual customers robynne sisco president and chief financial officer in terms of pricing aneel bhusri co founder co chief executive officer and chairman we are still in the world of hcm we sell to absolutely the biggest companies in the world like a cvs health and in finance the bigger companies haven t yet moved to the cloud but they re beginning to so right now i d say the average hcm customer at the high end is bigger than the finance customer but that s changing and they will equalize over time michael turits keybanc capital markets inc analyst okay thanks operator your next question comes from the line of alex zukin of wolfe research please proceed with your question alex zukin wolfe research analyst thanks guys for taking the question so i guess one element that seems interesting is there is a lot more of these new land motions around i think you mentioned planning you mentioned peakon spend management i want to get a better understanding how much of the bookings is kind of this now coming from this new land motion because it does feel like the opportunity for dollar based net expansion or expansion and going back into those customers is going be higher and so you kind of are opening up this new it s a little bit different than historically when you had such a large land but the upsell was more difficult chano fernandez co chief executive officer yeah clearly the majority of the dollars are of course are still coming from the core hcm and the core fins transformation as a whole these land motions are clearly what they re providing is much more significant volume up selling particularly on the install base but as well getting us into new customers that we re expecting to cross sell later on to our core products but of course the majority of the acv is obviously still from the bigger transformation projects alex zukin wolfe research analyst understood and then and robynne maybe kind of dovetailing on michael s question is it possible to get a little bit more color on some of the tailwinds on margins this year and how to think about them layering out of the model for next year particularly as we get back to some of those pre covid go to market motions in travel and with the bonus pool robynne sisco president and chief financial officer yeah so in addition to my commentary answering michael s question i guess the only thing i would add is that we still have six months to go until we re into next year things like travel how much it comes back are still uncertain so it s a little hard to predict right now above and beyond the drivers that i mentioned earlier but we ll share more with you on fy 2023 margins at a later date when we get closer and we ve closed another quarter or two aneel bhusri co founder co chief executive officer and chairman i would add that i do think travel and entertainment budgets i think those will change going forward even when we get out of the pandemic we ve just learned how to work smarter without having to have people on site everywhere you can do a lot of work from your office or from at home and then you can concentrate the few trips on really meaningful activities so and i don t think that s specific to workday i think that s specific to a lot of companies that were just used to spending a lot of money on travel that probably will not spend like that again alex zukin wolfe research analyst perfect operator we will now take two more questions your next question comes from the line of raimo lenschow with barclays please proceed with your question raimo lenschow barclays capital analyst hey thank you thanks for squeezing me in and congrats from me as well chano can you talk a little bit about the importance of the new payrolls that you announced i think germany and australia just in terms of the international buildout because we all agree that s a big opportunity the question is like in terms of financial functionality hr functionality are you quite there yet capitalize on that and then i had one follow up chano fernandez co chief executive officer yeah raimo we really understand and acknowledge how important local payrolls are to our strategy and our customers and if you look at payroll for your money and you know the country well workforce management over there and the number of manufacturing companies we are providing them solutions around hcm having payroll is of tremendous importance for us to capture a bigger part of the market i can say the same out of australia so this is expansion really into this market it s very significant and critical to our strategic initiatives that we do have for growth within our international markets so we feel very good about it obviously it s going to take us a couple of years to develop those but even today customers knowing that that is our strategy we think that is going to open more doors for consideration on some customers that are looking more for a provider that obviously can close the loop as well in terms of the pay and the workforce management and time tracking and scheduling as a whole when it comes to financials we just keep been doing an improvements in terms of our international capabilities i think if you look at some of the analysts they are highlighting those some of the customers as well they re highlighting those too and we just keep becoming stronger in terms of our financials solution from an international perspective in terms of the local regulations and basically the localizations that are required so that in some cases right now is highlighted today more as a strength than many other things when some of our customers are becoming workday customers honestly it s also a great point that many are going successfully live in emea with our financial solutions and those are working very nicely and becoming preferential customers for us raimo lenschow barclays capital analyst perfect that s very clear thank you and then one follow up when we talk with the system integrators they are seeing a lot more activity of people sketching out mapping out processes etc which is kind of the first step to toward changing the finance system what are you seeing there in terms of how quickly those projects are evolving in terms of and also kind of showing up for you guys are we still in the same pre pandemic cadence of six to nine months kind of lead time or trying to sketch out what you want to do and how you want to do it and then doing it or do you see an acceleration there because people realize there s a little bit more urgency here thank you and congrats from me as well chano fernandez co chief executive officer yeah it s a great question what you re seeing is more projects taking place that is obvious as you were saying some customers are doing what they call kind of a phase zero which is this mapping of the processes and understanding what would be the future compared with the assays kind of processes that they do have today and they re working with the system integrators but i think those a are being worked faster because there is more urgency there for transformation being all the things that and difficult business that customers have been facing during the pandemic phase and b clearly there are many more projects taking place as well around the financial transformation which is gradually improving is what we re seeing there as more customers are moving financials to the cloud raimo lenschow barclays capital analyst perfect thank you operator your final question comes from the line of scott berg with needham company please proceed with your question scott berg needham co llc analyst hi everyone congrats on the quarter and thanks for taking my question so first off you just announced the company achieved ready status for the fedramp program how should we think about the sales opportunity in that segment and what products do you expect those customers will adopt the most aneel bhusri co founder co chief executive officer and chairman well it s already in motion we already have customers in the federal government they re more quasi fed agencies than full fed agencies that are using workday as we go through the cycle it s long sales cycle but those sales cycles will begin and we re fully on the schedule middle of the next year so i would start i would think you ll start seeing the pipeline build and hopefully some good wins beginning to happen quasi agencies first and then full agencies sometime next year in terms of hr and financials there we re a good fit we re going to find requirements that we re going have to build specifically for federal government but we are in general a good fit for both solutions for the federal government scott berg needham co llc analyst great thank you and then just one more quick one you mentioned it a little bit earlier but talking about australia and germany and the expansion there with payroll can you give us a little bit of color on how much further should we expect the company to take its payroll functionality after those two markets are complete aneel bhusri co founder co chief executive officer and chairman i d expect that we re going to continue to invest in payroll integration across the globe we might add one or two more payrolls over the next few years but you re not going to see us add 10 unless we find a great company to acquire which we haven t seen yet what we are doing is going country by country and where we don t have a payroll really trying to build a tighter integration scott berg needham co llc analyst great aneel bhusri co founder co chief executive officer and chairman which is honestly what most of our customers do with their global payroll demands anyways scott berg needham co llc analyst awesome thank you operator duration 47 minutes call participants justin furby senior

them that s right they think these 10 stocks are even better buys see the 10 stocks stock advisor returns as of august 9 2021 with that i will now turn the call over to felipe felipe athayde chief executive officer thank you biz good morning and thank you for joining us the end of fiscal 21 marks an important milestone in the history of regis the journey toward a fully franchised business model and away from an operating company began four years ago and i can proudly say that this major transformational phase is now complete our salons are essentially fully in the hands of franchise partners and we can for the first time make decisions for regis through the lens of a true franchisor with a management team that combines both deep expertise in franchising and legacy operational know how along with the full transformation of our business model i am very pleased to say that we have a large number of salons running on our proprietary tech platform opensalon pro a platform that until three years ago simply did not exist these are all remarkable accomplishments in the face of unprecedented times and i want to take this opportunity to personally thank both our teams and our franchisees for working tirelessly through such challenging environments i want to take a few moments to update you on the progress we have made on key initiatives that have gone hand in hand with our business transformation major highlights for the year include assembling a new management team with deep franchising expertise a reorganization of our business to focus on our brands the elimination of 1 356 company owned salons through refranchising negotiated lease buyouts or closing at the end of the lease terms a new organizational structure based on zero based budgeting the transition of almost 2 000 salons onto our proprietary pos and salon management system opensalon pro and the rollout of individual bonus defining kpis across the organization to create a performance driven culture it is because of these changes that i believe we re in the best position to fully unlock the value of the regis platform as it relates to the current business and our results we re still very much feeling the effect of the pandemic however what began as a decline in consumer demands due to unprecedented disruption of routines has now shifted into a shortage of labor supply at our salons while retail and services are broadly feeling the effects of this labor shortage it is amplified in our industry since salon staffing directly translates to revenue generation our nominal sales continued to improve month over month as q4 2021 comps were four points better than q3 2021 but perhaps even more telling is that salon hours work is down 25 versus pre pandemic levels causing a slower sales recovery than we would have liked to see we re confident that this disruption is temporary in nature as in more than one fourth of our franchise salons that ran flat in labor hours compared to pre covid levels also ran flat in sales indicating that when we re able to capture more labor hours the sales do return we were encouraged last week by the announcement of the end of the additional federal unemployment benefits given the direct correlation between labor hours in revenue in our business from a geography perspective in our largest brand supercuts states such as florida oklahoma alabama and arizona have been able to improve labor hours by 5 to 10 points versus the rest of our fleet resulting in these states which were posting sales 10 points short of pre covid levels in q4 almost touching pre covid comps as we moved into july additionally the states that reopened earlier continued to outperform states such as california and the northeastern states which have been more restricted during the pandemic with residents taking longer to return to their normal routines states that ended unemployment benefits earlier are also performing better supporting our franchisees and ensuring their salons are properly staffed is one of our top priorities and we re actively working with our franchisees to facilitate these efforts we are implementing a new recruiting tool that delivers a fast frictionless mobile solution that streamlines the entire hiring process to assist our franchisees in hiring the stylist they need this will save our franchisees time every week and give candidates a wide club experience that has been shown to increase hiring conversion rates and overall candidate satisfaction we think this has the potential to provide us with competitive differentiation which is key in a world where our people are our product if we can help our franchisees hire the best stylists before their competitors do so it is a major win for our brands i will also remind you that we are the employer of choice for empire education beauty school graduates giving us preferred access to new stylists just entering the labor force we re also encouraged by the industry we re in while it has no doubt that an industry hit harder than others it is also one that remains resilient the disruption other industries have seen to their service and delivery models is one that does not exist in hair care as the need for physical retail space and a professionally trained stylist to provide our services will continue to hold to and the desire for people to use these services to look and feel their best is not going away we re confident that staffing will return to pre pandemic levels but what we cannot do is to predict the exact timing of when that will occur whenever that timing is regis is in the best position to capitalize on growth opportunities given our many transformations over the past year the regis of today is an entirely different company when compared to the beginning of fiscal 21 from our management team to our technology platform and everything in between we have a new team a brand centric focus set to drive sales the right business model for growth and the right sized org structure and tech platform to support and drive that growth the skill set of our management team matches our business model with a hungry driven and aggressive growth mindset they represent the perfect blend of deep franchising expertise in legacy regis operational know how the level of franchise expertise this team has is something regis never had before joined upon experiences driving value for franchisees and other systems this combined with close to 100 years of regis operating history is a differentiator from other franchisors we organize ourselves in a brand centric manner compared to a brand agnostic approach prior great franchise systems align both the franchisor and franchisees around optimizing their respective brands a key to brand building here will be further driving sales and we are in the best position to deploy our marketing dollars than ever before through collaboration with our supercuts franchise council regis will be centrally managing the supercuts ad fund for the first time versus having the majority in efficiently spent by franchisees themselves on local initiatives this past practice left regis with insufficient visibility to the marketing investments being made for supercuts and an inability to measure the effectiveness of incremental return on the investments it also resulted in limited dollars to drive national media marketing and brand initiatives that would have leveraged supercuts a scale we re now able to do all of this making use of our scale to deploy our ad fund dollars more efficiently into impactful initiatives that the entire supercuts fleet can benefit from during the pandemic and continuing till today we have made the conscious decision to pause most of our marketing efforts given the labor shortages the last thing we want is to spend promotional dollars to drive customers into salons that are staffed below full capacity we re currently rebuilding our advertising funds as labor comes back into our salons and we ll be ready to go with tactical marketing and promotions when the timing is right as i mentioned earlier our salons are now essentially fully operated by franchisees the major business transformation that we embarked on four years ago as of today only about 200 company owned salons are left in our portfolio the acceleration and completion of this refranchising process given the current business environment was remarkable and we could have easily been here with hundreds more corporate salons given the continuing uncertainty of the pandemic and nature of the remaining salons the pipeline of remaining venditions is set to get this figure down to under 130 corporate salons by the end of this calendar year making the transition essentially complete our team is now free to focus their efforts on fully supporting our franchisees and shifting to phase two of our refranchising process providing growth opportunities to our most capable franchisees both existing and new it is imperative now to ensure our salons are in the hands of capable well capitalized business partners that can be the best representative of our brands and it is those partners that will enable regis to fill in the geographies that we identify as white space salon growth opportunities in parallel with the refranchising we re working on our salon of the future concept to ensure new builds across our brands not only elevate our customer experience but also provide a strong roi to accelerate unit growth both domestically and internationally we have completed our corporate reorganization and our zero base budgeting work to ensure we have the right structure to support a fully franchised business model we have conducted a robust 6 month assessment of our people and cost structure and these changes are a major component of the plan to bring regis back on to a path of growth and profitability while we do expect net savings it is important to remember that investment is needed in our brands in our technology platform and in other areas of our business in order for regis to grow kersten will discuss our g a in more detail but i want to state that while we believe our go forward structure supports our growth initiatives in the most efficient manner we will always continue to assess our structure as zero base budgeting is a continuous process we also made important progress in our rollout of opensalon pro we now have just under 1 900 salons live on osp with another 200 contracts to install the system in the coming weeks we also entered into a transition services agreement with our former pos supplier to make the transition into osp even more seamless for our franchisees our goal is to have most of our salons running on osp by the end of fiscal 22 and all of them by the end of calendar 22 one of the most important aspects of having our salons on osp is the quality of the data we re able to collect and utilize so we can drive sales and traffic into our salons this data will help us understand behavioral patterns design new promotions and drive individualized marketing initiatives with crm and loyalty stylists around the country have reported improvements in ease of use as well as speed of checking in and checking out of customers while our franchise owners have reported far better visibility into key business metrics thanks to the opensalon go app a functionality that gives owners and their field leaders real time dashboard reporting of their businesses our product engineering team continues to enhance all aspects of osp and we re excited as to the impact this will continue to have on the business and serve as a differentiator for regis salons i also want to express how excited i am to have welcomed mike mansbach into the regis board back in june as former president of mindbody a software as a service firm that supports the fitness and wellness industries mike helped grow the business before playing an instrumental role in the sale of mindbody to vista equity partners mike is a tech industry veteran who brings a depth of expertise in connecting digitally with customers a skill set that i m confident will help enhance the overall customer experience for our regis brands and as we continue to evaluate our strategic options related to opensalon pro mike s experience in building enterprise value product strategy and marketing while creating global scale will help ensure we maximize value to our shareholders while we re still investing in opensalon pro and our top priority is to bring our entire fleet on board before considering potential external customers i am encouraged to see tech companies offering similar products achieve substantial valuations some of which with customer bases much smaller than ours it is a combination of all these achievements that enable us to look ahead and position us well for fiscal 22 our focus is clear we need to continue to drive systemwide sales ensure our franchisee base is as strong as can be by providing our existing franchisees with opportunities to grow and bringing in new franchise partners continue the osp rollout and laid the foundation for growth through a salon of the future framework that provides an investment case for large scale development agreements both domestically and internationally for all the challenges that fiscal 21 brought the regis we are today is a fundamentally different company than the regis of one year ago i m encouraged that regis is best positioned for the future and i m confident that we have the right people in place to execute on our plans thank you so much for your continued interest in regis and i ll now turn the call over to kersten to take you through the numbers kersten kersten zupfer executive vice president and chief financial officer thanks felipe and good morning on a consolidated basis we reported fourth quarter revenue of 99 million versus 60 million in the prior year which was 65 higher as the majority of our salons were closed in the fourth quarter of last year core royalties and fee revenue increased 263 from q4 of 2020 from 7 million to 27 million the increase is due to improved comps and fewer government mandated closures quarter over quarter comps and royalties improved due to improved performance and fewer government mandated closures the only significant shutdowns in q4 were in canada where approximately 300 salons were closed impacting our overall revenue by approximately 5 in the remaining fleet we can see improvements in our nominal sales as we move away from reopening dates and states normalize their environments as we look at some of the states and regions negatively impacting our comp particularly california and the northeast which are returning to normalcy more slowly we are seeing 10 to 20 increases in nominal revenue per store since the beginning of q4 which means they are growing they are just behind the curve overall with the direct correlation between labor hour performance and sales performance that felipe mentioned and 75 of our stores running well below pre covid levels from a labor hour perspective we remain unclear to the exact timing of staffing levels returning to pre covid levels we reported an operating loss of 27 million during the quarter which includes a 5 million noncash inventory reserve charge associated with the change in our merchandising strategy fourth quarter consolidated adjusted ebitda loss of 23 million compared to a 34 million adjusted ebitda loss in the fourth quarter of 2020 as we are lapping the closure of our fleet last year it s worth noting that this quarter s adjusted ebitda includes 13 million of losses related to our company owned salon portfolio that will be dramatically reduced as we exit these salons looking at the segment specific performance and starting with our franchise segment i mentioned fourth quarter royalties and fees increased 19 million versus the same quarter last year primarily due to the government mandated shutdowns last year fourth quarter franchise adjusted ebitda was 11 million an increase of 10 million year over year driven by increased sales and increased salon comps in our company owned salon segment fourth quarter revenue was 25 million an increase of 10 million or 65 versus the prior year company owned salon segment adjusted ebitda increased 9 million year over year to a loss of 13 million versus a loss of 22 million primarily due to the shutdown last year as it relates to corporate overhead fourth quarter adjusted ebitda loss of 21 million increased 8 million year over year compared to adjusted ebitda loss of 14 million in the prior year this increase is driven primarily by the furlough program in effect for the majority of the workforce across the corporate office field support and distribution centers in the fourth quarter of the prior year switching gears to g a as many of you have been asking about what our future state looks like upon the successful execution of our zero based budgeting we expect g a excluding rent to be in the range of 72 million to 80 million annually which not only represents g a for our franchisor structure but also g a for our full technology company that developed supports and maintains opensalon pro to be clear this run rate is expected to be achieved in q4 of fiscal year 22 due to the exiting of the distribution centers and refranchising of company owned salons in the first half of fiscal year 22 achievement of these g a levels is subject to the risk factors disclosed in our fiscal year 2021 10 k filed this morning i want to also state that while our corporate reorganization and zbb projects have rightsized our g a to the identified needs of regis in the short term zbb is a continuous process which we believe will continue to identify savings i also thought it would be helpful to spend a few minutes discussing our transition away from the wholesale product business a few weeks ago we announced that we will be partnering with saloncentric and bsg for the distribution of product to our franchisees saloncentric and bsg will be able to better service our franchisees as we move to a fully franchised model versus purchasing wholesale from regis had we continued to operate as is our wholesale product business would have lost 2 million to 3 million in fiscal year 22 on the flip side had we wanted to prevent this loss given the nature of our cost structure to support a fully franchised business we would have had to raise product pricing to our franchisees considerably which would have been a detriment to their four wall profitability we believe that our new model will bring value to our franchisees preserve our private label business and be ebitda positive while greatly reducing the complexity of our business turning to the balance sheet and liquidity as of june 30 we had 129 million of liquidity including 89 million of available revolver capacity and 19 million of cash our net available liquidity as of june 30 was 54 million which reflects our minimum liquidity covenant requirements and the permitted add back of the shortfall in certain refranchising proceeds in accordance with our amended credit facility looking forward to fiscal year 22 we expect to continue to remain a net user of cash for the fiscal year as we refranchise or close the remainder of our company owned salons and wind down our two distribution centers however as a post pandemic recovery continues coupled with the realization of the savings identified as part of the zbb process we expect to achieve monthly positive cash flow inflection during the latter half of fiscal 22 we believe that our current liquidity levels are sufficient to fund our cash needs during fiscal year 22 in closing progress on key initiatives accompanied with encouraging trends has us feeling very confident as we wrap up fiscal year 21 and move into fiscal year 22 this concludes my prepared remarks i would like to thank you for your continued support and interest in regis and we ll now turn the call back to biz for questions biz mcshane thank you kersten our first question is from steph wissink of jefferies please go ahead steph steph wissink jefferies analyst thank you good morning everyone we have two questions to begin if we could kersten just in relation to your final questions on cash thinking about cash use in the first half it sounds like maybe an inflection in the back half but can you help us think about the puts and takes inventory on the balance sheet i would guess would be a cash contributor as you move away from the products business any other things we should be thinking about that relate to the final kind of downdraft in the old model and the investment in the new model from a cash perspective kersten zupfer executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah great question steph the other two factors is as we roll out of the two distribution centers there s cash uses associated with that line down as well as the remaining refranchising efforts that will occur in the first quarter of this fiscal year so as we move through those then we start to see some moving from being a cash user to the latter half of the year where we ll generate some cash in certain months steph wissink jefferies analyst ok that s helpful and then my second question it s super encouraging to hear about the g a excluding rent being around that 72 to 80 million on a full year basis so i think it s running closer to low 90s run rate exiting q4 can you just help us bridge the roughly 2 million to 4 million a quarter where are the incremental savings expected to be realized and maybe it also relates to the dcs so just trying to bridge the incremental cuts that you are anticipating to realize over the course of the next 12 months kersten zupfer executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah i mean it s going to come in various places within the organization obviously the distribution center is a key component of that and as we ve discussed in previous quarters the zbb process and the zbo process is starting from a white piece of paper so we went through that process and built the work structure to support the business so as part of that there were some eliminations that we made at the end of june that you ll see those savings come through as we move into fiscal steph wissink jefferies analyst great and then my last one if i could pop one more in and it s just related to the products business under the new agreement with saloncentric and bsg can you just give us an illustration of how the dollars would flow through the franchise and then the corporate model so i want to make sure we fully appreciate that i mean you may still have access to some of the product value but you re not directly selling to the franchisees so just walking through an illustration i think would be helpful kersten zupfer executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah so as it relates to how it will flow through the model there is a rebate with the distribution partners that we will recognize as revenue that will come through the p l is that your question steph i want to make sure that i m answering it correctly steph wissink jefferies analyst yeah that s exactly right so just making sure we understand what s happening to the mechanics of the revenue recognition biz mcshane do you have anything else steph wissink jefferies analyst kersten could you just talk a little bit more about that so it s a revenue rebate but then what is the attributed margin to the rebate is there any expense behind the rebate kersten zupfer executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah so i mean as it relates to product sales it will be a rebate that runs through revenue and then what hasn t changed is we ll continue to receive a royalty on the product sales that our franchisees are making in their salons steph wissink jefferies analyst ok so from a margin perspective the royalty of course would be at your historic margin levels the rebate would be at almost pure margin is that the way we should think about it kersten zupfer executive vice president and chief financial officer yes yes steph wissink jefferies analyst ok all right very helpful i ll turn it to the next question asker thank you kersten zupfer executive vice president and chief financial officer thanks steph biz mcshane thank you steph our next question is from laura champine from loop capital please go ahead laura laura champine loop capital analyst hi kersten zupfer executive vice president and chief financial officer hey laura how are you laura champine loop capital analyst how much do you think was kersten zupfer executive vice president and chief financial officer laura we re having a hard time hearing you laura champine loop capital analyst what can you incur i m sorry can you hear me biz mcshane we can hear you now felipe athayde chief executive officer you broke up a few times laura sorry about that would you mind repeating laura champine loop capital analyst ok sorry bad quality of the call here on my end i wanted to talk a little bit about the labor shortage that you re facing and see how much of the problem you think goes away once we cycle through the enhanced unemployment benefits and i also wanted to see what you think you can do to help franchisees increase their hiring of folks who have been independent stylists see if there s much you can do there felipe athayde chief executive officer laura felipe here so look right now the major roadblock to sales recovery has been the labor shortage right but we re very encouraged with some of the facts that i talked about in my prepared remarks so states for example that ended the unemployment benefits sooner have seen a faster sales recovery and also if you look at the top performing one quarter of our salons in terms of labor hours versus last year i mean these guys have been the fastest to recover sales as well so we ve seen a very linear relationship between the recovery of labor hours and the recovery of sales right i mean in this industry of course the availability of stylist correlates directly with our ability to do sales right so that s as we were very very confident that as we our sales return to the workforce that this will directly translate into sales and with respect to the second part of your question which is how we can help franchisees we re about to implement the new recruiting solution to be used by our franchisees which is based on artificial intelligence basically the provider is a leader in this segment there s been a very successful global franchisor who adopted the system and with a lot of success really we want to replicate the success in recruiting on our end as well so we re very excited about that and we think that the effects will be seen shortly after the implementation of this tool laura champine loop capital analyst felipe athayde chief executive officer laura i think we re losing you again if you wouldn t mind repeating you re breaking up again laura champine loop capital analyst ok i ll take the rest of my questions offline thank you felipe athayde chief executive officer thank you laura appreciate it biz mcshane with no further questions we will adjourn thank you very much for joining today duration 29 minutes call participants biz mcshane felipe athayde chief executive officer kersten zupfer executive vice president and chief financial officer steph

officer we will now open the call for questions operator please queue up the first question questions answers operator thank you the question and answer session will begin at this time our first question today is coming from andrew lazar from barclays your line is now live andrew lazar barclays investment bank analyst great thanks so much for the question i guess i m sure there ll be plenty of discussion around inflation and cost and pricing and whatnot so i d like to focus a bit on your prepared remarks on the recovery of the nutrish brand which is lagging expectations you mentioned currently evaluating additional actions to better position the business i guess are you able to unpack that a bit more for us are we talking about further potential portfolio sort of optimization moves or repositioning the brand or its pricing position in the category or really something else entirely i m just trying to get a better handle on sort of why it s lagging and what actions are being contemplated thanks so much mark smucker president and chief executive officer sure andrew thanks for the question it s mark smucker andrew lazar barclays investment bank analyst good morning mark smucker president and chief executive officer good morning let me just make a couple of very brief comments just about the business in general and i will answer the nutrish question i just want to acknowledge first of all that we are very pleased with the results this quarter it s our sixth quarter in a row of meeting or exceeding expectations if you look at in the prepared remarks and you back out some of the noise in terms of divestitures and really look at an apples to apples the total company grew 1 all of our u s businesses grew and on a two year stack we saw that 6 top line growth so the point here is that underlying business fundamentals remain strong demand is still there our investments almost across every part of our business are working our brands are strong i mean just looking at the share growth two thirds of our portfolio are growing a couple of years ago that was like a quarter of our brands were growing so we are very pleased with the progress and the way we ve been able to execute throughout the last particularly the last 18 months in the pandemic and so really one of the only spots where we have not been satisfied is on nutrish dry dog even the pet business itself grew in line with our algorithm if you look on a two year stack it s about a 3 growth and we ve said our algorithm is 3 to 4 so we have been meeting that and seeing growth in dog snacks and cat food etc so really we re isolated to nutrish dry dog we do remain committed to the brand we have continued our portfolio and packaging optimizations we are it s still at the early stages of the big life launch so we clearly believe that there is still potential for the brand specifically though we have not been satisfied with some of our marketing investments and feel that they have not delivered the requisite return and so we are actually pulling back on some of those marketing investments still supporting the master brand and big life but making sure that the dollars we re spending there are truly going to make a difference and we re going to pull back temporarily and reevaluate some of those investments and so that s why we said the full recovery of the nutrish brand will be delayed throughout the remainder of this fiscal year andrew lazar barclays investment bank analyst right thank you for that appreciate it operator thank you our next question is coming from ken goldman from j p morgan your line is now live ken goldman j p morgan analyst hi thanks so much i wanted to just dig in a little bit one of the questions we re getting this morning is not only on the first quarter but on the second quarter the timing of shipments versus what we saw at nielsen or really just takeaway overall beyond nielsen as well first was there any mismatch between those two in the quarter just reported and then does your outlook for the second quarter include any assumption that maybe some of your customers will buy a little bit ahead of some announced price increases thank you tucker marshall chief financial officer ken as it relates to first quarter shipments the first quarter from a big picture perspective came in line with expectations but we did have two areas that were a bit softer than anticipated one due to labor and transportation issues throughout the entire network there were some shipments left on the dock that occurred at the end of july that should pick up into august and secondly due to some specific situations with two e commerce retailers e comm in the quarter was a little bit softer so we would anticipate in the second quarter and beyond shipments to recover and then also a bit of return in the e commerce channel ken goldman j p morgan analyst ok great that s helpful and then just quickly to follow up on something i appreciate you don t buy forward or hedge everything out you may still have some exposure to spot markets each quarter but i m a little surprised why the near term headwind is this much worse right in particular for 2q so is there any way to help us order or size some of the incremental cost challenges right whether it s direct inputs for food stocks or packaging or labor just so we better understand a little bit what s hitting you harder than you initially thought tucker marshall chief financial officer ken as we came into the fiscal year we were anticipating mid single digit cost inflation as a percent of our total cost of goods sold now we re seeing high single digit cost inflation as a percentage of our total cost of goods sold the change from our initial expectation is really driven within our commodity ingredients area transportation and then packaging and when you think of commodity ingredients there have been a few factors that have been driving that one is weather related so that would impact coffee particularly with brazil weather patterns the second was also weather patterns in the west specifically the pacific northwest that impacted fruit so those are two areas of commodities or ingredients where we ve seen inflation come through particularly in the second half of our fiscal year transportation due to the volatility and tightness of supply chain continues to be real not only from a labor standpoint but also from a unit standpoint and just an overall sort of backlog in the system that has persisted throughout the entire pandemic and then on the packaging front packaging continues to have the implications of just ongoing pricing pressures that continue candidly from the weather disruption that occurred in the winter time frame in texas due to the freeze and so as a result of this persistent inflation we continue to manage through very effectively not only through our supply chain and relationships with our suppliers and the great work by our teams but we ve got to acknowledge this inflation in our p l and we need to recover it and we are going to recover it through additional pricing actions this fiscal year that we anticipate in the second and third quarters in order to recover that so we do believe this is a timing impact and as a result of the timing impact it should have pressure on the margin that we noted as well but i do want to acknowledge two things we remain confident in the way we ve executed throughout the entire pandemic and we will going forward and i also want to acknowledge that this is not a symptom specific to smucker candidly this is a symptom specific to the entire economy ken goldman j p morgan analyst understood thank you very much operator thank you our next question is coming from chris growe from stifel your line is now live chris growe stifel financial corp analyst hi good morning mark smucker president and chief executive officer good morning chris growe stifel financial corp analyst i just had a quick question to follow up on some of the supply chain issues and kind of the labor related issues i guess i want to understand the degree to which those are an incremental factor in the lower gross margin outlook in relation to the inflation is there one that s more than the other just how to frame those two in relation to the gross margin softness you re going to see relative to your previous guidance tucker marshall chief financial officer chris definitely there are two factors that are driving the inflationary environment for us one is just the underlying input commodity and ingredient the second is transportation as you have noted and that has been a persistent headwind not only last fiscal year but it continues to be one this fiscal year and again it is predominantly driven by the availability of labor and it s also driven to some extent by the capacity of the system and so that s what we continue to manage through we have been very successful in managing not only our long term contracts but also our spot rate contracts as well we continue to do our best but as you bring material in as you produce and you ship material out the entire network right now is impacted from a transportation standpoint and it is material chris growe stifel financial corp analyst and so tucker that transportation factor is that half the gross margin decline is it that big or ingredient is a bigger factor i m just trying to get a relative size on how big each one could be tucker marshall chief financial officer no the commodity and ingredient would be the leading factor chris growe stifel financial corp analyst ok tucker marshall chief financial officer a very close secondary factor would be transportation and packaging if you re thinking in terms of order of magnitude chris growe stifel financial corp analyst ok and then just a follow on to that is this something that you can price to and i mean from a high level not looking at next quarter but just in general do you view these costs as transitory or can you is there another round of pricing or are you adjusting your pricing increases to account for this incremental cost you re bearing mark smucker president and chief executive officer sure chris this is mark as we think about cost and pricing recovery we really try to take a holistic view and make sure that as we ve said before are working with our retail customers in a prudent and fair way to recover essentially the aggregate costs and so when we look at costs and how they impact the finished product we really look at that in totality and as we go forward with our retail partners just making sure that we have an open and transparent dialogue of what needs to happen so that we can indeed recover those costs through our entire tool kit whether that s list price net revenue optimization or what have you chris growe stifel financial corp analyst ok thanks a lot mark smucker president and chief executive officer thank you operator thank you our next question is coming from bryan spillane from bank of america your line is now live bryan spillane bank of america merrill lynch analyst good morning everyone mark smucker president and chief executive officer morning bryan spillane bank of america merrill lynch analyst so i guess just a coffee or a question more specific to coffee and actually two one is just it sounds like or maybe i want to clarify that even coffee costs in the quarter were running higher and i guess the fact that it s going to hit you seemingly reasonably soon does it suggest that just maybe your hedges were at the end or you weren t hedged out as long as you normally were just trying to understand the dynamic of green coffee costs have clearly moved but it seems to be impacting you pretty quickly and so just if you can kind of walk us through i guess how you were positioned or hedged for higher coffee costs tucker marshall chief financial officer bryan good morning as it relates to our cost position for the year as we said coming into our fiscal year we knew that we would have year over year cost inflation which was inclusive of our coffee portfolio as well and we knew that that inflation was going to begin to hit us on a 12 month basis and that we were taking initial pricing actions in july to begin to recover that initial wave of inflation and so the margin in coffee for the quarter but yet the margin for the entire business for the quarter does reflect that inflation ahead of the pricing recovery as you think about what s happened since our initial guidance we began to have weather impacts in brazil that began to affect the underlying commodity and as a result of that we ve been managing through how we think about delivering the balance of the year while we d like to give you the specifics on our hedging position we don t disclose that but what we can share is is that coffee costs have gone up and that we will take additional pricing actions and measures to ensure that we recover the inflationary impact that we re seeing to the p l bryan spillane bank of america merrill lynch analyst ok and then i guess to the extent that the weather has been part of the issue is there also a i guess a question or pressure around just availability of green coffees are you concerned at all about just supply of raw material mark smucker president and chief executive officer yeah bryan it s mark generally speaking the frost in brazil which is what tucker was referring to over a longer period over a 12 month period is going to have some impact on the amount of coffee that s available however as one of the we are the largest roaster in the u s and one of the larger roasters in the world we still would be able to get our needs met but as tucker referenced it is going to be at higher prices which we will continue to manage through our robust set of hedging tools so we think we can manage through it but just acknowledge that both just the brazilian crop as well as some of the ongoing transportation issues are contributing to those costs bryan spillane bank of america merrill lynch analyst ok and if i could just sneak one last one and just same topic on coffee just maybe if you can give us mark some perspective on we ve had other periods of time in coffee where there s been inflation and the industry has had to price it through and there s been some elasticity can you just maybe give us some context in terms of this current situation with costs rising and having to price it through and kind of where the consumer is do you expect like this to be an abnormal period in terms of prices going up and elasticity or is this a pretty normal sort of course of action for again a category that has that pass through element mark smucker president and chief executive officer sure i guess the headline there would be that as we have managed through this initial phase of pricing which is now in effect the elasticities that we have modeled have generally performed as expected we can t predict what green coffee is going to do over the long term in terms of costs but we are certainly not at historical highs and so we would anticipate that as we think about further pricing actions and elasticity that we should be able to manage through that and even though no elasticity model is ever perfect we do have confidence that we ll be able to manage through that in a realistic fashion bryan spillane bank of america merrill lynch analyst all right thank you for the color mark smucker president and chief executive officer thank you operator thank you our next question today is coming from alexia howard from bernstein your line is now live alexia howard sanford c bernstein analyst good morning everyone mark smucker president and chief executive officer good morning tucker marshall chief financial officer morning alexia howard sanford c bernstein analyst so can we ask about the what the key drivers of uncertainty are what the biggest risks are i guess over the next few quarters it seems as though the level of uncertainty around particularly around supply chain disruption and perhaps the fragility of the supply chain has increased that feels somewhat different from previous commodity cycles where it was literally just having to handle increased cost pressures and pricing through other companies are also saying it s actually physically quite hard at the moment to get products from whether it s ingredients from overseas or whether it s shipping domestically in the u s because of the trucking situation i m just wondering what you see as the biggest sort of pain points and risks that you re looking at over the next few quarters what the biggest concerns are at the moment thank you and i ll pass it on mark smucker president and chief executive officer alexia it s mark as we ve discussed thus far we ve talked a lot about inflation and cost pressures and that is of course the primary driver and then the second one is supply chain as you noted i mean if we really want to simplify it s primarily those two factors there s a lot of unknowns of course about the pandemic and what course that may take so we re watching that extremely carefully but as to the supply chain specifically we do believe that the reason that we have had success is because of our ability to execute and manage the supply chain there is no question that it is tight and there are a variety of issues tightness spanning from all the way upstream to all the way to the shelf at the retailer but i would submit that our team and our people have done such a good job of managing every single step of the way engaging with suppliers and customers all the way through to the retail shelf that has been key to our success and so much so that it has allowed us to actually gain distribution at shelf because we generally have been able to deliver to our customers we ve gained some space in recent shelf set resets because of our ability to execute and so if you think about that factor coupled with our new commercial model which is truly focused on the retail shelf and delivering i think that really has been critical to how we ve been able to deliver results thus far and we would anticipate continuing those trends alexia howard sanford c bernstein analyst and as a follow up can i ask about the magnitude of pricing that you re expecting across the portfolio i mean obviously you ve got pricing actions that have just gone into place how much pricing do you anticipate being able to realize over the next few quarters or for the remainder of the fiscal year thank you and i ll pass it on tucker marshall chief financial officer alexia i think the way that we ve articulated this consistently is that we re experiencing double digit commodity inflation that is resulting in high single digit cost of products goods sold inflation which is then resulting in kind of low to mid single digit pricing at the total company level we haven t necessarily disclosed by each given commodity or business the pricing amounts or actions but that sort of formula should be able to give you a sense and then i would also share that on an underlying organic basis we are anticipating at the new guidance range to be up at about 2 points and as a result of that you re going to see some top line pricing being offset by some underlying volume as well and so that should help you get a revised organic of about 2 5 alexia howard sanford c bernstein analyst great thank you very much i ll pass it on operator thank you our next question today is coming from rob dickerson from jefferies your line is now live rob dickerson jefferies analyst great thank you so much my first question is just a quick follow up to alexia s question on the kind of cadence for the year and then just a question on the pricing so tucker your last answer was helpful in terms of kind of how to think about that magnitude that we re seeing but kind of more specifically i m just curious can the coffee business actually grow revenue this year right and we always sometimes let s say see the top line can decline but gross profit still growing in this case just given this near term pressure on cost i m curious could we be looking at a retail division that s flattish for the year maybe down a little bit because i think that would help us also be able to rightsize the total company as we get through the year tucker marshall chief financial officer rob good morning as it relates to coffee and its growth trajectory i think what we would say is is that we re probably anticipating kind of flat to up based on what we re seeing today but that would be inclusive of additional pricing actions i think it s difficult for us at this point to continue to break down each of the business units i think we ve talked about kind of an underlying organic for total company being up 2 5 points on the pricing front just from a cadence standpoint we took pricing in july it s reflective we ve discussed that we ve also acknowledged that the additional pricing actions would likely come through in q2 and q3 so that also should give you a sense of timing as well rob dickerson jefferies analyst ok mark smucker president and chief executive officer rob i would just it s mark i would just add one thing on coffee which is you ll recall that our strategy has been to ensure number one that we re participating in all the segments of the category but also continue to shift the portfolio to the growing segments so in that case that being dunkin café bustelo and k cups are all all three of those are outpacing the segment or the category we are outpacing the category excuse me and even the folgers brand has continued to gain share and its growth particularly in k cups has been strong as well so we feel like as the portfolio shifts we are delivering against our strategy rob dickerson jefferies analyst ok fair enough and the follow up kind of flows to what you were just discussing mark in the prepared remarks again referencing the coffee business there s a line that says came in a little bit lower than expectations right just a little lighter but then there s also the commentary around this increased distribution coming from folgers so i m just trying to kind of rightsize that like why do you think maybe things were a little bit softer than you thought but then also at the same time what s really driving that increased distribution on folgers brand that s it mark smucker president and chief executive officer yeah if you look at coffee on a two year basis in that two year stack we are seeing 8 so that s obviously very strong and the distribution gains that were referenced i think in the prepared remarks were relative to primarily recent some shelf resets as well as some new pickup at some key customers so those we haven t seen those come through our p l yet but that will clearly be a help as we move forward tucker marshall chief financial officer rob and i will also just rob i would also remind you that a year ago we were experiencing the continued momentum of the early stages of the pandemic into our first quarter and we had the inventory replenishment in the first quarter so there is a big what we refer to as a covid lap and particularly for your consumer and coffee businesses rob dickerson jefferies analyst yeah i mean bottom line it seems like you can get pricing in coffee that s obviously coming through again once you ve lapped the inventory build in q1 and you get some incremental distribution it doesn t seem like we re thinking of drastic elasticity as we get through the year is that fair i ll leave it at that tucker marshall chief financial officer the direction that you re sharing seems reasonable rob dickerson jefferies analyst thank you operator thank you our next question today is coming from jason english from goldman sachs your line is now live jason english goldman sachs analyst hey folks thanks for slotting me in two quick questions i know the magnitude of inflation pressure that you re facing in the industry largest facing continues to escalate and it s certainly a lot larger than any of us anticipated a couple of quarters ago but we ve been talking about resumed inflation for about nine months now yet you ve got almost no price not almost you have no price rolling through your p l yet including areas like pet where you re actually lapping deflation in the prior year so what s been the impediment in getting price in the system so far mark smucker president and chief executive officer there hasn t been any impediment jason most of the pricing was effective in july broadly and it s now on shelf so you re going to see that initial wave coming through in the second quarter and as we work through some of the additional pricing across our business as tucker mentioned earlier it will be effective likely in the end of the second quarter the beginning of the third quarter so yes we are confident that we will be able to work through that and that will be reflected and i m sorry the first part of your question i could you repeat jason english goldman sachs analyst you answered it we re good we re good so let me actually flip to my second question then it sounds like tucker just sort of unpacking some of the comments you ve made already pricing somewhere plus minus 4 implying volumes somewhere minus 1 5 points or so that looks like a lower elasticity function than you ve historically had which i compare it to your trade spend and last year in your 10 k you disclosed it s now 39 of sales which is up what 800 basis points from five years ago so you now seem to be a lot more reliant on promotions to drive volume than you used to be you look to be the only companies who actually didn t benefit from lower trade rates during covid and in the context of that sort of promotional dependence shouldn t we expect elasticity to be higher than it historically has what gives you confidence in underwriting sort of a lower elasticity function than history tucker marshall chief financial officer jason i would say that on a year over year basis pricing is going to contribute sort of up to mid single digit growth and it s going to be offset by sort of low single digit growth of volume mix other and what you have to be careful about in the volume mix other is one it s underlying business momentum for the smucker s uncrustables brand continued advancement of café bustelo and dunkin and advancement of our pet snacks portfolio along with a return in the away from home business but then it is offset by a decrease in at home consumption it is also offset by supply chain disruption which we are experiencing through our pet food portfolio particularly in wet pet and it s also offset by any additional trader promotion like you ve talked about but that trader promotion isn t the biggest bucket of what s causing sort of that change and then lastly is i would just acknowledge that in our volume mix bucket we also have factored in price elasticities for our pricing actions across the portfolio jason english goldman sachs analyst ok got it so there s some nice mix benefits in there to contemplate it s not you re not expecting volumes to only be down 1 5 or so i think that s the answer correct tucker marshall chief financial officer correct there s a big bucket in there to your point where there s more than one variable jason english goldman sachs analyst ok all right thanks i ll pass it on operator thanks our next question today is coming from pamela kaufman from morgan stanley your line is now live pamela kaufman morgan stanley analyst hi good morning tucker marshall chief financial officer morning pamela kaufman morgan stanley analyst can you elaborate on the factors that contributed to the sizable margin pressure in the pet segment this quarter this was the lowest operating margin that you ve reported in the segment to date and how are you thinking about your outlook for segment profitability over the course of the year tucker marshall chief financial officer pam as it relates to the profitability margin for the pet food segment in the first quarter you are correct it did experience a decline quarter over quarter i think you have to acknowledge the cost inflationary pressures in that business driven by the underlying commodities such as animal fats and proteins along with the impact of transportation and again that was ahead of any pricing benefit due to pricing actions that were taken in july so we would anticipate that the profitability in pet food come back in the back half of the year as pricing begins to reflect a half a year benefit against sort of a partial year first half and then it will be down year over year due to the timing of price recovery against cost inflation pamela kaufman morgan stanley analyst got it thanks and then i guess related to that how are you thinking about your ability to take pricing in pet at a time when the business is underperforming your expectations mark smucker president and chief executive officer pam we have been able to take pricing and pass that through and as we observe the market we have seen our peers and competitors do similarly and so we have confidence that we will continue to do that and just reminding that pet snacks is really a key part of our strategy and we do lead there so we are clearly not only in pet snacks but in other portions of our business have been able to do so so again just to point the headline being that our pet business is performing to expectations with the exception of nutrish and so we have delivered against our algorithm on pet pamela kaufman morgan stanley analyst thank you operator thank you our next question today is coming from ryan bell from consumer edge research your line is now live ryan bell consumer edge research analyst hey everyone morning i was just wondering how you re thinking about some of the structural changes to your demand not particularly around breakfast and lunch and pet snacks given some of the incremental at home activity that we ve seen and how is this reflected in your guidance mark smucker president and chief executive officer ryan thanks for the question it s mark smucker again as i started at the beginning of the q a the demand has generally remained strong i mean using coffee as an example 75 of cups consumed are still consumed at home and a lot more brewers in place clearly there are more pets out there and so pet snacks will continue to do will continue to meet our expectations because consumers will continue to treat their pets and so that will be another one and then of course as i ve discussed in the past even post pandemic however we define that one thing is certain which is career professionals are going to continue to work from home more than they did pre pandemic and that will benefit us because it speaks specifically to breakfast and lunch occasions so particularly in our spreads peanut butter and jelly as well as our uncrustables business we would expect that to be a positive factor on our businesses ryan bell consumer edge research analyst thanks is there any sense for the magnitude of some of those impacts that you re modeling into your guidance or is that a little bit less so for fiscal 2022 and it s more of a longer term question tucker marshall chief financial officer ryan we are anticipating continued momentum in at home consumption and our coffee portfolio as mark acknowledged and our consumer portfolio also driven by the uncrustables brand along with the pet dynamics and so as we continue to see how the pandemic plays out as we continue to ensure the investment and reinvestment in our brands for the long term health of our business and therefore for the benefit of at home consumption and the stickiness of households that we ve gained we hope to continue that momentum in this fiscal year and beyond today is probably not the time to quantify what we think that is but the momentum that we ve generated continues to perform ryan bell consumer edge research analyst thanks that s helpful and then last question for me where do you stand having a normalized sku assortment given some of the supply chain issues that have been experienced tucker marshall chief financial officer ryan what we continue to focus on are two things one is advancement of our strategy and a component of advancing the strategy is our portfolio reshape and a component of the portfolio reshape is making sure that we have the right skus in order to advance the given brand or category and that we would eliminate any unperforming or nonperforming skus and so that remains consistent in any financial plan and then i would say beyond that we do continue to look at our inventory levels from a working capital standpoint so that we can continue to ensure that we have the right level of raw material and finished goods in support of our supply chain but also in support of our customers and consumers and so those are two areas where we continue to focus on in the near term but right now we feel very comfortable with the assortment that we have behind the business ryan bell consumer edge research analyst great thank you operator thank you i will now turn the floor back over to management to conclude mark smucker president and chief executive officer thank you for your time and interest in our call this morning we do remain confident in our strategy and the delivery of our business the underlying fundamentals and the fact that we are still able to continue to invest in our business to ensure that we deliver against our strategy so we hope that many of you will be able to join us virtually for our presentation at the barclays global consumer staples conference in a couple of weeks and hope everyone has a great day and a good weekend operator duration 41 minutes call
