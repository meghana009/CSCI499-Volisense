capital allocation and strong returns we re well positioned for the future now i ll turn the call over to kevin to review the financial results kevin j mitchell executive vice president finance and chief financial officer thank you mark hello everyone starting with an overview on slide four we summarize our third quarter results we reported earnings of 402 million special items during the quarter amounted to an after tax loss of 1 billion which was largely comprised of an impairment of the alliance refinery excluding special items we had adjusted earnings of 1 4 billion or 3 18 per share we generated operating cash flow of 2 2 billion including a working capital benefit of 776 million and cash distributions from equity affiliates of 905 million capital spending for the quarter was 552 million 311 million was for growth projects including a 150 million investment in novonix we paid 394 million in dividends moving to slide five this slide shows the change in adjusted results from the second quarter to the third quarter an increase of 1 1 billion with a substantial improvement in refining and continued strong contributions from midstream chemicals and marketing and specialties our adjusted effective income tax rate was 16 slide six shows our midstream results third quarter adjusted pre tax income was 642 million an increase of 326 million from the previous quarter transportation contributed adjusted pre tax income of 254 million up 30 million from the prior quarter the increase was driven by higher equity earnings from the bakken and gray oak pipelines ngl and other adjusted pre tax income was 357 million compared with 83 million in the second quarter the increase was primarily due to a 224 million unrealized investment gain related to novonix as well as inventory impacts in september we acquired a 16 interest in novonix our investment will be mark to market at the end of each reporting period the sweeny fractionation complex averaged a record 383 000 barrels per day and the freeport lpg export facility loaded 41 cargoes in the third quarter dcp midstream adjusted pre tax income of 31 million was up 22 million from the previous quarter mainly due to improved margins and hedging impacts turning to chemicals on slide seven we delivered another strong quarter in chemicals with adjusted pre tax income of 634 million down 23 million from the second quarter olefins polyolefins had record adjusted pre tax income of 613 million the 20 million increase from the previous quarter was primarily due to higher polyethylene sales volumes driven by continued strong demand partially offset by higher utility costs global o p utilization was 102 for the quarter adjusted pre tax income for sa s decreased 45 million compared to the second quarter driven by lower margins which began to normalize following tight market conditions during the third quarter we received 632 million in cash distributions from cpchem turning to refining on slide eight refining third quarter adjusted pre tax income was 184 million an improvement of 890 million from the second quarter driven by higher realized margins across all regions realized margins for the quarter increased by 119 to 8 57 per barrel primarily due to higher market crack spreads lower rin costs and improved product differentials pre tax turnaround costs were 81 million down from 118 million in the prior quarter crude utilization was 86 compared with 88 in the second quarter lower utilization reflects downtime at the alliance refinery which was safely shut down on august 28 in advance of hurricane ida the third quarter clean product yield was 84 up 2 from last quarter supported by improved fcc operations slide nine covers market capture the 3 2 1 market crack for the third quarter was 19 44 per barrel compared to 17 76 per barrel in the second quarter realized margin was 8 57 per barrel and resulted in an overall market capture of 44 market capture in the previous quarter was 22 market capture was impacted by the configuration of our refineries our refineries are more heavily weighted toward distillate production than the market indicator during the quarter the distillate crack increased 1 55 per barrel and the gasoline crack improved 1 92 per barrel losses from secondary products of 1 98 per barrel improved 0 40 per barrel from the previous quarter as ngl prices strengthened our feedstock advantage of 0 01 per barrel declined by 0 26 per barrel from the prior quarter the other category reduced realized margins by 5 01 per barrel this category includes rins freight costs clean product realizations and inventory impacts moving to marketing and specialties on slide 10 adjusted third quarter pre tax income was 547 million compared with 479 million in the prior quarter our marketing business realized continued strong margins and saw increasing demand for products marketing other increased 62 million from the prior quarter this was primarily due to higher international margins and volumes driven by the easing of covid 19 restrictions refined product exports in the third quarter were 209 000 barrels per day specialties generated third quarter adjusted pre tax income of 93 million up from 87 million in the prior quarter largely due to improved oil margins on slide 11 the corporate and other segment had adjusted pre tax costs of 230 million an improvement of 40 million from the prior quarter this was primarily due to lower costs related to the timing of environmental and employee related expenses partially offset by higher net interest expense slide 12 shows the change in cash for the quarter we started the quarter with a 2 2 billion cash balance cash from operations was 2 2 billion excluding a working capital benefit of 776 million our cash from operations was 1 4 billion which covered 552 million of capital spend 394 million for the dividend and 500 million of early debt repayment our ending cash balance was 2 9 billion this concludes my review of the financial and operating results next i ll cover a few outlook items in chemicals we expect the fourth quarter global o p utilization rate to be in the mid 90s in refining we expect the fourth quarter worldwide crude utilization rate to be in the low 80s we expect the alliance refinery to remain shut down for the full quarter we expect fourth quarter pre tax turnaround expenses to be between 110 million and 140 million we anticipate fourth quarter corporate and other costs to come in between 240 million and 250 million pre tax now we will open the line for questions questions and answers operator thank you your first question will come from roger read with wells fargo please go ahead with your question roger read wells fargo analyst good morning greg c garland chairman and chief executive officer morning roger kevin j mitchell executive vice president finance and chief financial officer good morning roger read wells fargo analyst i guess let s take the first one just as the decision to buy in psxp i mean i don t think it should be a huge shock but i think one of the questions we ve gotten is why now so maybe kind of help us on that and then i m just curious at least at a high level how it might change how the company reports going forward greg c garland chairman and chief executive officer okay well i ll take a stab at that and then kevin and mark and tim can help but first of all i think probably we ought to acknowledge that psxp played a significant role in growing our midstream business if you look back kind of pre psxp so pre 2013 our midstream business generated about 500 million of ebitda and today it s 2 1 billion and more than half of that is at the mlp so it s we did a nice job in helping us build and grow a substantial the midstream business one thing to look at today is that the market just doesn t value kind of the drop down growth fueled mlps at this point in time consider trading in a 9 yield we see institutional ownership drop from the 90s into the low 70s and then from our perspective cost of capital is relative high versus psx and so it doesn t really provide an attractive vehicle to ponder growth midstream investments and then i will also say it is the very beginning we felt like mlp provided a clear line of sight to valuation of our midstream business from some of the spaces and i m not certain that really applies today so you think about these are high quality midstream assets we know them really well we re able to acquire them for essentially a 9 ish multiple and trade it up into a 10 times multiple which should be from a sum of the parts basis and then i think as we think about the future of midstream and potential consolidation in midstream i think rolling up the psxp gives us more degrees of freedom to create value with those assets for a long time a lot of the strength in was the mlp was the diversity of the assets you think about crude oil pipelines and terminals and product pipelines and ngl assets and we think that by bifurcating those being able to take those apart in discrete assets that we can create more value with those as we move into the future i don t know kevin or mark if you want to add on to that you re certainly welcome to do that kevin j mitchell executive vice president finance and chief financial officer no i think you ve covered it all greg roger the follow up around reporting on a go forward basis as you know as a fully consolidated entity what you see today in our midstream results reflects all of the mlp anyway so that s fully reflected in our midstream segment results but we have to cut back down below in non controlling interest for the third party public ownership and so once this transaction is closed you will eliminate that non controlling interest deduct from our bottom line results so that s really how it s going to impact the reporting roger read wells fargo analyst okay thanks for that and then i think my next question is for bob if he s on i ve been bugging jeff about what s going on with the renewable diesel conversion in rodeo and some of the i don t know if i d call it pushback but let s say some of the regulatory issues there and so i was hoping we could get a little clarity on some of the things we ve seen in the press in terms of the size of the project maybe being scaled back or whether or not that s an accurate depiction mark lashier president and chief operating officer okay yes thanks for that question roger i think so the critical path on the whole project right is a land use permit in costa county and that s the in california you get the opportunity to apply for lots of permits to build something but this is the big one and the most difficult path through so we ve been working it since we announced the project and i would say overall it s going really well the environmental impact statement that s part of obtaining that land use permit was released for public comment about the middle of october so that s a 60 day comment period so that s when you saw in there that they identified an opportunity to reduce the environmental impact of the project is to make the project smaller we actually took that as a good sign because by law the planning commission staff has to identify lower impact alternatives to the project and the fact that the only thing that was put in there was well you could just make it smaller to reduce the environmental impact all right reflected to us that they agree with us we have taken kind of every environmental step around reduction of emissions from the plant shutting down of the carbon plant everything we can do to reduce the emissions and the greenhouse gas footprint of the future project and that s really all that s left we take that as by no means that they are advocating or that anyone will advocate for a smaller project being built there this is the project that makes sense it s the one that uses the equipment that s on the ground and is very cost efficient to go and convert so we re in the middle of that public comment period at some point the county will start releasing the comments to us and we ll respond to those and the period will close in kind of mid december it will take planning staff probably part of the first quarter to work its way through those and we ll be responsive to those and we still anticipate getting this thing permitted sometime probably late 1q and then that freezes up to go start construction roger read wells fargo analyst very clear and i m glad you did that for us because i don t speak governmentese but good to know that it s still in the right direction thank you mark lashier president and chief operating officer you bet operator the next question will come from neil mehta with goldman sachs please go ahead neil mehta goldman sachs analyst good morning team greg i guess the first question is on 2022 capital spending typically we get that update here over the next couple of weeks but you ve been in relative maintenance spend mode outside of renewables just how should we think about the cadence of 2022 capex is it is the focus still on deleveraging the business and therefore we should assume capex close to sustaining levels or are you thinking about toggling some growth into the business greg c garland chairman and chief executive officer yes well we ve come to a big period of build in midstream i d say we ve finished up cdg frac four will finish up essentially this year going into next year so there s no big spend in front of us in midstream obviously we have the rodeo renewed project and we re anxious to get started on that next year but i think that all fits within the guidance we ve kind of consistently given here over the last couple of quarters of 2 billion or less for 2022 we actually go to our board for approval of the capital budget in december time frame but that s in round numbers that s kind of the numbers that we re looking at for 2022 i think that as certainly cash generation is improving as you can see the results from this quarter i think we re probably more optimistic today that we re moving toward more of a mid cycle earnings profile in our refining business our marketing and specialties has been performing really really strong this whole year since has been really strong this year midstream has been really strong this year so as we get refining back to something approaching more mid cycle that creates more optionality around the cash and what we do with the cash but clearly we re on a glide slope to pay down debt we want to get back to that 12 billion pre pandemic level and as we ve mentioned in the opening comments we ve paid 1 billion down so far this year of that so we re on a glide slope to do that but i think the real model post for us as we start thinking about capital allocation that first dollar is always going to go to our dividend or sustaining capital next 1 goes to dividend and then we think about debt reduction and then hopefully we ll get to a point where we start working share repurchases back in so kevin if you want to add anything to that kevin j mitchell executive vice president finance and chief financial officer no i think you covered it all i would say on debt reduction we are anticipating doing another reduction between now and the end of the year probably in the order of another 0 5 billion that we ll get in before the end of the year neil mehta goldman sachs analyst great thanks greg and kevin the follow up is just on the refining environment strong set of refining results this quarter can you just talk about how you re seeing the momentum going into q4 we ve seen distillate start to perform a little bit wcs now could that translate into numbers and then if you could take a moment to talk about differentials one of the things that has surprised i think market participants is how tight the spread between brent and wti is which matters for mid con refining do you think this is structural or do you think this widens out as us production comes back greg c garland chairman and chief executive officer neil i ll take a stab at that so we are optimistic going forward and the market is setting up well setting up for our kit as well too as you know we re distillate heavy versus gasoline and in the us distillate is over gasoline in every market now but chicago and we think that will continue through the winter you ve seen the wcs dips come off a few reasons why with some refining problems in the mid con barrels got wcs barrels got to the gulf coast weakened the dip and the canadian dips followed and also there were some pipeline issues just this past week in canada which also helped weakened the dip we think that dip will strengthen a bit going forward but we re happy where it is now in terms of brent tis the brent tis needs to stay relatively tight as you ve seen kevin j mitchell executive vice president finance and chief financial officer cushing inventories are at 27 million barrels currently we re getting close to operational mains when that happens we need to keep crude in the united states and the best way to do that is to tighten the wti brent differential so we think it will stay in the 2 to 3 range going forward so we think by and large the market is setting up for a good q4 and certainly a good 2022 greg c garland chairman and chief executive officer i think i would add that as opec puts more barrels into the market those are going to be medium and heavy sour barrels and should result in a wider heavy sour discount which our kit is disproportionately benefits from neil mehta goldman sachs analyst thank you operator the next question is from theresa chen with barclays please go ahead theresa chen barclays analyst hi thank you for taking my questions first just on the psxp transaction itself just out of curiosity will psxp electing to take a step up in psxp s tax basis and do you have an expectation of what that step up will be and just more generally speaking what will be the net tax effect for psx once taking into account the fact that all of your midstream earnings will be subject to tax post mlp rolling kevin j mitchell executive vice president finance and chief financial officer yes theresa it s kevin so psx will be taking a step up in basis for tax purposes which will result in additional tax depreciation we actually get the benefit from bonus depreciation on that also and so the net cash effect will be about 300 million in 2022 of think of it as reduced cash taxes paid and then about another 100 million the following year so in aggregate it s about a 400 million cash benefit to phillips 66 from an ongoing basis the primary impact from a tax standpoint excluding the impact of the step up in basis is going to be the tax that we will recognize on that what today is shown as non controlling interest that becomes those become our earnings they re taxable to us and so there will be tax on that on those earnings that we get from the formerly the units formerly owned by the public theresa chen barclays analyst thank you for that clear and detailed answer maybe if you could talk about your near term outlook for your european assets both on the marketing as well as the refining front clearly demand continues to rebound as mobility restrictions ease benefiting both innings but energy costs are sky high and you re seeing fuel switching reports refiners cutting bonds in general or at hydrocrackers specifically how do you see this situation evolving and how does it impact not only your european assets but also as the read through to pack one in the us and the cost advantage for us gulf coast assets that placed products on the water for export greg c garland chairman and chief executive officer i ll go ahead and start on the marketing assets theresa and then bob can jump in on the refining assets in terms of marketing we continue to build retail in europe we ve had if you listen to kevin s comments that was part of the reason why marketing had its second best quarter ever as people come back in overseas we re seeing austria at 2019 levels of demand switzerland 2019 level of demand uk as well germany is still off about 5 but it s coming back as well so the business has been really good we continue to reimage and update our stores over there that s giving us about a 2 increase in demand as well and then we re looking for some emerging energy opportunities we ve been building hydrogen stores in switzerland and we re looking for some more opportunities to put in electric pumps and some other things over there that you ll be hearing about hopefully in the near future robert a herman executive vice president refining yes and on the refining side you have to think about our humber refinery it s actually the most efficient refinery we have in the fleet and then you add to that the fact that it s got a pretty large cat cracker and then we got three cokers there and all of those are fuel gas generating units and so at the end of the day the humber refinery does not buy a lot of natural gas to run the refinery we see additional costs come through in power purchases and steam that we we re the host for from that s operated by a third party next door so there is a cost impact when i think about the overall refining complex in europe right margins have to rise to keep the lowest or the highest cost producer online and so everybody that floats all boats and humber will be i think the recipient of that and we ve seen that right with moderating cracks over at humber so it s a headwind but it s not a large headwind by any means for humber greg c garland chairman and chief executive officer i think as we look at the impact on demand it s the high natural gas prices especially in europe asia are an incremental 0 5 million barrel a day of demand to perhaps as much as 1 million barrels a day of incremental demand globally so a nice increase on the product side as well theresa chen barclays analyst thank you operator the next question is from phil gresh with jpmorgan please go ahead phil gresh jpmorgan analyst hi good afternoon just looking at the quarter itself obviously the earnings results are strong the cash flow before working capital maybe is a little less than i would have expected relative to the strength of the earnings and there s some deferred tax and other things in there so kevin is there anything kind of unique in the quarter around that that drove that kevin j mitchell executive vice president finance and chief financial officer yes phil there is there s actually an offset that between working capital accounts receivable and that deferred tax so there s a reclassification on tax receivables out of short term and into deferred and so in effect we inflated the working capital benefit and at the expense of reducing the pre working capital cash flow and that s in the order of 0 5 billion and so on a you can kind of do the math on what that really looks like because in my mind i think about the working the real working capital benefit being inventory of about 300 million and then the rest is offset within the cash flow statement phil gresh jpmorgan analyst got it that s helpful and just one question on refining if i look at the central corridor results much improved sequentially and when you look at the bridges that you provide the other part of the bridge was an area of huge improvement sequentially i was just wondering if you could delve into that piece of it a little bit more specifically for central quarters so i can understand the sustainability of the 3q results there kevin j mitchell executive vice president finance and chief financial officer yes so i think one of the real issues 2q to 3q in the central corridor was freeze effects and turnaround effects so we had ponca down for about three weeks because of the freeze that was a significant hit to us last quarter we had planned fcc outage at wood river which was another impairment to that so a lot of that has been kind of when you start doing the math when you don t run a lot of barrels last quarter it tends to kind of inflate to some extent on the other there s a rent effect obviously in the other also all combined so kind of a lot of additive things hit us all at once in the second quarter in the mid con that just aren t there now and i would classify our third quarter in mid con as we ran well and we ran normal greg c garland chairman and chief executive officer and i would say also the market really set up for us in the third quarter we had an early harvest season it started early september which is atypical no weather delays some of our competitors had issues during the third quarter that helped us out we had low distillate inventories as well and that favors our kit and we talked about the wcs steps which were also wider so all those things helped us in the mid continent in q3 phil gresh jpmorgan analyst very helpful thank you operator the next question is from doug leggate with bank of america please go ahead doug leggate bank of america analyst hi good morning everybody guys i wonder if i could start with refining and the alliance write down i m looking specifically at the utilization guidance for the fourth quarter and i guess we re i don t know if both in the spot here but are we at the point where we re seeing a recovery trajectory for refining and if so is that utilization rate so low because it s still including alliance in the denominator i m just curious about how you see that playing out maybe you could give us an update on how you think what the next steps are for lines at this point i ve got a follow up robert a herman executive vice president refining okay i ll take the first part and i ll let kevin talk about the write down so your two part question there yeah so as we said we don t anticipate alliance running in the fourth quarter so you can think about that as about a 10 hit utilization kind of on a normal basis if we would have been running during the quarter so we would have been guiding to low 90s so yes for a fourth quarter low 90s a little bit of turnaround activity in 4q not too heavy so i would characterize that we re kind of back to running our system in a normal condition and so we ll run as the economics dictate and particularly with heavy crude coming the dips coming wider that usually incents us to run several of our assets harder but then yeah we keep alliance in the denominator until it s not in the denominator kevin j mitchell executive vice president finance and chief financial officer yeah doug specifically on the impairment so with the hurricanes and the damage sustained by the hurricane that gave us our indicators of impairment that required us to then do a fair value analysis around that and so as a result of that work and that analysis we took a 1 3 billion pre tax impairment that put us down to a resulting carrying value of about 200 million on the balance sheet once we had taken that impairment and that reflects the asset as it stands today and the condition that it s in today doug leggate bank of america analyst i don t want to labor the point kevin but obviously there s capital required for repairs or remediation whatever it is you got to do but do you see a future for alliance in your hands or in someone else s hands back at is it going to operate again or is it down so much at this point that the thing is unlikely to result in your opinion kevin j mitchell executive vice president finance and chief financial officer yeah i think on that front doug we continue to explore any and all avenues for the alliance refinery as everybody knows it suffered significant damage particularly significant electrical system damage from the flood waters that hit it and we have been painstaking working our way through the assessment of how do you restore operations there so that work continues we continue to as we announced before seek buyers for the facility and then we continue to work with those third parties to see what the actual outcome of the alliance refinery it is too soon to make that call as to would operate as a refinery again or in some other capacity either for us or somebody else doug leggate bank of america analyst thank you my follow up guys is just a quick one on psxp i don t know that numbers are going to be terribly meaningful here but i just wonder if you could talk us through are there any incremental synergies coming out of the consolidation of bringing it back in obviously you don t have the accounting function and so on and i wonder if i could just tag on to that again not a big number but how should we think about the targets for the combined or consolidated company leverage debt targets going forward now that you ve fully brought it back inside thanks kevin j mitchell executive vice president finance and chief financial officer how many questions was that so in terms of the synergies associated with the roll up it s pretty small in the big scheme of things doug i mean clearly there are some corporate costs there s the fact that psxp is a public entity and all of the associated costs that go with that will disappear and so there ll be a modest impact but it s not anything that s going to move the needle when you step back and look at our consolidated financial results from the standpoint of leverage and debt levels we already had all of that mlp debt on our consolidated balance sheet and so the as greg talked about our target of 12 billion pre pandemic debt levels that we re trying to get back to that included psxp debt as well and so it doesn t really change anything in terms of how we think about our go forward leverage objectives the roll up does give us a little bit more flexibility though because one we have access to all of the cash that previously either was distributed to the lp unitholders as distributions or was excess cash excess sort of coverage cash becomes available to us for debt reduction and we also have the psxp debt available as we think of the options around paying down debt we have the psxp debt to consider in that context as well so it just gives us a bit more flexibility operator the next question is from paul cheng with scotia please go ahead paul cheng scotia analyst hey guys good morning greg c garland chairman and chief executive officer good morning paul cheng scotia analyst maybe the first one is for bob that can you i know that you re saying in home there is not a lot of you don t consume a lot of natural gas but can you give us an overall in u s and in europe for every 1 per mcf change what s the impact on the opex and your refining margin capture on a dollar per barrel basis that s the first question and secondly that in the u s phillips 66 is always at top a capital light wholesale brand model any plan to change it and become more engaged in and on your own store given the energy transition that we are seeing people that is i mean some of your bigger customers become more aggressive in owning the stations building the ev charger and all that is that and to some degree you are doing it in europe so is that something that you will also try to replicate in the us or that the wholesale capital light model is the way to go in the us robert a herman executive vice president refining nothing changed kevin j mitchell executive vice president finance and chief financial officer okay i ll take a shot at nat gas and i ll let brian talk about retail plans so we provide sensitivity paul that for every 1 change in milling btu nat gas price about 150 million a year across our fleet and you can think about that as about 100 million of that is pure natural gas and the other 50 million comes through in electricity and steam purchases of the 100 million then it s about three quarters hits our controllable cost line and then the other quarter of it is in cost of goods sold primarily natural gas that we buy to turn into hydrogen so and that s without any mitigating steps within the refining system obviously a lot of refineries have the ability to fuel propane and a little bit of butane and really the economics of the day will drive what we decide to do there we ve also got the knob of turning up severity on cat crackers and making more gas so there s a lot of moving parts into that sensitivity but the simplest way to think about it is just kind of 1 is 150 million a year so if we can call that 35 million or so a quarter brian mandell executive vice president marketing and commercial and paul on the retail us retail side we had a small retail joint venture in oklahoma city three dozen stores a few years ago in 2019 we stated that we want to be more in the retail business especially in markets where there are less opportunities to export markets like the mid con so we will have by the end of the year about 800 joint ventures stores in the us we re continuing to find stores and buy stores in middle america where we re going to integrate those stores with our refinery complex to make sure we have the pull through particularly as gasoline demand wanes in the us so it will still remain retail will remain a small portion of the whole for us in the us but it s a market that we re actively pursuing operator the next question is from manav gupta with credit suisse please go ahead manav gupta credit suisse analyst hi everybody if you could give us some idea of this nvx deal you re taking 16 interest in them how did it come out stepping into battery something we haven t seen you do before or any refiner do now i mean what i m trying to get to is we kind of know you make needle coke you won t tell us how much you make or what the price is but we kind of know it s there and i m trying to understand if there are some synergies between that needle coke and the nvx deal that you did greg c garland chairman and chief executive officer who want to state that robert a herman executive vice president refining i ll jump in i ll jump in well yes novonix yes we ve identified four key areas that we want to focus on in renewables to generate strong returns that s renewables batteries hydrogen and carbon capture so this particular opportunity falls under the battery pillar and as you noted we ve got a very good feedstock that can be used to generate synthetic graphite to go into anodes and we went through a screening process as these anode producers are looking at ways to provide shorter supply chain options for those that need their services like those that are building electric vehicles and novonix rose to the top of that screening process in north america and we like the team we like the technologies they were employing they ve got a low carbon intensity technology to produce the synthetic graphite they re locating in a place where they can get low carbon electricity and it s a great way for us to move up the value chain in battery manufacturing and supporting the growth in electric vehicles brian mandell executive vice president marketing and commercial i think maybe the other thing i might add is we know a lot about the specialty coke that goes into the anodes and how to tailor that and make properties around that but the further up the value chain we get the more we can understand how we can make those properties special right and so that we can drive more value creation and at the end of the day better batteries and so that s part of what s driving this is to seek to understand the ultimate customers in this market so we can help drive performance jeff dietert vice president investor relations i think the other thing i d add is there s an increased focus on local content within the u s and in europe and the advantage of having u s facilities serving that market manav gupta credit suisse analyst thanks jeff for that my one quick follow up here is look we understand the chemical margins of 0 68 or whatever would not last but in your opinion has pandemic fundamentally changed the demand for disposable plastics which means the mid cycle could be five or 10 or whatever number over a standard 0 20 0 25 per pound so just trying to understand your outlook for the mid cycle margins in the chemical space maybe for the next two or three years as we see some capacity expansion thank you mark lashier president and chief operating officer yeah manav i think that we re holding with our view of mid cycle margins that there may have been i think that clearly the plastics industry benefited during the pandemic i think as there may be some residual effects there with respect to personal protective equipment and things like that but i think as the world moves beyond the pandemic we see things coming back to a more normal supply and demand situation and i think it contributed to the strong growth that we ve seen and but we don t see a multiplier effect on that going forward manav gupta credit suisse analyst thank you operator the next question is from matthew blair with tudor pickering holt please go ahead matthew blair tudor pickering holt analyst hey good morning thanks for taking my question here for cpchem could you share your ethane outlook over the next i don t know call it a year or so we do have some new crackers starting up potential ramp of ethane exports do you see that incremental demand being covered by incremental production or do we need to pull from either i guess projection or just overall inventory levels timothy d roberts executive vice president midstream yeah matt this is tim roberts and a couple of things on that one is there s a couple of drivers that are happening in there first of all you still have about one million barrels being rejected so you ve got a sufficient pool that s sitting there that s obviously got to be incented to come out and so up to this last quarter it actually wasn t incented to come out we ve seen that flip a little bit here recently there ll be a little bit of pull with a couple of new crackers coming on stream here over the next two quarters but fundamentally we actually feel that the supply is going to be there and so it will be sufficient there s also quite an incentive for people to get out there and make sure they re maximizing gas production and then you are seeing folks out there continue to maintain production so we re seeing coming off of the crude side natural gas side and then with the rejection that s going on it feels very sufficient here matthew blair tudor pickering holt analyst got it and then on the renewables side are there any prospects for using renewable hydrogen for your plant in rodeo and if so would that be something potentially near term or is it like much bigger out robert a herman executive vice president refining yes there is a possibility to do that and we continue to explore those avenues it is not part of the project today and in fact we were running mostly third party hydrogen there so it s really a question for them but there are opportunities in california to recover renewable natural gas that could find its way to being run by the hydrogen supplier and that would lower actually the overall carbon intensity of the diesel we will eventually make matthew blair tudor pickering holt analyst sounds good thank you operator the next question is from ryan todd with piper sandler ryan todd piper sandler analyst hi thanks maybe a balance sheet cash flow question i mean in very rough terms your ex working capital cash flow this quarter roughly went an equal amount in the capex dividend and debt reduction i know you talked about another 500 million in debt reduction before or likely during the fourth quarter i mean as we think about your balance sheet that would have you down to about 14 5 billion versus the i guess your 12 billion pre pandemic target as we think about uses of cash in 2022 do you need to get the balance sheet down to that 12 billion level before you start thinking about buybacks or at what point does there s a potential for buybacks kind of become a part of the excess cash flow kevin j mitchell executive vice president finance and chief financial officer yes ryan it s kevin so what we re trying to balance here is first priority is to protect the credit rating so with the a3 bbb credit ratings strong investment grade we want to maintain those ratings and part of getting there is getting the balance sheet back to where it was but it s also a function of cash generation at mid cycle or thereabouts levels and so i think that once we are we re already making good progress on debt reduction and when we re in that position of we re clearly back in a mid cycle type environment we re generating mid cycle cash flow there s a very clear line of sight to the ability to continue to reduce debt down to the levels we want to get to we should have more flexibility to start thinking about the other alternatives that we have in terms of use of cash so maybe that s a long winded way of saying we don t believe we have to get all the way to before we think about alternatives as long as the cash generation is there that we can clearly see our ability to delever continue to delever and consider some of the alternatives around capital allocation ryan todd piper sandler analyst thanks and then maybe on i guess maybe as a follow up to that as you think about mid cycle mid cycle environment for the refining business i mean one of your large peers who reported earlier talked about their prior expectations for 2022 being below mid cycle and now they see it as potentially being an above mid cycle year in refining when you look at an overall supply demand dynamics and various trends in the industry do you see 2022 where do you see it on the refining side in terms of relative to kind of mid cycle expectations kevin j mitchell executive vice president finance and chief financial officer it s always hard to call because we invariably when we make a prediction we get it wrong but things seem to be shaping up to be somewhere at least close to mid cycle and i think the one component of the sort of refining contribution that s not there right now are the crude differentials so we re still lagging on heavy crude differentials but there s some light at the end of the tunnel on that as well as we start to see opec putting more barrels back into the market so we could see that start to come back in our favor but that is probably what s keeping us being a little maybe a little bit behind mid cycle at this point in time but open up to brian mandell executive vice president marketing and commercial yes i would say with low inventories across all products with jet fuel starting to come back the government opening up international travel to vaccinated travelers by november 8 i think we ll continue to see the heavy dips expand we ve seen meh and also dubai brent both expand quite a bit from late july to now so i think we ll continue to see that expansion part of that is this drive to use more sweet crude even overseas where people where hydrogen is costly so desulfurization is costly so people want to switch to or refiners want to switch to more light crude diet so i think things are setting up for a good 2022 we hear we ll call it an average year for us but it may be better than that depending on if inventories continue to decrease greg c garland chairman and chief executive officer little bit realized crack kind of 12 to 19 3 1 when adjusted it s kind of 10 50 a barrel give or take and we re kind of 8 50 ish in this quarter so we re not quite back to a mid cycle crack but to the point that you raised earlier i think well i don t think we re bullish i ve never been bullish in refining so it s not time to grow horns here but i do think that we re probably more constructive today on 2022 in refining and moving toward mid cycle margins than we were anytime in the past 19 months i would say operator the next question is from jason gabelman with cowen please go ahead jason gabelman cowen analyst thanks for taking my questions i first wanted to ask about this other refining bucket in that margin waterfall chart it s been volatile the past couple of quarters i think it was as high as 8 a barrel last quarter back down to 5 this quarter is that difference mostly related to rins or are there other things going on and where do you see that trending over the next coming quarters and then secondly i just wanted to ask about ngl exposure across the business ngl prices right now are pretty high propane inventories are low do you have an ability to capture some of that price strength in the midstream business and conversely is there an impact to your refining business in the winter due to butane blending and any ability to quantify that would help thanks robert a herman executive vice president refining yes so i ll take a shot at a couple of pieces to that the so you re right the other category is our most volatile category and we call it other because everything that is straightforward is in there so you ve got rin effects in there you ve got inventory effects in there we ve also got product differential effects in there so on particularly in the atlantic basin when european cracks really disconnect from the atlantic coast we ll see the plus or minus in that category inventory accounting can move numbers in there quite a bit and there s a few steady things in there like freight to get our products to market and those sorts of things are pretty steady but the volatility really comes product dips and that also includes the timing of our realizations for the products we move up colonial pipeline to the east coast that can be very volatile month to month and quarter to quarter the rins inventories and then just overall market structure in between the places that we buy and sell our products it s hard to say that the volatility will slow down it s kind of always there the bucket is just outsized right now because of the severe rin impact that we show in the other category right that accounts for almost half of that bucket here over the last couple of quarters on the ngl side butane blending into gasoline right you run a fair amount we ll want to do it if it s economic so if ngls prices run up and it doesn t make sense to put it in the gasoline we won t overall in refining as part of our secondary products right we make 4 5 ngls off the refining complexes so the higher the price for ngls the better off we are and lowers that usually negative to our income so overall it s we store a lot of our own butane every year to bring back and blend it in gasoline but quite frankly we ll sell it into the market if that makes more sense timothy d roberts executive vice president midstream on the ngl piece with regard to more along the lines of exposure taking advantage of the opportunity you re right barrel has been pretty active i mean it s effectively tripled in price here in the last year but what we do with our system we re predominantly we re not exposed significantly in the commodity cycle there so we really are a fee based business the way we re structured now what we do do much like what we do with the refining kit is we have a system we re managing around so as we are buying and selling barrels to optimize our kit there are opportunities for us to trade around those assets and capture and equip a couple of the corners in that process but it s really to manage and optimize our system to make sure our barrels as we buy them from the wellhead all the way to the point they end up in the marketplace that s how we try and position those barrels and we play in that so we don t have a lot of commodity exposure we have a little bit on our lpg but that was by design lpg exports excuse me that was a little bit of that by design but most of that business has turned up as well it should be considered a fee based business operator the final question is from connor lynagh with morgan stanley please go ahead connor lynagh morgan stanley analyst yes thank you i had a couple of questions on federal policy and i know things are early days but the first is around sustainable aviation fuel and if the incremental credit or blender s credit as discussed right now where it s going to effect how would that alter your thinking around how you re going to configure the rodeo plant between renewable diesel and aviation fuel robert a herman executive vice president refining yes so today the design is done the permits in so the opportunity currently to reconfigure what we plan to do there is really not there at this point right and but having said that the refinery itself will make 8 to 10 yield of sustainable aviation fuel that the blender s tax credit as envisioned today may or may not incent us to do that it s fairly close so it will depend on the on everything else that goes into the margin at that point whether we actually want to make sustainable aviation fuel or make renewable diesel and like everything else in the commodity business right we ll like the economics dictate i think there s plenty of opportunity as sustainable aviation fuel develops and the market develops for that over time to come back and do a debottlenecking or add a little bit of kit at rodeo renewed to make more sustainable aviation fuel is there and we ll probably make sense but it s probably going to take more than the 1 50 that the government is anticipating putting out there to make that happen connor lynagh morgan stanley analyst got it that s helpful the other is on carbon capture and i know you guys have discussed studying carbon capture as an opportunity you ve got these new targets out there producing your carbon intensity so how are you thinking about that and certainly it would seem that the enhanced incentives if passed would increase third party developers willingness to build systems so how are you thinking about it just broadly in terms of the opportunity set for you and if you were to pursue some larger scale projects would you use your balance sheet would you rely on others how do you think that would look timothy d roberts executive vice president midstream yeah i think i mean look this is still evolving as we move forward in this but we do think carbon capture is going to be a key piece of the overall transition being able to meet some of the targets and goals that have been set out there whether by 2030 2050 and so carbon capture going to be a key piece of that i mean it s already in play currently just not in a large scale but we certainly do believe there s opportunities for us to participate in that and so a big key piece of that is going to be having a concentration of carbon to capture i mean you ve got to have areas where there s heavy concentration you ve heard some of the stuff about houston and there are other metro areas or industrialized areas where there may be opportunities to do that as well we certainly think with our assets and our structure and the products and the process that we do that it does make sense now the next challenges doesn t make economic sense so we re going to work both sides of that equation with regard to see what makes sense and what fits whether it s organic whether it s with a partner whether it s equity relationships whether it s technology partnerships i think at this point in time we re not going to single in on one way we re going to find out what the opportunity is and what the value is and then determine what s the best path to maximize and optimize value operator we have reached the end of

good morning today i m pleased to announce it after after months of tough and thoughtful negotiations i think we have an historic i know we have historic economic framework it s a framework that will create millions of jobs grow the economy invest in our nation and our people turn the climate crisis into an opportunity and put us on a path not only to compete but to win the economic competition for the 21st century against china and every other major country in the world it s fiscally responsible it s fully paid for i want to thank my colleagues in the congress for the leadership we spent hours and hours and hours over months and months working on this no one got everything they wanted including me but that s what compromises that s consensus and that s what i ran on i ve long said compromise and consensus are the only way to get big things done in a democracy important things done for the country i know it s hard i know how deeply people feel about the things that they fight for but this framework includes historic investments in our nation and our people any single arm of this framework would fundamentally be viewed as a fundamental change in america taking together they re truly consequential this is about competitiveness versus complacency competitiveness versus complacency is about expanding opportunity not opportunity denied it s about leading the world we re letting the world passes by i ran for president saying it was time to reduce the burden on the middle class to rebuild the backbone of this nation working people in the middle class i couldn t have been any clear from the very moment i announced my candidacy that s why i wrote these bills in the first place and took them to the people i campaigned on that and the american people spoke this agenda the agenda is in these bills is what 81 million americans voted for more people voted than any time in american history that s what they voted for their voices deserve to be heard not denied or worse ignore if you look at the history of the journey of this nation what becomes crystal clear is this we ll say it again given half a chance the american people have never ever ever ever let the country down so let s get this done god bless you all and may god protect your troops and i ll see you in italy and in scotland thank you advertisement what s in and what s out as biden offers scaled back spending plan share copy link copy after months of talks with democratic lawmakers president joe biden outlined thursday a 1 75 trillion framework to support families and education as well as protect against global warming the updated plan includes universal preschool funding to limit child care costs and a one year continuation of a child tax credit that was expanded earlier this year and applied to more families but democrats are scaling back some investments and shortening the timeframe for funding to whittle down spending some proposals were dropped entirely more negotiations are possible the framework fits an approximately 1 75 trillion budget over 10 years rather than the 3 5 trillion budget plan originally envisioned here s what s in the package according to the white house tax breaks an expanded child tax credit would continue for another year as part of a covid relief bill democrats increased the tax credit to 3 000 per child age 6 17 and 3 600 per child age 5 and under households earning up to 150 000 per year get the credit paid out to them on a monthly basis budget hawks worry that a one year extension is a budgetary tool that will lower the cost of the

today are maria pope president and ceo and jim ajello senior vice president of finance cfo and treasurer following their prepared remarks we will open the line for your questions now it s my pleasure to turn the call over to maria maria m pope president and chief executive officer good morning and thank you jardon and thank you all for joining us hot summer weather and power market volatility had a significant impact on our region and on our results this quarter turning to slide four we reported net income of 50 million or 0 56 per share for the third quarter of 2021 this compares with the loss of 17 million or 0 19 per share for the third quarter of 2020 year to date financial performance is on track and despite third quarter volatility in the energy markets and higher o m we are reaffirming our 2021 earnings guidance of 2 70 to 2 85 per share our long term outlook remains unchanged and we are reaffirming our 4 to 6 long term earnings growth guidance overall our business is strong driven by load growth from the technology and digital sectors as well as elevated residential use due in part to the hot summer weather and continued covid constraints year to date revenue is up 12 versus 2020 and for the quarter up 17 versus last year jim will cover third quarter results in more detail provide regulatory and capital updates and discuss the outlook for the rest of the year the ongoing impacts of climate change underscore the importance of investments and actions that we are taking to rapidly transition to a clean energy future and meet our 2030 decarbonization goals while also ensuring that we have sufficient capacity we estimate that our 2030 targets will require approximately 1 500 to 2 000 megawatts of additional carbon free resources and approximately 800 megawatts of non emitting capacity resources in addition to removing coal from our portfolio we re seeking approximately 1 000 megawatts of renewables and non emitting capacity resources as part of our rfp which will be issued in december as part of this procurement we plan to add 375 to 500 megawatts of renewables to our portfolio we will also bring on approximately 375 of non emitting to special capacity we will work with the opuc and parties to evaluate opportunities to procure additional resources so the types of projects submitted in the irp process excuse me the rfp process make sense for customers and are attractively priced we could see procuring about a third of our clean energy resources needed to meet the 2030 emissions target reductions with this rfp we not only need more renewables we need to upgrade the grid to integrate these resources making it easier for customers to participate in demand response and distributed energy programs helping to keep service reliable and affordable in our recent distributed resource excuse me distributed system plan we lay out plans for the grid of the future that supports robust two way energy flows and better manages energy use especially during peak periods we estimate that as much as 25 of flexibility needed to meet our decarbonized future would come from customers and distributed energy resources such as solar panels batteries electric vehicles during the 2021 summer heat up we worked with customers to save 62 megawatts of power equivalent to powering 25 000 homes we re working to significantly grow this program to 500 megawatts by the end of 2023 we are very pleased to have been selected by the department of energy as part of their connect communities program and are working with local de i groups on the placement of resources such as batteries two way ev charging and solar panels to ensure that our customers in underserved communities participate in this clean energy transition as one of the early participants in the western energy and balance market we have been a leader in advocating for the expansion and strengthening of wholesale markets to increase reliability accelerate decarbonization and lower cost for customers pge and our utility partners across the west are working to bolster reliability planning advance integrated markets and examine the benefits of a western regional transmission organization throughout these processes we ll continue to advocate for rigorous resource adequacy standards sustainability is foundational to our business in september we published our esg report building upon our number one ranked voluntary renewable program sustainability is part of the fabric of everything we do including financing we recently adopted a green financing framework under which we successfully placed 150 million in green bonds yesterday we filed a rate case with the federal energy regulatory commission to review our third party transmission revenue the revenue that we receive from these new prices we ll offset retail customer prices through a revenue credit we continue to make progress on our 2022 general rate case and have reached settlements with stakeholders in october that resolves the cost of equity and gives at 9 5 as well as the 50 50 cash structure we look forward to working with stakeholders on the remaining items finally i m pleased to welcome dawn farrell to our board of directors dawn retired as president and ceo of transalta in march her deep experience in the energy sector as well as her leadership in transforming a thermal based generation company to a leading clean renewable energy company will be important as we advance our own transformation now i d like to turn the call over to jim jim ajello chief financial officer thank you maria and good morning everyone our third quarter results reflect the ongoing opportunity and the challenge as the economy enters a new normal we experienced strong load growth from higher demand and hotter weather at the same time volatility in the power markets was evident throughout the summer the fundamentals of our economy remained strong and are fueling strong growth in energy demand and a growing labor market with continued job growth in the region this quarter we had strong deliveries across our customer segments with additional benefit from a favorable weather our high tech and digital services sectors continue to grow at a rapid pace 9 higher when compared to q3 2020 customers are expanding capacity and we ve seen an uptick in site selection activity by data center developers and others residential usage remains significantly elevated as remote work continues we anticipate these trends to continue and this has contributed to our strong year over year load growth turning to slide five we reported gaap income of 0 56 per share in the third quarter of 2021 compared to a gaap loss of 0 19 per share in the third quarter of 2020 non gaap income for the third quarter of 2020 is 0 90 after removing the negative impact of the energy trading losses i ll cover our financial performance quarter over quarter on slide six beginning with the loss of 0 19 per share for the third quarter of 2020 we will add back the 1 09 one time impact of the energy trading losses we experienced a 0 37 increase in total revenues primarily due to the strong economy driving growth in our service territory with the balance due to warmer weather this represents a 17 year over year increase in total revenues offsetting this was a 0 39 of unfavorable power cost we experience substantially higher market prices due to warmer weather and increased regional demand for capacity as well as lower renewable generation as a result we are forecast to be above the 30 million threshold to begin customer cost sharing pursuant to our power cost adjustment mechanism through the quarter we have deferred 27 million which represents 90 of the variance above that threshold we anticipate the regulatory process related to this deferral will begin in 2022 after the pending rate case concludes our power costs this summer were not materially impacted by rising natural gas prices our portfolio is well positioned and a bit long to balance gas price fluctuation and we have significant gas storage at the 4 1 billion cubic foot north mist facility that we can draw on as needed there was 0 11 decrease to eps from cost associated with our fixed operating expenses including 0 03 for enhanced wildfire mitigation 0 04 of additional vegetation management including work that was delayed as we focused on storm restoration during the second quarter 0 02 of service restoration costs and 0 02 of miscellaneous other expenses there was an 0 18 decrease to eps from administrative expense half of the year over year increase is attributed to items that were unique to 2020 including 0 07 in adjustments to incentive programs following the energy trading losses in the prior period and 0 02 from the deferral of bad debt following the approval of the covid 19 deferral the remaining administrative expense can be attributed to 0 06 for outside services to support improvements to our customer experience a 0 02 increase in employee benefit expenses and 0 01 from miscellaneous other expenses while o m was higher this quarter when compared to q3 2020 on a year over year basis our cost have increased only 2 annually since 2019 the fact that we have reduced planned outages by 29 year over year stood up a large wildfire prevention program and greatly increased vegetation management is a testament to the efficiency we built into the o m program managing consistent with inflation while increasing wildfire resiliency improving our customer experience and growing our digital capabilities demonstrates the effectiveness and efficiency of our workforce as well as the use of technology finally there was a 0 03 decrease to eps from the following items 0 03 benefit from lower depreciation and amortization due to plant retirements 0 04 of higher tax expense due to the timing difference of asset retirements in 2020 and 0 02 from other unfavorable miscellaneous items turning to slide seven last month we reached an agreement with stakeholders on cost of capital in our 2022 general rate case our agreement supports a capital structure of 50 debt 50 equity and a 9 5 allowed roe we see this as a constructive outcome and look forward to discussing remaining unsettled issues with parties in the case as you see saw earlier this month we made several regulatory filings which we shared in which we shared our plans to advance the strategy to meet our targets for reducing greenhouse emissions in the power we serve to customers maria discussed our rfp plans earlier in this call we still plan to bid in benchmark resources into the rfp process to support our bids we filed for an affiliated interest entity that will help support our decarbonization interest our proposal is intended to address certain structural tax disadvantages encountered by utilities due to the unintended consequences of tax normalization requirements the affiliate interest would provide a greater price benefit to our customers as pge decarbonizes its generation portfolio turning to slide eight which shows our updated capital forecast through 2025 we increased our capital expenditure forecast by over 100 million this quarter this increase is concentrated in 2022 and is primarily associated with grid based investments with our recent settlement in the grc assuming approval by the opc this affirms that we will not need to issue equity in 2022 to meet our capital requirements unless there is a significant renewable addition stemming from the aforementioned rfp we continue to maintain a solid balance sheet including strong liquidity and investment grade ratings accompanied by a stable credit outlook total available liquidity at 930 million is just over 1 billion at pge sustainability is woven into the fabric of who we are as a company and we stand behind that through our actions as an organization including in our financing plans this quarter we renewed and increased by 150 million our revolving credit facility to include sustainability linked performance metrics we also refinanced the wheatridge renewable energy facility with low cost debt under a green bond in alignment with our green financing framework the demand for this was evident as it was nearly six times oversubscribed our investors are keen to purchase debt linked to sustainable investments going forward we will seek out opportunities to tie our long term debt toward our sustainability strategy through capital investments not only are these actions good for our business but they re also good for society turning to slide nine our year to date 2021 performance remains on track and we reaffirm our guidance range of 2 70 to 2 85 and remain on track to achieve long term earnings growth guidance of 4 to 6 from the 2019 base year the picture for 2021 and beyond remains clear strong growth in cost demand for clean affordable safe reliable and equitable energy paves the way for us to execute on our long term financial targets and deliver value for customers and investors alike and now operator we re ready for questions questions and answers operator our first question comes from the line of insoo kim from goldman sachs your question please insoo kim goldman sachs analyst thank you my first question is more financial in nature just jim for the year as we think about the year to date results and you reiterating the mix or i guess the guidance range rate last year seems to imply a pretty healthy fourth quarter earnings relative to if you look at 2019 fourth quarter or 2020 fourth quarter results can you just help us generally piece together some of the moving parts that gets us there jim ajello chief financial officer yes thanks insoo as i understood your question you re trying to in effect walk from where we are to date to the result of the 2021 guidance and in effect what we might do in the fourth quarter so let me try to do i get that right insoo kim goldman sachs analyst yes that s correct jim ajello chief financial officer okay perfect okay so let s look back to the fourth quarter of 2020 there the earnings were 0 57 per share you may recall but also we recorded a asset retirement obligation for our sullivan hydro facility a facility that s well over 100 years old in fact and that was 0 17 a share we also adjusted incentives for that fourth quarter as non gaap earnings were picking up speed in the fourth quarter so in reality what happened was the way i look at the fourth quarter and i walked to the fourth quarter of this year we had about 0 22 between the aro and the incentive adjustment added to the 0 57 to normalize the fourth quarter of 2020 which gets you to about 0 79 and that in fact gets you to about the midpoint if that were to reoccur again in 2021 of the present range does that help insoo kim goldman sachs analyst okay so the aro is a pretty big component of this jim ajello chief financial officer yes the aro is 0 17 a share incentive adjustments 0 22 add that to 0 57 you would normalize fourth quarter of 2020 to 0 79 a share and we re at 1 98 1 98 as you would know for the year to date presently right insoo kim goldman sachs analyst okay that definitely helps thank you for that second question maria just broader picture i think it s no question that the state of oregon s been a leader in proposing and advocating and acting on the clean energy transformation and portland s a big component of that when we think about the pending reconciliation package that is out there and the potential for extensions of tax credits and some changes to how those mechanisms will work how does that how do you think about that impacting or creating incremental opportunities maybe even over the next five years in terms of different clean energy investment that come about for you guys maria m pope president and chief executive officer sure first of all it s a great question and we were very pleased to see the announcements yesterday with significant investments that will help us and others transition to a clean energy economy the structure of the tax credits and the bill were particularly important to us as you know we ve worked with senator wyden on tech neutral tax credits those are reflected in what was discussed yesterday by the president and also important to us is tax normalization that s included in we are still working very focused on normalization for transmission and in particular for storage and so those remain goals of ours should that not take place the affiliate filing that jim talked about will give us the level playing field to continue to move forward with important components from a utility standpoint for our customers around battery storage and others so that we can get the very lowest cost for customers as we make this important transition insoo kim goldman sachs analyst understood that s it for me thank you maria m pope president and chief executive officer thank you operator thank you our next question comes from the line julien dumoulin smith from bank of america your question please maria m pope president and chief executive officer good morning julien julien dumoulin smith bank of america analyst thank you operator good morning to the team thank you and congrats to dawn as well i don t know if she s there but well done on bringing on more talent here if i could just jump into the rate case just real quickly here two quick clarifications so first off just following the earlier settlement obviously on cap structure and roe how you frame a potential to settle other outstanding items and just the process therein and then related to that if you could clarify given the capital structure in the 50 50 authorized does that change any equity dynamics as far as you re concerned here jim ajello chief financial officer julien i ll it s jim good morning i ll kick off so to take your last question first yes it does and it gives me confidence that we could go into 2022 without the issuance of any equity we re in very good shape from a balance sheet standpoint our cost of financing and able to fund even that increased capital program that i spoke of a moment ago we changed that from 550 million next year to 655 million and i ll just go further and maria may want to add in in a moment but we received comments earlier this week we re evaluating those i would say that this is a normal part of the process just want to remind everyone that we deferred filing a bit here earlier this year in consideration of the community impacts on covid so i think we were we respected everybody s interest in terms of timing we feel we put forward a pretty modest proposal frankly about 3 9 2 of that was in the aut itself it s largely a capital case we added 993 million of capital between the last time rates were filed we have kept as i mentioned in the remarks a moment ago our o m pretty tight over that period of time and as you would know the company has a history of settling so we are about to get into a process where we will exchange information and hopefully get to that outcome but it s too soon to predict anything at all maria anything to add maria m pope president and chief executive officer no i want to emphasize that as we ve made decisions around our rate case we have been particularly confident of the economy and particularly on those most impacted by the pandemic and as the result delayed filing our rate case i would also say we were able to do that because of all of the tremendous work that our colleagues here at portland general have done in jim s prepare remarks he talked about the efficiencies that we have gotten from better use of technology digital driving efficiencies across our entire company as a matter of fact our planned outages are down significantly over 20 we have seen better utilization of our assets better work management flow and there s no question that we are getting more work done than we have in the past and i m really encouraged that we were able to keep through all of the ups and downs of the last 18 months to two years o m increasing at only 2 annually and this focus on costs but more importantly on efficiency and driving outcomes for customers has allowed us to have the flexibility to delay our rate cases we ve brought on really important reliability capital capital also in the compliance area as jim mentioned we have really focused on vegetation management wildfire protection and then as you know people are moving to oregon and we have quite a bit expansion in our digital and high tech areas and so we have built a number of new substations we ve expanded some other of our infrastructure and it s really because of the good work of people at portland general that we ve been able to keep our prices as low as we are particularly in light of all of that s going on in our economy today julien dumoulin smith bank of america analyst got it excellent and just if i can pivot here to the affiliate dynamic just real quickly you brought this up this seems somewhat novel can you speak a little bit more as to just how that might expand the opportunity or why pivot to this opportunity now given that you haven t used it in the past i understand that tax normalization obviously has been abatement out there and then maybe your level of confidence there and now that you re pivoting to this strategic focus here on winning maria m pope president and chief executive officer sure so first of all we remain hopeful and the industry is focused on resolving the tax normalization issues and those discussions as you ve seen senator wyden quoted in political and whatnot are very much in play this is not this affiliate filing is not new we ve been talking about it for a long time and debating it so it s very similar to many other affiliate filings that you see across the country it will allow us to utilize tax advantages to reduce renewable costs from customers for customers to allow for more competition and really so that our customers can have the very lowest cost to energy that s reliable as we transition to ever increasing amounts of new renewables we have we as well as many others have very aggressive 2030 and 2040 goals and we think this is an important tool in that toolbox jim ajello chief financial officer julien i hear you asking the question why now and why us and in addition to the structural disadvantages compared to the way independent power producers can accelerate those tax credits and we have to normalize them over the life of the asset 30 years let s say we re about to enter into a and pivot into a very significant growth plan in renewables we want to be an extremely active benchmark and owner of those assets and we need to level the playing field and have the tools to do that we need a couple of thousand megawatts between now and the end of the decade and we want to be in that mix i don t expect to win everything but we expect to be very competitive and we need the tools to do that and that s really the framework and why now we re doing that julien dumoulin smith bank of america analyst fair enough excellent i will leave it there guys thank you jim ajello chief financial officer sure maria m pope president and chief executive officer thank you julien operator thank you our next question comes from the line of david peters from wolfe research your question please david peters wolfe research analyst hey good morning guys maria m pope president and chief executive officer good morning david peters wolfe research analyst the question first question i just have is just on the variable power costs obviously the magnitude of that seems fairly unprecedented and then the deferral of 27 million just curious how you expect this to play out exactly just because i think this is the first time you expect to kind of breach that and then just kind of particularly with the backdrop that you have several other kind of sizable deferrals pending that are outstanding along with the rate case so are there any creative ways to kind of mitigate potential bill impacts for customers here going forward jim ajello chief financial officer dave i would agree with your observations my time here is fairly short but i look back and i think you re right about the nature of the levels here so as the weather and the markets that we experienced over the summertime so i look at the mechanism itself as and our deferral under that mechanism is highly formulaic there are deferrals and there are deferrals this one i believe is can be objectively calculated at the level that we have recorded it and so i believe that this particular deferral is very straightforward very verifiable and the way it would work it typically typically i would say but subject to discussion with the opuc is we would amortize that over a couple of year period starting as i mentioned in the remarks after we adjudicate this pending grc that we have at the moment so that s that one and you refer to the other deferrals which are substantial as you could calculate they re nearly 150 million all together but they re very different in nature there s the covid deferral which again is subject to i think a pretty straightforward calculation around debt bad debt and then they re the more complex deferrals around the wildfires of 2020 and the last one being the biggest of all which is the february storm cost so i think i described these in terms of both size and ascending complexity and i fully expect since we don t have a securitization capability in this state at least not yet we will have to sit down and agree on an amortization schedule and as i described those deferrals they will go from shorter to probably a longer period of time so the latter deferrals that i mentioned probably over a number of years maybe many years so that s how i look at it dave and that s how i would think about it going forward maria m pope president and chief executive officer dave let me add a couple things to that we have gone through an extraordinary period of time we obviously had the pandemic we had the wild very destructive wildfires we had a once in 40 year ice storm where more than half of our customers were out of power and we had over 700 000 distinct customer outages we also had the high heat dome events and it s really has been an unusual point of time most utilities would use a securitization structure and that i think is something that we will explore with parties it s very important as well because we re able to take advantage of very low cost debt rates and so that will certainly be something that we will pursue i think it s really important as we look going forward around power costs that the pcam is really just one link in the chain of power cost recovery i think of this as kind of a four or five step process the first one is our forecasting methodologies and earlier this year late last year we made changes to some of our modeling assumptions with discussions with parties and the opuc and those changes allow for more volatility to be reflected in our modeling and that s particularly important with the variability of hydro and wind the second would be aut or our power cost filing that we do each year we are able to chew up market prices for power as we go into the prompt year and then third really our procurement strategy and de risking through our power operations and they have done an excellent job at that and i d say they re working very closely this would be my fourth area in terms of plant operation and making sure that our plants have the utmost reliability on the most challenging days of the year whether those be ice storms and freezing temperatures or high heat events and then finally the pcam comes in and provides a regulatory backstop for our extraordinary volatility as we ve experienced this summer so i think these are really unusual times as we look forward into 2022 and you can we ve been in discussions with parties around the aut we re about to we ll be locking down those numbers as we move forward but about half of the 60 million increase that we re roughly forecasting is directly related to higher load and so that s a good variance and we couldn t be more pleased with the expansion that we re seeing in the industrial commercial sector as well as with customer growth as people are still moving into our service territory into oregon and then we re seeing about the other half related to either de risking the portfolio with capacity and making sure that we have adequate reserves going into the year and then also just higher prices that are reflected one of the things that i m really pleased is our hedging strategy with regards to natural gas which has been in place for almost a decade and is really meaning that our customers are not experiencing the volatility of natural gas prices and so it s nice to see when these practices make a bottom line difference to every bill we send out to our customers and we re able to insulate them from some of the volatility that we re seeing across markets in the energy space david peters wolfe research analyst great no thank you for that detail second question i had just back to the rate case we saw staff s testimony earlier this week and obviously a big delta versus your guys ask which i don t think is inconsistent with history but could you maybe just comment on what you saw in there understanding that you think there s still a good chance of settlement and then just chances on getting some of those proposed changes approved around the storm accrual and decoupling jim ajello chief financial officer yes dave i ll start and maria may want to add to it you re right i mean i appreciate your comment not inconsistent with history we don t overreact to these things either these are the kinds of things that happen in cases like this i will tell you that i think we should pursue the grc in all of its detail we desire to get to a settlement but the deferrals are on separate tracks in separate dockets and therefore should be separated from the case and that s our view and that s the way it s set up to go forward here and as you know the settlement prospects here are always something that we try to do and we will deal with the deferrals in due course but they ll be on a separate track maria m pope president and chief executive officer yes i don t think i have anything to add we ll work collaboratively with parties we ll be transparent and i think help everyone understand the magnitude of the past year to 18 months and the good work that we have done to address the issues that mother nature has brought us to create a more reliable and resilient utility as we go forward david peters wolfe research analyst all right thank you guys jim ajello chief financial officer thank you maria m pope president and chief executive officer thank you operator thank you our next question comes from the line of shah pourreza from guggenheim partners your question please shah pourreza guggenheim partners analyst hey good morning guys maria m pope president and chief executive officer good morning shah shah pourreza guggenheim partners analyst maybe just starting at a higher level you guys obviously laid out some pretty substantial energy and capacity needs through 2030 and i understand it won t necessarily all be utility owned as maria obviously you highlighted in the prepared remarks but how should we sort of think about maybe this opportunity in the context of your guided 4 to 6 growth in the past we ve talked about the current rfp pushing you higher in that range so with the size of the overall need be enough to get you to consider maybe guiding even higher jim ajello chief financial officer shah it s jim good morning so i will tell you our setup for the guidance range here is not including any generation facilities that we may be fortunate enough to compete and win for in this next round in fact i would anticipate a couple of irps in this decade maybe two or three and successive calls for more resources we ve recently upped our expectations and we ve been encouraged to up our expectations given the march that we re on here so just to make it clear none of that ownership would be in the 4 to 6 and also let s not forget here we re backing out as soon as practicable our interest in the colstrip plant right and we have accelerated depreciation that s been agreed to it still needs to be approved finally by the oregon puc in the context of this rate case but we have a settlement there to accelerate depreciation at 2025 so we re making a really strong pivot to a significant purchase and perhaps ownership program but in terms of ownership that s not in the guidance nor is the capital that we ve laid out to operate the system including any of the capital that we would need to build those assets shah pourreza guggenheim partners analyst got it so just i guess maybe just brings the follow up so is the current process is that supportive of how you guide as in extending the runway or could it actually be accretive maria m pope president and chief executive officer if i understand your question correctly any additional as jim mentioned any additional ownership opportunities through the irp should those be the least costly risk projects would be accretive to our 4 to 6 growth jim ajello chief financial officer yes for sure and you can expect shah that we will capitalize those appropriately but at the end of the day we ll be accretive sure shah pourreza guggenheim partners analyst okay okay that s thank you very much for that and then just on the rfp process right in the event you were successful when would you be looking to do associated equity and would you automatically be eligible for an associate rider for recovery or would you have to go back in front of the grc maria m pope president and chief executive officer so we do have a renewable adjustment mechanism that allows us to track in renewable energy so that s very favorable and it s a mechanism that we ve used on numerous occasion as most recently with the ridge energy facility jim ajello chief financial officer and i ll add shah that we wouldn t know about the award periods until probably the spring and early summer construction would take place design and construction would take place later that year into 2023 and 2024 so financing would happen in that timeframe and we have such a terrific liquidity position that we could leg into any ownership without immediately needing to go into the market for much in the way of financing certainly equity financing shah pourreza guggenheim partners analyst okay perfect that s all the questions i had thank you very much appreciate it jim ajello chief financial officer sure maria m pope president and chief executive officer thank you operator thank you our next question comes to the line of peter bourdon from mizuho your question please peter bourdon mizuho analyst hi thanks for taking my question just to follow up on the power cost side of things is there any more color you can give on what drove the volatility that you saw this quarter and then secondly what gives you comfort that that volatility is not i guess the new normal going forward thank you maria m pope president and chief executive officer sure well in the west and maybe even the rest of the country as you look at scorch trees all over the place i think it s really important that we recognize the high heat events that we had and so that created we were able to forecast those events but not too far out into the future we also had quite a bit less hydro power in the region and aligned with hydro power is actually wind generation as well and that created quite a bit of volatility in market prices throughout the west and those that we were exposed to i would say that we particularly saw run up before the day ahead markets would have some of the highest prices and then they would frequently would fall off during real in real time as we think about working across the west we ve seen additional liquidity as we re more integrated and i would say power and energy trading leaders are really looking at how we expand the integration and pooling of resources across the entire west whether that s through day ahead markets and the expansion of the eim with caiso whether that is through reliability discussions at the northwest power pool or whether that s through other forums where people are really looking at how we manage going forward we re fortunate to have these i walk through the ability to update our power costs and every year through the annual update mechanism so we were able to reflect the learnings year to year into our future power costs and the reality of these market conditions as you know we ve across the west have reduced a number of significant thermal plants and that s having an impact on as we get into scarce periods of time there are less resources in standby that could come back on to the market and as a result i think we ll continue to see volatility and we are learning and managing through it peter bourdon mizuho analyst okay thank you operator thank you our next question comes from the line of travis miller from morningstar your question please travis miller morningstar analyst good morning thank you you answered a lot of my questions you two i appreciate that i want to go back to the capex increase can you talk a little bit more about that what types of projects led you to increase that 2022 number and what was the factor or factors during the quarter the last three months that led you to raise that 100 million or so maria m pope president and chief executive officer so let me build a little bit travis on the answer i just gave to the prior question around reliability in markets one of the things that s also really important is a tool in our toolbox and i mentioned it in my prepared remarks was that being able to use essentially 25 of the capacity and sort of shock absorber of markets in the distribution system and so as we move forward we have accelerated our plans around our distributed resource plans whether that s ders could be solar battery storage electric vehicles and their ability to charge and create a buffer but also demand response programs we have had one of the most robust energy conservation programs in the country in fact we lead in those areas and so all of this together combined with the infrastructure that needs to support a really smart flexible grid as we integrate more renewables and try and reduce the impact of volatility is important it s not just important to pricing it s important to overall reliability i ll let jim talk to you a little bit more about the specific buckets of capital that we have but please know that we re moving quickly to reflect the new realities of our markets and the need for greater sustainability and a carbon free future jim ajello chief financial officer hey travis i ll add that largely we don t think of capex as something that is temporal in the short term we think of it as a long term matter so just looking at the 2022 the reference to the higher capex at 655 versus 550 so largely that s 65 in fact grid related just to prove the point that maria was making about 25 million of that really is from our integrated operations center which we re finishing up we re adding some facilities out there that s about a 200 plus million investment a little bit of that carries over into the new year 2022 we ve got some work on the generation side as you would imagine as everyone would have maintenance capex there and then we re investing a great deal in technology that s the other chunk or part of that digitization more customer service activities improved work into flow and how we manage massive amounts of data that we re collecting some of our systems are older need to be replaced operating systems administrative systems and what have you so and then as you look to the out years 2023 to 2025 again those exclude as does anything in 2022 the generation that we may build it s largely grid related work you could really see the technology investments continuing the 85 million but then it s close to 400 million in all of the topics that maria just mentioned so it s really about grid and resiliency other than any generation which is not included here travis miller morningstar analyst okay great that s helpful now one higher level question obviously you ve talked about a lot of capacity needs relative to the energy needs how do you think about capacity in 80 carbon reduction world or even 100 clean energy world these days we typically think about capacity as a fossil fuel source type of resource maria m pope president and chief executive officer so we start out blessed to be at the pacific northwest where overall hydro generation makes up about 50 55 of the generation in the region so i think it s important to acknowledge that we have a natural competitive advantage from that standpoint and much of that in addition is low cost we also do have capacity factor from both wind and solar and the diversity of being able to use those combined and then in adding battery storage and our wheatridge facility is a great example of not only that since it combines all three of those technologies in its scale but it also better utilizes a very scarce resource of transmission so that s important i would also say i ve mentioned about being able to use the distribution system as a shock absorber and really a source of capacity across our area and that will grow very rapidly and is a really important component for us i would also say that we have a number of partnerships we ve announced partnership with douglas pud one of the hydro operators on the mid sea we provide energy services they provide capacity to us and you can see a renewal of a contract we have with the various tribes of the warm springs along those same lines on the deschutes river as well as many others we take what i would call and all and above set of solutions including all of the integrated aspects of west wide markets and the need to move much faster and accelerate the pace of change across the entire west so it s an exciting time if these are challenging problems i don t want to under estimate or sound as if we have all the answers we re going to be learning and growing through this with every year and it really is going to be the challenge of the next decade around reliable sources of capacity that supports ever increasing uses of electricity and we re excited to be leading in this clean energy future jim ajello chief financial officer yes travis i ll just wind up here by saying that in the 2021 rfp that we re talking about launching here in the near term about 375 megawatts of non emitting capacity as being called for and i m going to be very interested to see how battery technology in the cost curves show up in terms of that auction i can t prejudge it right now but that s a pretty big purchase for a system of this size so we ll see where that goes and it may not only be batteries but the sense we have from the market is that they will show up and of course pricing will be very important travis miller morningstar analyst yes indeed thank you very much that s very helpful appreciate it maria m pope president and chief executive officer thank you operator thank you our next question comes from the line of andrew levi from hite hedge your question please andrew levi hite hedge analyst hey guys how are you maria m pope president and chief executive officer good morning andrew levi hite hedge analyst couple of questions first on kind of what s going on in congress in direct pay i see you guys are kind of familiar with that and looked at that is that correct maria m pope president and chief executive officer yes andrew levi hite hedge analyst okay before i ask my question so how does that kind of play in so assuming you win a portion of this capacity that s needed i guess that s both good for you guys for the rate payers it brings in more cash immediately it maybe affects rate base a little bit as well but if what you re saying is the situation where you may need to issue some equity eventually to pay for this capacity additions how would that kind of offset that equity need and maybe change your outlook as far as growth and then additionally i would think it would also make you more competitive as a bidder for these assets by being able to use something like that in your calculations maria m pope president and chief executive officer so andy first of all thank you for the question and you re absolutely right our ability to deploy all of the tools that we have whether it be tax equity whether it be through ptcs itcs direct pay grants from department of energy as i mentioned we received a grant for some projects in our distribution system targeting low income areas all of these things are incredibly important tools as we deliver cost effective renewable and reliable energy to our customers what we call of here is leveling the playing field but it s really important that customers do not see price shocks and that we re able to use all of these tools competitively and effectively for our service territory the state of oregon and all the customers that we serve there s no question that direct pay would offset needs for equity and give us more optionality as we move forward as with many other aspects in the reconciliation plan as well as all of the tax issues still being worked out jim ajello chief financial officer i m a fan of the direct pay ptc andy because well i think it s probably pretty obvious but it s a significant gain for our customers a significant gain for the company the thing that i would add to maria s explanation is that this could help us eliminate some of the unutilized credits that we have carrying forward right so you d have more efficiency in that regard as well so the cash benefits the cash flow the lack or the lessened equity requirements are all benefits and i hope we get that just to be honest andrew levi hite hedge analyst okay and then kind of continuing on then you have this like regulatory structural regulatory lag that s a fairly fixed cost if i m not mistaken it doesn t really grow a lot as far as the actual cost of the lag so as your rate base grows by definition that lag especially if you end up adding significant capacity in capex that lag theoretically should shrink shouldn t it jim ajello chief financial officer yes absolutely right and yet another reason why we re benefiting from the growth in our territory that sort of growth should benefit us in a number of ways including that lag right as you know i mean the opuc calculates our equity turns differently than we would from an accounting standpoint we punch over nine percent on an accounting standpoint so we do relatively well i think with investors in terms of the allowed roe of course they take out the short term debt here so we actually have a bit higher ratio on equity as calculated by opuc standards than we would on an accounting basis but our returns are better on an accounting basis there but you re right it s the concept of spreading those expenses over a larger base that s fundamentally right maria m pope president and chief executive officer it also reduces the volatility as you have a larger more stable base to start with andrew levi hite hedge analyst got it and one last question so as benefits kind of circling back to the beginning so just on the pcam so your strategy as far as kind of eliminating that risk for both the shareholder and for the rate payer is by adding this capacity over time and whether it s whether you own it or you contract for that obviously will help on the volatility especially if you get extreme weather but i m just curious just for 2023 or 2022 excuse me i m jumping ahead and every year matters to me as i get older so i should take my time here but as far i think that s where all of us but for 2022 again without divulging anything that you may not want to divulge as far as how you re going to go into the market what s kind of the strategy as far as trying to eliminate if we got extreme weather again we don t know what the weather s going to be but to try to eliminate some of that volatility into next year for both the shareholder and customer maria m pope president and chief executive officer yes well so first of all we take what i call sort of an all and above set of strategies and really it starts with how we run our generation facilities and ensuring that they are 100 reliable during the most challenging days of the year the next is how we integrate those generation facilities across our power operations area and ensuring that we have the right amount of capacity procured and the right reserve margins for the increased volatility that we are seeing as we move forward and clearly all of those things and we ve taken actions on we also have adjusted and worked with parties and the commission are modeling techniques to make sure that our modeling is reflecting the current market reality of having less quite frankly thermal resources that can just be turned on and off and so those things are really important as we look farther out better integration of renewables into our distribution system and so we have accelerated in 2020 starting now and through 2022 and 2023 our distributed resource plan and that s really important to be able to use the distribution system essentially as a circuit breaker and a source of generation and we found that this was particularly helpful during the high heat dome event where we were able to move around some of our distributed resources in the system as well as manage transformer outages and others and really measure reliability at that time and then finally working with all of our utilities across the west to ensure that we re working on day head markets we re working on further integration and other areas around reliability and then finally looking at all the way down to assessing rtos and other mechanisms that will help us move forward so we re taking a layered approach starting with ourselves and corrective actions we can do things that we can do that are new and different using technology and then things that we can deal with through partnerships and others so i hope that this is really important work and it is unique work of a regulated utility and we re fortunate to be vertically integrated and to be able to serve our customers there s no question that our customers want ever increasing amounts of clean energy but they re not going to trade off costs and reliability jim ajello chief financial officer and we learned a lot this summer from the extreme conditions that we found ourselves in our system worked very well generation as well as the t d system very limited impacts on the customer so i think we were battle tested in that regard but at the same time those more extreme conditions i think someone said it earlier on the call are those the new normal or not and we don t know and i won t say much more than this we ve already prepared very well for next summer in terms of our positioning and i think we re going to be extremely well prepared as we go into this season next year andrew levi hite hedge analyst that s terrific and yes i mean the main thing is you kept the lights on which is the most important thing jim ajello chief financial officer yes i was very proud i was very proud of the group both on the generation side and the t d side under extreme very extreme conditions maria m pope president and chief executive officer and each point in time whether it be fires or ice storms or heat domes or whatnot we are rapidly iterating and learning faster than we ever have before andrew levi hite hedge analyst okay thank you very much i know i get it i ve taken enough time and it s like 12 05 and people probably want to go have lunch but i ll see you guys down nice to see you in person and we don t have to worry about the need buttons so it ll all be good operator thank you our next question comes from the line brian russo from sidoti your question please brian russo sidoti analyst yes hi just curious when you set the aut and the net variable power costs do you assume normal hydro condition or do you utilize noaa forecasts when setting that and when is the actual date in which the aut is set maria m pope president and chief executive officer so we use a long standing hydro forecast and sometimes we re a little bit above them sometimes we re below them those hydro forecasts go back decades and believe it or not but in the early part of the 1930s and 1940s and i have to go back and look at the exact date we had tremendous droughts across the west so that data is actually reflected in the hydro forecast as well and then for the wind forecast which is just as important we use five year rolling averages and we ve had pretty tough wind conditions as well so that s reflected in the history that s used all of that data also goes into how the market is pricing both electricity and gas and that those prices are trued up and that we will in the next couple days and weeks we ll be setting the aut and then that will be what we ll use for 2022 combined with the new modeling that we ve worked together on with the parties brian russo sidoti analyst right because i know that the forecasts are for wet and cold weather in the pacific northwest and i was wondering if that s captured in the tariff or if that creates the benefit that you potentially retain under the pcam maria m pope president and chief executive officer so the current weather conditions or the current forecast is not necessarily used and how we are setting we use it goes into the calculations of the longer term or in the case of wind five year averages and i can tell you it if we are expecting a full year of wet and cold weather we are off to a good start in that instance and that will be very helpful for hydro conditions as well as restocking not only reservoirs but also in some instances the water table so all of that is good and will be a benefit this next year i would also note that with those wet and cold temperatures also comes a lot of wind that not only helps with energy generation but can create additional outages and so that sometimes is a negative hit to our t d costs so we can see whether go both ways and it s one of the reasons that we re hardening our system so that we can reduce outages especially as people continue to work at home and kids are sometimes going to school still at home making sure that our reliability is higher than ever brian russo sidoti analyst understood and then just real quickly on ev infrastructure is that a sizable investment opportunity in addition to owning building or owning more supply for your portfolio maria m pope president and chief executive officer sure so first of all from a legislative enabling standpoint we ve got great decisions on the books in supportive utility infrastructure to accelerate the pace of electric vehicle adoption whether it is infrastructure that s needed within our systems transformers substations lines whether it is make ready so the additional cabling and infrastructure to get to the charging stations or whether it s the charging stations themselves it s very clear that the state of oregon and the commission expect the portland general to be at a leader and an enabler in clean transportation and so we see it as a tremendous opportunity it ll obviously is smaller skies now but will increase substantially with each year and the forecast for electric vehicles are very high and oregon has some of the highest penetration highest amounts of electric vehicles already to start with but the other is that the more electric vehicles there are the more sort of off peak period of charging we can do which enhances reliability lowers cost for customers overall and so we see it as really a synergistic sort of goodness for the entire system as we move forward not only is it a cleaner environment better reliability but also we re able to lower costs as electricity as the fuel is less expensive than fossil fuel brian russo sidoti analyst right it ll show up in load growth i would say tending in the second half of the decade here but starting to ascend in the next couple of years in addition to the capex implication so i think there s goodness on both sides there ll be additional capex to support as maria said but also i would estimate more and more load growth coming out of that as we get to the second half of the decade maria m pope president and chief executive officer we see each electric vehicle essentially equivalent to a new residential customer brian russo sidoti analyst okay great thank you very much operator thank you our final question for today comes from the line of paul patterson from glenrock associates your question please paul patterson glenrock associates analyst hey how you guys doing jim ajello chief financial officer good paul how you been paul patterson glenrock associates analyst right it s been a while since i ve talked to you jim and so listen so much of my questions have been answered just i really appreciate your comments maria about your focus on customer costs etc and i was just a little surprised and maybe you can sort of explain if you can the disconnect in the staff testimony which seems to highlight right upfront that they re concerned that there is some sort of trade off between this and an environmental focus at least that they seem to be somewhat concerned about that and i m just wondering if you could sort of explain where you think they might be coming from or if this is a communications issue or what do you think because i know you guys are just the opposite or at least that s my impression maria m pope president and chief executive officer so first of all i don t think i m going to take a stab at where staff s coming from i would reiterate all the comments that jim has made that we work collaboratively together they re the regulators we re the regulated we as a company are really proud of the investments we have made i believe we got it right in terms of seeing the future and the increased volatility the pressure on reliability and we have been investing to be able to weather the storms that come at us whether it s high heat or ice or whatnot and to be able to deliver affordable reliable energy to our customers that is increasing like carbon free and if you look at the overall price increases that we have proposed they re quite modest and it s really hats off to everyone who works at portland general day in and day out at driving efficiency across our system better use of technology on digital solutions of putting the customer first in everything that we do and i m really proud that we were able to keep our customer prices as low as we ve proposed in the general rate case and that we were able to hold off on our rate case during the worst days of the pandemic so i think there s a lot of goodness between our filing and we look forward to working collaboratively with parties as we move forward paul patterson glenrock associates analyst sure but sort of outside the context of the rate case itself and the back and forth and what have you on that is there sort of when you guys are making and you guys are forward thinking and you re looking at all this are there ways perhaps of using technology and renewables to actually lower cost for customers or i mean do you see any of these things as perhaps being from a sort of a cost reduction perspective perhaps in terms of delivering this i mean in other words it seemed to me from reading it that they felt that there was some sort of trade off at least in terms of focus and that s why i was sort of that s what i sort of just warning strategically speaking just in general how should we think of that when you re looking at all of this or is it just look if we re going to be going green we re going to have to pay a lot more for it you follow what i m saying maria m pope president and chief executive officer no i don t believe we re going to have to pay a lot more for it but i do think we re going to need to be smarter we re going to need to use technology in different ways we re going to need to be integrated with partners not only in our distribution system many of whom are our customers but also across the west and you can see that continually through the work that we have done to keep our costs low renewable energy today new renewable energy in most instances cost less than a new thermal operations but it s kind of create additional challenges around technology i m really pleased that we ve gotten after our distributed resource systems we have an adms system that s just about to go live and we will continue focusing in on the technologies that will allow us to reduce cost for customers and the renewable energy that we are taking on this is a huge transition and we re all learning together and we re going to be transparent and collaborative paul patterson glenrock associates analyst okay thanks so much i appreciate it have a great one take care maria m pope president and chief executive officer thank you jim ajello chief financial officer thanks paul take care maria m pope president and chief executive officer thank you very much for operator and this does conclude the question and answer session of today s program i d like to hand the program back to maria pope for any further remarks maria m pope president and chief executive officer great thank you all for joining us today and for those of us that we will see at the eei financial conference in just a couple of weeks or 10 days we appreciate your interest in portland general and we hope to connect with you in the future thank you

organic revenue growth in the quarter including a core growth rate of 8 5 and covid tailwinds of approximately 1 7 the covid tailwinds were principally driven by our vaccine related offerings in addition to delivering double digit organic top line results we grew adjusted ebitda nearly 26 resulting in ebitda margin expansion of approximately 180 basis points adjusted eps grew 48 to 0 35 per share in september we announced a definitive agreement to acquire masterflex a leading global manufacturer of peristaltic pumps and aseptic single use fluid transfer technologies expanding our proprietary single use offering for bioproduction we have since received all required regulatory clearances have secured the necessary financing and intend to close the transaction in short order i will share more details about the transaction in a moment we are committed to our role as a leader in life changing science and remain focused on driving innovation and growth with investments in capabilities and capacity this quarter we advanced several expansion initiatives including our production capabilities for key chemicals used in upstream and downstream applications in the bioproduction workflow we also advanced our hydration expansion strategy and recently opened a new european single use facility in the netherlands additionally demonstrating our commitment to helping scientists realize the potential of breakthroughs through innovation we announced a commercial agreement with oxford nanopore technologies a market leading manufacturer of next generation sequencing instruments kits and consumables the agreement combines the breadth and depth of avantor s global laboratory customer relationships across all of our end markets with the sequencing technology from

finalizing our 2022 operating plan and anticipate delivering another outstanding year in line with our long term targets we will share more details with you as part of our fourth quarter earnings call early next year moving on to slide four i d like to reiterate some of the highlights from our recent announcement about our pending acquisition of masterflex masterflex will further strengthen our single use offering for the high growth biopharma end market for more than 50 years masterflex has been providing industry leading fluid transfer technologies that play a central role in biopharma research and production workflows masterflex s technologies are relevant across all established and emerging biopharma platforms including monoclonal antibodies cell and gene therapy and mrna and support both vaccine and therapy manufacturing including covid 19 more than 80 of masterflex s revenue is concentrated in biopharma giving us access to a 5 billion addressable market that is growing high double digits and provides us a fully integrated solution for managing aseptic fluid transfer throughout the bioproduction workflow the single use fluid transfer space is an area of significant growth for avantor supported by the expansion of our facilities and our previously announced acquisition of rim bio our single use platform has been a key organic revenue driver of bioproduction sales to date and we see this acquisition as a further accelerator of our overall organic revenue growth rate this transaction meets both our qualitative and quantitative acquisition criteria and is a great example of our m a strategy in action our customers will benefit from our fully integrated aseptic fluid transfer solution throughout the bioproduction workflow and our financial profile will be enhanced by masterflex s double digit revenue growth and proprietary gross margins as i mentioned we expect to close this transaction in short order and are looking forward to welcoming the masterflex team to the avantor family turning to slide five i d like to summarize our third quarter financial results revenues increased 10 2 on an organic basis and 14 3 on a reported basis including the impacts of foreign currency exchange tailwinds in the ritter and rim bio acquisitions all regions and all product groups experienced strong organic growth overall performance was driven by our biopharma end market growing high teens with nearly 26 growth in bioproduction we also experienced high single digit growth in the advanced technologies and applied materials end market for the second consecutive quarter covid tailwinds contributed about 1 7 to our organic growth with the largest driver being proprietary materials and consumables sales to support the production of covid 19 vaccines as expected aggregate covid tailwind contributions declined sequentially reflecting a decline in revenues from diagnostic testing we continue to expect covid 19 tailwinds of around 400 million for the full year compared to approximately 250 million to 300 million in 2020 adjusted ebitda in the quarter was up 26 reflecting strong top line growth favorable mix including nearly 20 growth in sales of proprietary materials and consumables and outstanding execution enabled by the avantor business system despite ongoing inflation in excess of historical trends across a number of cost categories including raw materials third party products transportation and wages we leveraged our abs toolkit to expand ebitda margin by approximately 180 basis points adjusted earnings per share grew more than 48 reflecting the strong ebitda growth along with lower interest expense and a lower income tax rate we generated 229 3 million in free cash flow in the quarter more than 100 of adjusted net income while at the same time doubling our capex investment over the prior year to support our growth initiatives our adjusted net leverage ended at 3 5 times adjusted ebitda down 0 3 times from the second quarter reflecting our strong cash flow and sustained traction in deleveraging the funding of the masterflex transaction will obviously increase leverage in the fourth quarter but we fully expect that our strong cash flow profile will have us within our targeted leverage range of two times to four times adjusted ebitda by the end of 2022 in summary our third quarter financial results reflect the strength and relevance of our portfolio our integrated offering and exposure to the biopharma space and our unwavering focus on execution supported by the avantor business system i am proud of our team for delivering another strong quarter and confident in our outlook for the fourth quarter and beyond with that let me turn it over to tom to walk you through our results in more detail thomas a szlosek executive vice president and chief financial officer thank you michael and good morning everyone i m starting on slide six as michael noted organic growth was 10 2 this quarter leading to year to date organic growth of approximately 15 our core organic growth rate meaning organic growth less the estimated covid tailwind was nearly 9 and improved nicely from the approximate 2 core organic growth rate in the third quarter of 2020 proprietary materials and consumables grew nearly three times the rate of third party materials and consumables which as you know drives a favorable margin mix for the enterprise from a regional perspective americas which represents approximately 60 of annual global sales achieved 9 1 organic revenue growth driven by double digit sales growth in biopharma production offerings lab consumables biomaterials and procurement services biopharma production sales grew about 30 in the americas driven by sales of chemicals and single use consumables including those to support covid 19 vaccine we also achieved record sales of proprietary silicone formulations for our biomaterials platform as demand for elective procedures fully recovered in the quarter europe which represents approximately 35 of annual global sales achieved 10 9 organic revenue growth driven by double digit growth in lab consumables biopharma production offerings and biomaterials growth in covid vaccine related revenues were offset by anticipated declines in revenue from diagnostic testing resulting in limited net covid tailwinds in the quarter emea representing approximately 5 of annual global sales achieved 16 4 organic revenue growth which included a modest offset from covid headwinds growth was driven by especially strong demand for our proprietary offerings in bioproduction and semiconductor manufacturing let s move to slide seven which shows our organic revenue growth by end market and product group for the quarter biopharma representing approximately 50 of our annual revenue experienced high teens organic growth in the third quarter including roughly 26 organic growth in bioproduction driven by exceptional growth in single use consumables as well as double digit growth in production chemicals demand patterns continue to be impressive and open orders in biopharma production are now 65 higher than the beginning of the year on the research side the biopharma end market grew in the mid teens driven by lab consumables and supported by customer reopening healthcare which represents approximately 10 of our annual revenue experienced mid single digit organic revenue growth driven by a record demand for our medical grade silicone offering in the elective surgical market offset by lower covid diagnostics testing sale education and government representing approximately 15 of our annual revenue experienced low single digit organic revenue declines in the third quarter our education market experienced a low single digit growth driven by ongoing recovery in university research labs and k 12 activities government sales declined double digits on lower sales of covid related test kits and personal protective equipment advanced technologies and applied materials representing approximately 25 of our annual revenue achieved high single digit organic revenue growth driven by broad based growth in lab products sold for research and qa qc especially in europe and emea and in proprietary chemical formulations for semiconductor manufacturing by product group as i mentioned earlier our proprietary materials and consumables offerings achieved high teens organic revenue growth driven by strong demand for our biopharma production materials and single use consumables as well as by our biomaterials and electronic chemicals platforms we also achieved double digit growth in our equipment and instrumentation portfolio with good growth in both americas and europe against a favorable prior year comparison services had a mid single digit growth quarter driven by strong global lab and production services let me turn to slide eight for key financial performance metrics we achieved approximately 26 growth in adjusted ebitda and 180 basis points of margin expansion to 19 6 from 17 8 in the comparable prior period the margin rate expansion was driven almost entirely by gross margins which expanded to 33 6 we continue to generate strong productivity sound inflation management and a favorable mix as our higher margin proprietary materials and consumables once again achieved superior growth rates relative to those of our third party materials and consumables adjusted earnings per share were 0 35 up 48 reflecting ongoing operating performance and reduction in interest expense from our deleveraging and debt refinancing and reprising activity although our income tax expense was higher than the prior year we did have an effective tax rate of approximately 19 in the quarter reflecting a catch up to the now expected 22 rate for the full year driven by the impact of higher than expected deductions as well as u s tax credit planning our tax rate for the full year was previously expected to be 23 free cash flow a non gaap financial measure which we define as cash from operations excluding onetime acquisition costs less capital expenditures was 229 million compared to 266 million in the comparable prior period the decline was driven by higher cash taxes reflecting higher income and the expiry of cares act provisions working capital investments to support our growth and more than 30 million in capital expenditures in the quarter mostly related to growth driven initiatives more than double the 2020 capex we continue to forecast 850 million of free cash flow for the full year moving to slide nine as michael indicated we are raising our guidance for the year to reflect strong year to date performance stable core end markets and confidence in the fourth quarter outlook this represents our third raise to the annual guidance this year we now expect organic sales growth of approximately 10 to 11 for 2021 which includes approximately 2 from covid 19 tailwinds we continue to expect roughly 400 million in covid related revenue for the full year which includes modest covid 19 organic revenue headwinds in the fourth quarter which are expected to continue into 2022 the evolution over the course of the year to a higher proportion of vaccine related tailwinds and a lower proportion of diagnostic testing tailwinds has also played out as expected layering in projected impact from m a of approximately 2 5 and from fx of approximately 2 we are estimating total reported growth of approximately 14 5 to 15 5 for the full year we re increasing our full year adjusted ebitda margin expansion guidance from 150 basis points to more than 170 basis points reflecting our strong year to date results continued core business momentum and a modest benefit from masterflex the margin accretion from ritter was already reflected in prior guidance we now anticipate adjusted earnings per share growth of approximately 55 up from our previous guidance of approximately 50 this new eps growth estimate incorporates the impact from m a including masterflex and an incrementally lower income tax rate offset by higher interest expense and a slightly stronger u s dollar adversely impacting foreign currency translation we are maintaining our full year free cash flow guidance of approximately 850 million which we raised at the end of the second quarter by 50 million we expect the ebitda upside reflected in our earnings and free cash flow guidance to be offset by higher investments in working capital and capital expenditures to support our growth initiatives one final comment regarding leverage as noted earlier in the presentation we ended the third quarter at 3 5 times adjusted ebitda an improvement from 3 8 times at the end of the second quarter the net debt in the 3 5 times adjusted ebitda calculation conservatively excludes the 967 million in net proceeds we received from the masterflex related equity issuance in september upon the close of the masterflex transaction we expect leverage to be approximately 4 7 times adjusted ebitda we are confident in the attractive cash generation capability of our business model and are committed to be within our targeted two to four time adjusted ebitda leverage range in 2022 this concludes my prepared remarks i ll now hand the call back over to michael michael stubblefield president and chief executive officer thanks tom i m now on slide 10 the relevance of avantor s business model and the importance of our mission of setting science in motion to create a better world is evident in our strong year to date performance and the overall momentum in our core business we continue to execute well as evidenced by our margin expansion eps growth and free cash flow results we remain committed to our growth strategy including the ongoing integration of ritter and rim bio and soon masterflex we will continue to focus on biopharma as a key growth driver for our company and will support our customers and ongoing investments in manufacturing capacity we re also committed to advancing our sustainability initiatives through our science for goodness platform as we look ahead we are well positioned for continued growth across each of our end markets and expect to deliver another solid year in 2022 the role of avantor s products and services in enabling scientific breakthroughs has never been more important i want to thank you for your interest in avantor and for your ongoing support i will now turn it over to the operator to begin the question and answer portion of our call questions and answers operator thank you your first question is from the line of tycho peterson from jpmorgan your line is now open tycho peterson jpmorgan analyst hey good morning tom i d like to start with the ebitda margin expansion which was certainly impressive you talked about inflation management can you maybe just talk on how much of that gross margin expansion which drove most of it was from pricing versus mix and maybe some of the productivity initiatives thomas a szlosek executive vice president and chief financial officer yes tycho thanks for the question and i think you re referring to the growth in the ebitda margins as we said about 180 basis points most of which as we said came from gross margin expansion it was an equal mix we had a very a mix as we said on there it s a combination of three different items the favorable proprietary mix continues to be a nice driver for us as we said the growth in our proprietary products was almost three times the growth in third party products and that s not to say the growth of third party products with chevy it was mid single digits as well so it was overall mixing favorably on the sales mix secondly was you had a strong commercial impact of managing price over cogs that did contribute to the margin accretion so of course cogs and inflationary impacts did have a modest impact but commercially and through other means we were able to offset that and the third thing was just our ongoing productivity initiatives which includes the leverage that we get from the additional volume i d say those three factors were equally weighted in the margin accretion on gross margin tycho peterson jpmorgan analyst okay are you able to quantify what the pricing contribution was i mean i guess obviously with all the input costs going up resin costs etc are you able to kind of how much of that are you able to pass on to customers or have you gotten more aggressive on pricing is kind of the spirit of the question thomas a szlosek executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah i think the if you look at our history over the years we ve both in the proprietary business as well as the third party business strong acumen in doing and managing the balance between the inflation we experienced in our product or in our cost against the commercial pricing that we have and this quarter was no different i mean in fact you talked about inflation since start of the quarter we ve been experiencing inflation and for that matter some supply chain challenges so it s not as if it s suddenly emerged on the scene for us in the last quarter or so and so i d say the cadence that we have has continued to work even with the modest uptick here in this quarter and i wouldn t say that the overall impact was of pricing over cogs inflation was materially different than it s been in any quarter in the past in terms of its contribution to gross margin tycho peterson jpmorgan analyst okay and then for michael just curious if you could comment on ritter and rim performance i know m a was 3 to 3 2 or so for the quarter but how has the integration gone in those two and then separately on o t you noted launching a handheld scanner a sequencer i m just curious to hear a little bit more about the strategy around that thanks michael stubblefield president and chief executive officer thanks tycho obviously early days for both the rim and ritter acquisitions integrations on both fronts are going as expected so i think we ve got a pretty low playbook by now for driving integrations of these acquisitions and certainly excited by the momentum we have in integrating the new capabilities into our channel and presenting those offerings to our customers in the quarter i think both expected roughly in line with our expectations with perhaps a similar trend in the covid exposure which is somewhat modest for ritter as in our own business as we saw somewhat of a sequential decline in revenues into covid related applications for ritter but the german business is performing ahead of plan we re excited about the momentum we have in positioning those products in our channel similar to our other proprietary offerings these are specification driven products which require our customers to qualify these products into their processes and applications and our teams are busy in sampling and qualifying these opportunities and we have a pretty full pipeline that we re working on so pretty excited about where we re at with both of those acquisitions tycho peterson jpmorgan analyst the second thing o t michael stubblefield president and chief executive officer the second question o t i think it s just another great reflection of the power of our channel and the opportunity it gives our third party partners to see their innovations through our channel obviously there s a lot of excitement around this the technology and being able to do sequencing on the desktop which represents a remarkable step forward from an innovation and technology standpoint and given the access that we have to labs around the world once again showing the power of our model and the interest of our partners in leveraging our access to seed their content through our channel alongside the rest of our capabilities and we ve had tremendous uptick in the early days of that launch through our channel and we highlighted really just as another example of our focus on innovation and whether it s our own internal r d or innovation that we bring to the market from our partners just the important role that we play in the innovation ecosystem and bringing relevant technologies to our customers tycho peterson jpmorgan analyst understood thank you operator your next question is from the line of derik de bruin from bank of america your line is now open derik de bruin bank of america analyst hey good morning michael stubblefield president and chief executive officer hi derik derik de bruin bank of america analyst hey so if you could i know you re not giving specific 2022 guidance but could you just clarify something when you mentioned that your 2022 plans underway you expect it to be in line with long term objectives when you think about that 4 to 6 target put out there is that is looking at 2022 is that going to be inclusive of covid or is that just the base business because we re expecting covid to be down in 2022 your covid contribution be down 2022 versus 2021 so love some clarification on that michael stubblefield president and chief executive officer good place to start i think the way you re thinking about it is spot on as we talked about at investor day we expect next year to be in line with our long term targets of mid single digits and that would be inclusive of the covid headwinds that we would expect next year we ll get more specific when we do the guide in january but i think probably not a bad way to model at a roughly 2 headwind for covid in our business next year and that would be reflective of ongoing durability of the vaccine revenues that we enjoy today and sequential downturn decline in contributions from ppe and diagnostics and in our mid single digit outlook we feel confident that we can absorb the headwinds that this would reflect and deliver against our long term targets for next year but we ll get a little bit more specific for you as we move into one derik de bruin bank of america analyst great that s pretty bullish along those lines i mean you having any issues with supply chains or just your customers not your suppliers having issues delivering like that are there any shortages or weaknesses in the channel michael stubblefield president and chief executive officer derik i d say that there are but i wouldn t necessarily say that they are any different or more acute than we ve seen throughout the year and it seems to move from different categories we re certainly seeing some improvements in things like ppe availability and some of the plastic wear that has been short for the better part of 18 months we re starting to see some improvements in availability of supply in some of those categories some of the other categories like some of the residents for example that go into some of the single use offerings which have been persistently growing well into the high double digit levels continue to be constrained so it s a bit of a balance but i wouldn t say it s much different than we ve experienced throughout the year and the teams are doing a great job managing through that leveraging the abs toolkit problem solve on a real time basis and keep things moving but certainly there are constraints and whether they re product availability or certainly some of the labor constraints that everyone is facing in the us those are certainly in our business today but not at any different levels than we ve seen from previous quarters derik de bruin bank of america analyst great and then just one housekeeping question for tom what s the what are your expectations on share count for q4 full year just given the equity raise thomas a szlosek executive vice president and chief financial officer yes as you know from the equity raise that we did in mid september related to the masterflex transaction which raised roughly 1 billion at 42 share price the shares that came with that including the exercise of the green shoot because we were oversubscribed by about five times on the offering but came in about 23 million 24 million shares on that so as we reset 2022 derik what we re going to do is reset this adjusted share count as you know we ve been we ve conservatively maintained expanding number for the adjusted share count that includes the presumed conversion of our mandatory convertible preferred stock so even though the share count has averaged around 5 80 5 90 we ve for reporting purposes to all of you in our discussions have assumed the conversion of that mandatory convertible so that is what s behind the 6 42 that we ve used but we ll adjust the 6 42 to reflect the issuance of the shares from masterflex as well as other minor changes in share count that have happened of course you can always see the base outstanding shares the diluted outstanding shares on a gaap basis in our 10 q derik de bruin bank of america analyst thank you operator your next question is from the line of vijay kumar from evercore isi your line is now open vijay kumar evercore isi analyst hey guys congrats on the print and thanks for taking my question michael just to clarify on the prior question from derik the fiscal 2022 commentary was inclusive of two points of headwind from covid so the assumption is your base business for next year excluding covid is tracking or i shouldn t say tracking perhaps the expectation is high single digits michael stubblefield president and chief executive officer yeah happy to provide some clarification there vijay the mid single digit guide that we or target that we have outlined there at our investor day as we said then and reiterate again today certainly is inclusive of how we see covid playing out next year which would include roughly two points of headwind for us and i think consistent with how the business has been running over the last two or three years i think the growth that you re talking about there for the core business is in line with what we ve been delivering each of the last several years including this year so not a bad way to think about it vijay kumar evercore isi analyst got you so inclusive of covid headwinds we re probably at five so excluding headwinds somewhere around seven ish or the base one on the covid tailwinds itself can you remind us i know the prior range was 350 to 450 and now we re fine tuning into 400 what percentage is vaccine and what percentage is diagnostics and others for fiscal 2021 and so sorry and should vaccine tailwinds be higher in fiscal 2022 similar to your peers michael stubblefield president and chief executive officer yes so if you look at the mix that we ve been talking about i think it s playing out in line with what we ve described roughly 40 to 50 of our tailwinds are vaccine roughly 40 to 50 or diagnostic testing and then the balance is ppe and that is kind of the aggregate view across the year obviously as we move throughout the year the contribution from vaccines becomes the majority of the benefits that we re getting here and as we ve said before we expect that to be durable and continuing to increase as we move into next year both as production internally here ramps as we bring on some of our capacity expansion as well as just more capacity for vaccine production being available globally as we move forward and in line with our expectations diagnostic testing and ppe we would expect to continue to decline over time vijay kumar evercore isi analyst got you and tom just on the share count just to be clear what you re saying is base of 6 40 plus another 23 so that s around mid 60 6 65 something like that is that what you re pointing to on share count thomas a szlosek executive vice president and chief financial officer yes as you know vijay we ve used 6 42 since the ipo and since the ipo there have been other equity transactions minor ones like option exercises and restricted stock units that we haven t continued to update the 6 42 we ve kept it flat just for simplicity purposes but we ll be baseline the 6 42 to reflect the masterflex as well as to reflect any other transactions that have happened i mean i expect it to we ll cover in the earnings guidance call in late january early february vijay kumar evercore isi analyst thanks guys operator your next question is from the line of dan brennan from cowen your line is now open dan brennan cowen analyst thanks for taking the question just wanted to start off on biopharma particularly for bioproduction so obviously solid growth revenues and orders can you just give us a flavor for like ex covid what that number looks like both on the revenue and order side and just give us some color on what you re seeing in that business michael stubblefield president and chief executive officer yes you re correct in that so we continue to see great momentum in biopharma end market at the r d portion of our core business as well as at production and just to remind you biopharma is roughly 50 of our overall revenue and about two thirds of our revenue is captured in the r d space and we see continued momentum there as labs start to return to more normalized operations higher levels of activity driving strong growth in that part of the business then roughly one third of the platform is our offerings into bioproduction where we continue to see very very strong growth as is reflected in our prepared remarks just under 30 growth in the quarter with a very very strong order book order book continues to grow as we ve said in previous quarters we re sitting on roughly a year of open orders for that platform which is a bit unusual or quite unusual and it continues to grow day by day interestingly the makeup of that order book continues to be dominated by our core business i would say over 80 of the order book is in fact related to our offerings into our core monoclonal antibody cell and gene therapy business excluding covid so great momentum in both the core and obviously we re well positioned to capture the ongoing benefits of covid vaccine exposure but the business overall is quite healthy and contributing at a high level both organic revenue growth as well as margin expansion given the proprietary offerings that we have in the production portion of that platform thomas a szlosek executive vice president and chief financial officer and dan i would also add to what michael said if you look at the high teens growth for biopharma in the quarter two thirds of the growth was the base business and roughly a third was driven by covid dan brennan cowen analyst great thank you tom and maybe just one on kind of education and government obviously the government looks like it was under the pressures just given some of the covid kind of natural slowing on the education side just wondering what the outlook is there given the funding environment juxtapose against probably some near term pressure from lab access just as we re in the fourth quarter and we re looking ahead would that be a nice tailwind as we get into 2022 maybe as that lab pressure alleviates michael stubblefield president and chief executive officer so the education government portion of our business is approximately 15 of our revenue with two thirds of that being in education the other third being in government government was certainly a headwind for us really reflecting the strong covid related revenues we enjoyed in the prior year period for things like ppe and diagnostic testing that didn t repeat in this particular quarter on the education front while there s certainly some level of covid headwind on a year over year basis in the quarter reflected there we do see continued improvement in lab utilizations and at the university level contributing to what i characterize as kind of low single digit growth for that part of the platform and then in the science education portion of our business which is roughly 2 of that overall education and government platform continues to be a bit sluggish we haven t really seen much of a pickup this year in line with what we normally expect for curriculum deployment at k 12 districts across the united states so the next opportunity is probably there for that recovery will be going into next year but we re i think pleased with how things are developing in education portion of that business and the government portions they re running in some pretty tough comps just given the role that governments around the world played in deploying covid related offerings in prior year periods dan brennan cowen analyst great thanks michael just one housekeeping item just what s the base ex covid organic for 4q that s implicit in the new 10 or 11 full year range can you just give us that number just to make sure we re doing that right michael stubblefield president and chief executive officer yes for q4 i think it works out to correct me here tom but yes i was going to say 3 5 tailwind for the quarter thomas a szlosek executive vice president and chief financial officer you recall quarter of 2020 was close to our high mark in terms of covid related revenues as michael had mentioned while the vaccines continue to have durability and we ll have durability the next year the impact in the q4 starts to turn a bit because of the reduction in the peak of diagnostic testing as well as ppe usage dan brennan cowen analyst got it thank you operator your next question is from the line of jack meehan from nephron research your line is now open jack meehan nephron research analyst thank you good morning i wanted to start just get a little bit more color on ritter do you feel like they re still on track for 225 million of sales this year i look at the m a contribution of 50 million or so it was a little below what i was thinking and then one other ritter question it looks like most of the m a came in europe just thoughts on geographic expansion michael stubblefield president and chief executive officer yes great questions jack good to hear from you this morning as i mentioned responding to one of the earlier questions i think we continue to be very very excited about ritter obviously we re only a couple of months into the acquisition here and integration is going quite well i think if we go back to what we talked about at the announcement of that transaction relative to end market exposure we did acknowledge that there was a modest exposure to covid related applications in line with kind of the market exposure there somewhere in the 10 to 20 range and as we had modeled that at the time i think we had we probably would have anticipated that coming off perhaps in 2022 time period and i think it s as we ve got into the third quarter here it s come off a bit quicker than we had initially anticipated but the core of the business continues to run very strongly and it s enabled us to accelerate our synergy capture you might be able to devote more of the capacity toward providing samples and initial stocking volumes for customers in our channels so our teams are being very aggressive very energized about placing these products in the hands of our healthcare and biopharma customers around the world as i mentioned earlier these products are specification driven so you have kind of a multi month process of qualification in sampling before you can start to appreciably ramp the synergies at commercial quantities and so the what you re seeing there in the third quarter is really reflective of kind of the legacy business and over time you should start to see heavier contributions outside of europe as we have success in seeing that in our channel a lot of efforts in stocking supply chains in asia as well as in the us with both air freight as well as seafreight to get inventories in position outside of europe to support the growth that we anticipate jack meehan nephron research analyst got it that makes sense and then just another question on 2022 in your initial planning just any thoughts around whether the historical algorithm of proprietary growth outpacing third party should hold there s obviously a lot of moving parts just trying to think about the implications for margin expansion michael stubblefield president and chief executive officer i think we re comfortable with our historical continuing of mid single digit organic growth conversion of revenue to ebitda in this 1 5 to two times range that we typically see and that is obviously driven in part by very very strong proprietary growth with the investments that we ve made this year and the momentum that we have in our proprietary offerings we don t see any reason why that wouldn t play out next year as well jack meehan nephron research analyst great thank you operator your next question is from the line of tejas savant from morgan stanley your line is now open tejas savant morgan stanley analyst hey guys good morning and thanks for taking the questions here michael i was just curious on jack s earlier question as well on margins for 2022 can you comment on your ability to or rather your confidence in passing through inflation on the distribution side of the business particularly given rising freight costs and on a somewhat related note are you guys seeing any sort of deterioration in your on time delivery metrics at all michael stubblefield president and chief executive officer yeah great questions on your first point around inflation management clearly the team has done a nice job managing that this year and as tom indicated inflation didn t just show up in the third quarter it s been higher than historical trends for the better part of the year and as well as on the raw material side or on the wage front we ve certainly seen escalations there above historical levels and you see the execution of the team and the action the team has in offsetting these through a number of means including pricing as evidenced by our strong margin expansion this year typically this time of the year is quite busy and the teams are focused on driving price adjustments into the market going into the new year and i would say one of the differences this year compared to previous years perhaps is the process has started probably a little bit earlier and you see it both from our suppliers as well as the market at large here most folks getting trying to get ahead of this and get prices effective as early as they can to reflect the rising cost environment that we face and so we re very active in communicating with our customers about 2022 pricing as well as presenting i think a number of alternatives here and really offering choice which is one of the strengths of our business model here is where customers have flexibility on branding being able to take advantage of the flexibility that our channel provides in trying to offset some of the inflation but net net price increases will be higher this year than maybe historical to reflect the environment or going into next year excuse me to reflect the inflationary environment that we see but we re in conversations with our customers and i think at this stage are comfortable that just given the macro backdrop that we re going to be able to manage the inflation as we normally do tejas savant morgan stanley analyst got it and on my question on delivery metrics michael stubblefield president and chief executive officer yes so certainly the supply chain has been strained over the last 18 months given the rapid run up in demand i wouldn t say necessarily that we ve seen a deterioration of our on time metrics where we are seeing the impact and is the lead times for many of our products have been pushed out to reflect the constraints and so against maybe our historical lead times certainly not able to keep pace with those levels but with the increased lead times that we have for most of our products which gets reflected in our order book than the supply chain is holding up well tejas savant morgan stanley analyst got it and one final one on the single use capacity expansions you ve announced recently obviously the netherlands site is very recent but can you give us a sense for capacity utilization at in massachusetts and your other facility in north carolina michael stubblefield president and chief executive officer yes great questions when you look at what we have done here from both kind of an organic expansion in both north carolina as well as the devens massachusetts site together with the launch of the greenfield site in europe and the acquisition in china we ve increased our clean room capacity by more than fourfold this year which is going to give us a lot of flexibility here to recognize significant growth over the next couple of years but it was needed we re our backlog has been growing in single use the demand for our technologies is significant and so our factories are quite busy and when we look ahead here when we talked about the masterflex acquisition in our prepared remarks that s going to be a nice complement to our existing single use offering and give us a complete end to end integrated solution for aseptic fluid transfer technologies and there are some complementary capabilities on the assembly side of that business that we will have the opportunity to incorporate the masterflex clean room capabilities into our own footprint and then integrated in with the pumping and tubing capabilities that masterflex brings so we re super excited about the developments of our single use business the capabilities that we ll have and the offering that we ll give to the market here but yes no doubt our factors are pretty good tejas savant morgan stanley analyst got it appreciate the time this morning operator your next question is from the line of patrick donnelly from citi your line is now open patrick donnelly citi analyst two questions maybe just on the m a side obviously a little early with masterflex it and closing but tom you talked a little bit about where the leverage is going to be after this deal where you re heading next year i mean how are you guys thinking about the activity is there a certain threshold where you want to be below before you look at the next deal and maybe just talk a little bit about the pipeline how active things are for you right now thomas a szlosek executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah good morning patrick and thanks for the question the as i said in our prepared comments when we close masterflex which we expect it to be really any day now that will obviously take our leverage up a bit i think of it as the 4 5 range i think i said 4 7 in my prepared remarks but it s in that range we believe that very rapidly as we demonstrated the last three years our cash flows will enable us to take a full turn off of that in a year or so so if you think of us as less than 4 or closer to 3 by the end of 2022 we re squarely in the middle of our targeted leverage range of two to four times adjusted ebitda from a debt perspective and when you look at that and look at where we were at the beginning of this year we re roughly four times and we re able to deploy capital of 4 billion and get ourselves back to acceptable leverage range or targeted leverage range we feel like we re in the same boat we re not in a much different position in terms of our m a opportunities and with that said the types of things we re looking at are very consistent with what we ve talked about before we talk about proprietary we talk about some of the proprietary spaces particularly in biopharma production some of those unique lab workflows as well as the service business all those would be attractive areas we want to invest in but obviously we re going to do it in a disciplined way we re not in a hurry we want to achieve returns that are attractive to our shareholders and give us accretion on the top line as well as on our margin rates and keep up on the cash flow so i think it s full steam ahead but with the idea that we re fully focused as well on getting to our stated target leverage levels between two and four times ebitda patrick donnelly citi analyst understood okay and then michael maybe just on the advanced technologies and applied materials a pretty nice result there can you just talk through the more industrial pieces and i know obviously not the biggest piece of it but are you seeing any difference in geography in slowing in kind of those core industrial markets maybe just an update on what you re seeing out there michael stubblefield president and chief executive officer yeah no we were pleased to see the momentum that we had in that business continuing to build we had a second consecutive quarter here of high single digit growth and i would say looking at the trending as we ve moved through the year we see nice progression in all three regions of the world and maybe most notably we saw a nice uptick in emea region in the third quarter maybe to call out there but i would say the progression in europe and the americas was in line with kind of the sequential improvement that we saw in particular out here obviously the semiconductor space gets a lot of attention at a macro level just given the chip shortage and the fabs are producing at record levels and that s having a nice impact on the formulations business that we have in support of wafer manufacturing really around the world but especially in asia and in the us so good backdrop i would say positive fundamentals for us overall there patrick donnelly citi analyst great thanks guys michael stubblefield president and chief executive officer thanks operator your next question is from the line of catherine schulte from baird your line is still open catherine schulte baird analyst hey guys thanks for the question i guess first on proprietary materials and consumables you had another strong quarter here with high teens growth can you just break that down between covid versus core and kind of how you think about the long term growth rate for that side of your portfolio michael stubblefield president and chief executive officer yes thanks for the question catherine i mean when you look at our covid offerings as we said they re roughly 40 50 vaccine related which is almost entirely proprietary the other piece of it the 40 50 is diagnostic testing that has a higher mix of third party there is some proprietary area in there so when you go to our overall proprietary growth the high teens growth that we talked about the covid impact was probably similar to what you saw in the overall growth rate for of 10 2 so i d say roughly a couple of percentage points catherine schulte baird analyst okay great and then maybe just on the guide you talked about now assuming some masterflex contribution in there i guess what are the timing assumptions around the deal close and expected revenue contribution in the fourth quarter it seems like maybe somewhere around 40 million but just curious to get your assumptions there michael stubblefield president and chief executive officer catherine have you been getting inside information here you re pretty spot on in terms of what we expect for the fourth quarter that would assume a very imminent close so you can think of it as roughly two months worth of revenue and that s pretty much in line with what we ve talked about i think you probably calibrated it based on what we talked about the size of masterflex so yes it will be taken away pretty quickly here and contributing in that magnitude as you know the margin rates are quite attractive for us certainly accretive to the bond term margin rate we re looking forward to good impact starting in the fourth quarter catherine schulte baird analyst great thank you operator that concludes our q a for today i will hand it over back to our presenters for closing remarks michael stubblefield president and chief executive officer thank you again for your participation in our call today everyone as we close i want to express my continued gratitude to our associates around the world who are working hard to deliver values and serve our customers each and every day the resolute and steadfast support of our customers is certainly critical to our mission and our long term growth strategy and our overall success i m really excited about our future and we re looking forward to updating you when we get an opportunity to meet up back and until then take care and be safe everyone thank you

one of the most chaotic and notorious musical performances in saturday night live history took place on halloween 1981 fear a southern california punk rock band were the night s guests the group was far from a household name having mainly cut its teeth in the underground scene punk documentary the decline of western civilization filmed in 1979 and 1980 before being released in july 1981 had given fear their biggest spotlight so far but the band had one major thing working in their favor a die hard fan by the name of john belushi the comedian had become enamored with fear after catching their performance on a local los angeles based music tv show he sought out the group befriended the members and initially tried to get them involved in his latest project a film called neighbors belushi convinced the band to record a song that could be used over the comedy s end credits i wasn t looking forward to singing lyrics that i had written for someone else to sing that were based on a movie that didn t touch my life fear front man lee ving recalled decades later to rolling stone instead he tried to get belushi to handle the vocals himself eventually both men sang on the track which was appropriately titled neighbors but while belushi loved the collaboration studio executives felt differently and outright rejected it listen to neighbors by fear feat john belushi feeling as though he d let fear down belushi promised to get the band a performance on saturday night live as one of the show s most successful and beloved alumni the comedian knew he d be able to pull some strings also working in his favor the program s sagging ratings first belushi got snl head writer michael o donoghue on his side then to seal the deal the animal house star agreed to make a guest appearance in the oct 31 1981 episode if fear could be the night s musical guest the deal was made but belushi wasn t done working determined to make the performance as authentically punk as possible belushi reached out to associates in the d c area and had them bus up for the taping he wanted 15 to 20 people ving explained but they stopped in baltimore and philly before they got to new york and arrived with 35 40 people that evening s saturday night live was hosted by halloween star donald pleasence but it was fear who stole the show the band rocked through songs beef bologna and new york s alright if you like saxophones while their loyal fans went nuts on the studio s floor suddenly frenzied mosh pits were taken out of the dark sweaty clubs and shoved directly onto tv screens across america the real audience at saturday night live was scared to death ving admitted noting that his band s fans took over they didn t know what was happening with all the mayhem watch part of fear s saturday night live performance the punk fans became unhinged breaking production equipment throwing a pumpkin into the chest of snl producer dick ebersol and in one particularly chaotic moment grabbing a microphone and screaming expletives on live television the latter offense was the final straw as the network cut away to a prerecorded eddie murphy sketch the main nbc guy was at home watching with his wife and freaked out calling the station saying go to stock footage cut cut cut ving recalled headlines afterward would describe the scene as a riot with the new york post claiming the show s staff was glad to be alive following the event i ve been in the business for years and i ve never seen anything like this one unnamed nbc technician told the post this was a life threatening situation it s amazing no one was killed a saturday night live spokesperson disputed such reports claiming the severity of the damage which some estimated to be 200 000 was much less nobody was hurt and nothing was smashed the rep explained to billboard there was no smoking ruin still fear s antics earned them a lifetime ban from snl something ving admitted he took pride in they swore that night they d never rebroadcast our footage the singer revealed as a result i have become one of the esteemed members of the permanently banned
posted in comics tagged london orbital comics orbital comics in london finally closes shop orbital comics was one of the three comic book shops of central london accompanied by gosh comics and forbidden planet round the corner it won the spirit of retailers eisner award and for years was my comic book store of choice coming into london first emerging from the wreckage of b hive on denmark street it set up shop in a basement on old carnaby street in soho beneath a tattooist it moved above ground to charing cross road close to centre point until that was demolished to make way for the still being built crossrail tube extension then it moves into the old photographer s gallery next door to the arts theatre and within spitting distance to leicester square tube station it became the most convenient shop for being coming into the city also being right next door to where diagon alley is in the harry potter movies guaranteed a steady stream of pop culture geeks discovering it existed for years it also supplied review copies of comic books to bleeding cool week in week out a coupe of years ago everything changed a falling out with diamond comic distributors led owner damien keeng to pull his account and the shop became a graphic novel store hosting another comic shop with an existing diamond account to supply the weekly wednesday warriors of customers as damien tried to reinvent orbital comics as orbital space a pop culture environment he lost a lot of staff for many the heart of the shop with that change but karl the longest working comic store clerk in the west end back to the early nineties and the model for bernard black in black books remained at the store and kept that heart beating damien began to use the gallery space inherited from the previous occupants more installing a coffee shop and barista a vinyl store gallery prints and the like while still selling comic books they became the exclusive vendor of robert crumb s most recent work and regularly held art shows and launches the store closed during lockdown but did not reopen when the others did as it underwent remodelling the new look orbital space was featured on bleeding cool as the great and the good discovered a post pandemic social and artistic life but the new business model found it hard to prosper in london where people were working from home tourists were scant and the west end was suddenly a lot emptier and the exhibitions seemed to flounder karl left and with him a bunch of customers and now it seems enough is enough there are rumours that orbital may reopen again in the new year and there are signs that orbital as a name will continue online but as a london west end shop there is currently a space and the landlords have taken over occupancy a number of folk have been sharing their memories at the news online i reached out to damien this week without response but i did head by the place tonight on the way home it was indeed closed even though orbital s opening

create millions of jobs grow the economy invest in our nation and our people turn the climate crisis into an opportunity and put us on a path not only to compete but to win the economic competition for the 21st century against china and every other major country in the world it s fiscally responsible it s fully paid for i want to thank my colleagues in the congress for the leadership we spent hours and hours and hours over months and months working on this no one got everything they wanted including me but that s what compromises that s consensus and that s what i ran on i ve long said compromise and consensus are the only way to get big things done in a democracy important things done for the country i know it s hard i know how deeply people feel about the things that they fight for but this framework includes historic investments in our nation and our people any single arm of this framework would fundamentally be viewed as a fundamental change in america taking together they

letting the world passes by i ran for president saying it was time to reduce the burden on the middle class to rebuild the backbone of this nation working people in the middle class i couldn t have been any clear from the very moment i announced my candidacy that s why i wrote these bills in the first place and took them to the people i campaigned on that and the american people spoke this agenda the agenda is in these bills is what 81 million americans voted for more people voted than any time in american history that s what they voted for their voices deserve to be heard not denied or worse ignore if you look at the history of the journey of this nation what becomes crystal clear is this we ll say it again given half a chance the american people have never ever ever ever let the country down so let s get this done god bless you all and may god protect your troops and i ll see you in italy and in scotland thank you advertisement what s in and what s out as biden offers scaled back spending plan share copy link copy after months of talks with democratic lawmakers president joe biden outlined thursday a 1 75 trillion framework to support families and education as well as protect against global warming the updated plan includes universal preschool funding to limit child care costs and a one year continuation of a child tax credit that was expanded earlier this year and applied to more families but democrats are scaling back some investments and shortening the timeframe for funding to whittle down spending some proposals were dropped entirely more negotiations are possible the framework fits an approximately 1 75 trillion budget over 10 years rather than the 3 5 trillion budget plan originally envisioned here s what s in the package according to the white house tax breaks an expanded child tax credit would continue for another year as part of a covid relief bill democrats increased the tax credit to 3 000 per child age 6 17 and 3 600 per child age 5 and under households earning up to 150 000 per year get the credit paid out to them on a monthly basis budget hawks worry that a one year extension is a budgetary tool that will lower the cost of the program on paper but mask its true costs since lawmakers tend to continue programs rather than let them expire continue for one year the expanded earned income tax credit that goes to 17 million childless low income workers education universal prekindergarten for all 3 and 4 year olds and child care subsidies for poorer and middle income americans are part of the package but the programs are only funded for six years provide 40 billion for higher education and workforce development this includes raising the size of pell grants and providing funding for historically black colleges and universities as well as institutions where students are largely hispanic or serve tribal communities health care medicare would be expanded to cover hearing aids costing an estimated 35 billion over 10 years expanded tax credits for insurance premiums tied to the affordable care act would be extended through 2025 the white house said it would help 3 million uninsured people gain coverage provide 150 billion for a medicaid program that supports home health care helping to clear a backlog and improving working conditions provide 90 billion for investments that would include funding maternal health community violence initiatives disadvantaged farmers nutrition and pandemic preparation child care biden s plan calls for parents earning up to 250 of a state s median income to pay no more than 7 of their income on child care parents must be working seeking a job in school or dealing with a health issue to qualify housing commit 150 billion toward housing affordability with the goal of building more than 1 million new rental and single family homes the goal would be to reduce price pressures by providing rental and down payment assistance environment fund 320 billion worth of clean energy tax credits these credits over 10 years would help businesses and homeowners shift to renewable energy sources for electricity vehicles and manufacturing direct 105 billion toward investments that would improve communities ability to withstand the extreme weather caused by climate change the funding would also create a civilian climate corps that focuses on conserving public lands and bolster community resilience to flooding drought and other weather emergencies provide 110 billion to help develop new domestic supply chains and develop new solar and battery technologies support would also be given to existing steel cement and aluminum industries use 20 billion for the government to become the buyer of clean energy technologies as part of the procurement process taxes beefs up the irs to improve collections and close the gap between taxes owed and taxes paid a 15 minimum income tax on large corporations along with a 1 surcharge on corporate stock buybacks a new surtax on multi millionaires and billionaires aligning the u s with an agreement reached by more than 100 countries earlier this month designed to deter multinational companies from stashing profits in low tax

roger sherman editor s note we could all use a little inspiration and light during these strange days enter best practices an f w pro interview series where we share how leaders and creatives are facing unprecedented challenges head on during the pandemic while still growing personally and professionally have you ever stopped to think about the voice in your head while simmering tomato sauce maybe it s your grandmother or a friend who first guided you through the process but if you re dorothy kalins legendary magazine and cookbook editor the distinctive low and raspy voice in that moment is from the late italian cookbook author marcella hazan reminding her that adding butter will round out the flavors kalins calls the people like hazan in her life her kitchen whisperers and she s written a beautiful new memoir of the same name that celebrates the lessons they ve shared with her after a storied career editing and co creating award winning cookbooks like gramercy tavern chef michael anthony s v is for vegetables and editing magazines like metropolitan home garden design saveur and newsweek kalins has finally turned the lens on herself exploring a life well lived in kitchens and on assignments around the world related 23 fall cookbooks we re reading and cooking from this season filled with stories about as kalins puts it real people who cook real food the book is ultimately about shared knowledge in many ways the memoir is an extension of kalins work at saveur the magazine she christopher hirsheimer and colman andrews founded in 1994 during an era when many other food magazines were hawking pork chops six ways and low fat cassoulet saveur which focussed on origin stories about regional foods and the provenance of ingredients quickly became a must read for curious home cooks and professional chefs alike the magazine s test kitchen on 32nd street in manhattan was also where i started my own magazine career in 2008 kalins is known in part for her ability to motivate teams and get the best work out of them you re nothing if you can t make the people around you feel like they re excited about what they re doing and that they re working for something larger than themselves kalins says i ve always been the get the smart people in the room and we ll figure it out kind of editor recently i had the pleasure of talking with kalins about her creative process for making cookbooks respecting ingredients and which chef has the best hands stick around for the end for a bonus speed round to find out about what kind of person you are based on how you cook your turkey best practices dana cowin knows what you should be doing and she s not afraid to tell you the following interview has been edited for clarity and length i wanted to ask you first about your hands on role as a producer and as a packager most recently of books how do you come to pick a project and what s your process for wrapping your hands and your head around that project is it relationship first as you know i m a magazine editor i ve been a magazine editor for most of my professional life so i look at a book as a blank page it s important the size of it the heft of it the feel of it the look of it the book comes to me before the writing the actual tactile experience of that book is important should it be big and hefty and authoritative or should it be small and easily accessible and useful and idiomatic in its language you re designing a communication product and every one is different i like to think it s appropriate to the spirit and the integrity of the chef i m working with how did that process change as you began writing your own memoir this was a totally different experience this was like writing a hundred thousand editor s letters because for years when i was editor of met home garden design and then at saveur i wrote a page in front of each magazine it was meant to be a door opening into the idea and feeling of that issue it was made for readers to connect and i think really the books that i ve worked on are always focused on the reader and how does the reader connect with this material best practices virginia hotelier sheila johnson knows diversity is good for business when michael anthony and i were developing the gramercy tavern book we said this is a book that people are going to use at home it s not just a voyeuristic experience of looking at beautiful pictures that they can t realize so we really went through the intellectual process of boiling down the ideas to the things that could quickly communicate what the signature ideas of michael anthony s food is and one of them is his fresh ingredients another is pickling things another is quickly sautéing a filet of fish or beef another is the saucing of vegetables and how you come to a flavorful sauce we focused on skills that home cooks could use and could adapt to their own experience for example he has a pasta sauce that involves corn and to make that corn broth rich he cooked the corncobs after the kernels were taken off the cob well duh that s the smartest i mean you throw a couple of onions in there and some herbs and you boil it down for 30 minutes and you ve got a very flavorful stock that was a breakthrough for me why are you so seduced by the way real people cook real food because i think as opposed to being in a restaurant when we re in our kitchens no matter how much we know it s between us and the refrigerator and what are we putting on the table so we re real cooks no matter our skill level we re still trying to figure it out what do i have what can i work with how can i do this quickly and painlessly how can i make it delicious those are the things that go through a home cook s mind i think i guess the defining idea of the kitchen whisperers is that we all have inside our heads knowingly or not voices that talk to us as we go through the process of putting together a meal and as i was beginning to write this book no matter who i was talking to they connected with that idea and i ve gotten funny notes from people who ve read the book who said oh yeah this reminded me of my uncle the way he used to do this i think it enriches our lives because basically we re all alone in the kitchen making dinner i started writing my list of kitchen whisperers as i was reading the book i ve always considered myself a culinary mutt taking inspiration from different places and sort of frankensteining things together but your book made me step back and think wow what a gift what a gift this career of editing is and actually starting to take the time to think about who those voices are and where i learned this and where i learned that good best practices how ayesha curry amped up and stayed balanced during the pandemic danny meyer wrote something that i was really taken with in the forward of kitchen whisperers he said that when you cook for others you don t let your guests see the amount of effort that went into what you prepared and it made me think also about your writing and editing the reader doesn t need you to show them the work do you draw a parallel between the kitchen and the keyboard well it s interesting i never really thought about it that way i think there s just a certain modesty and a certain connection with giving your guests an experience it s not about you it s about you giving and to me that s the joy of doing what we do whether it s producing a book or a magazine or producing a dinner the last thing i want people to feel when they come into my house is to think that i ve worked so hard to make this happen and then of course these last two years there have been a precious few coming to the table but we are beginning to have a few people around the table again and it s wonderful i ve heard from multiple people that you ve worked with that you ve got a tremendous ability to motivate people and get the best out of them that they truly want to do a good job not just on the project but for you how did you cultivate this skill well i was an editor in chief for 25 years and you are as well and you know that you re nothing if you can t make the people around you feel excited about what they re doing and like they re working for something larger than themselves i ve never been an authoritarian top down my way or the highway kind of editor i ve always been the get the smart people in the room and we ll figure it out kind of editor i ve been lucky enough to have projects where i work with very small teams it s always okay how are we going to solve this problem how are we going to do this what s the right thing to do for the project and it makes people feel part of a team and it s real because you are a part of the team and everybody has a little different corner of the sofa to keep up in the air that s why i think that in certain creative fields you have to be together this zoom esque way of relating to people it works it s fine but you don t have time for that off the wall bit of craziness that leads to something really good so when i work on a book project i define the team and it s a small team usually the chef or chefs and a photographer not even necessarily an assistant and no food stylist ever the chef knows what he or she wants that food to look like and an art director because i love the idea of seeing the page before you ve even made the photograph it s just parity we re all the same we re lying on the floor trying to move the props around as you do when you re setting up a photograph and it s always how does this best communicate and how will it look on the page best practices carlton mccoy on creativity leadership mental health breaking down the walls of exclusivity i think what happens often is that chefs are misled by production teams that come in with their own aesthetic and all of a sudden you have something that doesn t feel authentic and i think that s the driving force behind all the books that i ve ever done and it was a saveur impulse it s nothing new it s something that we did go to the place find the way it s done shoot it write about it capture it don t make it up don t give me a low fat cassoulet dorothy kalins this is a good transition to saveur that was my first magazine job running the test kitchen from 2008 to 2011 and you were the founding editor in 1994 and left in 2001 we also have a lot of saveur dna among our editorial team at food wine that yearning to always tell a deeper story talk to me about those early startup days in 1994 especially in the context of what was happening with chefs in america and american ingredients and also in food media basically we tried to tell people what authenticity was we did a cover story in the first year on saffron chefs were so interested in saveur and in what it delivered because they said to me we didn t have the time to learn about these things in culinary school when we were learning our knife skills we were not learning the provenance of ingredients and we were really interested in that because inevitably when you go down the rabbit hole of an ingredient you find out things about the culture that are so interesting and nobody was doing stories like that that really interested us best practices how mashama bailey and johno morisano wrote a restaurant book on race i write in the book about colman s thing about cassoulet you know if you re going to do a cassoulet do a real cassoulet use real tarbais beans use ingredients that live together and harmonize together otherwise don t eat it don t give me a low fat cassoulet which was actually a blurb that was on a magazine cover when we were launching saveur if it s too fat or too heavy or too whatever make something else but don t do low fat cassoulet and don t do six ways with pork chops because that s not what we re interested in we re interested in going narrow and deep the other thing was this idea of photographing food so that it looked like it was cooked in a home kitchen that was new too to not over light something it should look like it came from somebody s grandmother s kitchen kitchen whisperers is to me at least a book about shared knowledge whose voice was in your kitchen last night man so last night the voice was use what you got girl because i had gone to the market on the weekend and i still had some fresh tomatoes and i had some peppers and i had some fennel and i had some ricotta it was really a reductive process it wasn t somebody saying to me make this or it was just there s a shaped voice a chorus in my kitchen to say use what you have well and i ve heard that from so many different people i can t attribute it to one person so i mixed up some ricotta with basil and made a little layer i sliced some fennel and put the ricotta over that and then i put some fresh tomatoes over that and i had some long jimmy nardello peppers so i put them in and then i just put some tomato sauce on the top with some mozzarella andi baked it it was a non lasagna lasagna basically there was no pasta in it but it was delicious it was a vegetable tian i don t know who that is that s not one human being it s just the sensibility of a lot of people saying to me honor your ingredients revere your ingredients there s a chapter in the book called the cook and the garden and there s a wonderful farmer on long island named patty gentry who i write about a little bit and patty always said you just have to do so little to these vegetables patty talks to me in my kitchen she was a chef for 25 years before she became a farmer and she always says don t fuss i don t even take the leaves off thyme anymore just toss a stalk she said when i was a chef we were taught to de leaf thyme sprigs but it doesn t matter just throw it in use it call it the hippocratic oath of vegetables do no harm first do no harm right in the same vein i m thinking about cooks who i watched and learned from i always end up looking at their hands you know somebody like david tanis i remember an old saveur story where he was in his little paris kitchen chopping vegetables and you just look at the hands christopher and i did that story yep after we d left saveur we went back because we wanted to see what david knew who are the cooks in your mind who have those most knowing hands david tanis chapter is called cooking with your hands and there is nothing that he can t treat beautifully but so does christopher she has a care as if she s dealing with baby animals i mean there s a gentleness and a respect but i think all the people i ve been lucky to work with all the professional cooks are that way that s one thing i revere about them that they honor their ingredients and they do things that are very deep but they re not necessarily complicated if you get what i mean you ve also worked with some chefs who ve turned out to be human beings who have hurt and disappointed others you referenced one of them in the book when you re talking about gumbo and i assume that to be john besh i think you called him a former sunshine man without naming him how do you move on from these collaborators and also maintain trust in other chefs moving forward and how do you separate your legacy from theirs i don t know i would say with great difficulty i think that when you have the kind of relationship that i have with the chefs with whom i produced books you become invested in their lives in their story in their background my job as an editor always is to try to pull out the things from them that they have to say and when you get that intimately involved with a co creator you have to believe it yourself and of course i did believe that and i think it s with great difficulty that you move on from that we deal with it almost on a monthly basis now i feel like part of the job now is crisis management absolutely you tell a story and then you find out that there were all these alleged victims of this person and it just happens more and more now mike solomonov he s very clear about his history he had a bad history with drugs and he overcame it and he never pretends that isn t part of who he is but having overcome it having then begun all these other restaurants and places and ideas that come out of the best part of him makes all more poignant i was looking at a photo of you and colman andrews in marcella hazan s kitchen and you ve got your notebook and i think that s one of the things i ve missed during the pandemic is being able to be in other people s kitchens at a time when younger cooks are learning from tiktok and youtube and are really interested in cooking what do you think is lost in the digital medium and what might be gained well i think everything s lost of course but i have a son lincoln who s 28 years old and who completely ignores these thousands of books i have in my office and will go immediately online to get a recipe and he knows how to handle himself in the kitchen he s pretty good at it he only wants to make what he wants to make and he makes hard things and he s totally tiktok and totally online and if it s not online he s not interested and i would imagine that it s tough for you because your readers are at both ends right i mean they want your information and that s why you have such robust online content and yet they want to get up in bed with your magazine and learn how to make that dough i love that that feeds me sometimes if i think i don t have any time i use recipes that i download immediately and just do it but i don t think it feeds you in the same way but i think younger people would disagree with that i mean lincoln has 10 000 tiktok followers for his cat videos so go figure my son how long will words on paper matter dorothy kalins what s the one question i should be asking you right now that i have not well the thing that i was feeling when i got up in bed with your last couple of issues i thought how long will words on paper matter and that worries me i mean there s something about reading a recipe and reading the food story like the ode to faugeres in food wine s september issue that idea of place and steve hoffman is a wonderful writer isn t he and i just thought are people going to read those stories this way and be fed by them will they continue to be and you re in a better place than i am to answer those questions i m sure there s a ton of pressure for you to develop all these other ways of storytelling i think it can be interesting it can be challenging how do you be authentic in that way but words on paper to me are threatened okay time for a speed round you wrote you tell me how you cook your turkey and i ll tell you who you are i know you re a salt and tangerine flavored roast turkey kind of human so i thought we could do a weird and different kind of a speed round to close this out i m going to name a few different techniques of cooking turkey and you tell me how that correlates with a person who would be doing that technique okay what s the first personality that comes to mind when i say turkey confit you re a chef you hate thanksgiving but you prize flavor love it fried turkey so you re southern you d walk out to your backyard and you ve got this thing you ve been doing forever in this big old wash tub over a fire and you fry your turkey you re a good old boy roulade oh that s another cheffy thing you re just trying to fight against the idea of the bird and you re turning it into something else and you also have to show off that you can do that spatchcock i think you re looking for an easy way out or i ve talked to many chefs who swear by that because they say you can carve it so beautifully and it looks so great on the platter and you put the slices around it so presentation matters to you a lot stuffing your turkey before roasting it i mean we grew up that way we grew up stuffing once frozen turkeys with the pop up tab things i did at least but i think that the health people the health police say don t do that last one turkey in an instant pot oh you re definitely a millennial
updated october 29 2021 at 6 10 pm et updated nov 2 8 10 p m et children as young as 5 will be able to get vaccinated against covid 19 in the u s within the next several days while some parents aren t sure how they feelabout this others are waiting eagerly for a chance to protect their children from covid 19 but federal agencies can t be rushed here s what has to happen before the pfizer biontech shots can start going into kids arms loading currently pfizer is the furthest along in this process but moderna has shared some promising results from its vaccine trial with this age group and johnson johnson is expected to begin vaccine trials for young kids in the future as well here are more details on what the regulatory process entails and how it is going for the pfizer vaccine step 1 drugmakers complete the clinical trial pfizer and biontech have completed a three phase clinical trial in children 5 to 11 years old the companies submitted all of the data from that trial and an application for emergency use authorization to the food and drug administration on oct 7 the main study included 2 250 kids and found that the lower dose version of the vaccine was 90 7 effective in preventing symptomatic covid 19 it was given as a series of two shots 21 days apart and the dose was 10 micrograms a third of the dose given to adults and teenagers no serious side effects such as heart inflammation were reported although with only a few thousand children included in the research that sort of rare problem wouldn t necessarily be detected step 2 independent scientists review the data this week on oct 26 a panel of outside scientists considered pfizer s safety and efficacy data along with an analysis from fda scientists on the risks and benefits of the vaccine in different pandemic scenarios after some lively discussion the group overwhelmingly voted yes that the benefits of the pfizer vaccine outweigh the risks for use in this age group step 3 fda officials weigh in next the fda the agency itself considered the advisers vote on pfizer s smaller dose shot for kids on friday fda officials decided to extend the emergency use authorization for pfizer s covid 19 vaccine to younger kids acting commissioner dr janet woodcock assured parents in a statement that the agency had rigorously evaluated the data and this vaccine meets our high standards step 4 more independent scientists debate and vote but wait there s more yet another federal health agency and its advisers had to weigh in before the shots can become available this time it s the centers for disease control and prevention you can think of it like this when it comes to vaccines the fda is in charge of the what and the cdc is in charge of the who the cdc s advisory group met tuesday and voted to recommend the vaccine for all children in the 5 11 age group dr amanda cohn served until recently as the executive secretary for the cdc s vaccine advisory group and she s a voting member of the fda s vaccine advisory group explained the difference between the two federal advisory groups that weigh in on these kinds of decisions the fda decides whether a vaccine or other product is safe and effective she explained at the fda advisory meeting this week the cdc s group then considers and votes on who would benefit from the vaccine and who should get vaccinated their deliberations include factors such as equity feasibility and the potential impact of recommendations on a population she said when they vote the cdc s advisers could follow the fda s lead in their recommendations or they could make more focused or nuanced recommendations cohn said for instance they could have recommended it for a certain subgroup like children with underlying conditions or those who haven t had a prior coronavirus infection step 5 cdc director makes final recommendation even then a vote from the cdc s advisers isn t an official recommendation that comes from the cdc s director dr rochelle walensky on tuesday night she greenlit the advisers recommendation if she had chosen to she could have changed the recommendation from what the committee voted on as she did with boosters but she followed their lead and recommended them to all kids aged 5 11 only after the cdc director issues an official recommendation can shots get distributed to pediatricians and pharmacies around the country step 6 the shots get distributed to providers and pharmacies experts have been reassuring the public that the rollout of this new lower dose vaccine won t be a repeat of the disarray of the original covid 19 vaccine rollout last winter we will be ready immediately following fda and cdc s decisions so that parents can get their kids vaccinated quickly easily and conveniently jeffrey zients the white house s covid 19 response coordinator said at a news conference wednesday the immunization managers planning the rollout in each state feel much more ready this time says claire hannan executive director of the association of immunization managers we have plenty of vaccine and i think that we re very well prepared she says still she warns that parents shouldn t expect that they ll be able to get their kid vaccinated the instant the regulatory hurdles are cleared there will be challenges getting the vaccine to the right providers to meet the demand experts suggest looking out for guidance from your child s pediatrician and school parents will also be able to find pharmacies with pediatric covid 19 shots in stock at vaccines gov a cdc website launched in

new york ap the lawyer for sen richard burr s brother in law told a judge friday that u s regulators should question the senator before quizzing his client in a probe of whether insider trading resulted from secrets about the pandemic s true threat attorney francis warin complained to a manhattan federal judge that the securities and exchange commission is insisting on interviewing gerald fauth under oath when the republican senator from north carolina hasn t been questioned the sec had asked the judge to order fauth to submit to questioning by tuesday œsenator burr has not been questioned and they seem completely fixated on taking our client s testimony ť warin said œand yet mr burr has not been questioned ť warin even asked judge andrew l carter jr to ask sec lawyers during the hearing why they had not questioned burr though the judge declined to do so saying he wasn t going to œmicromanage ť how the sec conducts a probe burr has previously denied any wrongdoing the sec has released a timeline of his phone calls from feb 13 2020 the day burr sold the vast majority of his portfolio roughly a week before the stock market began a steep descent the sec said in court papers that burr had œmaterial nonpublic information concerning covid 19 and its potential impact on the u s and global economies ť some of which he œlearned through his position ť as chairman of the senate intelligence committee and from former staffers directing the government s coronavirus response fauth the brother of burr s wife has been unable to answer questions under oath for more than a year because of health issues warin said carter told warin to consult with his client s doctors and let the court know by wednesday whether fauth can safely answer questions in the probe even if it s just 15 minutes every other day for a month with medical staff standing by an sec lawyer asked that the doctors be asked how fauth could safely be asked questions rather than whether or not he can be asked them at all without suffering a health event the judge allowed the health issues to remain secret burr is among several lawmakers from both parties who faced outrage over their aggressive trading in early 2020 before the economic threat from the virus was widely known under a law known as the stock act it is illegal for members of congress to use inside information learned through official duties to benefit financially he was captured in a recording privately warning a group of influential constituents in early 2020 to prepare for economic devastation burr was investigated by the trump administration s justice department for offloading 1 6 million from his portfolio in january and february 2020 the department cleared him of wrongdoing almost a year later on jan 19 donald trump s last full day in office burr is not seeking reelection next year he was elected to the senate in 2004 after a 10 year run in the house during friday s hearing carter read facts from the litigation aloud saying the sec got no response to affidavits sent to fauth and his wife in may 2020 and has been continually seeking compliance with a subpoena for his testimony since june 2020
public policy and government finance people tend to love or hate the property tax supporters most of them local government officials and notably budget officers favor its consistency over economic cycles it s the most reliable and least volatile of all the major revenue sources that states and localities deploy but political progressives and purist public finance economists dislike its regressivity lower income residents bear a disproportionate share of the total levies derived from taxes on housing elderly homeowners living on fixed incomes also dislike the property tax unless it s been capped along the lines of california s proposition 13 so it should come as no surprise that perspectives and opinions about how best to manage property taxes will be diverse and conflicting in coming years with the prospect that residential property values will continue to surge in many communities at rates we haven t seen since the inflationary 1970s add to that the complete lack of uniformity in property assessment procedures between various states and even divergent local practices within some states and the discussion becomes something like the parable of the blind men and an elephant everybody has a viewpoint on the topic but their factual knowledge is typically limited by their experience with local practices what sets the stage for some spirited debates and diverging public policy decisions in coming years is the housing shortage beginning in the great recession homebuilders cut back new construction rates sharply and never returned to robust 2006 levels meanwhile gen z and millennials stayed home longer than elder generations out of economic necessity and only recently have begun shifting from rental housing to homeownership the covid 19 pandemic forced most of us to work from home and that pushed some urban tenants especially those with young families to become suburban house seekers to make matters worse homebuilders now face shortages of land labor materials and appliances so new home construction now falls even shorter of demand and existing homeowners are sitting tight because of a scarcity of available homes to switch into and to further tighten the stock of housing for sale institutional real estate buyers have been scarfing up huge portfolios of single family homes and renting them out for investment income with demand for homes outstripping supply prices have jumped the most in decades in many communities the increase in the past year has been double digit and for some it s been double digit for several years at least for now there is no end in sight so housing inflation is now running well above the rate of national consumer inflation indexes and that will likely continue until the federal reserve yanks the punchbowl with significantly higher interest rates in a year or two at the earliest so how will these increases in home values work their way into local government budgets and how soon can city county and school officials expect to see a surge in property tax revenues well that depends on how one s state administers property taxes beginning with its basic property assessment rules and then the legal and practical limits that are placed on local officials for adjusting their tax rates on one extreme or at least the edge of it we have california s prop 13 rules until a property is sold property assessments on an individual parcel cannot escalate more than 2 percent annually and because local tax limits require a special vote the revenue increases allowable for most municipalities schools and agencies are capped only the incremental value of construction property improvements and new assessments resulting from fresh property sales can augment this restricted level of revenue increases if property values have increased over time by 20 percent on average from their capped assessments but only 5 percent of a jurisdiction s properties are sold in a given year then the local total revenue increase in that year would be something close to 2 9 percent plus the taxes on new construction and improvements it s clearly an inflation inelastic formula along with gaping horizontal inequities between properties with similar market values on the other extreme some states require annual property reassessments often calculated by computer algorithms rather than site specific appraisals and allow local jurisdictions to set their own tax rates in those places the level of tax revenues is really based on budgetary and political decisions more than property price inflation and jurisdictions can calibrate their tax rates to match budget growth even when assessed values are escalating rapidly these are the entities with maximum financial flexibility and sometimes the spiciest debates over tax rates in between there are some states that limit tax revenue increases one way or another some let the assessed values float with the market but limit total revenues to an inflation rate plus a factor for new construction and population growth in some states property reassessments are performed triennially or quadrennially inflationary tax increases are deferred for a few years but eventually catch up to market levels which is perplexing and aggravating to many taxpayers add to such disparities the divergence between property price appreciation in various market segments single family houses rental apartments and commercial and industrial buildings the latter are often dependent on the income generated for the property owner which assessors often must consider in addition to brick and mortar replacement costs and comparable sales in today s economy for example malls are still suffering and may demand assessment relief and office building owners may demand similar reductions using the income valuation approach to reflect vacant space and tenant concessions with this complex milieu of property tax conventions it is impossible to make sweeping generalizations about how housing inflation will impact local government budgets in some locations tight revenue caps will result in local revenues falling short of higher costs for police cars road building supplies health care benefits and eventually public payrolls in others elected officials have sufficient latitude to make ends meet by adjusting their tax rates whether or not such decisions are popular with homeowners some of this will depend on whether overall inflation remains within the fed s recent 3 4 percent forecast one housing related budgetary mismatch is predictable in many but not all jurisdictions the cost of housing for younger workers is likely to increase faster than many public employers revenues and eventually that will work its way into payroll increases that put pressure on their budgets labor statistics also portend a trend to raise pay for state and local employees for urban municipalities that now strive to induce their police officers and firefighters to live in the jurisdiction where they work as a way to foster community attachment expect a double whammy even local governments commuting office workers may face rent increases and housing inflation that drive some to seek alternative employment at a higher pay eventually therefore rents and housing cost inflation will creep into the public payroll to paraphrase the iconic monetarist economist milton friedman who said that wage and price inflation follows the money supply with long and variable lags housing inflation will similarly impact local governments in coming years it s not a double digit problem but hotter than the fed s latest inflation forecast the trend is obvious although the impacts and remedies are both disparate and circumstantial

joe lewnard jlewnard dailyherald com established in 1998 and encompassing the former glenview naval air station the glen tif paved the way for new infrastructure such as roadways and storm water detention facilities and numerous public developments including gallery park attea middle school park center the glen of north glenview metra station fire station 14 and the northeastern illinois public safety training academy there are an additional 649 acres of private residential and commercial developments glenview trustees on thursday directed staff members to conclude the landmark glen tif before the end of the year setting in motion a plan that marks the completion of a historic award winning redevelopment that has brought 5 500 residents thousands of new jobs and nearly 1 9 million square feet of retail restaurant hotel and office space to the village officials said the conclusion of the tif allows area taxing districts to begin directly receiving property taxes generated from the glen going forward instead of property tax payments being made to the tif fund those same payments will go directly to taxing districts including the glenview public library glenview park district village of glenview and school districts 30 34 and 225 additionally the closure of the tif will not result in any tax increase for property owners inside or outside the glen according to a village news release this milestone is the culmination of more than two decades of collaborative work by past and present leaders from all of our local taxing districts village president mike jenny said the glen is a world class development that has become the model for how to close and redevelop decommissioned american military bases established in 1998 and encompassing the former glenview naval air station the glen tif paved the way for new infrastructure such as roadways and stormwater detention facilities and numerous public developments including gallery park attea middle school park center the glen of north glenview metra station fire station 14 and the northeastern illinois public safety training academy there are an additional 649 acres of private residential and commercial developments the 1 360 acre tif boundary includes an area roughly bound by willow road lehigh avenue east lake avenue and shermer road a tif district or tax increment financing district is an economic redevelopment tool used by communities to spur investment in a particular geographic area in the case of the glen tif beginning in the late 1990s property tax revenues within the tif district were collected and allocated to fund significant redevelopment and critical infrastructure improvements going forward after closure of the glen tif property tax payments will instead go directly to the taxing jurisdictions rather than to fund redevelopment village property owners will see no increase to their property tax bills as a result of the tif ending the village outlined a

updated october 29 2021 at 6 10 pm et updated nov 2 8 10 p m et children as young as 5 will be able to get vaccinated against covid 19 in the u s within the next several days while some parents aren t sure how they feelabout this others are waiting eagerly for a chance to protect their children from covid 19 but federal agencies can t be rushed here s what has to happen before the pfizer biontech shots can start going into kids arms loading currently pfizer is the furthest along in this process but moderna has shared some promising results from its vaccine trial with this age group and johnson johnson is expected to begin vaccine trials for young kids in the future as well here are more details on what the regulatory process entails and how it is going for the pfizer vaccine step 1 drugmakers complete the clinical trial pfizer and biontech have completed a three phase clinical trial in children 5 to 11 years old the companies submitted all of the data from that trial and an application for emergency use authorization to the food and drug administration on oct 7 the main study included 2 250 kids and found that the lower dose version of the vaccine was 90 7 effective in preventing symptomatic covid 19 it was given as a series of two shots 21 days apart and the dose was 10 micrograms a third of the dose given to adults and teenagers no serious side effects such as heart inflammation were reported although with only a few thousand children included in the research that sort of rare problem wouldn t necessarily be detected step 2 independent scientists review the data this week on oct 26 a panel of outside scientists considered pfizer s safety and efficacy data along with an analysis from fda scientists on the risks and benefits of the vaccine in different pandemic scenarios after some lively discussion the group overwhelmingly voted yes that the benefits of the pfizer vaccine outweigh the risks for use in this age group step 3 fda officials weigh in next the fda the agency itself considered the advisers vote on pfizer s smaller dose shot for kids on friday fda officials decided to extend the emergency use authorization for pfizer s covid 19 vaccine to younger kids acting commissioner dr janet woodcock assured parents in a statement that the agency had rigorously evaluated the data and this vaccine meets our high standards step 4 more independent scientists debate and vote but wait there s more yet another federal health agency and its advisers had to weigh in before the shots can become available this time it s the centers for disease control and prevention you can think of it like this when it comes to vaccines the fda is in charge of the what and the cdc is in charge of the who the cdc s advisory group met tuesday and voted to recommend the vaccine for all children in the 5 11 age group dr amanda cohn served until recently as the executive secretary for the cdc s vaccine advisory group and she s a voting member of the fda s vaccine advisory group explained the difference between the two federal advisory groups that weigh in on these kinds of decisions the fda decides whether a vaccine or other product is safe and effective she explained at the fda advisory meeting this week the cdc s group then considers and votes on who would benefit from the vaccine and who should get vaccinated their deliberations include factors such as equity feasibility and the potential impact of recommendations on a population she said when they vote the cdc s advisers could follow the fda s lead in their recommendations or they could make more focused or nuanced recommendations cohn said for instance they could have recommended it for a certain subgroup like children with underlying conditions or those who haven t had a prior coronavirus infection step 5 cdc director makes final recommendation even then a vote from the cdc s advisers isn t an official recommendation that comes from the cdc s director dr rochelle walensky on tuesday night she greenlit the advisers recommendation if she had chosen to she could have changed the recommendation from what the committee voted on as she did with boosters but she followed their lead and recommended them to all kids aged 5 11 only after the cdc director issues an official recommendation can shots get distributed to pediatricians and pharmacies around the country step 6 the shots get distributed to providers and pharmacies experts have been reassuring the public that the rollout of this new lower dose vaccine won t be a repeat of the disarray of the original covid 19 vaccine rollout last winter we will be ready immediately following fda and cdc s decisions so that parents can get their kids vaccinated quickly easily and conveniently jeffrey zients the white house s covid 19 response coordinator said at a news conference wednesday the immunization managers planning the rollout in each state feel much more ready this time says claire hannan executive director of the association of immunization managers we have plenty of vaccine and i think that we re very well prepared she says still she warns that parents shouldn t expect that they ll be able to get their kid vaccinated the instant the regulatory hurdles are cleared there will be challenges getting the vaccine to the right providers to meet the demand experts suggest looking out for guidance from your child s pediatrician and school parents will also be able to find pharmacies with pediatric covid 19 shots in stock at vaccines gov a cdc website launched in

updated october 29 2021 at 6 10 pm et updated nov 2 8 10 p m et children as young as 5 will be able to get vaccinated against covid 19 in the u s within the next several days while some parents aren t sure how they feelabout this others are waiting eagerly for a chance to protect their children from covid 19 but federal agencies can t be rushed here s what has to happen before the pfizer biontech shots can start going into kids arms loading currently pfizer is the furthest along in this process but moderna has shared some promising results from its vaccine trial with this age group and johnson johnson is expected to begin vaccine trials for young kids in the future as well here are more details on what the regulatory process entails and how it is going for the pfizer vaccine step 1 drugmakers complete the clinical trial pfizer and biontech have completed a three phase clinical trial in children 5 to 11 years old the companies submitted all of the data from that trial and an application for emergency use authorization to the food and drug administration on oct 7 the main study included 2 250 kids and found that the lower dose version of the vaccine was 90 7 effective in preventing symptomatic covid 19 it was given as a series of two shots 21 days apart and the dose was 10 micrograms a third of the dose given to adults and teenagers no serious side effects such as heart inflammation were reported although with only a few thousand children included in the research that sort of rare problem wouldn t necessarily be detected step 2 independent scientists review the data this week on oct 26 a panel of outside scientists considered pfizer s safety and efficacy data along with an analysis from fda scientists on the risks and benefits of the vaccine in different pandemic scenarios after some lively discussion the group overwhelmingly voted yes that the benefits of the pfizer vaccine outweigh the risks for use in this age group step 3 fda officials weigh in next the fda the agency itself considered the advisers vote on pfizer s smaller dose shot for kids on friday fda officials decided to extend the emergency use authorization for pfizer s covid 19 vaccine to younger kids acting commissioner dr janet woodcock assured parents in a statement that the agency had rigorously evaluated the data and this vaccine meets our high standards step 4 more independent scientists debate and vote but wait there s more yet another federal health agency and its advisers had to weigh in before the shots can become available this time it s the centers for disease control and prevention you can think of it like this when it comes to vaccines the fda is in charge of the what and the cdc is in charge of the who the cdc s advisory group met tuesday and voted to recommend the vaccine for all children in the 5 11 age group dr amanda cohn served until recently as the executive secretary for the cdc s vaccine advisory group and she s a voting member of the fda s vaccine advisory group explained the difference between the two federal advisory groups that weigh in on these kinds of decisions the fda decides whether a vaccine or other product is safe and effective she explained at the fda advisory meeting this week the cdc s group then considers and votes on who would benefit from the vaccine and who should get vaccinated their deliberations include factors such as equity feasibility and the potential impact of recommendations on a population she said when they vote the cdc s advisers could follow the fda s lead in their recommendations or they could make more focused or nuanced recommendations cohn said for instance they could have recommended it for a certain subgroup like children with underlying conditions or those who haven t had a prior coronavirus infection step 5 cdc director makes final recommendation even then a vote from the cdc s advisers isn t an official recommendation that comes from the cdc s director dr rochelle walensky on tuesday night she greenlit the advisers recommendation if she had chosen to she could have changed the recommendation from what the committee voted on as she did with boosters but she followed their lead and recommended them to all kids aged 5 11 only after the cdc director issues an official recommendation can shots get distributed to pediatricians and pharmacies around the country step 6 the shots get distributed to providers and pharmacies experts have been reassuring the public that the rollout of this new lower dose vaccine won t be a repeat of the disarray of the original covid 19 vaccine rollout last winter we will be ready immediately following fda and cdc s decisions so that parents can get their kids vaccinated quickly easily and conveniently jeffrey zients the white house s covid 19 response coordinator said at a news conference wednesday the immunization managers planning the rollout in each state feel much more ready this time says claire hannan executive director of the association of immunization managers we have plenty of vaccine and i think that we re very well prepared she says still she warns that parents shouldn t expect that they ll be able to get their kid vaccinated the instant the regulatory hurdles are cleared there will be challenges getting the vaccine to the right providers to meet the demand experts suggest looking out for guidance from your child s pediatrician and school parents will also be able to find pharmacies with pediatric covid 19 shots in stock at vaccines gov a cdc website launched in

louisville a group of louisville residents opposed to city leaders decision to approve plans for the large scale redtail ridge development project have gathered enough signatures to potentially overturn the approval louisville city clerk meredyth muth confirmed the receipt of the requisite petition signatures this week and said a 40 day period to allow for protest of the petition has begun according to redtail opposition organizers the petition garnered 780 signatures nearly double the amount required by the city sponsored content exploring expressing grief support groups and events as well as creative therapies and professional counseling are all ways in which pathways supports individuals dealing with grief and loss redtail ridge is a project by denver based developer brue baukol capital partners llc which seeks to transform the long vacant former phillips 66 nyse psx with the construction of as many as 3 million square feet of office industrial and flexible use buildings after more than a year of hearings and several iterations of the plans the project was approved on a 4 3 vote of the louisville city council in late september throughout the city s development plan approval process which was put on hold last year after city leaders balked at the scope of the ambitious proposal at the roughly 400 acre site that formerly housed the storage technology corp headquarters concerns have been raised both by officials and residents about loss of open space economic viability traffic congestion and environmental degradation the city council placed a series of conditions on the approval of the plans such as a 3 million square foot cap on development increased public land dedications and a minimum of three megawatts of solar power on site while these conditions were enough to win over the support of a majority of the council some in louisville remain unconvinced almost immediately after the project was approved opponents began circulating a petition seeking to overturn the decision this is probably the biggest land use decision in the century sherry sommer one of the petition s organizers and a former louisville city council candidate told bizwest this month i want to see something that the majority of others in louisville want to see as well if the petition is not protested or should any protest fail statute requires that the louisville city council reconsider the ordinance that approved the redtail ridge plans if the city council decides not to reverse its decision a ballot measure will be put to louisville residents to decide the matter a hearing to reconsider the decision is tentatively scheduled for dec 7 according to muth 2021 bizwest media llc
new york ap the lawyer for sen richard burr s brother in law told a judge friday that u s regulators should question the senator before quizzing his client in a probe of whether insider trading resulted from secrets about the pandemic s true threat attorney francis warin complained to a manhattan federal judge that the securities and exchange commission is insisting on interviewing gerald fauth under oath when the republican senator from north carolina hasn t been questioned the sec had asked the judge to order fauth to submit to questioning by tuesday senator burr has not been questioned and they seem completely fixated on taking our client s testimony warin said and yet mr burr has not been questioned warin even asked judge andrew l carter jr to ask sec lawyers during the hearing why they had not questioned burr though the judge declined to do so saying he wasn t going to micromanage how the sec conducts a probe burr has previously denied any wrongdoing the sec has released a timeline of his phone calls from feb 13 2020 the day burr sold the vast majority of his portfolio roughly a week before the stock market began a steep descent the sec said in court papers that burr had material nonpublic information concerning covid 19 and its potential impact on the u s and global economies some of which he learned through his position as chairman of the senate intelligence committee and from former staffers directing the government s coronavirus response fauth the brother of burr s wife has been unable to answer questions under oath for more than a year because of health issues warin said carter told warin to consult with his client s doctors and let the court know by wednesday whether fauth can safely answer questions in the probe even if it s just 15 minutes every other day for a month with medical staff standing by an sec lawyer asked that the doctors be asked how fauth could safely be asked questions rather than whether or not he can be asked them at all without suffering a health event the judge allowed the health issues to remain secret burr is among several lawmakers from both parties who faced outrage over their aggressive trading in early 2020 before the economic threat from the virus was widely known under a law known as the stock act it is illegal for members of congress to use inside information learned through official duties to benefit financially he was captured in a recording privately warning a group of influential constituents in early 2020 to prepare for economic devastation burr was investigated by the trump administration s justice department for offloading 1 6 million from his portfolio in january and february 2020 the department cleared him of wrongdoing almost a year later on jan 19 donald trump s last full day in office burr is not seeking reelection next year he was elected to the senate in 2004 after a 10 year run in the house during friday s hearing carter read facts from the litigation aloud saying the sec got no response to affidavits sent to fauth and his wife in may 2020 and has been continually seeking compliance with a subpoena for his testimony since june 2020
world oil houston bloomberg exxon mobil corp and chevron corp are plowing windfall profits into share buybacks as soaring energy prices boost their cash flow exxon will revive repurchases for the first time since 2016 the company said friday it plans to spend as much as 10 billion on repurchases starting next year chevron is considering an expansion of its buyback program after surging natural gas prices and oil refining returns drove free cash flow to an all time high in the last quarter shares of both companies climbed in pre market trading the two largest u s oil and gas producers appear to be prioritizing shareholders rather than capital spending despite energy crises in europe and china and widespread concern about inflation and supplies of fossil fuels the crucial question for executives at both companies when they appear on their respective conference calls with analysts later on friday will be whether some of additional cash goes into boosting crude and gas production in 2022 exxon is expected to use the bulk of its extra cash flow to cover dividends and pay down debt which peaked on a net basis at almost 70 billion at the end of 2020 all four of the company s major rivals chevron totalenergies se royal dutch shell plc and bp plc are using this year s commodity rally to buy back shares as well shell and bp were forced to cut their dividends last year recovery mode exxon earned 1 58 a share during the third quarter compared with the 1 56 average estimate among analysts in a bloomberg survey net income excluding some one time gains and losses reached 6 8 billion the most since 2014 the company lost 650 million a year earlier chevron s quarterly profit excluding one time items was 2 96 per share which surpassed every analyst estimate compiled by bloomberg earnings were so strong that the company s net debt to capital ratio has fallen below its target of 20 to 25 a key threshold that could spur an increase in stock repurchases chief financial officer pierre breber said we re fast approaching a net debt ratio where we could increase our buyback guidance range even further breber said in an interview chevron reduced its full year capital budget target to 12 billion to 13 billion from 14 billion citing pandemic related project deferrals and reduced costs in the permian basin the oil explorer has thus far avoided the attentions of activist investors like those that have targeted exxon and more recently shell chevron chief executive officer mike wirth is betting on a strategy of enriching shareholders and increasing production while at the same time addressing climate concerns by lowering a controversial measure of carbon emissions major turnaround free cash flow of 6 7 billion in the quarter allowed chevron to fund a dividend that s among the top 10 in the s p 500 index and reduce debt but the company bought back just 625 million of shares in the period the mid point of its targeted range chevron shares rose as much as 2 3 in pre market trading in new york while exxon gained as much as 1 6 a big reason why oil supermajors are generating record cash flow is because of deep budget cuts made during the pandemic driven oil market collapse of last year chevron s year to date spending was 22 lower than the year earlier period but with record natural gas prices in europe and asia and robust crude prices everywhere there are growing incentives to increase investments in fossil fuels

the lgbtq community have all risen in the last few years hate crimes against asian americans increased by 150 percent in the country last year and now it s becoming clear where all that hate is emanating from most of us remember when we first signed up for facebook i was a little late arriving in 2009 at the insistence of my partner and most of us recall the innocent posts of those early days your name at the top of your page and your status update coming off your name i e john casey is at a bar with friends and an accompanying picture of fun and frolic in those early days when i was a pr person it was initially recommended that businesses large and small stay off facebook the main reason was that you couldn t control what was going to be said about your business in the comment section we wanted companies to avoid being yelled at online then around 2008 or 2009 that all changed rather abruptly suddenly facebook became a great way to build a community around your business and most companies used it as a marketing tool creating an ongoing dialogue with their customers facebook ultimately became a business a very big business a behemoth as a result shareholders and analysts put pressure on facebook like every other publicly traded company to concentrate solely on profits what was originally intended by its founders as a way to connect people suddenly became a cutthroat money making machine the whistleblower frances haugen leveled some extraordinary and serious charges against facebook both in front of congress in the u s this month and this week before the u k parliament and what is now following cascading is more like it are more incriminating stories about facebook s lust for hate through her testimonies and the document dump that her team provided 30 reporters last friday this week has seen a mountain of stories and stunning revelations about all the odium that lies at the feet of facebook facebook changed its name on thursday to meta an attempt to foreshadow the virtual and augmented reality that is the future of social media however that name change does nothing to erase all of the bad news this week and the company s bad behavior during the last few years facebook acts like a predator in its desire to sign up or exploit children and some of those children were suffering from thoughts of suicide and body dysphoria issues child trafficking existed on facebook unimaginable wars were being inflamed around the world and facebook not so surprisingly played a pivotal role in the january 6 insurrection at the u s capitol and that infuriated facebook employees last weekend according to axios facebook warned its employees what was to come this week we need to steel ourselves for more bad headlines in the coming days i m afraid wrote the company s vp of global affairs nick clegg how many more bad headlines are still ahead for facebook how bad will it get for facebook a k a meta it s despicable that facebook allows hate groups misinformation and lies to fester not only about the 2020 presidential election the covid vaccine or transphobia but so much more all this cruelty happened in order to generate and provoke lots of interaction and clicks more clicks equal more advertising dollars more advertising dollars means more profits which leads to bigger stock prices and higher corporate earnings for facebook it s the same old story but this one includes a particularly cruel money monger they say you can judge a man by the company he keeps and mark zuckerberg facebook s founder and ceo keeps some dangerous and hateful company sitting on facebook s board is peter thiel an out and dubious billionaire private equity tech investor an initial investor in facebook and a man who has no scruples thiel s claim to fame is that he is the most hated man in silicon valley and a villain to the queer community the author of a new book about thiel bloomberg writer max chafkin said that if there s a trump political party or a trump faction thiel wants to be the koch brothers to that faction thiel famously organized a secret meeting between zuckerberg donald trump and jared kushner nothing good could come out of a meeting with these four people and nothing did now we know the truth about what happened at that creepy dinner from chafkin s book zuckerberg allegedly agreed not to fact check political posts by donald trump s administration in exchange for facebook being spared heavy handed laws and just because zuckerberg is friends with a gay man doesn t mean he keeps lgbtq hate speech off of his facebook and instagram platforms those two social media sites along with youtube tiktok and twitter are all effectively unsafe for lgbtq users according to report by glaad earlier this year the hate and danger spread far and wide zuckerberg whose original dream was to connect people disconnected himself from all that was good and noble about facebook saddled up with thiel and let hate and venom spread all in the name of keeping the feds away from him and the money coming toward him despite all of the internal research about how detrimental the company was zuckerberg kept his foot on the gas and as a result people were hurt joe biden proved to be prophetic when he said earlier this year that facebook was killing people what vehicle has been most prevalent spreading lies about the vaccine facebook what social channel has wielded the most power when it comes to spreading the big lie about the 2020 election turns out it s facebook who spreads religious hatred in india facebook how was ethnic violence being encouraged in ethiopia facebook protect the brand first users be damned no matter how hard the company tries name change and all facebook s secrets will be revealed eventually and when that bad information starts to come out in an unvarnished form there will be some sort of reckoning by the securities and exchange commission congress foreign governments or facebook users haugen has opened an enormous pandora s box the day after haugen s devastating testimony facebook and instagram inexplicably went down the company said it was an internal error could be however was this a case of the dog wagging the pr tail billions were left thirsting for their instagram and facebook was it the social giant s way of implying want them to shut us down then what will you do facebook s investors could care less about all the hate in fact the only thing that would make them hate facebook is if all these hateful clicks and shares were to shut down and the users went away and if the money dried up this week saw the release of facebook s third quarter earnings report it fell short of analysts expectations 29 04 billion earned versus 29 45 expected that is just one quarter but reported user growth at 12 percent of new monthly users across its apps say whatever you want they ll just keep signing up will facebook continue to chase the almighty dollar and new users regardless of who how or what it harms in light of all the withering revelations yet to come will users still keep coming to facebook will our accounts go dark in protest or will facebook make them go dark to tease its billions of users about life without their news feeds will we keep logging on or opening the facebook app because we re addicted to it will all of our dependence end up saving facebook does meta mean that facebook turns the corner and works to redeem itself will facebook become the social media site we love to hate john casey is editor at large at the advocate

the fed s long awaited tapering announcement will headline the coming week with the october jobs report adding to the excitement the reserve bank of australia also has scheduled a regular meeting however it is the bank of england that could roil markets the most as it ponders whether to raise rates early to fight burgeoning inflation employment data in canada and new zealand will be the other highlights on the data front while opec s monthly get together is unlikely to yield any change in plans to normalize production rba a dovish bluff the reserve bank of australia has been pretty vocal in signalling the markets that it has absolutely no intention of raising interest rates before 2024 however with lockdowns in australia gradually being lifted as vaccination rates catch up with europe and america the economy looks set to make a big comeback in the next few months in the meantime inflation is on the rise specifically underlying price gauges have started to creep higher although it may take some time before wages also start to head north in a sustainable fashion key criteria for the rba investors think this is only a matter of time and are predicting that rates will need to go up much sooner interest rate futures currently imply four rate hikes next year policymakers will probably try to push back against such expectations but not entirely the rba has allowed the three year yield on australian government bonds agb to surge past its target of 0 10 in recent days raising speculation that it may soon abandon its yield curve control policy it s not certain whether that would happen as early as the next meeting on tuesday but another option that cannot be ruled out is the further tapering of asset purchases such a move would be a major u turn with the decision having previously been postponed to february in response to the prolonged lockdowns although the virus backdrop hasn t changed since the decision was delayed the inflation picture has so at the very least the rba will likely flag some form of an earlier withdrawal of stimulus which could power up already turbocharged agb yields boosting the australian dollar aussie traders will also be keeping an eye on september building approvals on wednesday trade and retail sales numbers on thursday as well as the rba s monetary policy statement on friday which contains the latest forecasts new zealand jobs data eyed by the kiwi staying in the vicinity quarterly employment figures are released in new zealand on wednesday while manufacturing pmi data out of china could stir up the risk currents on monday ruffling both the aussie and kiwi the third quarter prints on the unemployment rate jobs growth and labour cost will be important for the new zealand dollar as they could swing the odds in favour of an aggressive 50 basis point rate hike by the rbnz when it meets in late november if they are stronger than expected however given the markets ability to constantly brush aside negative news any disappointment from china s official and caixin markit manufacturing pmi readings would likely only temporarily weigh on risk sentiment fed to start tapering but bypass rate hike talk the federal reserve is widely anticipated to announce that it will begin to wind down its massive monthly purchases of bonds and securities on wednesday tapering could commence days after the meeting but the decision has been so well telegraphed that investors will almost certainly be focusing their attention on chair powell s press conference bond markets have been confused lately with short term yields spiking sharply but long term yields unable to keep up leading to a flattening of the yield curve the only way to interpret this is that investors think policymakers will be forced to act sooner on rates but fragile economies will prevent them from hiking too steeply although powell will very likely want to steer clear of rate hike talk in his press briefing and emphasize the progress in the recovery while maintaining some caution there might be clues on the timing of liftoff in what he says about inflation should powell suggest that he is no longer so sure about higher inflation being transitory this would add fuel to market bets that the fed could begin to raise rates soon after tapering ends which is expected to be in the middle of 2022 but in all likelihood the fomc meeting might turn out to be uneventful and it is friday s payrolls report that jolts markets the us economy is expected to have added 425k jobs in october that would be an improvement on the prior 194k figure after the recent surprises another large miss or beat in the headline number is possible thus the us dollar may only come alive at the end of the week drifting sideways in the meantime other data worth watching out of the united states include monday s ism manufacturing pmi followed by the ism s non manufacturing composite on wednesday as well as september factory orders bank of england will they or won t they since the last meeting in september the bank of england has been unmistakably guiding market pricing for rate hikes higher the repeated hints that a rate rise might become appropriate before bond purchases have ended an unusual step in the world of qe have pushed up the market probability of a 15 bps rate increase in november to more than 60 with a hike by february fully priced in however some mpc members do not yet appear to be on board for premature tightening action and the boe doesn t have the best track record for clear communication so there is some risk that the hawkish bets have been overdone economists are also unconvinced and don t think that a change in the bank rate on thursday is on the cards but even if that turns out to be the case sterling might not necessarily suffer a significant selloff concerns that supply constraints worker shortages and soaring energy costs will be bigger headwinds for the uk economy than its peers have capped the pound s gains from rate hike speculation a more dovish than expected meeting could even be positive for the currency as it would ease worries of tighter policy impeding growth either way investors will be placing as much importance on the boe s updated economic forecasts which should reveal how closely aligned the bank s projected rate hike path is with the markets euro to take a backseat across the channel it will be relatively quieter in the euro area with thursday s producer price index and the final estimate for the october composite pmi potentially garnering some interest for the single currency german industrial orders on thursday and industrial production on friday both for september will also be watched however after the european central bank dampened expectations of higher interest rates anytime soon the upcoming data probably won t change much for the euro oil slips ahead of opec meeting weigh on the loonie one central bank that hasn t shied away from taking hawkish turns is the bank of canada having unexpectedly ended their qe programme early at the october meeting policymakers now have to decide how soon interest rates should start to rise friday s jobs report could help them do that if there s another strong jump in employment in october it would underscore market expectations of a rate increase in early 2022 which remain ahead of the boc s own recently brought forward forecast of q2 q3 however despite the hawkish surprise the canadian dollar s gains post the meeting have been marginal as a pullback in oil prices has countered the boc led advances opec and its allies meet on thursday to decide whether to stick to the pre planned quotas and raise output by 400 000 barrels a day or by a higher amount the major oil producers are under pressure from the united states to ease supply curbs more quickly following the sharp rally in oil prices since late august the opec alliance has so far resisted calls to pump more oil with some members even struggling to meet existing targets however opec has a tendency to shock so a bigger than expected boost in output is a possibility especially if saudi arabia has a change of heart another option for opec is to increase production by 800 000 bpd in november to ease the immediate fuel shortages but keep them unchanged in december any surprise decision to raise output more than the predicted amount could spark a steeper correction in oil prices than the mild retreat seen in the last few days

litchfield litchfield officials are now exploring a long term fix for the woodbury pond dam that could be roughly 150 000 cheaper than initial repair plans problems began to show this spring when dam keeper terry averill witnessed settling of the stone riprap next to the right side of the upstream training wall he also noted seepage along that wall starting at about 7 feet and intensifying at 7 and a half feet since then topsham based engineering firm wright pierce surveyed the site and presented litchfield with a report along with estimated repair costs the firm was also assisted by geotechnical engineering consultants from haley aldrich tests confirmed that the water was traveling through this wall and exiting beneath the downstream training wall and engineers also noted that the riprap had settled between their visits in may they found that the problem was caused by a loss of materials in the embankment within a 10 foot area and recommended that the pond s elevation not go beyond 7 feet until measures are taken against the leak related litchfield moving forward with woodbury pond dam repair they pitched a two phase approach to tackling the problem the first phase would stabilize the situation and involves installing sandbags along the affected area as well as pressure grouting this area to temporarily stabilize the dam this part of the plan also involves regularly monitoring the dam and embankment and noting any changes in seeping or settling advertisement phase one was estimated to keep the area stable for up to two years residents in june approved adding 55 000 to the municipal budget to help with the first phase of the dam s repair phase two would be a long term repair strategy engineers suggested three options installing a concrete core within the existing dam embankment installing a steel sheet pile cutoff wall on the upstream face of the dam or installing a concrete secant pile wall on the upstream face of the dam litchfield selectmen discussed approval of phase one during a monday meeting but opted not to sign off until engineers could provide a more precise financial estimate altogether costs for this phase were originally estimated at between 79 500 and 142 000 town manager kelly weissenfels said wednesday that the town s public works director larry nadeau suggested moving forward with the steel sheet pile cutoff wall option for phase two he said this option would allow the town to skip the pressure grouting step and only install sandbags as part of phase one the grouting costs up to 150 000 weissenfels said so rather than putting money into that procedure which would give us two or so years we hope to instead go straight to the steel sheet wall and that way it would save us 150 000 that s our hope advertisement looking ahead he said the next step would be to authorize engineers to conduct a geotechnical survey and find out if the steel sheet option would work in the meantime the town will pursue seeking the permitting and monitoring required to install sandbags at the site once a permit is obtained and the sandbags are installed weissenfels said the dam s issues will be kept at bay for approximately seven months at which point engineering work will ideally be finished and officials could obtain permits for the long term fix nothing has been finalized at this point he said but said it will be brought to the select board on july 12 weissenfels said they are still exploring the costs for the long term fix and that initial estimates are roughly 300 000 in order to help fund this fix he said the town will explore grants as well as the maine municipal bond bank s dam repair and reconstruction fund it s great news in terms of economics weissenfels said there s a little bit of risk involved if the leak increases and that s why monitoring the dam is important send questions comments to the editors previous next filed under
litchfield with residents recently approving an additional 55 000 to help with the first phase of repair for the woodbury pond dam town officials are pursuing an eventual permanent fix for the dam issues were first identified this spring when dam keeper terry averill observed settlement of the stone riprap next to the right side of the upstream training wall as well as seepage on that wall starting at approximately 7 feet and intensifying at 7 1 2 feet topsham based engineering firm wright pierce surveyed the dam and recently presented the town with a report of their findings and estimated repair costs they visited the site may 5 and may 25 with environmental and geotechnical engineering consultants from haley aldrich they conducted three dye tests to determine the location and movement of water through the embankment which showed water traveling through the upstream training wall and coming out beneath the downstream training wall engineers also saw increased settlement of the riprap adjacent to the upstream right side wall between their visits and noted voids between individual riprap pieces in the area engineers determined the problem was related to a loss of materials within the embankment and that it appears to be localized within a 10 foot area they recommended that the pond elevation not exceed 7 feet until initial measures are taken against the leak advertisement they proposed a two phase approach to fixing the problems with the first phase involving a short term fix and phase two being a long term repair strategy the first phase would stabilize the impacted embankment and control water seepage that involves installing sandbags along the upstream right side face of the dam embankment and training wall as well as pressure grouting the affected area to temporarily stabilize the dam in their report the engineers wrote that the project was discussed with gorham based contractor knowles industrial services which helped provide cost estimates engineers said work could be scheduled directly with knowles and potentially finished in late summer as the installation of sandbags and pressure grouting will take approximately two to three weeks and also require a 30 day approval period through the maine department of environmental protection and the u s army corps of engineers because there are still unknown subsurface conditions that could impact that cost and effectiveness of this short term plan engineers estimate that phase one could stabilize the dam for about one to two years providing ample time to work on the long term repair strategy or phase two and because of these uncertainties phase one also involves regularly monitoring the dam and embankment if any changes in the seeping or settlement occur the dam may require emergency repairs altogether costs for phase one are estimated between 79 500 to 142 000 with the budget for engineering support between 8 500 and 9 500 permitting and remediation oversight between 8 500 and 10 500 monitoring plan development between 1 500 and 2 000 and establishing monitoring points and quarterly monitoring between 6 000 and 10 000 advertisement estimates for the sandbags and pressure grouting also included in the total budget are between 55 000 and 110 000 according to the engineer s report these figures were provided by knowles with the low end of the quote accounting for a three person crew working for six to eight days the 110 000 estimate accounts for obstructions or unforeseen circumstances that could impact the time and scope of the project town manager kelly weissenfels said that officials are planning to speak with monmouth about potentially sharing costs for phase one as the municipality shares a portion of the dam s water frontage he said money could also be saved by using town equipment to assist with laying sandbags which are one cubic yard of sand each a contractor would handle work for other aspects of this phase such as grouting engineers pitched three options for the long term repair strategy installing a concrete core within the existing dam embankment installing a steel sheet pile cutoff wall on the upstream face of the dam or installing a concrete secant pile wall on the upstream face of the dam initial rough estimates for the long term repair range from 265 000 to 500 000 for construction 60 000 to 85 000 for design and permitting and 40 000 to 60 000 for construction administration and oversight the total budget estimate is between 365 000 and 645 000 weissenfels said the town may consider funding via the maine municipal bond bank s dam repair and reconstruction fund to assist with the second phase adding that he is hopeful that the short term repairs will provide the town with ample time to begin saving for the project related headlines litchfield residents approve 2 8 million budget send questions comments to the editors previous next filed under

president trump is set to sign a renegotiated deal in an attempt to address trade inequities by mark anderson president donald trump will formally sign a phase one trade deal with china at the white house jan 15 which reportedly contains several positives for the u s in terms of rebalancing u s china trade relations this is expected to correct china s bad behavior in specific areas in the 86 page agreement according to a white house overview china has agreed to structural reforms in areas of intellectual property technology transfer agriculture financial services and currency and foreign exchange those are the key areas in which china has misbehaved for far too long most analysts would agree although the dominant anti tariff internationalists have the clout and trump s ear for promoting their view and burying a more populist nationalist approach to achieving economic equilibrium and true prosperity with more domestic self sufficiency less dependence on international trade and the creation of a sovereign u s currency free of debt and interest regarding technology transfer the internationalist peterson institute for international economics piie produced a june 2018 paper that reveals some concerns the white house has as it enters into the first phase of the u s china pact with high hopes to soon proceed to phase two the paper noted in a report issued march 22 2018 the united states trade representative cited numerous instances of forced technology transfer and failure to protect u s intellectual property from infringement or theft a broad range of experts and market observers agree that china has repeatedly forced foreign multinational corporations to transfer technology to indigenous firms as a condition for market access and that china has persistently failed to protect the intellectual property of foreign firms discussing the options the white house has as it moves away from levying tariffs the piie report continued at the same time stock markets american industry and farm sectors dependent on exports to china have been worried by the prospect of a u s china trade war fortunately there is a better way instead of indiscriminate tariffs carefully targeted sanctions should be imposed on the chinese entities directly involved in technology misappropriation the white house overview adds the agreement includes a strong dispute resolution system to ensure effective implementation and enforcement as a result we will be able to ensure full enforcement of this phase one agreement and the reforms it includes as a part of this agreement the united states has agreed to significantly modify its section 301 tariffs when trump and chinese officials announced the phase one agreement in mid december the u s agreed to shelve plans to impose new tariffs on 160 billion of chinese goods that had been set to take effect dec 15 usa today noted thus the tariffs that trump has threatened or imposed so far on chinese goods are being described largely as a means to prod china to negotiate not so much as a permanent proper method of economic protection and revenue source for the u s treasury forbes business writer charles wallace on july 21 2018 described the volatile situation washington and china are trying to settle trump is trying to force china to stop stealing intellectual property from u s companies since china s rules that enable such theft constitute a blatant violation of world trade organization rules that beijing agreed to when it joined the wto in december 2001 wallace continued each time trump raises his bet by adding new tariffs china responds with an equal amount of import duties on american goods both sides want the other to blink first but here s the tricky part while the u s bought 505 billion of goods from china last year the chinese only bought 129 billion worth of u s goods so one strategem for the chinese is to hit back in another non tariff way such as making their goods cheaper so that the trump tariffs don t make a difference enter the renminbi china has allowed the currency to decline 7 6 against the dollar in just the last four months that s a huge drop and almost negates trump s threatened 10 import tariffs on some chinese products it indeed may be of strategic necessity to reign in china s abuses and keep the communist capitalist slave state placated especially considering the heavy dependency the u s has long had on china for underwriting the u s dollar and while trump wants to keep american farmers and other exporters happy in order to uphold those economic sectors and to keep his current campaign promise to get a rebalance deal with china the pressure to strictly limit or phase out u s tariffs on chinese and other foreign imports seems overwhelming this may prove unfortunate the real test of whether u s trade with china has been rebalanced will be if the notoriously massive u s trade deficit with china which for decades has cost the u s hundreds of billions of dollars per year while giving china a surplus it leverages to build its military and cyber spying capabilities will finally be laid to rest so truly balanced and fair trade will ensue another test will be whether the u s will maintain sufficient not punitive tariffs on imports from china and elsewhere in order to pump badly needed externally sourced revenue into the u s treasury that is not derived from the already over taxed american domestic economy mark anderson is afp s roving editor email him at

as the covid 19 pandemic continues to disrupt just about every part of the supply chain the owners of some pizza restaurants in maine are hoping that when customers get a pie to go and it s not in its usual box they ll remember that it s what s on the inside that counts in a post on facebook thursday monte s fine foods in portland called out paper goods supplier international paper co based in tennessee for increasing its minimum order requirements for custom printed pizza boxes suddenly and with no advance notice monte s might on average order about about 5 000 of the boxes at a time owner steve quattrucci said under the new requirements he said that order would need to be more than tripled to 17 500 way more than we or our distributor can handle at one time unable to meet the new minimum monte s signature white pizza boxes with the company logo emblazoned on top are temporarily unavailable international paper responded via email to the portland press herald with a statement about the supply chain issues leading to its decision we re experiencing congestion and cost pressure across all modes of transportation as well as rising fuel energy and fiber costs the company said labor shortages are also impacting the supply chain across all industries given the challenges facing our broader u s supply chain in recent months we are hopeful that efforts to eliminate bottlenecks and expedite the movement of goods will be successful and can benefit the entire supply chain advertisement quattrucci said his company is working to find another supplier but in the meantime is using generic brown pizza boxes overall it s a small concession but quattrucci said the company has put a lot of time and effort into its branding and packaging and that regular customers would notice the sudden change we have a premium product we take a lot of pride in the pizza we make and we want folks to know where it came from he said it s the same special pizza they ve come to expect despite the generic packaging leo micucci owner of micucci s wholesale foods in portland is the distributor for monte s and more than 50 other businesses that buy printed boxes almost all of which will now have to make do without he doesn t have the warehouse space he said to order triple the usual number of boxes for each business and even if he did it would take years for the pizza shops to go through them all even for the boxes he can get the wait times are significantly higher what used to take two to three weeks now takes two to three months no matter which company micucci goes through he said i m doing everything i can to get as many pizza boxes in here as i can micucci said it s absolutely crazy advertisement related subscribe to our portland weekly newsletter to get a roundup of top city headlines sherri cunningham a manager at pat s pizza in orono said the longtime pizza shop also has had problems getting boxes with the pat s logo but they ve managed to hold onto them by switching suppliers other paper products also have been hard to obtain according to micucci the clamshell style cardboard boxes for to go orders and leftovers are scarce and quattrucci said the company has been unable to procure a special corrugated insert to keep the pizza from touching the bottom of the box it has found a substitute he said but it s more expensive according to business insider international paper told investors in july that the supply of cardboard boxes was severely low and warned there would likely be continued supply chain bottlenecks for the rest of the year but the supply chain issues extend far beyond just paper products in all my years of doing this i ve never seen anything close to what s going on right now micucci said advertisement onion rings chicken fingers pizza sauce fry oil mushrooms all are either nearly impossible to get or the prices are sky high sometimes triple what they were pre pandemic he said quattrucci agreed for any given order about half the products usually come in and the other half are out of stock he said we just have to keep ordering more to try to keep the shelves filled he said the prices on invoices also keep going up quattrucci said the company is trying to avoid hiking food prices too much to compensate for the added costs but menu prices have been increased somewhat cunningham the pat s pizza manager said supply chain issues have caused the chain to temporarily take some items off the menu for the deliveries that do come in they re often arriving at erratic times such as 8 30 p m instead of the usual 9 a m or on a saturday instead of during the week she said that compounded by the ongoing labor crisis that has made it difficult to find all the workers they need has created new challenges the shop a staple in orono since cunningham s grandfather pat opened it 90 years ago is now doing takeout only during the day and opening for in house dining from 4 9 p m the restaurant is still doing ok as are

updated october 29 2021 at 6 10 pm et updated nov 2 8 10 p m et children as young as 5 will be able to get vaccinated against covid 19 in the u s within the next several days while some parents aren t sure how they feelabout this others are waiting eagerly for a chance to protect their children from covid 19 but federal agencies can t be rushed here s what has to happen before the pfizer biontech shots can start going into kids arms loading currently pfizer is the furthest along in this process but moderna has shared some promising results from its vaccine trial with this age group and johnson johnson is expected to begin vaccine trials for young kids in the future as well here are more details on what the regulatory process entails and how it is going for the pfizer vaccine step 1 drugmakers complete the clinical trial pfizer and biontech have completed a three phase clinical trial in children 5 to 11 years old the companies submitted all of the data from that trial and an application for emergency use authorization to the food and drug administration on oct 7 the main study included 2 250 kids and found that the lower dose version of the vaccine was 90 7 effective in preventing symptomatic covid 19 it was given as a series of two shots 21 days apart and the dose was 10 micrograms a third of the dose given to adults and teenagers no serious side effects such as heart inflammation were reported although with only a few thousand children included in the research that sort of rare problem wouldn t necessarily be detected step 2 independent scientists review the data this week on oct 26 a panel of outside scientists considered pfizer s safety and efficacy data along with an analysis from fda scientists on the risks and benefits of the vaccine in different pandemic scenarios after some lively discussion the group overwhelmingly voted yes that the benefits of the pfizer vaccine outweigh the risks for use in this age group step 3 fda officials weigh in next the fda the agency itself considered the advisers vote on pfizer s smaller dose shot for kids on friday fda officials decided to extend the emergency use authorization for pfizer s covid 19 vaccine to younger kids acting commissioner dr janet woodcock assured parents in a statement that the agency had rigorously evaluated the data and this vaccine meets our high standards step 4 more independent scientists debate and vote but wait there s more yet another federal health agency and its advisers had to weigh in before the shots can become available this time it s the centers for disease control and prevention you can think of it like this when it comes to vaccines the fda is in charge of the what and the cdc is in charge of the who the cdc s advisory group met tuesday and voted to recommend the vaccine for all children in the 5 11 age group dr amanda cohn served until recently as the executive secretary for the cdc s vaccine advisory group and she s a voting member of the fda s vaccine advisory group explained the difference between the two federal advisory groups that weigh in on these kinds of decisions the fda decides whether a vaccine or other product is safe and effective she explained at the fda advisory meeting this week the cdc s group then considers and votes on who would benefit from the vaccine and who should get vaccinated their deliberations include factors such as equity feasibility and the potential impact of recommendations on a population she said when they vote the cdc s advisers could follow the fda s lead in their recommendations or they could make more focused or nuanced recommendations cohn said for instance they could have recommended it for a certain subgroup like children with underlying conditions or those who haven t had a prior coronavirus infection step 5 cdc director makes final recommendation even then a vote from the cdc s advisers isn t an official recommendation that comes from the cdc s director dr rochelle walensky on tuesday night she greenlit the advisers recommendation if she had chosen to she could have changed the recommendation from what the committee voted on as she did with boosters but she followed their lead and recommended them to all kids aged 5 11 only after the cdc director issues an official recommendation can shots get distributed to pediatricians and pharmacies around the country step 6 the shots get distributed to providers and pharmacies experts have been reassuring the public that the rollout of this new lower dose vaccine won t be a repeat of the disarray of the original covid 19 vaccine rollout last winter we will be ready immediately following fda and cdc s decisions so that parents can get their kids vaccinated quickly easily and conveniently jeffrey zients the white house s covid 19 response coordinator said at a news conference wednesday the immunization managers planning the rollout in each state feel much more ready this time says claire hannan executive director of the association of immunization managers we have plenty of vaccine and i think that we re very well prepared she says still she warns that parents shouldn t expect that

helena mont ap montana has become the latest state to stop making license plates because of disruption in the u s aluminum supply another example of supply chain problems caused by the pandemic montana correctional enterprises which makes the plates at the state prison ran out of aluminum this week said carolynn bright spokesperson for the montana department of corrections another shipment of aluminum isn t expected until december officials said we knew this might be a possibility because it s been an issue at other license plate factories throughout the nation said gayle butler administrator of montana correctional enterprises a division of the department of corrections in may north carolina suspended its program to replace license plates that are more than six years old due to an aluminum shortage while arizona had an aluminum supply chain problem that cleared up in june montana is searching for other places to get aluminum but others who have the metal don t want to sell it because of the same supply shortage butler said in a statement there are problems across all supply chains due to the covid 19 pandemic in part due to a surge in demand as economies reopened that outstripped the ability of suppliers to keep up said mark zandi the chief economist with moody s analytics other industries have struggled to find enough computer chips and lumber during the pandemic a recent surge of covid 19 in southeast asia led factories and ports to shut down zandi said in addition energy costs are higher and making aluminum is energy intensive leading to higher prices shortages for aluminum for license plates are more likely linked to supply chain disruptions than an actual shortage of material said christopher davis a regional price reporting director for s p global platts there is aluminum available on the spot market but it might cost more than it did a year ago davis said and it might take longer to get where it s needed due to the same logistics and labor challenges affecting supply chains globally about 750 000 license plates are made each year at the montana state prison in the small community of deer lodge the plate design and numbers are printed on reflective sheets that are applied to pieces of aluminum county motor vehicle departments and authorized license plate distribution agents in missoula and billings still have some license plates available said laurie bakri administrator of the state s motor vehicle division state officials are trying to determine how many aluminum plates are still in stock and whether counties with extra plates can share them with other counties that have dwindling supplies she said we re assuming our big counties will run out of plates quicker bakri said for now montana correctional enterprises is printing plate numbers on the reflective sheets and placing them inside plastic sleeves similar to the temporary registration license plates that are issued before people get their permanent plates officials said if the shortage continues montana plans to apply the reflective sheets onto pvc sheeting to create license plates bakri said people who receive the temporary plates will get permanent plates when regular production resumes bakri said hopefully we won t have to see any of those on cars but that is our backup plan should aluminum not come in in december she said amy beth hanson the associated press

wanted a crystal ball rush shipping to kansas city southern shareholders canadian pacific railway ltd on tuesday reentered the bidding war for the railroad which is the smallest of the major north american rail operators and the only remaining opportunity for consolidation in an already tight knit industry canadian pacific boosted its offer to us 300 a share in stock and cash or about us 31 billion including the assumption of debt that s still less than the implied current value of the deal kansas city southern agreed to with canadian national railway co in may but canadian pacific ceo keith creel calls the extra dollars in canadian national s bid fools gold because the rival bidder faces a tougher path to regulatory approval he s betting kansas city southern shareholders will be willing to trade a higher price for more certainty that a deal will actually close the trouble is while it s clear that canadian national has to jump through more hoops to win regulators signoff and there are reasons to be skeptical there s still a chance it could pass muster the kansas city southern takeover battle is the first major railroad consolidation proposal to officially stand before the surface transportation board since the 1990s after a rash of dealmaking in the sector the regulator adopted tougher merger rules in 2001 that require would be acquirers to prove that a transaction will serve the public interest and enhance rather than simply preserve competition kansas city southern was granted an exemption from that rule however because of its comparatively small size the stb has said that the exemption holds if canadian pacific is the acquirer and has already signed off on its proposal to use an arcane structure called a voting trust to close the deal on a financial basis for shareholders ahead of formal regulatory approval but because there is some overlap between kansas city southern and canadian national s tracks the stb has said canadian national must meet the higher burden of proof under the 2001 rules the stb hasn t indicated whether canadian national s own proposal to use a voting trust meets those stricter standards the regulator said tuesday afternoon that it would make a decision no later than aug 31 this is all coming to a head now because kansas city southern has asked its shareholders to vote on the canadian national deal on aug 19 if investors do back the purchase they won t be able to consider any alternatives until february regardless of the outcome of the stb review according to canadian pacific the counterbidder has also filed a proxy statement asking kansas city southern shareholders to vote against the canadian national deal but institutional shareholder services inc last week advised kansas city southern investors to back the canadian national deal in part because canadian pacific hadn t provided any actionable alternative the sweetened offer disclosed by canadian pacific on tuesday does provide an alternative whether it s really actionable is a different question if kansas city southern s investor vote on the canadian national deal goes ahead as planned on aug 19 and the stb hasn t provided any updates on its perspective shareholders will essentially have to guess at the eventual outcome in the absence of an actual crystal ball the best move may be to sit tight stick with the higher canadian national offer and see what happens february isn t eons away it s six months canadian pacific clearly wants this deal badly in addition to the sweetened price the railroad offered to refund the us 700 million breakup fee it received when kansas city southern dumped it for canadian national and front the cost of the us 700 million penalty the target would owe canadian national if it walks away from that deal there aren t any alternative takeover targets for canadian pacific there s no certainty in february of 2022 that i ll get a chance to make that compelling offer again canadian pacific s creel said on a call tuesday to discuss the railroad s latest bid a lot could happen between now and then that is true it s still a pandemic after all but something would have to go wildly wrong with canadian pacific s balance sheet kansas city southern s business or the financial markets for the deal to no longer make sense on these terms and lest investors forget this whole takeover saga first started because private equity firms blackstone group inc and global infrastructure partners made several offers for kansas city southern last year someone is going to buy kansas city southern at the end of this canadian pacific s higher bid seems intended to force kansas city southern shareholders to make a choice instead it may have signaled that investors can both have their cake and eat it too

covid 19 turned the u s into a takeout food nation companies that have seized on the pickup and delivery trend such as chipotle mexican grill inc domino s pizza inc and shake shack inc are betting that people avoidance will play a persistent role in the future of dining and that consumers will remain willing to pay up for it but the pandemic s turbulent effects haven t finished running their course through the economy which means fast food ceos risk serving up the wrong order restaurants like many industries are contending with staff shortages rising inflation supply chain paralysis and surging virus cases tied to the delta variant for now large chains have weathered this by raising prices and investing in traffic driving and profit enhancing conveniences that smaller independent restaurants simply couldn t these include online ordering curbside pickup new drive through and walk up windows and delivery some are finding that these digital adaptations along with consumers wanting to grab their food and go may alleviate some of the need to cave further to wage pressures the stronger you were in digital and the stronger you were in off premise the better off you re doing domino s ceo richard allison said last summer that s still largely the case in light of that it s surprising that the same executives who are betting big on the takeout trend are pointing optimistically this earnings season to the return of in store dining and the lunch break crowd as vaccines loosen lockdown behaviors and some of their business starts to shift back to cities from the suburbs it shows people are going back to their normal behaviors chipotle ceo brian niccol said on a july 20 earnings call there s a sense that consumer appetites will be large enough to keep both modes of business growing so executives are less hesitant to make bold moves even with the broader economic uncertainties chipotle raised its hourly wage to us 15 in june then instituted a 3 5 per cent to 4 per cent increase in menu prices to cover the cost we saw very little resistance with the price increase niccol said but how long can the industry have its guacamole and eat it too takeout has been so popular that it has inspired branded pickup methods such as shake shack s shake track for fried chicken sandwich aficionados the upstart chains that once eschewed the drive through a concept popularized some 50 years ago have now stamped their names on it in a way that longtime megachains mcdonald s and burger king never did of the 200 restaurants chipotle plans to open this year 70 per cent will feature drive through chipotlanes it s no small wager mcdonald s corp which is expected to report earnings this week has more than 13 000 locations in the u s alone chipotle has only about 2 900 total that potential growth opportunity is why chipotle s stock trades at 61 times earnings a 130 per cent premium to mcdonald s the concern is that restaurant valuations aren t reflecting the uncertainty of whether these chains can sustain breakneck sales growth while absorbing the impact of higher ingredient and labor costs on their margins bloomberg intelligence analysts led by michael halen wrote this month there are many factors externally outside of our control that are difficult to predict domino s allison said following earnings july 22 which nonetheless sent shares of the pizza maker surging 15 per cent to an all time high while domino s has benefited from higher demand in less affluent markets that rejected other quick service chains price increases staffing challenges caused its own delivery times to slip a minute or two he said in august investors will get to hear from shake shack executives analysts predict it had a 54 per cent recovery in same store sales chipotle s niccol is waiting to see how long inflation persists before raising prices again saying there are a lot of unknowns except that the chain will keep growing because there s little overlap between digital customers and store customers right now he sees room to drive one type to try the other method calling each different occasions but what seems equally plausible is that americans who adopted a habit of weeknight drive through dinners at chains such as chipotle and shake shack during the crisis might grow tired of maintaining that frequency afterward whether because they re back to being a lunch break customer or eating out is getting expensive and while the end of government stimulus may bring back workers it could also mean fewer customers corporate leaders won t hazard to guess how long any of this lasts taken together they seem to be suggesting america s appetite for fast food simply knows no limits but there are only so many occasions in a week for takeout burritos and only so much customers will pay

in addition to paying millions to avoid prosecution over the faulty dehumidifiers restitution will be paid to u s customers for fire damage los angeles a chinese company that sold millions of faulty dehumidifiers to u s customers will pay 91 million for failing to tell regulators that the devices could overheat and could catch fire federal prosecutors announced friday gree electric appliances inc of zuhai china and its hong kong subsidiary entered into an agreement to avoid criminal prosecution the u s attorney s office announced the firms also will provide restitution to victims for fire damage caused by the dehumidifiers the agreement was filed in federal court in los angeles the agreements are the first corporate criminal enforcement actions ever brought under the consumer product safety act according to a statement from the u s attorney s office gree usa inc another subsidiary based in the city of industry near los angeles has agreed to plead guilty to willfully failing to report consumer product safety information prosecutors said the case involved more than 2 million dehumidifiers that were sold in the u s between 2007 and 2013 under various brand names in stores such as costco lowe s menards and walmart according to court filings consumers reported some 450 fires and nearly 20 million in property damage no injuries were reported prosecutors contended that gree and the subsidiaries knew that their dehumidifiers were made with parts that didn t meet safety standards and could catch fire but didn t report it to the u s product safety commission for months the company only reported problems and finally recalled the devices after consumer complaints of fires and resulting harm continued to mount the u s attorney s office statement said the 2013 recall came nearly a year after executives first learned about the product s dangers authorities said no one should live in fear that a properly used consumer product might cause injury or death to their loved ones acting u s attorney tracy l wilkison said in the statement we will not allow companies to profit at the expense of consumers health and safety
for well over half a century the international monetary fund and argentina s populist establishment have been playing cat and mouse with each other they are rather like the north american cartoon characters tom and jerry though the imf enjoys the backing of the world s richest and most powerful countries and therefore comes equipped with very sharp teeth and claws all its attempts to corner argentina have failed instead of agreeing to do its bidding in exchange for soft loans designed to make it easier for them to put the national economy in some kind of order the country s rulers have regularly refused to risk anything they think could cost them votes as even talking about belt tightening let alone austerity provokes howls of rage in this part of the world their willingness to pander to the electorate by trying to spend their way out of whatever difficulties they confront has had disastrous consequences especially for the people they say they want to protect what is more while in other countries nationalists justify harsh measures by going on about the need to put the national interest first in argentina their counterparts do the precise opposite in their view letting things slide is patriotic with parliamentary elections just a couple of weeks away the kirchnerites are sticking to the traditional script according to them the imf in cahoots with mauricio macri is almost entirely responsible for argentina s plight and should therefore pay through the nose to keep her and their branch of the peronist movement afloat as has happened so many times in the past the government has put resistance to take imf suggestions seriously at the core of its policy statements its leading lights have taken to firing up bussed in crowds by stridently telling them they will never bow to the outrageous demands that are now being made on them one such is asking them to come up with something resembling a coherent economic plan over the years peronists radicals and leftists have staged hundreds of big protest rallies in an effort to persuade themselves that it was not their fault that the country continued to go downhill though the street theatre performances they are fond of organising make headlines at home they do not impress financiers who are looking for places in which to invest the large sums of money they manage for their own sinister reasons they tend to steer clear of government sponsored mobs which shout insults at them and wave posters decorated with the face of che guevara nonetheless the kirchnerites are not entirely wrong when they say that the imf deserves to shoulder much of the blame for the unhappy situation argentina now finds herself in after having wasted almost three quarters of a century looking for an alternative to the way things are done elsewhere it could well be that the very existence of the imf which stands between indebted countries and the markets has made the problems facing argentina far worse than would otherwise have been the case unlike the faceless financial markets the imf is represented by recognisable human beings who have fairly clear views about what should be done to rein in inflation balance the budget and the like which means they can be accused of having it in for those politicians with different ideological preferences who happen to disagree with them this allows the kirchnerites and many others to strike a defiant posture and make out they are defending argentina against a bunch of foreign technocrats who according to them are determined to impoverish the entire population as a result the imf faces an unpleasant dilemma even if the men and women in charge of it were as cold hearted as populist demagogues say they are they would still have to convince public opinion in the rich countries that they have no desire to make anyone suffer however by adopting a soft approach they give argentine politicians an additional excuse for declining to put into effect the kind of measures most of them presumably know would be necessary to prevent the economy from falling over the cliff towards which it is now hurtling at breakneck speed this sort of thing has been going on for decades and no doubt there are many local politicians who take it for granted that yet another meltdown would be as tolerable for them as were the previous ones which left most of them not merely unscathed but even better off than they had been before unfortunately the endgame is already in sight and it looks anything but pretty while optimists tall us that argentina simply cannot become a sub tropical version of venezuela because her economy does not depend on a single commodity like oil and in any event most of the population is dead against anything which smacks of chavismo the wretched conditions prevailing in the buenos aires province slum belt which holds the federal capital in its clammy grip could well be providing us with a glimpse of what the future has in store for the entire country the kirchnerites among them president alberto fernández who may not be fully on board with the creed peddled by cristina fernández de kirchner and her more excitable acolytes but evidently feels he should bend over backwards in order to appease them are letting it be known that because they are fearless patriots they are prepared to tell the imf to get lost economists warn them that such a course would be suicidal because the country is flat broke and as far as serious investors are concerned is a pariah they would be well advised to boycott but it could be that cristina and her son máximo kirchner whose overriding priority is to stay out of jail would rather see argentina descend into chaos than run the risks they would face were the opposition allied with the many peronists who loathe them to decide it would be in their interest to sacrifice the pair of them on the altar of the fight against corruption good old joe biden would like all latin american governments to undertake for most political movements getting rid of an inconvenient leader whose time has passed can be a bit awkward but it usually entails little more than some hurt feelings however for cristina there is far more at stake than her personal pride deprived of the political power she has accumulated she would find it desperately hard to escape the unfriendly attention of a host of prosecutors judges and others who have more than enough evidence to put her and máximo inside for a great many years a fate which understandably enough she will go to almost any length to avoid

i live by an investing rule that i learnt from the world s most revered investor the oracle of omaha or none other than warren buffett that simply says if you don t understand it don t invest in it that has meant i ve missed out on investing in the aussie created atlassian when it listed on the us based nasdaq stock market in 2015 this chart nearly makes a grown man cry atlassian this chart shows its share price has gone from 27 to 417 in about six years a woman in the us who manages a tech fund filled with complicated hard to understand companies cathie wood with her ark innovation etf this chart shows how well she has done arkk even though tech stocks have been dropped lately by smarties you can see her foray into once hard to imagine successful businesses have really helped her fund s performance what are these companies that were once not really well known am i talking about try tesla roku square zoom shopify coinbase global and others so cathie wood has exposure to cryptocurrencies with coinbase global being a regulated cryptocurrency company that provides customers around the world with a platform for buying selling transferring and storing digital assets earlier this month this is what wood had to say about bitcoin if institutions around the world were to allocate 5 per cent of their portfolios to bitcoin that allocation alone and this is just one of many use cases out there would add would roughly 500 000 to bitcoin s price she looked back on her investing career and made this memorable observation at the cfa societies of australasia conference that investors should think about i have seen two periods in my investment life where what seemed like new asset classes were moving into institutional portfolios real estate in the 70s and 80s and emerging markets right now her fund is down 22 since february primarily because when interest rates rise as they have been on bond markets tech stocks get sold off why well as interest rates rise the potential returns for high growth tech stocks that are often unprofitable and are downgraded thus their share prices fall however eventually their improving and often unbelievably successful revenue results see their share prices spike again i reckon arkk s share price will eventually take off again because the businesses it is invested in are businesses of the future for example this week rent a car company hertz ordered 100 000 tesla cars with half set to be rented out to uber drivers did i say cathie s companies were businesses of the future that deal took the stock market value of tesla over one trillion dollars for the first time is this a sneak preview on tomorrow i think the answer is yes this week for my learning from legends podcast i talked to a legend of the money world mark carnegie if this guy isn t the smartest guy in the room then it must be a room filled with geniuses of einstein proportions well that might be a little exaggerated but when it comes to money few rivals could know more than mark he s started a cryptocurrency fund and explained why over time that the plumbing of the global money world that permits money transfers for transactions investments and so on will one day be challenged by a growing and increasingly accepted cryptocurrency world he puts bitcoin aside looking at it more as an asset that will be used for speculators and wealth builders because of its limited supply however he sees cryptocurrencies such as ethereum as having the potential to be a real challenge to existing currency systems as it will permit poorer populations of the world to transfer money at a fraction of the cost of the prevailing system that he argues is ripping everyone off the society for worldwide interbank financial telecommunication swift is a global network connecting banks to communicate messages about activities like money transfer safely and securely using a code about 11 000 members of swift send nearly 33 6 million transactions every day the swift network acts as an information transport network connecting your money s original location to its final destination via a series of banks your money is then transferred from country to country passing between different financial institutions until it reaches its endpoint swift is a cooperative company under belgian law and is owned and controlled by its shareholders financial institutions banks representing approximately 3 500 firms from across the world carnegie says the world of cryptocurrencies powered by blockchain that makes safe cheap money transfers happen without the need for banks is coming down the pike do i fully understand cryptocurrencies and their future no but i see their potential and i believe over time they will be accepted especially if you look at what young people think is important there are three ways to play the hard to understand business and stock market future 1 stick to great easy to understand companies and buy them when the market is negative on them for example cba at 58 in may 2020 2 bite the bullet and jump on board now buying a tech fund with a number of companies in it might be a safer more diversified way to pay future tech 3 wait for the next market crash and then buy the big tech and crypto names or the big tech funds and wait for the future to pay off for you when the stock market crashed in march 2020 bitcoin went from 15 000 to 10 000 a 33 slide so at 80 300 today anyone who went long bitcoin with the coronavirus crash would be on good terms with themselves i guess as a financial advisor i should suggest to you that it might be timely to start learning about cryptocurrencies because if mark carnegie is as smart as i think he is then you won t be wasting your time by the way other smart guys in the rooms of the world like ray dalio of bridgewater associates the so called king of hedge funds are invested in bitcoin in june this year paul tudor jones one of the usa s top fund managers said that bitcoin is a great way to protect his wealth over the long run and is part of his portfolio just like gold i like bitcoin as a portfolio diversifier for me it s just a way of kind of foundationally looking at how i protect my wealth over time it s a great diversifier cnbc carnegie thinks having a 1 2 exposure to cryptocurrency is a sensible play but other thrill seekers have gone very long bitcoin highly regarded billionaire fund manager bill miller who has consistently made large returns over the past 15 years has allocated 30 per cent of his 154 million fund in bitcoin reported newsbtc com after resigning from his position at 3 65 billion investment management firm legg mason miller created his own investment firm miller value partners miller s investment firm which oversees 2 3 billion in assets operates a 154 million hedge fund called mvp 1 which has recorded a 72 5 per cent year to date gain according to jason zweig of the wall street journal the report revealed that s a huge bet from a really smart guy which makes me think a 1 crypto play is probably not too adventurous

by nathaniel meyersohn cnn business amazon s rise has been relentless for more than a decade with regulators and rivals alike failing to slow it but now amazon has taken a hit from a pair of immovable forces snarled supply chains and worker shortages the company s third quarter earnings and sales fell well short of wall street s projections it was a rare miss for amazon that drove its stock down around 3 in mid day trading friday apple also said thursday that chip shortages and manufacturing disruptions caused it to miss out on 6 billion in sales in the last quarter shoppers aren t what s holding amazon back the american economy remains strong and demand for online shopping is growing albeit at a slower rate than last year when stores were closed and everyone was stuck at home the issue amazon just can t get all of its stuff to customers quickly enough this shows it s not regulators or competition slowing amazon down it s the supply chain nightmare said daniel ives a technology analyst at wedbush securities amazon said supply chain bottlenecks and inflation on raw materials labor and trucking costs crimped profits during its latest quarter those ongoing problems will cost the company an additional 4 billion this quarter dragging down profits during the upcoming holiday shopping period the company added we re dealing with labor risks and supply chain interruptions like many other companies amazon chief financial officer brian olsavsky said on a call with analysts thursday certainly the cost of fulfillment in the last few months and what we ve forecast into the next quarter are not what we re happy about olsavsky said staffing shortages at some warehouses during the last quarter forced it to reroute products to other facilities that that were fully staffed but less convenient this resulted in less optimal placement which leads leads to longer and more expensive transportation routes amazon s results and the response from investors are fresh signs of the far reaching impact of the supply chain crisis and hiring struggles small stores without the scale to keep prices down in the face of elevated costs or the logistics networks to overcome supply shortages and delays are getting hit hardest say retail analysts but these problems are plaguing corporate giants too on average 15 to 23 of products are out of stock on amazon s online marketplace an all time high according to guru hariharan who worked at amazon s retail business for five years and runs commerceiq an e commerce analytics company that advises leading brands such as kellogg colgate and duracell selling on amazon commerceiq tracks out of stock rates from its range of clients on amazon which it then aggregates as a representative sample of a product category on the site amazon declined to comment on the data the company ramped up promotions in october to push customers to shop early for the holidays pulling demand forward helps amazon prevent a crush of orders later in the holiday that can strain its delivery operations that works better for us than to have it all hit in a few concentrated weeks around cyber monday and black friday amazon s olsavsky said thursday operationally it s easier to perform when the volume is spread out he added love it in october but we will take it in november and december as well the company is also using more containers and bringing in goods to new us ports to dodge clogged entryways on the west coast on the labor side amazon is increasing wages and dangling sign on bonuses to ease inconsistent staffing levels in our operations he said amazon is hiring 150 000 holiday workers to meet demand its starting average hourly wage is above 18 with an additional 3 an hour for certain shifts in some locations and signing bonuses up to 3 000 despite the downbeat quarter and the challenges amazon is facing many analysts say it s still gaining market share from competitors and remains in a stronger position than rivals to weather ongoing supply and labor disruptions the company has also spent heavily in recent years to build new warehouses and add capacity in an effort speed up delivery times analysts expect these investments to benefit amazon in the long term we remain positive on in the longer term and believe that supply chain issues and elevated shipping costs are temporary not structural james lee an analyst at mizuho securities said in a note to clients friday cnn business clare duffy contributed to this article the cnn wire 2021 cable news network inc a warnermedia company all rights reserved

as the covid 19 pandemic continues to disrupt just about every part of the supply chain the owners of some pizza restaurants in maine are hoping that when customers get a pie to go and it s not in its usual box they ll remember that it s what s on the inside that counts in a post on facebook thursday monte s fine foods in portland called out paper goods supplier international paper co based in tennessee for increasing its minimum order requirements for custom printed pizza boxes suddenly and with no advance notice monte s might on average order about about 5 000 of the boxes at a time owner steve quattrucci said under the new requirements he said that order would need to be more than tripled to 17 500 way more than we or our distributor can handle at one time unable to meet the new minimum monte s signature white pizza boxes with the company logo emblazoned on top are temporarily unavailable international paper responded via email to the portland press herald with a statement about the supply chain issues leading to its decision we re experiencing congestion and cost pressure across all modes of transportation as well as rising fuel energy and fiber costs the company said labor shortages are also impacting the supply chain across all industries given the challenges facing our broader u s supply chain in recent months we are hopeful that efforts to eliminate bottlenecks and expedite the movement of goods will be successful and can benefit the entire supply chain advertisement quattrucci said his company is working to find another supplier but in the meantime is using generic brown pizza boxes overall it s a small concession but quattrucci said the company has put a lot of time and effort into its branding and packaging and that regular customers would notice the sudden change we have a premium product we take a lot of pride in the pizza we make and we want folks to know where it came from he said it s the same special pizza they ve come to expect despite the generic packaging leo micucci owner of micucci s wholesale foods in portland is the distributor for monte s and more than 50 other businesses that buy printed boxes almost all of which will now have to make do without he doesn t have the warehouse space he said to order triple the usual number of boxes for each business and even if he did it would take years for the pizza shops to go through them all even for the boxes he can get the wait times are significantly higher what used to take two to three weeks now takes two to three months no matter which company micucci goes through he said i m doing everything i can to get as many pizza boxes in here as i can micucci said it s absolutely crazy advertisement related subscribe to our portland weekly newsletter to get a roundup of top city headlines sherri cunningham a manager at pat s pizza in orono said the longtime pizza shop also has had problems getting boxes with the pat s logo but they ve managed to hold onto them by switching suppliers other paper products also have been hard to obtain according to micucci the clamshell style cardboard boxes for to go orders and leftovers are scarce and quattrucci said the company has been unable to procure a special corrugated insert to keep the pizza from touching the bottom of the box it has found a substitute he said but it s more expensive according to business insider international paper told investors in july that the supply of cardboard boxes was severely low and warned there would likely be continued supply chain bottlenecks for the rest of the year but the supply chain issues extend far beyond just paper products in all my years of doing this i ve never seen anything close to what s going on right now micucci said advertisement onion rings chicken fingers pizza sauce fry oil mushrooms all are either nearly impossible to get or the prices are sky high sometimes triple what they were pre pandemic he said quattrucci agreed for any given order about half the products usually come in and the other half are out of stock he said we just have to keep ordering more to try to keep the shelves filled he said the prices on invoices also keep going up quattrucci said the company is trying to avoid hiking food prices too much to compensate for the added costs but menu prices have been increased somewhat cunningham the pat s pizza manager said supply chain issues have caused the chain to temporarily take some items off the menu for the deliveries that do come in they re often arriving at erratic times such as 8 30 p m instead of the usual 9 a m or on a saturday instead of during the week she said that compounded by the ongoing labor crisis that has made it difficult to find all the workers they need has created new challenges the shop a staple in orono since cunningham s grandfather pat opened it 90 years ago is now doing takeout only during the day and opening for in house dining from 4 9 p m the restaurant is still doing ok as are the other locations scattered throughout the state but they re definitely all feeling the supply chain crunch cunningham said send questions comments to the editors previous next filed under

here are five tips to help build a 2 million nest egg on the average american s salary of 51 480 the average american earns about 51 480 a year that s based on the 990 median wage for the second quarter of 2021 according to the u s bureau of labor statistics if you re earning an average salary it may seem impossible to save and invest enough to retire a millionaire especially with the costs of housing child care and groceries soaring but a schwab retirement plan services study found that the average 401 k plan participant believes they ll need just shy of 2 million in retirement think 2 million is out of reach here s how to get there on the average american s salary 1 plan to invest for at least 35 years most people with an average income can t afford to invest a huge percentage of their salary so investing over a long time horizon and giving your money plenty of time to compound becomes ultra important if you invest 525 a month over 35 years with annual returns of 10 you d have just over 2 million in retirement that s only about 12 of an average salary you can still get to 2 million if you don t have a 35 year time horizon but you ll have to invest more each month assuming the same annual returns you d need to invest about 875 a month just over 20 of the average worker s salary to get the same results 2 get your full 401 k match it s a lot easier to become a multimillionaire on an average salary when all of that money isn t coming out of your pocket that s why taking full advantage of your company s 401 k match is a no brainer one common match scenario is 50 of your contributions up to 6 of your pay if your employer follows this formula you d need to contribute about 515 a month but you d get over 770 each month to invest an automatic 50 return on your investment is too good to pass up if you re getting a late start on investing searching for a job that offers a 401 k match can help you make up for lost time vti total return level data by ycharts 3 invest aggressively to achieve 10 returns you ll need to invest relatively aggressively that means you ll need to invest primarily in stocks rather than bonds especially if you have a couple of decades until retirement while stocks carry greater risk the stock market has always recovered from downturns you can shift to more conservative investments when your retirement is less than five years away 4 build a six month emergency fund while investing is the only realistic way to get to 2 million on an average salary having a cash buffer can help protect your future millions aim to build a six month emergency fund so that you can withstand a loss of income or a big expense without touching your investments the damage to your net worth can be long lasting if you have to sell investments at a loss because you need cash on top of that if you re withdrawing money early from a retirement account you ll often owe income taxes and a 10 penalty 5 invest your pay raises you may be earning an average salary now but that doesn t mean you ll earn an average salary forever get in the habit of budgeting and living below your means commit to investing extra money every time you get a raise for example you could plan to invest 50 of your next pay bump and spend the other 50 consistent investing is only part of the equation in becoming an everyday millionaire avoiding lifestyle inflation is just as important on your wealth building journey

as we fall deep into the season of dancing skeletons and haunted hayrides yes it s time once again to think about taxes sure dressing up as a cpa isn t exactly a hot halloween costume though an industry group once smartly suggested dressing up as a golfer wearing the name tag par value and gave another another costume tip for general ledger most of us really aren t thinking tax returns in mid october but oct 15 is a date to watch for a few reasons first families can expect some treats since the fourth round of advance monthly payments for the child tax credit are scheduled to arrive oct 15 is the stock market primed for an october swoon why investors shouldn t fear the frightful month the daily money get our latest personal finance stories in your inbox watch to see if you ve received the correct direct deposit or a check in the mail if you have children who are 17 or younger but don t bank on everything going smoothly for oct 15 because we ve heard of more than a few bumps in the night with this roll out now the tricky part did you file your 2020 tax return by this year s deadline of may 17 which was extended a bit to deal with a long list of tax changes and issues or did you need even more time to pull it all together some taxpayers could wrongly view this as a six month extension from may 17 but the extension is six months from the traditional deadline it s april 15 plus six or oct 15 said mark steber chief tax information officer for jackson hewitt tax service will you need to file a tax return by oct 15 if you re one of the thousands of americans who requested an extension to file their 2020 federal income taxes returns must be filed by oct 15 to avoid a penalty for late filing free file remains available through oct 15 take into account that if you were a victim of a tornado or other severe weather you may be eligible for some relief in michigan for example those facing setbacks due to severe storms tornadoes and flooding can wait until nov 1 if they had requested a valid extension to file their 2020 federal income tax returns the irs automatically identifies taxpayers in a covered disaster area and applies filing and payment relief but affected taxpayers who reside or have a business outside the covered disaster area would need to call the irs disaster hotline at 866 562 5227 to request relief more economic drags remain but the u s will avoid a recession in 2022 here s how irs spokesperson luis d garcia noted that others will also have more time including certain members of the military and taxpayers in other states hit by natural disasters victims of hurricane ida in parts of new york and new jersey for example now have until jan 3 to file various individual and business tax returns and to make tax payments the irs notes that those who still have not filed a 2020 tax return owe tax and did not request an extension can generally avoid additional penalties and interest by filing the return as soon as possible and paying any taxes owed will more money for the child tax credit arrive oct 15 the ongoing advance monthly payments for the child tax credit are also scheduled to arrive oct 15 again you want to wait until you see the actual direct deposit or the check in the mail as payments in august and september were marked by scattered mishaps i ve heard from many families who waited more than a week and then received less money than they anticipated for the september payment some 2 or less or roughly 700 000 of those receiving the advance credit did not get their money on time as of sept 15 according to the irs most families are automatically receiving monthly payments of 300 for each young child through age 5 or they re receiving 250 each for an older child without having to take any action under the american rescue plan the maximum child tax credit rose to 3 000 from 2 000 per child for children ages 6 and older and it rose to 3 600 from 2 000 for children ages 5 and younger the age limit went up to 17 from 16 to cover more teens for a maximum 3 000 what else is tied to oct 15 the revamped child tax credit now includes help for families who typically don t make enough money to be required to file a tax return but to get the money they need to file a federal income tax return or go through a non filer tool at irs gov if you re going to try to use the tool online the irs said its child tax credit non filer sign up tool will be available only until oct 15 at irs gov the nonfiler tool is for those who need to report qualifying children born before 2021 the nonfiler also must have a main home in the united states for more than half of the year you would not use the nonfiler tool if you filed or plan to file a 2020 federal income tax return the irs lists other reasons not to use the tool as well including if you do not have a qualifying child who was born before 2021 and had a social security number issued before may 17 2021 key deadlines to stop advance child credit payments while many people like to receive extra money now there are many reasons to avoid getting that money too say if you re worried about owing taxes or getting a much smaller income tax refund when you file your tax return for this year in 2022 steber of jackson hewitt said the advance payments this year only amount to up to half of the potential credit and he noted the irs has done a good job of matching up appropriate advance payments based on 2019 or 2020 tax returns that works well when facts line up with reality steber said haven t received your child tax credit check are you sure you want it yet if families know their situation has changed where they wouldn t really qualify for the credit he said their best bet is to stop the advance payments even at this late date putting things off sort of like telling yourself that you ll get gas on monday morning has a way of not exactly working out the way you d imagine he warned so far the tax industry estimates that more than 1 million people have opted out of these advance payments steber said but the numbers aren t exact because the irs has not released such data opting out does take some effort including verifying your identification and setting up an id me account and the irs has continued to work on the new tool i wouldn t say it s like pressing a button on your smart phone and you re opting out steber said you can stop the november payment if you meet the irs s nov 1 deadline for opting out if you miss that you can opt out of the december payment as long as you meet a nov 29 deadline if you re trying to opt out of payments for november and december you won t need to opt out twice if you act by nov 1 the irs says you d stop those payments for each of the two months some who are married may want to opt out if they re concerned that they might owe too much in taxes but here s a key tip if you re married and filing a joint return both spouses need to opt out the irs notes that if your spouse unenrolls but you do not you still will get half of the joint advance payment you were supposed to receive with your spouse no monthly advance payments are currently in place for 2022 because so far this deal is temporary house democrats though want to extend the program until 2025 in addition they want to make permanent a change that makes the credit available to low to no income families why should you stop payments even now the monthly advance payments in 2021 could create a massive headache for some including those divorced couples who share custody of their children and alternate years for claiming their children on tax returns it gets really complicated quickly the irs is sending the advance payments now to the parent who claimed the child on their 2020 tax return and that s true even if that parent has no plans to claim the children on the 2021 return the problem could hit if someone else is qualified to get the child tax credit for 2021 and then will be claiming the credit on the 2021 return when it s filed next year if parents alternate years claiming their child on their tax return the irs said it will send the 2021 advance child tax credit payments to the parent who claimed the child on their 2020 tax return even though they will not claim them on their 2021 tax return and someone who gets the money now could have trouble when filing a 2021 tax return next spring when they file their 2021 tax return they may have to pay back the payments over the amount of the credit they re entitled to claim the irs noted in an october alert some taxpayers may be excused from repaying some or all of the excess amount if they qualify for repayment protection if a taxpayer won t be claiming the child tax credit on their 2021 return they should unenroll from receiving monthly payments using the child tax credit update portal the irs said steber noted that the window for forgiveness is very small there are safe harbor amounts where you re not required to repay up to 2 000 per qualifying child that s the case if you are single and your income is below 40 000 for the head of household the income needs to be below 50 000 and for married couples filing jointly the income would need to be below 60 000 a partial safe harbor exists for filers with income between 40 000 and 80 000 if single 50 000 and 100 000 for head of household and 60 000 and 120 000 for married filing a joint return if your income exceeds these thresholds you will be responsible for repaying the full amount of any over payment on your tax return steber said those safe harbors were put in place to reflect that the irs was rolling out the new advance payment program in a short time frame and working with the information that was readily available at that time the taxpayer who does claim the children on the 2021 return is the one who is qualified to receive the full amount of the child tax credit even if the ex spouse received the monthly advance payments george w smith a cpa with andrews hooper pavlik in southfield said he expects a great deal of confusion and sticker shock for some divorced taxpayers with children the shared custodial issue is definitely going to create problems smith said smith said he fears that many people won t have the money to pay it back if they are required to do so next april that is why i would advise them to stop and take a wait and see approach smith said
