shocking breach of faith by a company that sends workers inside millions of homes every year trial lawyer chris hamilton of dallas based firm hamilton wingo said in a written statement in a news

announced charter said tuesday that it would appeal the jury s decision to put the 7 billion award in perspective it is larger than the entire market value of many of the largest corporations in the united states it s three times the market value of xerox holdings corp for example charter has a total stock market value of 80 billion with sales of 52 billion last year and net income of 5 billion

credit cards the attorneys said advertisement article continues below this ad trial testimony showed that charter hired holden without verifying his employment history which would have revealed that he had lied about his work history thomas family s attorneys said in the weeks before the murder supervisors ignored a number of red flags including holden s written pleas to upper management for help because of his distress over financial and family problems they said the thomas family s attorneys also said in the news release that after the family filed a lawsuit charter used a forged document to try to force the lawsuit into closed door arbitration in that scenario the results would have been secret and damages for the murder would have been limited to the amount of thomas s final bill they

the equity markets have been highly volatile for the last few months with the s p tsx composite index falling 14 5 from its april highs rising prices higher interest rates and continued geopolitical tensions have dragged the equity markets down given the uncertain outlook and expectation of a recession due to yield curve inversion i expect the markets to remain volatile in the near to medium term yield curve inversion occurs when the 10 year treasury yield falls below the 2 year treasury yield investors consider the inversion to be an indicator of an upcoming recession amid the challenging environment investors should look to invest in quality dividend stocks to strengthen their portfolios and earn stable passive income meanwhile here are my top two picks algonquin power utilities with an impressive track record of raising its dividends at a compound annual growth rate cagr of over 10 for the last 12 years i have selected algonquin power utilities tsx aqn nyse aqn as my first pick the company operates a low risk utility business meeting the electricity natural gas and water needs of 1 2 million customers across the united states canada chile and bermuda the company owns and operates a diverse portfolio of 43 renewable power generating facilities with a combined capacity of 2 5 gigawatts it sells 82 of the power produced from these facilities through long term power purchase agreements plus it has an economic interest in 1 4 gigawatts of power producing facilities so these long term agreements and low risk utility businesses generate stable and predictable cash flows allowing the company to raise its dividend consistently its dividend yield for the next 12 months currently stands at a healthy 5 43 in other words an investment of 100 in the company can generate 5 43 per year in dividends for the investor meanwhile algonquin power utilities has planned to invest around 12 4 billion from 2022 2026 including acquisitions these investments could expand its rate base at a cagr of 14 6 while growing its adjusted earnings per share eps at an annualized average rate of 7 9 considering all these factors i believe the company s dividends are a safe bet enbridge another reliable dividend stock is enbridge tsx enb nyse enb which has been paying dividends uninterruptedly for the last 67 years the midstream energy company operates over 40 diverse businesses and generates 98 of its cash flows from long term contracts around 80 of its earnings before interest tax depreciation and amortization ebitda is inflation indexed allowing the company to pass on increased expenses to its customers so it generates stable and predictable cash flows which has allowed the company to increase dividends for the last 27 years at a cagr of over 10 with a quarterly dividend of 0 86 share its yield for the next 12 months stands at 6 2 enbridge has planned to invest around 5 6 billion annually for the next three years strengthening its midstream and renewable assets besides rising energy demands could increase the throughput of its liquid pipeline segment to further drive its financials in the coming quarters meanwhile the company s management projects a 5 7 annual growth in its distributable cash flows through 2024 so i believe the company is well positioned to maintain dividend growth enbridge s financial position looks healthy with its liquidity sitting at 4 3 billion at the end of the first quarter the company s valuation also looks attractive with its price to earnings multiple for the next 12 months at 18 3 this means an investment of around 18 3 in enbridge will earn about 1 over the next 12 months

advertisement it wasn t supposed to be like this walmart inc is the world s biggest retailer with stores that are a beacon of low prices and a corporate culture that is famously penny pinching if anyone was to thrive in the current economic environment it should have been the big box retailer and yet on monday it warned on profit for a second time in just over two months that is an ominous sign for the whole consumer sector and the broader us economy advertisement walmart isn t losing customers in fact its low price mantra is attracting them the company said earlier this year that during periods of inflation all customers low middle and higher income families become more price conscious that is encouraging them to shop at walmart it now expects second quarter us same store sales excluding fuel to increase by about 6 slightly ahead of its previous guidance of a 4 5 expansion the trouble is as consumers are becoming more thrifty they are changing their shopping habits in ways that are far less helpful for the retailer with us inflation at a 40 year high and food price inflation running at a double digit percentage americans are spending more on the things they need such as food and consumer goods rather than on things they simply want such as clothing and home furnishings this is weighing on earnings because general merchandise is more profitable than food whose margin is as slim as a slice of wafer thin ham meanwhile more markdowns are needed to shift the pile up of products that cash strapped shoppers aren t buying the situation hasn t been helped by the fact that walmart built up stocks amid the supply chain snarl ups of late last year like rival target corp walmart is discounting its glut of inventory while walmart is making progress in clearing items such as home furnishings and electronics more special offers are needed to entice shoppers to spend on clothing rather than the difficulties working themselves out relatively quickly which walmart predicted in may the retailer is now expecting more pressure on its non food business in the second half of the year in one bright spot however the start of the back to school spending season has been encouraging nevertheless all this is set to take its toll on second quarter and full year profit with walmart forecasting that adjusted earnings per share will fall as much as 13 in the current fiscal year the shares fell as much as 10 in after market trading the new wave of discounts could help counteract the effects of inflation but any benefit to american consumers may have come too late amid higher prices for food and fuel they are also missing those stimulus payments of 2021 and grappling with higher borrowing costs and the first signs that the jobs market is cooling if walmart with its low price prowess and cost cutting expertise is suffering the damage from more skittish shoppers will be even worse elsewhere we ve already seen bath body works inc cut forecasts it is unlikely to be the last of walmart s less muscular rivals to do so this earnings season walmart said in february that its customer base looked a lot like the us population if that is the case then its profit warning is a red flag not only for retail and hospitality companies but for the engine of the us economy
advertisement it was during a car journey to california in temperatures sometimes exceeding 40 c that sophie gilbert decided she needed to make a major career change driving to visit family from her home in moscow idaho she passed columns of wildfire smoke the oppressive heat limiting the time she could spend out of her air conditioned car the two day drive midway through last year helped to crystallize a feeling that she urgently needed to do something more concrete to help deal with the threat of climate change advertisement it hit at a gut level says gilbert climate change isn t something that s going to happen to someone else later on it felt deeply viscerally real for me and my family and what i care about given her role as a wildlife ecologist at the university of idaho in moscow it might seem that gilbert was already well placed to have a positive impact on climate change but the slow incremental pace of academia and the difficulty of getting policymakers to act on her findings left her feeling that she was not making as much of a difference as she d hoped cop26 hasn t solved the problem scientists react to un climate deal i ve been studying how wildlife responds to environmental change to inform conservation planning for 15 years now researching and publishing and waiting for something to happen and then having it not happen even when i ve worked closely with wildlife and land management agencies she says the system just isn t designed to respond to the urgent challenges we re facing she says gilbert took stock of her skills and knowledge and how they could be put to use settling on nature based solutions such as forest carbon storage and biodiversity she made a shortlist of companies and non governmental organizations ngos doing that kind of work and started contacting them to discuss her options in april this year a month after securing tenure gilbert joined natural capital exchange a start up firm based in san francisco california the company allows small private landowners to sell carbon credits for preserving forests on their land gilbert s role as senior lead for natural capital involves adding biodiversity credits to the company s offerings to provide incentives for conserving functioning well managed forests giving up the security and freedom that tenure offers was a big step but gilbert says that the hardest part of the decision was actually breaking the news to her graduate students whose reactions ranged from anger to understanding to some combination of the two there s a lot of mentoring and mutual responsibility there so telling them and helping them through the process of finding a new adviser has been by far the most emotionally gruelling part she says but she is excited to be taking up the challenge of working in the fast paced world of a start up company the company is full of rigorous smart people who want to do good work she says it s going to be a wild and exciting ride spreading the word it s a ride that alice bell knows well by 2015 she had spent 11 years working as a lecturer in science communication at imperial college london and as a research fellow in the science policy research unit at the university of sussex in brighton uk she decided to leave academia for good and took up a position as head of communications at the climate change campaign group possible based in london the move came about partly by necessity bell s contract was due to end and she felt that uk government cuts were making academia an ever more precarious occupation but it stemmed mainly from a desire to be more directly involved in tackling the climate crisis while at imperial she had built and launched a college wide interdisciplinary course on climate change that had forced her to look more deeply into the issue i felt a greater urgency to put my skills somewhere they would be best utilized she says bell says leaving academia was the right choice she thinks she is having a bigger impact on the climate crisis and that her work life balance has improved she also feels more engaged in her work i feel more intellectually stimulated in workshops with ngos than i did in most academic meetings she says adding that she finds it liberating to be freed from academia s pressure to publish and from the weight of that pressure on career progression but there are some drawbacks when you re working for a small charity no one knows who you are says bell i was taken more seriously when i could say i was from imperial some might fear that leaving academia could arouse suspicions that they weren t good enough to stay ignore that voice she advises for many individuals it could well be the best decision to give up

san francisco ap google s revenue growth during the past quarter decelerated to its slowest pace in two years as advertisers reined in their spending amid intensifying fears of an economic recession the regression reported tuesday by google s corporate parent alphabet is the latest sign that the tailwinds propelling big technology companies during the pandemic have shifted the array of new challenges facing the industry has already caused the tech driven nasdaq composite index to plummet by 26 so far this year in alphabet s case revenue during the april june period totaled 69 7 billion a 13 increase from the same time last year that would be impressive growth for most companies outside of tech but it marked alphabet s lowest growth rate since the the april june quarter of 2020 when the company suffered the first and so far only year over year revenue decline in its history the cause advertisers retreated while most consumers were being corralled at home during the pandemic s early stages the more sluggish spending was especially evident at youtube where major advertisers have increasingly gravitated to promote their brands with short commercials youtube s ad revenue rose by 5 from the previous year during the second quarter the lowest rate of year over year quarterly growth since alphabet began to disclose the video site s financial results in late 2019 ruth porat alphabet s chief financial officer attributed some of youtube s meager growth to truly extraordinary ad spending at the same time last year as vaccines emboldened more consumers to begin returning to their pre pandemic lifestyles and spending patterns despite the slowdown alphabet remains extremely profitable the mountain view california company earned 16 billion or 1 21 per share during the second quarter although even that was a 14 decrease from last year as usual most of that money poured in from google s dominant search engine and a wide range of other popular services including its maps gmail chrome browser youtube video site and android software for smartphones even though both the revenue and earnings came in slightly below analyst estimates the numbers apparently weren t as bad as investors feared alphabet s slumping stock price gained more than 5 in extended trading after the numbers were released the rally gained momentum after alphabet ceo sundar pichai and other top executives assured analysts during a late tuesday conference call that the company intended to be more judicious about its spending in the months ahead a commitment likely to bolster profits even if revenue growth continues to falter personally i find moments like this clarifying pichai explained during the call it gives us a chance to look at everything we do through a critical lens the second quarter results reflect greater caution among digital advertisers are remaining cautious as the federal reserve contemplates more aggressive action meaning higher interest rates to bring down the highest inflation in more than 40 years a mission that threatens to drag the economy into a recession the next rate increase is expected wednesday we use the term uncertainty because that is the best way to characterize what we are seeing porat said during a conference call with analysts late tuesday she also acknowledged google has been affected by pullbacks among an unspecified number of advertisers the tightening in ad budgets has repercussions beyond google it squeezed the social platform snap so severely that its earnings plunged below management warnings of poor business results creating such a cloudy outlook that its executives refused to make predictions for the current quarter facebook s corporate parent meta also has been bracing for tougher times ahead meta ceo mark zuckerberg is expected to elaborate on his take on the current state of digital advertising wednesday when the company is scheduled to release its second quarter results besides the current economic certain both snap and facebook have been hurt by privacy protections that apple imposed last year to prevent social media services and a wide variety of other apps from tracking people s interests and locations on iphones to help sell ads without users permission that safeguard hasn t affected google as much because its search engine can learn so much about people from their queries although the company is better positioned than most to navigate the economic turbulence that appears to be looming ahead it s clear google has its work cut out for it in the back half of the year said insider intelligence analyst evelyn mitchell google already began girding for potential recession by recently announcing plans to slow hiring and then went even further by imposing a two week freeze on extending job offers to candidates but before that pause alphabet beefed up its payroll significantly during the quarter it added more than 10 000 employees from the end of march through june up from increase of roughly 7 400 workers during the first thee months of the year the company ended the quarter with about 174 000 employees worldwide porat told analysts the downturn in google s hiring probably won t start showing up in its quarterly numbers until next year partly because of the job offers already in the pipeline and the expectation that it will complete its 5 4 billion acquisition of cybersecurity specialist mandiant and its roughly 2 300 employees later this year

if you ve ever driven through the rural areas of colorado you may have come across ranches or farms that have a pair of cowboy boots resting upside down on top of a fence post sometimes it s both boots and other times just one residents who place cowboy boots on fence posts aren t just decorating with a western theme in mind there s actually a meaning behind it according to classroom com there are actually several reasons why this may be done one explanation for a rancher hanging a pair of boots on the fence is to honor their bond with a horse on their farm it s no easy feat to train a horse and many ranchers have a deep relationship with these animals after breaking them in if the horse is sold or dies later in life a cowboy will often sacrifice a pair of boots to the fence to pay respect to their beloved equine phinehas adams unsplash another reason boots may be seen hanging on a fence is to honor a hired hand who has worked on the farm the idea stems from a pair of boots for every hand many ranchers invite workers to live with them on the property and help out in exchange for food housing and a small stipend once the helper moves on from the farm or sadly passes away the ranch owner will put boots on the fence in their memory in this scenario it s usually a pair of the employee s boots placed on the fence although it s probably not the brightest idea these days in former times boots on a fence meant that the workday was over and the farmer was back home when the shoes pointed toward the ranch gate it symbolized that the rancher was home if they were facing the other way it meant the rancher was out this was in the days before electricity and telephones existed so it was an easy way to let visitors know when they could stop by the tradition of boot hanging has been passed down for generations cowboys have a special attachment to their boots and once they become too worn for wear they often end up on a fence post it s common to see cowboy boots on fence posts in other parts of the country as well the western tradition holds the same meaning from state to state 16 things a true coloradan would never do

microsoft corp gave an upbeat sales forecast for the fiscal year that just began easing investor concerns about growth that had flared up following a lackluster fourth quarter earnings report shares jumped more than 5 per cent in late trading reversing earlier declines on a conference call tuesday the software giant said it expects revenue and operating income to increase at a double digit pace for fiscal 2023 which ends next june currency fluctuations will cut sales by about 4 per cent for the year and about 5 per cent in the current quarter microsoft executives said tempering worries that the strong us dollar would have an even bigger impact on the value of overseas sales the forecast was shockingly strong said dan ives an analyst at wedbush the forecast will be the guidance heard around the world and street microsoft said it is attracting more large deals to its azure cloud computing software and moving clients to pricier versions of office cloud programs the company s expenses will decelerate as the year goes on and as the pace of hiring slows after it adds a planned 11 000 workers in the current period the turbulent economic picture will lead some customers to gravitate to microsoft s products and to cloud software more generally because it can help them control what they re spending on technology chief executive officer satya nadella said on the call coming out of this macroeconomic crisis the public cloud will be even a bigger winner nadella said microsoft shares rose as high as us 269 41 in extended trading following the forecast they had dropped about 2 per cent immediately following the earnings report after falling to us 251 90 at the close in new york while the stock jumped 51 per cent in 2021 it has fallen 25 per cent so far this year amid a rout in large technology stocks earlier the company reported fourth quarter sales and profit that fell short of analysts projections held back by unfavorable currency exchange rates and weaker demand for cloud computing services personal computer software and advertising on its online properties revenue in the fourth quarter which ended june 30 rose 12 per cent to us 51 9 billion the software maker said in a statement net income rose to us 16 7 billion or us 2 23 a share on average analysts had estimated sales of us 52 4 billion and us 2 29 a share in earnings according to a bloomberg survey revenue growth in azure cloud computing services slowed to 40 per cent a closely watched rate that also missed predictions the surging us dollar which reduces the value of foreign sales hurt revenue and profit in the recent quarter prompting microsoft to cut its forecasts in early june the company has slowed hiring in some divisions like azure and office which makes pc productivity software overall sales rose the least since september 2020 with azure growth rates continuing to tick lower and the broader personal computer market on track for an annual decline demand slowed further in the last few weeks of microsoft s quarter as customers delayed purchases in anticipation of a possible global recession said derrick wood an analyst at cowen post memorial day things started getting slower and you started hearing more cautious buying behavior and longer sales cycles wood said analysts predicted azure revenue would rise 44 per cent according to a note from jefferies in the fiscal third quarter the division posted growth of 46 per cent excluding the impact of currency azure growth was 1 per cent lower than forecast in april chief financial officer amy hood said in an interview still the company signed a record number of azure contracts worth more than us 100 million and us 1 billion she said commercial bookings a measure of future sales to corporate customers were significantly better than the company expected rising by 25 per cent an indication corporate demand for microsoft software remained strong in the quarter she said we do the majority of our commercial bookings business in june hood said it was a record quarter for us and much better than we had planned redmond washington based microsoft in june reduced its sales and profit forecast for the fourth quarter blaming the stronger us dollar for a revenue hit of us 460 million the software giant on tuesday said currency impacts in the period were even steeper than it projected the war in ukraine prompted the company to scale back in russia leading to accounting charges of us 126 million additionally hardware production shutdowns in china and a worsening pc market hurt sales of the windows operating system software to computer makers microsoft also recorded us 113 million in severance payments in the recent period earlier this month microsoft said it cut less than 1 per cent of its 180 000 person workforce affecting groups such as consulting and customer solutions but said it planned to finish the current fiscal year with increased headcount the company has also eliminated many open jobs and slowed hiring including in units that make azure windows office and security software these hiring constraints will continue for the foreseeable future the company said last week microsoft s overall revenue from cloud products which includes azure and web based versions of office software rose 28 per cent to us 25 billion the company said in slides posted on its website google parent alphabet inc which also reported earnings tuesday has sounded a similar note of caution on hiring as have apple inc and amazon com inc and shareholders are scrutinizing technology industry numbers closely for signs of wilting demand social media companies twitter inc and snap inc last week reported disappointing sales and microsoft said lower advertising spending hurt results at its linkedin professional network and in the search division global pc shipments dropped more than 15 per cent in the quarter according to idc although they remain above pre

bad thing bowman said in a call from colorado all revenue is not good you need profitable revenue you need revenue which might not make money today but it s going to make money in two steps bowman who was acting chief operating officer before being appointed ceo started his quest for good revenue with cost cutting a hallmark of his predecessor scott cooper s less than one year tenure cooper previously ran truss beverage co a joint venture between molson coors canada and hexo last year he orchestrated a 180 person layoff which he expected to deliver about 15 million on an annualized basis bowman doesn t mince words about the move the cost cutting wasn t sufficient he said we ve done additional cost cutting over those initial layoffs and redundancies because you have to right size your organization for success in its latest financial filings the company said it is working to cut 450 positions by the end of 2023 to save about 30 6 million a year advertisement 3 story continues below

have everybody all in he added the cuts have gone beyond personnel bowman has also dropped products which didn t make any money and replaced them with profitable items he would not give specifics about what products or lines of business he targeted because the company plans to publicize its new goals during its fourth quarter however he said if there s segments where there s not money to be made i m not going to chase false market share or false revenue because it doesn t add anything except cost into our infrastructure and that s probably the biggest change the company is currently known for its recreational brands up cannabis original stash 48north trail mix bake sale and redecan but bowman thinks there is room for hexo to establish itself in the personal care pharmaceutical

bill kirk said in june roughly a month into bowman s tenure in a note to investors he said hexo s adult use pricing in canada has fallen below last year s wholesale pricing and market share is

the google logo is displayed at their offices on nov 1 2018 in granary square in london google s revenue growth during the past quarter decelerated to its slowest pace in two years as advertisers reined in their spending amid intensifying fears of an economic recession the regression reported tuesday july 26 2022 by google s corporate parent alphabet is the latest sign that the tailwinds propelling big technology companies during the pandemic have shifted into a challenging new direction credit ap photo alastair grant file google s revenue growth during the past quarter decelerated to its slowest pace in two years as advertisers reined in their spending amid intensifying fears of an economic recession the regression reported tuesday by google s corporate parent alphabet is the latest sign that the tailwinds propelling big technology companies during the pandemic have shifted the array of new challenges facing the industry has already caused the tech driven nasdaq composite index to plummet by 26 so far this year in alphabet s case revenue during the april june period totaled 69 7 billion a 13 increase from the same time last year that would be impressive growth for most companies outside of tech but it marked alphabet s lowest growth rate since the the april june quarter of 2020 when the company suffered the first and so far only year over year revenue decline in its history the cause advertisers retreated while most consumers were being corralled at home during the pandemic s early stages the more sluggish spending was especially evident at youtube where major advertisers have increasingly gravitated to promote their brands with short commercials youtube s ad revenue rose by 5 from the previous year during the second quarter the lowest rate of year over year quarterly growth since alphabet began to disclose the video site s financial results in late 2019 ruth porat alphabet s chief financial officer attributed some of youtube s meager growth to truly extraordinary ad spending at the same time last year as vaccines emboldened more consumers to begin returning to their pre pandemic lifestyles and spending patterns despite the slowdown alphabet remains extremely profitable the mountain view california company earned 16 billion or 1 21 per share during the second quarter although even that was a 14 decrease from last year as usual most of that money poured in from google s dominant search engine and a wide range of other popular services including its maps gmail chrome browser youtube video site and android software for smartphones even though both the revenue and earnings came in slightly below analyst estimates the numbers apparently weren t as bad as investors feared alphabet s slumping stock price gained more than 5 in extended trading after the numbers were released the rally gained momentum after alphabet ceo sundar pichai and other top executives assured analysts during a late tuesday conference call that the company intended to be more judicious about its spending in the months ahead a commitment likely to bolster profits even if revenue growth continues to falter personally i find moments like this clarifying pichai explained during the call it gives us a chance to look at everything we do through a critical lens the second quarter results reflect greater caution among digital advertisers are remaining cautious as the federal reserve contemplates more aggressive action meaning higher interest rates to bring down the highest inflation in more than 40 years a mission that threatens to drag the economy into a recession the next rate increase is expected wednesday we use the term uncertainty because that is the best way to characterize what we are seeing porat said during a conference call with analysts late tuesday she also acknowledged google has been affected by pullbacks among an unspecified number of advertisers the tightening in ad budgets has repercussions beyond google it squeezed the social platform snap so severely that its earnings plunged below management warnings of poor business results creating such a cloudy outlook that its executives refused to make predictions for the current quarter facebook s corporate parent meta also has been bracing for tougher times ahead meta ceo mark zuckerberg is expected to elaborate on his take on the current state of digital advertising wednesday when the company is scheduled to release its second quarter results besides the current economic certain both snap and facebook have been hurt by privacy protections that apple imposed last year to prevent social media services and a wide variety of other apps from tracking people s interests and locations on iphones to help sell ads without users permission that safeguard hasn t affected google as much because its search engine can learn so much about people from their queries although the company is better positioned than most to navigate the economic turbulence that appears to be looming ahead it s clear google has its work cut out for it in the back half of the year said insider intelligence analyst evelyn mitchell google already began girding for potential recession by recently announcing plans to slow hiring and then went even further by imposing a two week freeze on extending job offers to candidates but before that pause alphabet beefed up its payroll significantly during the quarter it added more than 10 000 employees from the end of march through june up from increase of roughly 7 400 workers during the first thee months of the year the company ended the quarter with about 174 000 employees worldwide porat told analysts the downturn in google s hiring probably won t start showing up in its quarterly numbers until next year partly because of the job offers already in the pipeline and the expectation that it will complete its 5 4 billion acquisition of cybersecurity specialist mandiant and its roughly 2 300 employees

fed chair jerome powell and a senior member of congress are at odds over a report issued tuesday by senate republicans alleging that china is trying to infiltrate the federal reserve and that the central bank has done too little to stop it the report by members of the republican minority of the senate homeland security and governmental affairs committee alleges that china has used promises of lucrative teaching and research contracts to try to entice economists working at more than half of the system s 12 federal reserve banks to share nonpublic information about economic forecasts and monetary policy decisions with chinese officials china s goal according to the report is to supplant the u s as the global economic leader and end the u s dollar s status as the world s primary reserve currency in one case the report alleges that a fed economist was detained while traveling in china and threatened with arrest and retaliation against his family if he did not cooperate variety of contacts while the report paints an alarming picture many of the details provided about fed officials contact with chinese officials are not obviously nefarious the central bank s researchers and officials regularly correspond and meet with their counterparts around the world often exchanging information when they do so however some of the activity described is clearly suspicious including one fed employee who was found to be researching articles on the prosecution of economic espionage and who used a modified version of the name of chinese president xi jinping as one of his computer passwords the report lays out five case studies that go into detail about unnamed fed officials contacts with china the report notes that the fed investigated the activities of the individuals involved to determine whether any information was provided to china in violation of fed policy in all five cases the investigation did not identify any policy violations nevertheless the report alleges that the central bank has fallen short in responding to china s alleged efforts at infiltration saying that the fed lacks sufficient counterintelligence expertise and cooperation with u s law enforcement and the u s intelligence community it also claims that the fed s policies and procedures are insufficient to counter the threat of chinese infiltration and criticizes the central bank for allowing employees to retain access to sensitive information after learning of their connections with chinese organizations i am concerned by the threat to the fed and hope our investigation which is based on the fed s own documents and corresponds with assessments and recommendations made by the fbi wakes the fed up to the broad threat from china to our monetary policy said senator rob portman the ranking republican on the committee the risk is clear i urge the fed to do more working with the fbi to counter this threat from one of our foremost foreign adversaries strong fed response the report generated a forceful rebuttal from powell who said the central bank s staff are well aware of their obligations to keep sensitive information secret in a letter addressed to portman powell wrote because we understand that some actors aim to exploit any vulnerabilities our processes controls and technology are robust and updated regularly we respectfully reject any suggestions to the contrary powell a republican who was appointed fed chair by former president donald trump in 2018 also took issue with the report s description of the activities of a number of individual fed employees saying that the central bank is deeply troubled by what we believe to be the report s unfair unsubstantiated and unverified insinuations about particular individual staff members chinese government response chinese officials criticized the report saying it reflects outdated thinking about the relationship between the two countries in a statement emailed to voa liu pengyu spokesperson for the chinese embassy in washington said the remarks of the relevant u s congressmen are full of cold war zero sum thinking and ideological prejudice he added the cooperation between china and the u s in economic financial and other fields is open and aboveboard which has played an important role in enhancing mutual understanding and mutual trust between the two countries the u s should take off its colored glasses and stop disrupting local and non governmental exchanges between the two countries talent recruitment programs portman has previously led other investigations into china s use of talent recruitment programs to develop connections with u s scientists and academics allegedly in the service of obtaining proprietary information and technology the most prominent of these is the thousand talents plan established in 2008 which offers top scientists and scholars across a number of disciplines financial incentives to come to china to teach or do research tuesday s report alleges that a number of fed officials participated in the program or had relationships with a former fed official who did the report lays out five case studies that outline contacts that fed employees had with chinese officials and institutions including multiple universities in 2021 the fed instituted a new rule barring employees from accepting any outside compensation from restricted countries including china individual a the most troubling of the case studies focuses on a federal reserve bank economist identified as individual a the report alleges that in 2019 while visiting china he was detained on four separate occasions by chinese officials the officials threatened individual a s family allegedly tapped his phones and computers and copied the contact information of other fed officials from individual a s wechat account according to the report in addition they threatened him with imprisonment and demanded he share sensitive nonpublic data about the u s economy and fed policies including information about the deliberations of the federal open market committee which sets u s interest rates the fed reported the incident to the federal bureau of investigation and issued a warning to all of its economists about traveling to china

i resisted the enthusiasm surrounding cryptocurrencies on the codger s grounds that i distrust anyone who comes up to me with a sales pitch that says look i ve invented new money please give me all of yours because mine is prettier i have held to this axiom even through all those spiffy tv commercials about how crypto is the new roman empire or whatever the folks at marketwatch have collected some of the appeals from investors who lost everything when the celsius network cratered and are asking the bankruptcy court of the southern district of new york for help getting some of their assets back it makes for some very hard reading a social media thread on reddit emerged about a week ago to show how celsius clients can contact the bankruptcy court and trustee it isn t clear if the posting has been a catalyst of individual letters to the court flori ohm a single mother of two daughters headed to college next year wrote in another letter i and my family are severely impacted both in financial and mental health by the bankruptcy and locked up cryptos i always check the app if my cryptos are still there i can t focus my job or sleep stephen bralver another celsius customer said he has less than 1 000 left in a wells fargo checking account to support his family after celsius froze all withdrawals bralver called for a release of his funds with celsius saying that this is an emergency situation simply to keep a roof over my family and food on their table then again of course yet the celsius bankruptcy hasn t shaken some crypto investors confidence in the rather nascent asset class i still have full faith in crypto but do not have faith in the management of celsius with the current team wrote customer brad ungar in his letter to the bankruptcy court this has been the sad human denouement of all the similar stories that have occurred since capital forged its alliance with government wherein government agreed to less regulation and capital agreed to help elected members of government stay elected members of government in the 1980s and 1990s the savings loan scandal crisis ruined the lives of thousands of citizens most famous among these swindlers was charles keating whose lincoln savings and loan cost the government more than 3 billion ruined some 23 000 investors and damn near ended the careers of five members of congress including the late sen john mccain of course deregulation and go go financial prospecting went merrily on right through the stock market collapse in 1987 when the mergers and acquisitions fever and the hostile takeover piracy not only cost thousands of jobs but also nearly brought the entire financial system to complete collapse through a liquidity crisis and this was merely a dress rehearsal for the near catastrophe of 2007 2008 all of this history is built on a foundation of anonymous human misery the kind that the financial reforms passed in the wake of the 1929 crash were supposed to ameliorate there is more than a little hint of an iron caveat emptor fist inside the velvet free market glove attempts to control advertising for risky investment schemes devolve into arguments over the free speech rights of bunco artists people who defaulted on their mortgages after being sold a trap laden arm during the housing boom now are replaced by young people being gouged by student loan servicers democrats in congress have rumbled about some sort of legislation to break this boom and bust cycle sen amy klobuchar has taken the lead on reinvigorating antitrust legislation sen elizabeth warren has fastened her pitiless gaze on the crypto networks tying it on a string with all the other adventures in financial deregulation from politico the banks have not served the american public well warren told reporters when asked if she sees any societal benefits to crypto there s a reason that crypto takes hold in some areas because the banks have continued to impose fees on transactions at a time when the cost of transactions should be dropping fast however substituting an unregulated unverified system in which scammers and cheats and terrorists mix in with ordinary consumers and no one can tell who s on the other side of a transaction is not a safe substitute it s worth reading the letters from the celsius investors they speak for all of us in one way or another related story crypto commercials were all over the super bowl

shocking breach of faith by a company that sends workers inside millions of homes every year trial lawyer chris hamilton of dallas based firm hamilton wingo said in a written statement in a news

negligence and reckless misconduct for the safety of the american public we can only hope that charter spectrum and its shareholders are listening as it did when the compensatory damages were announced charter said tuesday that it would appeal the jury s decision to put the 7 billion award in perspective it is larger than the entire market value of many of the largest corporations in the

utility knife supplied and went on a spending spree with her credit cards the attorneys said trial testimony showed that charter hired holden without verifying his employment history which would have

management for help because of his distress over financial and family problems they said the thomas family s attorneys also said in the news release that after the family filed a lawsuit charter used a forged document to try to force the lawsuit into closed door arbitration in that scenario the results would have been secret and damages for the murder would have been limited to the amount of thomas s final bill they said the jury found that charter committed forgery beyond a reasonable doubt conduct that constitutes a first degree felony under texas law they added charter denied that it

muji is still touting products made with xinjiang cotton and not only in china where the japanese retailer has publicly voiced its support for the fiber despite widespread concern that it s being harvested and processed by persecuted muslim minorities in stores across singapore oxford shirts shirtdresses and blouses were spotted with tags advertising the cotton s xinjiang origins though the products themselves were cut and sewn either in china or vietnam muji singapore s website however elides any mention of xinjiang where human rights groups say more than a million uyghurs kazakhs and other turkic ethnic groups are being held in so called reeducation camps as part of a broader campaign of religious and cultural oppression that many have dubbed genocide this stands in contrast to muji s chinese website where reference to xinjiang is liberal unlike a growing number of countries the southeast asian nation doesn t place any import restrictions on goods made with suspected forced labor the united states recently established a rebuttable presumption that bars all goods manufactured in whole or in part in xinjiang or by an entity on the uyghur forced labor prevention act uflpa entity list from entering the market the import of products tainted with forced labor has been illegal in canada since last july when it amended its customs tariff following the passage of the united states mexico canada agreement the european union is looking at tightening up its modern slavery laws as are australia and new zealand but as muji s example shows such efforts are far from universal neither have government mandates and civil society pressure dissuaded all apparel brands from sourcing from xinjiang in the fight to stamp out modern slavery this could prove a problem experts say it s a very stark reminder of the need for global alignment on import bans mandatory human rights due diligence and measures to hold violators to account allison gill forced labor program director at the global labor justice international labor rights forum a member of the coalition to end forced labour in the uyghur region told sourcing journal the uflpa is clearly having an impact she added according to data from the china national cotton information center sales of ginned xinjiang cotton through mid june have plummeted 41 percent from the same period in 2021 even as the production and sales of cotton globally have remained stable otherwise until companies apply a single standard on their supply chain instead of bifurcating them into clean products for the united states and tainted ones for other markets that impact will remain limited muji which sells similar products in the united states declined to comment on how it complies with uflpa regulations nor would it answer if other markets besides singapore and china promote xinjiang cotton besides the singapore dollar other currencies printed on the tags sourcing journal examined include the australian dollar the indian rupee the indonesian ringgit and the philippine peso if muji is bifurcating its supply chain and thereby directing goods made of xinjiang cotton everywhere but the us then that is beyond disreputable scott nova executive director of the worker rights consortium another member of the coalition to end forced labor in the uyghur region told sourcing journal however it is also entirely possible that there is no bifurcation and that muji is sending such goods to the u s as well in violation of the uflpa either way muji s approach should make it a subject of intense scrutiny by u s regulators in stores across singapore oxford shirts shirtdresses and blouses were spotted with tags advertising the cotton s xinjiang origins though the products themselves were cut and sewn either in china or vietnam sourcing journal the ryohin keikaku owned company said the products in singapore were old stock from 2020 and no longer in production muji also conducts annual audits by third party organizations in line with conventions established by the international labor organization the united nations guiding principles on business and human rights and the organization for economic cooperation and development due diligence guidance for responsible business conduct it said ryohin keikaku believes that its most important responsibility is to respect the fundamental human rights of all people involved in its supply chain around the world and to ensure their physical and mental health security and safety a spokesperson told sourcing journal in our business activities we comply with the laws and regulations of each country and region and we are taking all necessary steps to respect human rights and manage labor standards when asked if muji presented any red flags customs and border protection cbp said it does not publicly comment on conditional business information it s possible the retailer may already be on the radar import data reveals that muji u s a received shipments from esquel garment manufacturing in vietnam as recently as may the company is part of esquel group a hong kong apparel giant that has been battling to remove its xinjiang based changji esquel textile co subsidiary from the department of commerce s entity list for suspected forced labor links albeit to no avail in september esquel accused cbp of using its entity list status to target its vietnamese shipments imperiling its contractual obligations and resulting in permanent economic and reputational damages changji is also named on the uflpa entity list which esquel railed against last week as misguided and unjust esquel didn t respond to an email asking if any of the cotton in its muji u s a shipments can be traced to changji or xinjiang it previously said however that its vertically integrated end to end supply chain allows it to meet all international standards for its products while preventing the sale or export of goods in jurisdictions where they are outlawed still there is a need for very robust enforcement of the uflpa to be sure that companies like muji that clearly continue to use cotton tainted with forced labor don t slip through the cracks gill said cbp has made it clear that companies will have to show significant evidence to overcome the presumption including complete supply chain information it would be interesting to know how muji can credibly show that its u s supply chain is completely free of xinjiang origin materials muji s blatant support for xinjiang as gill described it could come down to avoiding the wrath of chinese consumers who have lashed out against brands such as adidas and nike for shunning the region h m which recently shuttered its shanghai flagship vanished from chinese e commerce sites such as tmall and jd com last summer after voicing concern about forced uyghur labor a similar boycott would strike a significant blow at muji which makes more than 40 percent of its net sales from the market according to its 2021 annual

anthropologist who specializes in china s crackdown on uyghurs said that it s clear that beijing is looking to shift the movement of xinjiang cotton from an increasingly hostile west to its own domestic market and those in southeast and central asia particularly those involved in the massive infrastructure project known as the belt and road initiative where economic concerns dominate it is not illegal for companies to sell xinjiang products elsewhere meaning they can create an internally bifurcated supply chain to supply different markets according to respective regulations zenz told sourcing journal even detained shipments in the united states can be reclaimed and dispatched elsewhere still xinjiang cotton which makes up roughly 85 percent of china s supply of the fiber could be facing a more existential threat climate change reuters reported saturday that xinjiang authorities have warned that drought born from above normal summer temperatures could jeopardize agriculture in the province during a critical growing season chen chunyan chief expert at the xinjiang meteorological observatory told state media that extreme weather in the southern and eastern parts of the region has already lasted some 10 days with temperatures in aksu bazhou hotan and kashgar potentially exceeding 104 degrees fahrenheit dry hot days could also impact cotton crops which require extensive irrigation she noted meanwhile continued high temperatures have accelerated glacial melting in mountainous areas causing natural disasters such as flash floods mudslides and landslides in many places chen said the melting ice could also pose a high risk of dam failure on a tributary of the aksu river near china s border with kyrgyzstan where cotton is an important commodity

fed chair jerome powell and a senior member of congress are at odds over a report issued tuesday by senate republicans alleging that china is trying to infiltrate the federal reserve and that the central bank has done too little to stop it the report by members of the republican minority of the senate homeland security and governmental affairs committee alleges that china has used promises of lucrative teaching and research contracts to try to entice economists working at more than half of the system s 12 federal reserve banks to share nonpublic information about economic forecasts and monetary policy decisions with chinese officials china s goal according to the report is to supplant the u s as the global economic leader and end the u s dollar s status as the world s primary reserve currency in one case the report alleges that a fed economist was detained while traveling in china and threatened with arrest and retaliation against his family if he did not cooperate file a news conference with federal reserve chairman jerome powell is displayed on televisions while traders work on the floor at the new york stock exchange in new york june 15 2022 variety of contacts while the report paints an alarming picture many of the details provided about fed officials contact with chinese officials are not obviously nefarious the central bank s researchers and officials regularly correspond and meet with their counterparts around the world often exchanging information when they do so however some of the activity described is clearly suspicious including one fed employee who was found to be researching articles on the prosecution of economic espionage and who used a modified version of the name of chinese president xi jinping as one of his computer passwords the report lays out five case studies that go into detail about unnamed fed officials contacts with china the report notes that the fed investigated the activities of the individuals involved to determine whether any information was provided to china in violation of fed policy in all five cases the investigation did not identify any policy violations nevertheless the report alleges that the central bank has fallen short in responding to china s alleged efforts at infiltration saying that the fed lacks sufficient counterintelligence expertise and cooperation with u s law enforcement and the u s intelligence community it also claims that the fed s policies and procedures are insufficient to counter the threat of chinese infiltration and criticizes the central bank for allowing employees to retain access to sensitive information after learning of their connections with chinese organizations file senator rob portman talks to reporters as he takes a senate subway train on capitol hill in washington july 30 2021 i am concerned by the threat to the fed and hope our investigation which is based on the fed s own documents and corresponds with assessments and recommendations made by the fbi wakes the fed up to the broad threat from china to our monetary policy said senator rob portman the ranking republican on the committee the risk is clear i urge the fed to do more working with the fbi to counter this threat from one of our foremost foreign adversaries strong fed response the report generated a forceful rebuttal from powell who said the central bank s staff are well aware of their obligations to keep sensitive information secret in a letter addressed to portman powell wrote because we understand that some actors aim to exploit any vulnerabilities our processes controls and technology are robust and updated regularly we respectfully reject any suggestions to the contrary powell a republican who was appointed fed chair by former president donald trump in 2018 also took issue with the report s description of the activities of a number of individual fed employees saying that the central bank is deeply troubled by what we believe to be the report s unfair unsubstantiated and unverified insinuations about particular individual staff members chinese government response chinese officials criticized the report saying it reflects outdated thinking about the relationship between the two countries in a statement emailed to voa liu pengyu spokesperson for the chinese embassy in washington said the remarks of the relevant u s congressmen are full of cold war zero sum thinking and ideological prejudice he added the cooperation between china and the u s in economic financial and other fields is open and aboveboard which has played an important role in enhancing mutual understanding and mutual trust between the two countries the u s should take off its colored glasses and stop disrupting local and non governmental exchanges between the two countries talent recruitment programs portman has previously led other investigations into china s use of talent recruitment programs to develop connections with u s scientists and academics allegedly in the service of obtaining proprietary information and technology the most prominent of these is the thousand talents plan established in 2008 which offers top scientists and scholars across a number of disciplines financial incentives to come to china to teach or do research tuesday s report alleges that a number of fed officials participated in the program or had relationships with a former fed official who did the report lays out five case studies that outline contacts that fed employees had with chinese officials and institutions including multiple universities in 2021 the fed instituted a new rule barring employees from accepting any outside compensation from restricted countries including china individual a the most troubling of the case studies focuses on a federal reserve bank economist identified as individual a the report alleges that in 2019 while visiting china he was detained on four separate occasions by chinese officials the officials threatened individual a s family allegedly tapped his phones and computers and copied the contact information of other fed officials from individual a s wechat account according to the report in addition they threatened him with imprisonment and demanded he share sensitive nonpublic data about the u s economy and fed policies including information about the deliberations of the federal open market committee which sets u s interest rates the fed reported the incident to the federal bureau of investigation and issued a warning to all of its economists about traveling to china

to investors as key supplemental measures of its performance ffo noi affo ebitdare and adjusted ebitdare these non gaap financial measures should be considered along with but not as alternatives to net income or loss as a measure of the company s operating performance ffo noi affo ebitdare and adjusted ebitdare as calculated by the company may not be comparable to other companies that do not define such terms exactly as the company ffo the company calculates ffo in accordance with the standards established by the national association of real estate investment trusts or nareit nareit defines ffo as net income loss calculated in accordance with gaap excluding gains or losses from sales of depreciable operating property plus real estate related depreciation depletion and amortization excluding amortization of deferred financing costs and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures management presents ffo as a supplemental performance measure because it believes that ffo is beneficial to investors as a starting point in measuring the company s operational performance specifically in excluding real estate related depreciation and amortization and gains and losses from sales of depreciable operating properties which do not relate to or are not indicative of operating performance ffo provides a performance measure that when compared year over year captures trends in occupancy rates rental rates and operating costs the company also believes that as a widely recognized measure of the performance of reits ffo will be used by investors as a basis to compare the company s operating performance with that of other reits however other equity reits may not calculate ffo in accordance with the nareit definition as the company does and accordingly the company s ffo may not be comparable to such other reits ffo affo the company calculates affo by adjusting ffo to exclude the income and expenses that the company believes are not reflective of the sustainability of the company s ongoing operating performance including but not limited to real estate related acquisition and due diligence costs stock based compensation and incentive deferred impact of interest rate swap terminations and distributions on the company s series a preferred units for the avoidance of doubt 5 7 million non cash redemption of series b participating preferred stock in q4 2021 is not included in affo changes in gaap accounting and reporting rules that were put in effect after the establishment of nareit s definition of ffo in 1999 result in the inclusion of a number of items in ffo that do not correlate with the sustainability of the company s operating performance therefore in addition to ffo the company presents affo and affo per share fully diluted both of which are non gaap measures management considers affo a useful supplemental performance metric for investors as it is more indicative of the company s operational performance than ffo affo is not intended to represent cash flow or liquidity for the period and is only intended to provide an additional measure of the company s operating performance even affo however does not properly capture the timing of cash receipts especially in connection with full year rent payments under lease agreements entered into in connection with newly acquired farms management considers affo per share fully diluted to be a supplemental metric to gaap earnings per share affo per share fully diluted provides additional insight into how the company s operating performance could be allocated to potential shares outstanding at a specific point in time management believes that affo is a widely recognized measure of the operations of reits and presenting affo will enable investors to assess the company s performance in comparison to other reits however other reits may use different methodologies for calculating affo and affo per share fully diluted and accordingly the company s affo and affo per share fully diluted may not always be comparable to affo and affo per share amounts calculated by other reits affo and affo per share fully diluted should not be considered as an alternative to net income loss or earnings per share determined in accordance with gaap as an indication of financial performance or as an alternative to net income loss earnings per share determined in accordance with gaap as a measure of the company s liquidity nor are they indicative of funds available to fund the company s cash needs including its ability to make distributions ebitdare and adjusted ebitdare the company calculates earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization for real estate ebitdare in accordance with the standards established by nareit in its september 2017 white paper nareit defines ebitdare as net income calculated in accordance with gaap excluding interest expense income tax depreciation and amortization gains or losses on disposition of depreciated property including gains or losses on change of control impairment write downs of depreciated property and of investments in unconsolidated affiliates caused by a decrease in value of depreciated property in the affiliate and adjustments to reflect the entity s pro rata share of ebitdare of unconsolidated affiliates ebitdare is a key financial measure used to evaluate the company s operating performance but should not be construed as an alternative to operating income cash flows from operating activities or net income in each case as determined in accordance with gaap the company believes that ebitdare is a useful performance measure commonly reported and will be widely used by analysts and investors in the company s industry however while ebitdare is a performance measure widely used across the company s industry the company does not believe that it correctly captures the company s business operating performance because it includes non cash expenses and recurring adjustments that are necessary to better understand the company s business operating performance therefore in addition to ebitdare management uses adjusted ebitdare a non gaap measure the company calculates adjusted ebitdare by adjusting ebitdare for certain items such as stock based compensation and incentive and real estate related acquisition and due diligence costs that the company considers necessary to understand its operating performance the company believes that adjusted ebitdare provides useful supplemental information to investors regarding the company s ongoing operating performance that when considered with net income and ebitdare is beneficial to an investor s understanding of the company s operating performance however ebitdare and adjusted ebitdare have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of the company s results as reported under gaap in prior periods the company has presented ebitda and adjusted ebitda in accordance with nareit s recommendation beginning with the company s reported results for the three months ended march 31 2018 the company is reporting ebitdare and adjusted ebitdare in place of ebitda and adjusted ebitda net operating income noi the company calculates net operating income noi as total operating revenues rental income tenant reimbursements crop sales and other revenue less property operating expenses direct property expenses and real estate taxes less cost of goods sold since net operating income excludes general and administrative expenses interest expense depreciation and amortization acquisition related expenses other income and losses and extraordinary items it provides a performance measure that when compared year over year reflects the revenues and expenses directly associated with owning and leasing farmland real estate providing a perspective not immediately apparent from net income however net operating income should not be viewed as an alternative measure of the company s financial performance since it does not reflect general and administrative expenses interest expense depreciation and amortization costs other income and losses view source version on businesswire com james gilligan source farmland partners inc

if you ve ever driven through the rural areas of colorado you may have come across ranches or farms that have a pair of cowboy boots resting upside down on top of a fence post sometimes it s both boots and other times just one residents who place cowboy boots on fence posts aren t just decorating with a western theme in mind there s actually a meaning behind it according to classroom com there are actually several reasons why this may be done one explanation for a rancher hanging a pair of boots on the fence is to honor their bond with a horse on their farm it s no easy feat to train a horse and many ranchers have a deep relationship with these animals after breaking them in if the horse is sold or dies later in life a cowboy will often sacrifice a pair of boots to the fence to pay respect to their beloved equine phinehas adams unsplash another reason boots may be seen hanging on a fence is to honor a hired hand who has worked on the farm the idea stems from a pair of boots for every hand many ranchers invite workers to live with them on the property and help out in exchange for food housing and a small stipend once the helper moves on from the farm or sadly passes away the ranch owner will put boots on the fence in their memory in this scenario it s usually a pair of the employee s boots placed on the fence although it s probably not the brightest idea these days in former times boots on a fence meant that the workday was over and the farmer was back home when the shoes pointed toward the ranch gate it symbolized that the rancher was home if they were facing the other way it meant the rancher was out this was in the days before electricity and telephones existed so it was an easy way to let visitors know when they could stop by the tradition of boot hanging has been passed down for generations cowboys have a special attachment to their boots and once they become too worn for wear they often end up on a fence post it s common to see cowboy boots on fence posts in other parts of the country as well the western tradition holds the same meaning from state to state 16 things a true coloradan would never do

fed chair jerome powell and a senior member of congress are at odds over a report issued tuesday by senate republicans alleging that china is trying to infiltrate the federal reserve and that the central bank has done too little to stop it the report by members of the republican minority of the senate homeland security and governmental affairs committee alleges that china has used promises of lucrative teaching and research contracts to try to entice economists working at more than half of the system s 12 federal reserve banks to share nonpublic information about economic forecasts and monetary policy decisions with chinese officials china s goal according to the report is to supplant the u s as the global economic leader and end the u s dollar s status as the world s primary reserve currency in one case the report alleges that a fed economist was detained while traveling in china and threatened with arrest and retaliation against his family if he did not cooperate file a news conference with federal reserve chairman jerome powell is displayed on televisions while traders work on the floor at the new york stock exchange in new york june 15 2022 variety of contacts while the report paints an alarming picture many of the details provided about fed officials contact with chinese officials are not obviously nefarious the central bank s researchers and officials regularly correspond and meet with their counterparts around the world often exchanging information when they do so however some of the activity described is clearly suspicious including one fed employee who was found to be researching articles on the prosecution of economic espionage and who used a modified version of the name of chinese president xi jinping as one of his computer passwords the report lays out five case studies that go into detail about unnamed fed officials contacts with china the report notes that the fed investigated the activities of the individuals involved to determine whether any information was provided to china in violation of fed policy in all five cases the investigation did not identify any policy violations nevertheless the report alleges that the central bank has fallen short in responding to china s alleged efforts at infiltration saying that the fed lacks sufficient counterintelligence expertise and cooperation with u s law enforcement and the u s intelligence community it also claims that the fed s policies and procedures are insufficient to counter the threat of chinese infiltration and criticizes the central bank for allowing employees to retain access to sensitive information after learning of their connections with chinese organizations file senator rob portman talks to reporters as he takes a senate subway train on capitol hill in washington july 30 2021 i am concerned by the threat to the fed and hope our investigation which is based on the fed s own documents and corresponds with assessments and recommendations made by the fbi wakes the fed up to the broad threat from china to our monetary policy said senator rob portman the ranking republican on the committee the risk is clear i urge the fed to do more working with the fbi to counter this threat from one of our foremost foreign adversaries strong fed response the report generated a forceful rebuttal from powell who said the central bank s staff are well aware of their obligations to keep sensitive information secret in a letter addressed to portman powell wrote because we understand that some actors aim to exploit any vulnerabilities our processes controls and technology are robust and updated regularly we respectfully reject any suggestions to the contrary powell a republican who was appointed fed chair by former president donald trump in 2018 also took issue with the report s description of the activities of a number of individual fed employees saying that the central bank is deeply troubled by what we believe to be the report s unfair unsubstantiated and unverified insinuations about particular individual staff members chinese government response chinese officials criticized the report saying it reflects outdated

tampa bay fla according to the federal bureau of investigation cybercriminals are creating fake cryptocurrency investment platforms to steal people s money a report published last week by the fbi shows that since last year 244 people have fallen victim to fraudulent cryptocurrency investment websites losing a total of 42 7 million the fbi said these websites claim crypto investors owe taxes or fees and will threaten to take your money if you don t pay more which is what tampa bakery owner lorena brunson believes happened to her we make birthday cakes decorated sugar cookies fruit bouquets chocolate covered strawberries said brunson after retiring lorena brunson followed her dream and became the owner of beanie and bellies cupcakery in south tampa but covid hit her business hard wfts and i had lost my partner earlier this year so i was kind of struggling as far as money said brunson the bakery was in danger of going under and she needed help then last month out of nowhere she said it looked like she was going to get the break she needed her son joseph met someone on instagram who introduced him to investing through a cryptocurrency website and he was making money i wanted to make sure it was legitimate so i asked her if i could withdraw the funds and she showed me how to do it said joseph brunson he said after a week he was getting big returns so i was telling all my family members hey this is probably legitimate let s try to make some money off of this it might help said joseph so joseph s mother lorena started investing what she had been saving and at first she said it went well the money had doubled and was tripling and we thought this is great let s invest more she said they invested more but when they wanted to make another withdrawal they were told they needed to pay taxes or they would lose the money they had in their account so they scrambled to get the tax money even borrowing from friends and family i took cash advances from my credit card because i can return it back in a matter of days said lorena they say they paid 29 000 but were told that because they had help from others they had to pay a risk hedge fee and then we had two days to get them the 62 000 said lorena by this time they realized something was wrong so they filed a report with the police and fbi but it was already too late within a month lorena says she lost more than 100 000 and fears she will lose her bakery i m probably going to lose everything said lorena wfts she said the most frustrating part is the website is still active cryptocurrency expert armando pantoja said brunson s experience with the website follows a familiar pattern of cybercriminals they take the money the crypto from you and then they re able to manipulate the database on this made up website they can put whatever they want they could say you have 10 000 50 000 100 000 said pantoja he said the website operator threatened to take your money unless you paid more normally it s like you have to pay taxes or an international exchange fee they just come up with something for you to send them more money said pantoja the fbi said it s seeing many more cases and that the cryptocurrency world is still very new to most people that s the other thing with cryptocurrency it s still kind of the wild west said sundanah parsons fbi special agent special agents sundanah parsons and kelly shannon in tampa s fbi field office say that most crypto exchanges are not criminal still if a fraudulent case originates in a foreign country it presents a challenge criminals that may be located overseas or websites that may not be located here in the united states it takes time to work with foreign partners and coordinate on all of those investigative matters said shannon when it comes down to it experts say you need to look out for yourself pantoja said some red flags in the crypto world are people reaching out through social media a website that looks outdated has stretched images misspellings or oddly worded sentences being rushed to make quick decisions big returns an average return in the stock market is 9 anything above that you need to do your due diligence said pantoja which is something joseph says he wishes he had done more of it s heartbreaking because i ve never seen her lorena cry maybe more than once in my life that hurt a lot because she put all her trust in me said joseph for lorena she said she wants to pay back her friends and family and warn others i would hate to have to see someone else endure all of this you work hard for all you have your whole life and to have it all taken away in a matter of a month said lorena we sent a message to the company whose website displays brunson s crypto account there was no phone number only a gmail address we have not received a response by the time of this publication the fbi encourages people to report any cybercriminal activity to their nearest fbi field office wendi lane at wfts first reported this story

spike in macroeconomic uncertainty and braced for aftershocks of the u s federal reserve s expected 75 basis point rate hike bitcoin was recently trading at about 21 200 off slightly for the past 24 hours although it was down more than 5 earlier in the day the largest cryptocurrency by market value was changing hands over 24 000 as recently as last wednesday amid renewed investor optimism that inflation might have peaked and that the global economy was declining at a reasonable pace but the rally proved short lived as btc returned to the 18 000 to 22 000 range it has occupied since the first part of june at one point dipping below 21 000 on tuesday we re really stuck in this range paul eisma head of trading at crypto finance firm xbto group told coindesk tv s first mover program and we re waiting to see what the data is and what the fed really what their guidance is what they foresee ether was recently trading just above 1 440 off less than a percentage point from the previous day but well off its most recent high above 1 600 the second largest crypto by market cap after bitcoin rallied last week on optimism about the merge which would shift the ethereum blockchain from a more energy intensive proof of work model to proof of stake and investors increased appetite for risk a heightened level of options open interest relative to that of btc underscored this trend advertisement advertisement but ether s 10 plunge on monday represented its biggest dip in more than a month as the crypto broke from a six day trading range of 1 460 to 1 660 the focus has shifted to ether s 50 day moving average of 1 293 as coindesk senior markets reporter omkar godbole wrote however fairlead strategies founder and managing partner katie stockton wrote in a research note published monday that support could dip lower highlighting short term signs of investor exhaustion a pullback in ether may find initial support at the 50 day 1 293 but we expect an eventual retest of interim support 1 000 on the next down leg stockton wrote most other major cryptos fell deeply in the red with uni and sushi down more than 11 and 10 respectively at one point and sand dropping by more than 6 equities decline stock indexes suffered through a dreary day with the tech focused nasdaq declining nearly 2 and the s p 500 which has a tech heavy component and dow jones industrial

of rising prices for energy and fuel auto manufacturer general motors gm missed its estimates for profitability google parent alphabet goog reported its slowest quarterly sales growth in two years advertisement advertisement meanwhile the fallout from russia s unprovoked invasion of ukraine took a new but hardly unexpected turn with russia s announcement monday that it would cut gas flow through the pipeline that serves western europe rising energy prices have played a major role in inflation throughout the continent and has put european economies on edge brent crude oil a widely watched measure of energy prices edged up near 100 per barrel and its price has risen nearly 40 since the start of the year eisma noted the u s federal reserve s difficult position in combatting inflation without casting the economy into a deep rapid recession and investors understandable caution the reality is the fed is in a bind eisma said they have to have a balanced approach but they don t want inflation expectations to get embedded because that s more dangerous than putting the economy in a mild recession he added this is a tricky week if with so much event risk this week and volatility it s somewhat smart to either take some short term profits to see if sort of the dynamic has changed it s always smart to lessen risk going into the events that are coming in this week insights binance deserves some criticisms but it s not a ponzi scheme by sam reynolds advertisement advertisement binance s ceo is once again suing the media and this time he might have a case in the chinese edition of bloomberg businessweek published by hong kong based firm modern media cl bloomberg s profile piece on changpeng zhao originally used the term ponzi scheme in its headline the headline has since been changed but court documents captured the original which included the direct transliterated term for ponzi scheme 龐氏騙局 and not a less direct term that would leave some room for interpretation and debate this is strange because for all binance s flaws it being a ponzi is not something that even its fiercest critics would say advertisement advertisement binance s critics have pointed out that it has had at one time a lax know your customer anti money laundering kyc aml regime which is said to have made it a hub for illicit activity and a portal for sanctioned iranians to trade for its part binance responded by highlighting its dozens of new hires in its kyc aml department including a number of heavy hitters from the law enforcement community what might have been possible in binance s early days isn t going to happen under their watch is the mantra but for chinese readers ponzi scheme when speaking about crypto would be familiar territory in china state media often refer to it that way when mentioning crypto just scroll through stories on xinhua a state news service and you ll see crypto being referred to as a ponzi or a pyramid scheme the language is similar to how regulators in china describe it after all real ponzi schemes run rampant through the chinese traditional finance markets so regulators are undoubtedly concerned that this is the next major one advertisement advertisement as bloomberg businessweek s chinese edition is widely available within mainland china it could be that the editors at modern media cl chose to use aggressive but familiar language about crypto that would please authorities in china and the censors after all binance began its operations in china before leaving as the regulatory environment turned hostile zhao a canadian national is said to be persona non grata in the country 2020 lawsuit zhao is no stranger to suing the media on claims of defamation in 2020 binance sued forbes over the publication of language describing an alleged tai chi strategy that involved setting up a web of corporations to deflect regulatory scrutiny of binance s u s operations to its offshore counterparts binance denied the veracity of the document and said its provenance involved a pitch from a third party corporate services firm that was never implemented advertisement advertisement if the chinese version of bloomberg businessweek s headline was about money laundering or the tai chi document it would have an effective defense available to it in the form of qualified privilege a libel defense created by u k courts as a common law jurisdiction hong kong courts cite case law from the u k and this defense has been tried before that protects journalists from being found guilty of defamation even if they are wrong but have done a responsible amount of diligence in reporting in matters of public interest there s a right to be wrong not completely wrong of course but the defense will defeat a libel claim if despite the journalist s best efforts some facts or allegations turn out to be wrong or false as one legal academic put it tai chi and binance s web of ownership are matters of public interest and even if forbes sources were wrong there s still a defense available ultimately binance dropped the case but the firm still doesn t have a declared headquarters and for all that can be determined the exchange exists as an intricate web of offshore entities advertisement advertisement but that doesn t mean it s a ponzi scheme important events mining disrupt miami meta earnings q2 6 p

warned that monetary tightening along with spillover from the war in ukraine and covid 19 lockdowns in china could push the global economy to the brink of recession in the coming months and so central banks might be a little bit antsy about this and this is why when we look at the next year or so this is really going to be an environment that will test the mettle for central banks around the world gourinchas said will they be really ready to stay the course and keep their eyes on inflation and bringing it down 80s throwback if central banks do start easing policy before inflation is tamed gourinchas said there could be a repeat of the early 1980s when the fed then led by paul volcker backed off of monetary tightening as unemployment mounted in 1980 only to be forced into an even more punishing run of rate hikes later that year to finally crush inflation that precipitated a long and painful recession in 1981 and 1982 then the deepest since world war two with an unemployment rate that eventually hit 10 8 3 points higher than when the fed had taken its hiatus top stories get the latest headlines breaking news and columns there was an error please provide a valid email address

but your article continues below article content but unlike the volcker fed era today s central banks do not need to apply shock therapy to quell inflation but need to navigate a path to return to a neutral policy stance he said this is not about inflicting unnecessary pain on the u s economy or other economies gourinchas said neutral policy means one that is neither stimulating nor restricting the economy but if inflation persists and doesn t respond to withdrawal of support in a reasonable time central banks may have to push beyond neutral in a number of cases which may cause recessions the fed for one does anticipate its policy becoming restrictive by year end gourinchas a french born university of california berkeley economist who joined the imf in january said the path to bring down inflation without a recession is much narrower now especially in the united states asked whether the united states may be in a recession already he said the broader discussion is that the u s economy is cooling off it s cooling off significantly it s getting to the point where in 2023 fourth quarter to fourth quarter growth is going to be 0 6 unemployment might even rise during that period advertisement 4 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content the u s jobless rate last month was 3 6 near a half century low gourinchas cited china s slowdown due to covid 19 lockdowns as a major drag on the global economy he said the imf s forecasts anticipate a continuation of beijing s zero covid policies that have led to strict lockdowns chinese authorities have more recently found ways to adapt the economy so that lockdowns do not have as severe an impact on activity as they did in 2020 markets working amid a gloomy imf outlook gourinchas said there were a couple of bright spots including that financial markets have functioned well allowing currencies and asset prices to adjust to a changing environment markets have not seized up and there s a lot of differentiation in the market and this is really a sign of the strength of many of the emerging market economies that have improved their policy frameworks have improved their resilience their buffers over the years he said some commodity prices also have eased in response to the tightening of monetary policies including oil and some metals prices that was one of the key drivers of inflation going up gourinchas said if these prices start coming down and they start coming down a lot that will be a key driver of inflation moderating or easing going forward so we might be having a scenario where inflation might be coming down faster than we anticipated reporting by david lawder editing by dan burns and leslie adler article content share this

oilfield services companies are among the biggest winners as demand soars on a favorable mix of exploration and offshore activity when the energy crisis hit a nadir two years ago highly indebted american oil and gas companies quickly changed their playbook adopting stricter cost discipline cutting back on expensive drilling programs and vowing to return more cash to shareholders in the form of dividends and buybacks luckily for them the good times are here again with high oil and gas prices helping to massively improve their balance sheets however many shale companies have so far been reluctant to go back to their trigger happy drilling days preferring instead to fall back on their dwindling stocks of drilled but uncompleted wells ducs to keep going indeed according to the u s energy information administration s latest drilling productivity report the united states duc tally plunged to 4 245 in june 2022 a sharp drop from 8 900 at its peak in 2019 the large decline in ducs clearly shows that u s oil companies are drilling much less which does not bode well for revenue starved oilfield services companies it also does not help that oilfield services and drilling companies had some of the most high risk debt during the crisis but that could soon become a thing of the past if the latest announcement by ofs major schlumberger ltd nyse slb is any indication on friday the houston texas based company raised its full year revenue guidance following a strong q2 at which time it announced that growth was very broad across all dimensions schlumberger says it now sees sales of at least 27b this year good for an 18 increase from 2021 citing the biggest jump in demand for its services in more than a decade schlumberger says annual sales will rise the most in 11 years as energy security concerns outweigh recessionary fears among major oil explorers growth was broad based characterized by a favorable mix of exploration and offshore activity and the increasing impact of improved pricing resulting in the largest sequential quarterly growth since 2010 ceo olivier le peuch revealed during the company s earnings call schlumberger posted q2 revenue growth of 42 to 1 53b in its north american market while its international market recorded a 15 y y expansion to 5 19b total revenue of 6 77b 20 2 y y beat by 490m while gaap eps of 0 67 increased 86 sequentially and 123 year on year earlier there were fears that ofs majors like schlumberger halliburton nyse hal and baker hughes nasdaq bkr would be among the first victims of the ukraine crisis due to their sheer size and brand recognition indeed rystad energy s head of energy services research audun martinsen told the financial times that their smaller peers were more likely to continue operating under the radar because they are not directly exploiting or exporting oil and natural resources however the latest set of results by slb proves that these fears were unfounded slb stock has surged 8 after the announcement bringing its year to date gains to 11 3 source the financial post source y charts growing production schlumberger s robust growth is not an isolated case oil explorers across the globe are rapidly expanding the search for crude and natural gas on land and at sea in the sector s most bullish forecast yet schlumberger compared the current era to the heady days of 2008 when oilfield

an adult beagle awaits a checkup sunday at the helen woodward animal center in rancho santa fe before heading a foster home they re among more than 4 000 beagles seized last week from a medical testing breeding lab in virginia every year the helen woodward animal center takes in and re homes about 4 000 rescued dogs cats and other animals but there s never been any rescues quite like the 43 adult beagles who arrived at the rancho santa fe shelter over the weekend from virginia raised in cages as breeding stock for medical testing labs the underfed under loved and unsocialized dogs will have to spend some time in foster homes to learn the basics of living their lives as dogs before they re ready for forever homes said jessica gercke public relations director for helen woodward the dogs are among more than 4 000 adult beagles that were seized earlier this month by the humane society of the united states hsus from envigo rms a breeding center in cumberland va that sells puppies to laboratories for animal experimentation although this lab animal breeding industry is legal envigo agreed to give up its dogs after the u s justice department sued the company for allegedly committing more than 70 violations of the animal welfare act the hsus has called the seizure the largest operation in its history advertisement two rescued beagles await a medical check in sunday at the helen woodward animal center in rancho santa fe they re among more than 4 000 beagles seized earlier this month from a medical lab breeding center in virginia earlier this month nancee e lewis for the san diego union tribune according to the lawsuit which followed a seven month undercover operation the dogs at envigo were denied veterinary treatment food and protection from both extreme cold and attacks by other dogs there were also allegations of overcrowding and unnecessary and cruel euthanasia practices unfortunately this is not as uncommon as we d like it to be gercke said we found out the other day there are 10 000 facilities like this in the u s we hope this will encourage these types of facilities to be wary of the inhumane treatment these dogs were receiving because of the scope of the seizure the hsus has enlisted the help of 15 no kill animal shelters across the country to help find homes for the dogs including helen woodward and priceless pets in orange county the dogs are being removed from the envigo facility in batches of roughly 400 at a time to avoid overwhelming the participating shelters helen woodward could receive as many as 400 beagles over the next few months which gercke said is a big responsibility because they will all need to be spayed or neutered and will need training and fostering a rescued beagle cautiously approaches a dish of food on sunday at helen woodward animal center in rancho santa fe which has taken in 43 of the more than 4 000 beagles seized earlier this month from a medical testing breeding center in virginia nancee e lewis for the san diego union tribune gercke said beagles are a popular choice for medical testing because they have docile personalities and few genetic health problems she said that when the beagles arrived at helen woodward over the weekend they were quiet sweet and friendly but they were unfamiliar with basic habits of domestic pets because they have never lived outside a cage none of the dogs are potty trained they also have never slept on a bed or couch never played with a toy never stepped on grass never walked on a leash nor eaten out of a dog bowl also because the dogs have always been surrounded by other dogs they are now experiencing separation anxiety shelter staff and foster families are training the dogs to cope with being left alone in a room for a few minutes at a time they re very loving little dogs gercke said we re surprised at how gentle they are with humans people expect them to howl or bark but what stands out is how quiet they are the first 43 dogs 30 females and 13 males ranging in age from 2 and 9 years have undergone medical treatment and are now in foster care after some socialization training and spaying the dogs will be put up for adoption some may be ready as soon as this weekend gercke said there has been tremendous interest from the public about adopting the beagles but center staff plan to vet new owners carefully because they will need to commit the time to potty training the dogs these dogs will be the most loving sweet pets but they will need patience and people to work with them she said the worst thing we could do would be to adopt the dogs out and people end up sending them back these dogs have been through enough they need this to be their forever home to fill out adoption paperwork become a foster caregiver donate to the care and spaying of the beagles or donate to an amazon wish list for beagle toys bedding and other supplies visit animalcenter org
earlier this month on 4 july the left leaning publication new frame suddenly announced it was shutting up shop taking the south african media by surprise launched in august 2018 the non profit seemed flush almost all of the money came discreetly and indirectly from a sole benefactor the us tech mogul neville roy singham the publication paid good salaries to a team of about two dozen journalists offered highly competitive rates for freelancers and operated out of spacious offices in central johannesburg in its four years of existence new frame spent r122 million as recently as late january or february editor in chief richard pithouse promised staff that funding was secured for an improbable 20 years i mean that s just unheard of he told staff in a meeting that was recorded funding cycles are normally three years or five years assuming we don t do something crazy and mess it up that money is there we re in an extraordinarily lucky position at the same time pithouse confirmed what everybody at new frame already understood singham s central role our funder and of course we re not directly funded by a person it s through funds he s set up and so on but you know where our money comes from it comes from roy singham not all of it but definitely most of it but in the next few months budget cuts were announced first the freelancer budget was to be trimmed then it was 20 across the board and then the plug was pulled entirely the sudden decision to step back was announced in an editorial by pithouse but this only raised more questions than it answered not least from the retrenched journalists themselves who felt they were owed a full account staff wanted to know why the tap was shut off so abruptly and why despite their offers to assist there appeared to be no genuine effort to source funds from other donors amabhungane s investigation suggests that the failure to diversify funding streams may have been by design a feature not a flaw and that the publication though presented as independent was actually suspended in a golden cage created by its benefactor although pithouse insists that new frame maintained staunch editorial independence singham appears to operate within a different paradigm one that suggests a more interventionist political agenda new frame sat within a global network of media think tanks unions and political parties tied to singham as funder in south africa the national union of metalworkers of south africa numsa the largest single union in the country with a reputation among the international left for its militancy became the centre point of singham s network around which the various other entities hovered including new frame disinformation machinery circumstantial evidence suggests that the singham network became an increasingly coherent political project intertwined with the propaganda and disinformation machinery of certain state actors most importantly the chinese communist party in the process singham s role in numsa and his relationship with its general secretary irvin jim also became controversial pithouse has responded to public criticism and questions from media including amabhungane in a series of lengthy letters and an opinionista piece in daily maverick alleging that new frame s management and funder are the victims of conspiracies and political point scoring from the sectarian left a space well known for being riven with paranoia and bitter enmity read his full response to amabhungane s questions below yet it is hard to conceive of a more paranoid response than the intensely personal attacks launched on one of the authors of this article reddy following the delivery of questions from amabhungane about singham new frame and numsa in one of his letters pithouse says reddy is widely perceived across the fractious south african left to be embedded in one faction of the left a faction involved in intense contestation over the future of the trade union movement and therefore not as an independent journalist as this article was being edited numsa s jim issued a rambling six page attack on reddy and amabhungane while failing to answer any of the questions posed about singham and his network meanwhile pithouse paints much of the criticism against new frame and its funder as malicious slander and racist attacks from a small but vociferous faction of embittered ex staff on singham pithouse says they first met in 2017 and talked about a possible media project that would be broadly pro working class and pan african i haven t met him in person for years and he has never sought to discuss specific articles or more specific details of editorial policy with me however his unwillingness or inability to answer key questions around singham s decision to withdraw funding and explain the channels and contractual arrangements of new frame s opaque funding model leaves important questions lingering why did the funder so quickly fall out of love with the publication that had been his darling could new frame s demise have been because it was no longer politically useful attempting to answer these questions has led to a worldwide tour of entities and individuals seemingly built around singham s funding new frame among them this dense network seems to have taken on its funder s pro china political bent although here new frame appears to have been the odd one out never entirely falling into line with the ideological boundaries that came to define the network singham did not respond to detailed written questions singham s network from the us to sa singham is a 68 year old us tech tycoon and the son of a prominent intellectual he made a fortune through thoughtworks a software design and it consulting company which he founded in the early 1990s in 2017 singham sold his company to uk based apax for an undisclosed sum at the time thoughtworks had 4 500 staff spread across 45 offices in 15 countries it was taken public late last year and has a market cap today of about 4 6 billion thoughtworks in south africa provided singham with his entry point into numsa the union and later its political party offshoot the socialist revolutionary workers party srwp became central nodes in singham s network of moneyed influence around which a number of singham linked entities began to orbit in 2016 thoughtworks began doing pro bono work for numsa conducting a membership survey and updating the union s it systems for managing membership and subscriptions thoughtworks employees were effectively seconded to the union among them vashna jagarnath pithouse s former partner and a close confidante of numsa general secretary jim who is also the chair of the srwp this arrangement according to one former thoughtworks source gave singham his in to numsa the year 2017 when singham sold thoughtworks marked a turning point in a blog post about the sale from august that year thoughtworks chief scientist martin fowler cited singham s increasing involvement in his activist work as one of the reasons for the sale i saw spend more energy on his activist work it was apparent it would be appealing to him to accelerate that activism with the money that selling thoughtworks would bring as an article in the online magazine new lines described several thoughtworks employees began jumping ship and turning up at various us based charitable organisations linked to singham these began funnelling money to his various causes across the world including new frame and others in south africa key among the us donor foundations is an organisation that received tax exempt status in the us in 2017 the people s support foundation psf according to us tax filings psf s president is singham s partner jodie evans who according to the new lines article established the entity with the help of chad wathington thoughtworks chief strategy officer thoughtworks former general counsel jason pfetcher is listed as a director and treasurer of the organisation and its secretary is jo anderson figueroa the psf provides grants from tax deductible donations it receives and from revenue from corporate stocks it holds the donations it receives come via the goldman sachs philanthropy fund a donor advised charity that conceals the original source of the funds from the public record the psf s tax filings for 2019 show it had assets of 156 393 895 and distributed 12 218 487 in charitable disbursements that year over 2018 and 2019 it channelled 1 87 million nearly r32 million at the current exchange rate to the centre for pan african media cpam the non profit that houses new frame a letter from cpam announcing the retrenchments of staff shows how reliant the organisation was on a single source of funds it stated that over the last six months it had received 99 9 percent of its funding requirements from one foundation and that it could not secure funding beyond the end of september cpam has three directors pithouse tariro takuva a former senior thoughtworks employee and neo bodibe bodibe is a longtime numsa staffer who sat on the boards of the numsa investment company and chaired one of its subsidiaries until november 2021 she is currently the general manager for employee relations at transnet bodibe told amabhungane my role as a member of the board of cpam was to provide advice and oversight on financial governance and hr matters the mandate of the board did not extend to editorial decisions and the board did not at any point influence the editorial direction of new frame the new lines article detailed a complex string of other funding vehicles run out of the us by people connected to singham their tax filings do not provide details on the organisations they fund outside the us though notably the new york based united community fund ucf contributed a total of 22 9 million to various unspecified entities and causes in sub saharan africa another major recipient of singham s largesse in south africa is pan africa today pat which received more than 2 5 million from the psf the non profit founded in 2016 has been involved in running numsa s political school in limpopo and providing political education to numsa members pat s directors are takuva jonis alasow a former student of pithouse at rhodes university numsa regional leader and senior srwp treasurer andile zitho and ngenda mwikisa second vice president of the zambian socialist party which singham is understood to back pan africa today appears to play an important role in bringing together various singham linked entities and initiatives a 2021 srwp report by jagarnath who serves as the deputy general secretary of the party notes that pat works with various organisations across the continent but its fundamental relationship is with the numsa socialist party of zambia and srwp the report notes pat s involvement in over 16 international schools and 4 international conferences and the non profit s role in the building of a pan african network of socialist organisations across the african continent the report also mentions that the srwp is part of the leadership core of an organisation called the international people s assembly ipa which bills itself as a sort of umbrella organisation for trade unions political parties and social movements its affiliates in africa are the srwp numsa the socialist party of zambia and the socialist movement of ghana singham is directly involved in the ipa and it appears to play an important coordinating role in his network of influence on 23 june 2018 a group of activists met in south africa to examine possibilities of using the experiences from the gdr for today s international struggles the gdr or german democratic republic is the former east germany the meeting included east german dignitaries and politically organized youth a numsa delegation and a contingent of representatives from various organisations linked to singham including pat s alasow and one franziska kleiner who was listed as a pat representative kleiner is a former lead for social and economic justice at thoughtworks in germany and is listed as the president of the ucf the singham linked new york entity that made large donations to sub saharan africa jagarnath participated in the meeting as the strategy adviser for the srwp and coordinator for the tricontinental institute of which more later also in attendance was singham who was listed as representing the people s support foundation and the international assembly he introduced the meeting to the rather loftily termed international assembly of organizations and movements of peoples working to rebuild an international movement to fight against capitalism and imperialism tellingly in the footnotes of the meeting report under the heading further projects is point e which states roy s invitation to the next chinese communist party congress the picture that begins to emerge is of a tightly woven network linked to singham and his money in which a coterie of activists academics and politicians close to him hold overlapping positions further evidence of this is seen in a south african non profit called common ground another cog in the singham machine which a new frame source believed was one of the funding vehicles for the publication common ground counts takuva as a director alongside two others one is kayla jacobs a former rhodes student whose linkedin profile describes her as the head of operations for various companies jacobs works for another company called gspan which appears to be linked to singham common ground s third director is anderson figueroa the secretary of the psf who appears to be embedded in the wider singham network in 2009 she was the recipient of a chinese government scholarship to complete her master s degree at jilin a leading university under the direct jurisdiction of china s ministry of education her thesis was titled the win win partnership between china and the caribbean after the cold war from the outside the boundaries between these organisations appear rather permeable with the same group of people linked to singham circulating between them seemingly as a conduit for singham s activism pithouse however stressed that new frame was insulated from the whims of its funder whom he says has never made a direct donation to new frame but instead supported foundations from which new frame has received funding i have never reported to singham or any other individual i report as is standard in donor funded organisations to a board that in turn sends proposals and reports to foundation boards singham does not sit on the boards of any of the foundations that he has supported however singham s influence and the role of chinese propaganda in his network become a little clearer when one looks more closely at the role of the tricontinental institute for social research an organisation which received 12 5 million from the goldman sachs philanthropy fund and 700 000 from the ucf the china connection the tricontinental is a research institute headed by prominent indian marxist academic vijay prashad focusing on the global south according to its website it has offices in latin america india and south africa and is a partner member of the international people s assembly it appears to play an important ideological role in singham s network as a bridge between academic production and political and social movements the research it generates is disseminated throughout the network informing the political positions and talking points of the various other organisations it is also the crucial link between singham s network and the chinese communist party s public relations infrastructure in tricontinental the party seemingly has a willing ally in china s communication operations and a means of implanting the party s official message within the international left the south african leg of the outfit a non profit company called the tricontinental pan africa includes takuva and bodibe as directors so too is phakamile hlubi she is numsa s spokesperson and was an electoral candidate for the srwp in 2019 kate janse van rensburg resigned as a director in 2019 she was also an srwp candidate mikaela erskog also resigned as a director in 2019 her twitter profile describes her as a researcher at tricontinental and a member of two other organisations associated with people in the singham network no cold war and dongsheng news she is also quoted as a spokesperson for srwp and has fronted for a number of pro china initiatives such as an event titled towards a multipolar world an international peace forum in 2021 and this year an event called china is not our enemy webinar a closer look at china in africa both were promoted by code pink a women s anti war activist organisation founded by evans singham s partner other sponsors of this year s event include the qiao collective and the people s forum the former describes itself as a diaspora chinese media collective challenging us aggression on china according to qiao collective s website the organisation aims to foster critical consideration of the role of china and socialism with chinese characteristics in contemporary geopolitics it routinely publishes articles that promote the chinese official narrative on issues from hong kong tiananmen square and the persecution of ethnic uighurs in xinjiang the people s forum is a cultural centre in manhattan which received 12 million from the psf in 2019 it shares an office with breakthrough news which the new lines article describes as a project spearheaded by rania khalek an apologist for syrian dictator bashar al assad khalek was previously a producer and host for maffick a media site which sued facebook after the social media giant posted an advisory comment on the maffick pages identifying it as russia state controlled media maffick filed an application for a temporary restraining order requiring facebook to take down the label a california court denied the application based on unrebutted evidence establishing that maffick had multiple ties to the russian government and known russian propaganda outlets again evans crops up as one of the people s forum s directors as the new lines article shows and amabhungane has independently verified the people s forum sits within a web of us based activist organisations and funding entities including the psf and ucf that are linked via money flows shared addresses and a familiar cast of characters connected to singham the media component of this network includes organisations like the people s dispatch the qiao collective breakthrough news and dongsheng news all of these media organisations share a similar editorial line consistently repeating official narratives of the chinese state and communist party by for instance legitimising china s persecution of ethnic uighurs as a fight against terrorism prashad the head of tricontinental looms large in this media ecosystem his widely syndicated articles faithfully toeing the chinese party line new frame also regularly carried prashad s pieces something that several former new frame journalists said led to unease among staff who objected to his partisan politics prashad did not respond to questions sent to him for this article however pithouse described him as a highly regarded writer held in high esteem by the likes of noam chomsky and angela davis he is published all over the world often in prestigious publications as with any writer one does not have to agree with everything that prashad writes to recognise that he is a major figure whose work often adds real value to public disputation the overlap between new frame and prashad s tricontinental ran deeper because pithouse wore two hats one as new frame s editor in chief and the other as an employee of tricontinental various websites to which he has contributed describe pithouse as a coordinator for tricontinental in south africa tricontinental has an office housed within new frame offices a glassed in cube as one new frame source put it commenting on the organisational overlap and the suggestion that new frame may not have been sufficiently insulated from the singham political network pithouse wrote new frame has always operated independently legally practically and editorially from the organisations that are mentioned in the list of allegations of course we did publish excerpts from some research by the tricontinental research institute but we did the same from a wide variety of sources including other research organisations new books from various publishers etc etc we did not publish excerpts from all the institute s research and there was no expectation that we would do so belt and road singham has a longstanding connection to china and a seemingly genuine ideological affinity for maoism and the chinese communist party ccp in 1971 as a 17 year old singham joined the league of revolutionary black workers in detroit which was heavily influenced by maoist thought in an email sent in august last year to staff at some of the organisations he funds singham said i have been following china since i was 14 years old the chinese and cuban revolutions defined my generation s attraction to liberation and socialism singham worked closely with chinese tech giant huawei as a consultant according to the new lines article and in 2005 thoughtworks opened offices in china sometime after selling thoughtworks singham moved from the us to china and currently owns or part owns a number of companies domiciled there in 2021 indian media reported that india s enforcement directorate named singham in a money laundering case against indian media portal newsclick and its people s dispatch website alleging that he was the key source of rs 38 crore about 5 million it received between 2018 and 2021 allegedly to promote a pro chinese narrative in the indian media the funds were alleged to have passed through a network of companies and ngos including us based worldwide media holdings allegedly owned by singham the justice and education fund one of the singham linked us foundations gspan llc and tricontinental ltd in the us and centro popular demidas in brazil india s ministry of home affairs went so far as to notify banks to flag ngo donations from these companies in terms of india s foreign contribution regulation act though it should be noted that the right wing indian government s blocking of foreign funding for certain ngos because of anti national activities has been widely criticised as muzzling dissent responding to the allegations contained in the indian press pithouse said i would also caution you to take great care with the claims made by the highly repressive and right wing indian state its hostility to donor funded ngos independent media and the left in general is well known prashad s own links to the chinese party state are significant given his role as a prominent ideologue within the singham network prashad is a senior non resident fellow at the chongyang institute for financial studies a think tank affiliated with beijing s renmin university the institute bills itself as a new style think tank with chinese characteristics and says it directs the chinese think tank cooperation alliance for the belt and road the belt and road initiative is the centrepiece of china s foreign policy in a sign of just how embedded chongyang is in chinese officialdom the institute and renmin co hosted an event last year organised by the people s government of xinjiang uighur autonomous region and the state council information office of the people s republic of china also known as the central propaganda department an important organ in the propaganda machinery of the chinese communist party notably two research fellows from tricontinental were listed as presenters one of them tings chak also served as the secretary of the new york based ucf and is a regular contributor to the pro china media platforms in the singham network a write up of the event shows that it was predictably a sanitised affair which uncritically promoted the chinese government line on xinjiang and entirely elided any mention of the persecution of uighurs this sort of staunchly pro china politics appears to have seeped into the various organisations of the south african sphere of singham s network in which new frame found itself and was a source of disquiet to at least some of its staff more than just friends singham s august 2021 email the one in which he explains his interest in china shines more light on his connections to the chinese establishment and the extent to which that influenced his network in it he urges recipients to attend an online lecture by li bo who singham writes is a very good friend of mine here li bo is an academic linked to the singham network as a representative of tricontinental in china he is the executive director of the shanghai chunqiu institute for development and strategic studies assistant dean at the china institute of fudan university and the academic representative of the guancha syndicate all three organisations appear to be part of the chinese propaganda machine linked to the party state guancha is a popular and influential chinese online news portal with a nationalist editorial line in a reporters without borders rsf study titled china s pursuit of a new world media order guancha is referred to as a chinese propaganda outlet one of the co founders of guancha is well known chinese venture capitalist eric li who has long been an apologist for china s authoritarian system li s many other roles include his chairmanship of the advisory committee of fudan s china institute where li bo is assistant dean among the 15 or so fellows at the china institute is alexander dugin the ultranationalist ideologue who is said to have laid the ideological groundwork for russia s invasion of ukraine and whose views have been described as fascist fudan is a leading university in china and was recently the subject of controversy after reference to academic independence and freedom of thought was removed from its charter and a new pledge was inserted to ensure the university would weaponise the minds of teachers and students using xi jinping s socialism ideology with characteristics of china in the new era asked by the financial times about the change to the university s charter li said for a period of several decades the chinese national has been debating what kind of government and society they want there are people who are liberals who want to be a liberal country i think that debate is over the china institute s director is another prominent advocate of chinese nationalism zhang weiwei li bo eric li and zhang again link up at the shanghai chunqiu institute for development and strategic studies where li bo is executive director eric li is vice president and zhang is a fellow the result of these overlapping relationships is a network of nationalist figures closely associated with the chinese party state li bo prashad s associate at tricontinental and singham s very good friend links this network to singham s with the latter having seemingly increasingly pivoted towards china influence in south africa coming full circle if singham is as enmeshed in the chinese party state and its propaganda apparatus as his network appears to be then how has this played out in numsa and the wider south african left and at a publication that not long ago held so much promise as a progressive voice in the media in recent months a heightened climate of conspiracy has clouded matters in numsa the union has been gripped by purges machinations and political mudslinging in the lead up to its national congress at the end of july last week the congress was interdicted by the labour court after a faction opposed to jim accused him of having purged dozens of officials seen to be critical of him and a threat to his power read on daily maverick numsa s interdicted national congress to proceed but a court challenge looms more than 50 officials including the union s second deputy president ruth ntlokotse had been banned from attending the congress where jim was up for re election much criticism of jim and his faction has centred on alleged abuse of power and claims of mismanagement and corruption involving the union s investment company funds but for years rumours have circulated about the mysterious foreign benefactor singham whose patronage was said to be aiding jim and his loyalists singham s name has been dragged into more recent fights in the union and srwp with a western cape branch of the party claiming that numsa s international activities are determined by ngos funded by singham and the union is adopting his maoist politics this means that structures driven by the funder are being put as future plans of numsa reads a letter from the shaun magmoed branch when new frame s closure was announced the rumours and conspiracy theories spilt over into new avenues giving rise to speculation about why singham suddenly terminated a publication that many numsa members considered theirs the letter from the srwp branch reads when the new frame was closed down overnight by sudden overnight stopping of funds by singham numsa offered no statement in defence of the publication nor of the staff and journalists there champion of the workers a more far fetched but widely circulated rumour is that singham ditched new frame because he is reprioritising his funding as part of a broader chinese communist party linked plan to consolidate the left in south africa numsa the srwp and the south african communist party and potentially certain social movements and elements of the anc are to be brought together behind some sort of united front and drawn closer into china s sphere of influence there is no evidence of such a coordinated plan but the rumour does at least point to a growing perception of chinese influence within numsa and the constellation of organisations floating around the union one individual rumoured to be involved in the conspiracy to reorganise the left on china s terms is former unionist politician and businessman phillip dexter dexter is not shy about his admiration for the chinese state and was a founding member of the african chinese people s friendship association in recent months dexter together with jagarnath has been involved in setting up an organisation called the pan african institute for socialism pais its facebook page states that pais will partner with pan africanism today and other like minded organisations to conduct research to do political education and to publish its work in july pais and tricontinental were among the organisers of a panel discussion on busting the myth of chinese neo colonialism in africa hosted at the forge a venue at the same address as new frame and tricontinental s south africa office one after another the event s speakers prashad dexter fred m membe of the socialist party of zambia and kwesi pratt of the socialist movement of ghana dutifully made the case for china in africa dexter told amabhungane i have always supported the chinese development path and continue to do so and while he acknowledged knowing singham he strongly denied that pais is linked to him pais has nothing to do with china singham or any other organisation it is independent funded by its founders staffed by volunteers and it focuses on propagating socialist ideas in africa the extent to which singham linked organisations such as tricontinental and pat have inserted themselves within numsa and the srwp could be the reason that overtly pro china stances on major international issues have crept into the policies and positions of the unions and party the international section of numsa s 11th national congress secretariat report of june this year is illuminating in two ways firstly in its uncritical support for china and russia including the latter s invasion of ukraine the report took a starry eyed view of chinese russia integration and the promise this would hold for anti imperialist forces to engage with an intention to build an alternative to the dominant imperialist force in the world namely the us secondly the report listed a range of singham linked organisations that have played a role in numsa pat tricontinental the people s forum and the forge the report also noted numsa s support of progressive media platforms such as peoples dispatch or new frame just weeks before the latter was shut down fallout after new frame s closure was announced its journalists and staff were quick to make claims of censorship alleging an editorial line aligned with its funders pro china leaning new frame was also accused of having been soft on russia pithouse told amabhungane that new frame was an emphatically editorially independent publication adding that it operated independently from the individuals and organisations named in amabhungane s questions to him he has made a plausible case that there was no censorship at new frame at least not overtly citing articles critical of russia and china he told amabhungane it is true that we did not publish a substantive piece on xinjiang after all there are numerous regions and issues around the world that we have not published on including many in africa for the simple reason that we didn t have writers in these places and never received pitches from people who wished to write on these issues in his opinionista piece in daily maverick he said anxiety with regard to our coverage of china first emerged among a tiny number of our staff members after the publication of an article in an obscure magazine at the beginning of this year referring to the new lines article regarding criticism of its partisan coverage of labour issues and domestic politics pithouse told amabhungane that no person who has participated in the activities of the srwp including vashna jagarnath my ex wife has ever had any influence directly or indirectly on our editorial process he said that out of 5 000 articles new frame published since august 2018 only nine of those mention the srwp 0 02 of our articles of the nine articles that mention the srwp seven only mention it in passing he attributed allegations that jim had sat in on an editorial meeting early in the life of new frame to a misunderstanding saying that new frame s offices were shared with two other organisations one of which has the specific task of working with activists across the continent and space has often been offered at no cost to other organisations jim he said was a participant in another meeting and inadvertently found himself in the new frame meeting pithouse s forceful and detailed defence of new frame s editorial policies however stands in sharp contrast with his coyness about questions around new frame s funding when pressed he has only admitted that singham has made contributions to foundations from which we have received support in his editorial announcing the closure pithouse almost seemed to be speaking for the funder whom he never named he wrote when funding for progressive projects and causes is available every rand spent on media is a rand that could be spent on another dimension of the struggle for a more just world including support for the people on the frontlines of resistance media is in relative terms very very expensive this raised eyebrows among new frame staff and despite lengthy letters and op eds pithouse has yet to give a full account of singham s sudden decision to pull the plug he has attributed the closure to new frame s very high costs for a very small audience it was clear that our costs were too high for the available funders our audience was too small for us to be able to attract significant funding and that there simply are no media funders available who could make up the r34 million that we needed to run new frame for a year yet new frame s high costs and low penetration were nothing new and pithouse has failed to explain why these factors were unconcerning and unaddressed earlier this year but considered fatal at the end of june as for those positing political reasons for the closure of new frame pithouse says a less kind interpretation is that they are punting conspiracy theory but in social media posts and speaking to amabhungane new frame staff say there was no meaningful attempt to attract new donors or diversify funding even after cuts were announced a social media post by one former journalist read new frame refused over many months numerous offers from staff to identify potential funders speak with our contacts in funding agencies and write funding proposals market the site consult experts in marketing write up the impact reports that other news sites provide to funders there was never a marketing or distribution plan at new frame at any point in the last four years staff were never given any hearing when we suggested ways to save money suggestions that the very large office be closed and staff work from home were rejected pithouse s failure to provide answers about the exact channels and contractual arrangements through which new frame was funded who took the decision to abruptly cut the funding and why and the reasons for not permitting a measured process in which alternative funding could be sourced leaves much to speculation like the srwp which performed dismally in the 2019 elections new frame did lack impact perhaps for singham it was simply no longer a worthwhile investment or if pithouse is to be believed and new frame maintained its editorial independence then maybe the publication was killed precisely because its reporters did not kowtow to the dogma prevalent in the rest of the singham network dm amabhungane is a nonprofit centre for investigative journalism we co publish our investigations which are free to access to news sites like daily maverick for more visit

refer to it as a tax to own a television currently 159 191 usd per year per household which in turn funds the bbc but does not fund any of the other broadcast channels which are mostly ad supported in 1961 kempton bunton jim broadbent a 60 year old man who has difficulties holding down a job in new castle began protesting this fee claiming it was too expensive for the elderly so much so that he removes the bbc coil from his television arguing that he should not have to pay then license fee if his television set cannot receive the bbc the general post office disagrees and after detecting that bunton s house has a tv but no license bunton is thrown into jail once he is released bunton sees on the news that the british government has purchased a painting of the duke of wellington by francisco de goya for 140 000 outraged at the waste of money not to mention his dislike for the duke thinking that the money could have better been used to cover tv licenses for seniors the irony of all of this is that bunton has been writing and submitting plays to the bbc which are constantly being rejected his wife dorothy helen mirren has had enough of his shenanigans and after he loses his job as a taxi driver she tells him that he needs to find a steady job once and for all and give up writing he agrees under one condition she grant him a two day trip to london to address parliament on the unfair tv license fees to seniors he is immediately thrown out of the parliament building upon his arrival but comes into possession of the duke of wellington portrait by goya his son jackie fionn whitehead helps him hide the painting in a wardrobe at the house and begins sending letters to the national gallery asking them to make a donation of 140 000 and in exchange he will return the painting of course the police think this was the work of a criminal mastermind possibly a group of art thieves and have no idea the theft was done on a whim by a commoner but there is an underlying story here both kempton and dorothy are still trying to come to terms with the loss of their 18 year old daughter after a tragic bicycle accident 13 years ago the source of many of kempton s manuscripts you can sense their underlying sadness as they go about their everyday lives and eccentricities thanks to brilliant performances by broadbent and mirren the duke was made very much in the style of the ealing comedies from britain in the 1950s and early 1960s directed by the late roger michell notting hill who passed away in 2021 after completing the film but before it was released theatrically earlier this year my only real issue with the film is that i felt it did not really connect the dots from bunton s antics and protests of tv license fees to the concession of those fees in the year 2000 to those over the age of 75 and makes no mention that the concession ended in 2020 video 5 5 3d rating na sony brings the duke to blu ray in a wonderful 1080p avc encoded transfer
