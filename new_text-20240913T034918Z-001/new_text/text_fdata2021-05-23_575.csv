scroll down to read more about this map scott ritter the day buy photo reprints stonington for the past three decades town dock fishermen and their counterparts across the northeast have struggled to stay afloat in the face of strict regulations designed to rebuild depleted stocks of cod flounder and other species some diversified turning to so called underutilized species such as squid and whiting to supplement their declining income while others retired or left for jobs on land but now that many of the species have rebounded and government regulators are increasing the amounts of fish they can land the fishermen face a new threat offshore wind power projects fishermen such as joe gilbert who owns four scallop and fishing boats based at the town dock say their concerns are being ignored by federal officials who are in the process of leasing massive tracts of ocean bottom off the northeast coast to wind power companies some of those tracts of bottom also happen to be areas where fishing boats land their catches and transit a lot of people sacrificed a lot to rebuild a sustainable fishery and keep stonington a vibrant fishing community gilbert said one recent day while sitting at the town dock and he stressed that he and other fishermen are not opposed to green energy projects just don t put it on prime fishing grounds he said we re racing forward with all these projects with no science this has never been done on this scale any place on earth the turbines are planned for relatively shallow areas which are placed to maximize the full potential of wind energy some of these areas also happen to attract fish gilbert added that it makes no sense to replace one renewable sustainable industry such as fishing with another one longtime town dock fisherman bob guzzo said the federal government is giving away land that fishermen have used to feed people for more than 300 years i d like to pass this on to someone else who wants to go fishing he said gilbert said that instead of federal regulators incorporating the fishermen s concerns into the lease agreements for the various wind power projects fishermen are being told to negotiate with each company individually that makes it easy for the companies to ignore the fishermen he said and it s also time consuming for fishermen who need to work it s just a process of checking all the boxes he said about the companies talking with fishermen we become collateral damage coalition speaks up last month members of responsible offshore development alliance or roda a national coalition of fishing industry members boycotted a meeting with a federal bureau of ocean energy management task force which is considering auctioning of 800 000 acres of new york bight shallow waters south of long island and east of new jersey to potential wind farm operators roda said its members feel they are not being listened to on april 6 roda said 1 665 members of fishing communities in every u s coastal state submitted a letter to the bureau of ocean energy management or boem and national marine fisheries service requesting a transparent and balanced national planning process for offshore wind development roda said offshore wind development poses direct conflicts with fishing and the current permitting process provides no meaningful opportunity to include the needs of sustainable seafood harvesting and production in strategies to mitigate climate change just before the federal government last week approved the vineyard wind i project the first large scale offshore wind farm in the country roda members requested that boem adopt reasonable and consistently requested fisheries mitigation measures for the project that project calls for erecting 62 turbines off martha s vineyard which will generate power for 400 000 homes after the approval roda said boem did not even consider any mitigation measures recommended by roda or any fisheries professionals scientists or natural resource managers despite having clearly defined requests available to them for the past decade fishermen have participated in offshore wind meetings whenever they were asked and produced reasonable requests only to be met with silence roda executive director anne hawkins said from this silence now emerges unilateral action and a clear indication that those in authority care more about multinational businesses and energy politics than our environment domestic food sources or u s citizens the vineyard wind i turbines were spaced 1 nautical mile apart after commercial fishermen and environmentalists expressed concerns vineyard wind developers also agreed to pay 37 7 million to commercial fishermen as compensation for future losses guzzo though said some fishermen feel it is more important that they are able to continue landing fish and feeding people than collecting money from developers or the government in addition to the leases under consideration for the new york bight seven leases also have been granted for waters south of martha s vineyard and southeast of block island which has it own small offshore wind farm to help power the island four of the leases are for the ørsted eversource cooperative which is developing state pier in new london into a staging area for their projects boem says it listens to fishermen in an email to the day boem spokesman stephen boutwell said the agency works with all ocean users and stakeholders including state and local governments coastal communities the u s military fishing and maritime communities and tribal governments throughout the offshore wind development process to avoid or reduce potential impacts from offshore wind energy development as for the complaints from fishermen that they have to discuss their concerns with the individual wind companies boutwell said that while fishermen are encouraged to discuss their concerns directly with the lessees prior to the lessee s submission of a plan to boem it is not a requirement to do so he said that throughout boem s environmental review process the fishing community has the opportunity to comment directly on the impacts the project may have to their business he added boem requires lessees to develop fisheries communication plans and hire liaisons to have discussions with fishermen the goal of boem s area identification process is to identify the offshore locations that appear most suitable for wind energy development taking into consideration coexistence with ocean users as part of this process boem removed areas of highest conflict from consideration the agency said last month the agency also plans to begin an environmental review with public input on these areas in federal waters for potential offshore wind leasing what are the concerns fishermen have a long list of safety and environmental concerns in addition to the turbines being located in some of their prime fishing grounds chief among them is that some of the projects call for the turbines to be spaced 0 67 mile to 1 mile apart far less than the 2 mile spacing and 4 mile wide transit lanes the fishermen say are needed gilbert explained that it is extremely difficult for boats to stay apart from one another within the 0 67 mile spacing while towing their gear especially in rough weather we re willing to share the ocean he said we just want them to intelligently place the turbines within the needs of a historic and proud industry gilbert said in bad weather when fishermen are trying to get home the corridors are not wide enough to safely transit additionally he said the spinning blades create radar scatter that can hide the presence of nearby vessels guzzo agreed with the potential radar problems and said the transit lanes through the bight are busy with ships going in and out of new york city boutwell said the turbine spacing and layout is considered on a project by project basis and each project must submit a navigational safety risk assessment which is developed based on the coast guard s guidance the coast guard additionally is involved in the review of the project plans asked if efforts are being made to move turbines out of fishing and transit areas boutwell said boem works with the coast guard and other maritime stakeholders to considers impacts to navigation and fishing in all stages of the leasing and development of projects prior to leasing he said boem removes areas overlapping charted shipping and vessel transit lanes and avoids areas with higher volumes of vessel traffic after the leases are issues he said boem encourages developers to work with the coast guard and other stakeholders to develop their navigation safety risk assessment as early as possible for example he said boem removed more than 900 000 acres of ocean bottom from consideration for leasing in the new york bight gilbert said national marine fisheries service scientists also have expressed concern that the turbines will disrupt the stratification of the water column which is essential to the ecosystem of fishing grounds he said the turbines also generate fog as they mix cold and warm air creating another safety issue the hundreds of turbines planned by ørsted eversource for their four projects south of martha s vineyard are 873 feet tall just 190 feet shorter than the eiffel tower with blades that have a diameter of 722 feet guzzo said he is worried the turbines will make fish such as flounder disappear from traditional fishing grounds gilbert said the rockpiles around the turbines also create an attractive habitat for black sea bass a voracious predator that feasts on juvenile lobsters crabs clams and shrimp lobster catches already have plummeted across southern new england over the past few decades due to warming waters decreasing oxygen levels and polluted runoff so while recreational anglers and charter boat captains are big fans of the tasty seas bass commercial lobstermen and shellfishermen are not guzzo said he is also worried about oil leaking out of the turbines something he said he has seen with the turbines off block island gilbert also criticized state and federal legislators for not coming out strong for us on the issue he said the fisherman face a tough road because environmentalists and lawmakers want to see more renewable energy projects j wojtas theday com

speculative excesses are starting to crack my base case is that speculative excesses have driven many markets too high too fast some markets that attracted massive speculative money flows have started to crack perhaps an early warning sign for other markets that remain near their highs i expect these initial cracks in speculative excess to ripple out to other markets jim rogers markets are interrelated a move in soybeans for example will have some impact on the bond market i remember interviewing jim rogers years ago and he asked how can you trade wheat in chicago if you don t know what s happening to iron ore in china perhaps the shanghai stock market which cracked earlier this year will impact north american markets bob hoye the speculative excesses that have driven many markets higher over the last year may well have been underwritten by massive fiscal and monetary stimulus there seems to be a strong correlation no kidding but there have also been stories and predictions and expectations and momentum and fomo in that regard my long time friend bob hoye likes to remind me that people will believe the most preposterous stories so long as prices keep going up time to call bullshit i like to call bullshit and i ve been looking for opportunities to short speculative excesses i will not short a market simply because i think it is ridiculously over priced valuation is not a timing took i will not short a market simply because i think it should go down for a list of reasons i watch for technical signs that it has stopped going up and may have started to go down bill fleckenstein i interviewed bill fleckenstein many years ago and introduced him to our radio audience as a short seller a guy who made profits from selling way overpriced stocks bill quickly corrected me no no victor i don t short over valued stocks they can easily get way more overvalued i short stocks that i have good reason to believe will fall and one of the best reasons to believe they will fall is that they are already going down sell things that are going down my p l is down small ytd because i ve shorted some markets that looked like they were turning lower but reversed and i was stopped out with small losses i ve been trading small size and using tight stops or option strategies because i have huge respect for the power of the rallies from last year s lows i also think of my trades as initial probes to test the strength of the market i m willing to take a small loss because i will make much more than what i m risking if i m right on the trade if the trade starts to work in my favour i will try to add to it speculative excesses may drive markets much higher i may be hugely underestimating their strength i don t pretend to know the future i believe that trading profits come from managing risk not from having a great crystal ball and that a big part of managing risks is taking losses quickly and staying with and adding to winning trades why i ve been shorting the canadian dollar the canadian dollar has been the strongest currency in the world ytd it was knocked down to 18 year lows in march 2020 during the covid panic and has rallied 22 from there to its current 6 year highs over time the main influences on the cad are commodities the strength weakness of the usd the strength weakness of pro risk sentiment the s p is a good barometer and interest rate differentials from time to time other things like the april 21 surprisingly hawkish comments from the bank of canada will influence the cad these influences have helped drive the cad higher especially since the end of march the cad has closed higher for eight consecutive weeks another underestimated influence on the cad is capital flows since the beginning of 2021 speculators in the cad futures market have built a larger and larger net long position the net speculative long positioning is now the largest it has been since late 2019 i think speculators are buying the cad as a play on the commodity markets there is a robust correlation between the cad and the crb they are also buying it because it has been trending higher people buy things that are going up things go up because people are buying them this aggressive speculative cad buying has helped drive the cad higher in this chart the black line is the cad the pink line is the crb commodity index the flow of funds that has driven the cad higher will become a liability if for some reason the cad starts to fall speculators will create additional selling pressure if when they exit their long positions a quick segue i ve traded currencies since the late 1970s and back then i thought the fx market was more psychological than other markets remember leads and lags my thinking has changed i now believe that other markets have become more like the fx markets they have become more psychological meaning that they are driven primarily by fund flows not valuations think of the size of the relentless passive investing bid in the stock market i ve been anticipating a reversal of speculative excesses that would see stocks and commodities fall and the usd rally that would be a triple whammy against the cad likely exacerbated by speculators exiting their long positions shorting the stock indices the s p and djia may have topped out last week i caught part of last week s 1 500 point decline in the djia and then stepped aside i got short the s p early this week stepped aside wednesday when the market had a wonderful opportunity to take out last week s lows but didn t and re shorted the s p friday after it reversed from making new highs for the week shorting the australian dollar the australian dollar has been on my radar for a few weeks it may be making a 5 month head and shoulders top a break below 7550 would target 70 cents i bought july 76 strike puts friday as a toe in the water my short term trading over the past two weeks i have shorted cad s p and russell futures i ve had some winners and some losers net net i ve made money i ve been trading small size given that i ve been shorting markets that have been in strong up trends at the end of the week i m short s p long cad and aud puts if the markets start to break down from their range of the past two weeks i hope to add to my positions be careful trading intermarket correlations i watch intermarket relationships closely no correlation lasts forever but when a correlation lasts for a long time people will invest as though it will last forever think about the zillions of dollars invested on the assumption that the stock bond correlation will last forever if i identify a correlation say wti crude oil and the cad there is a temptation to make an if then trade for instance if wti is falling then the cad should fall so short the cad i have made many if then trades over the years but i think it is better to use the correlation as an alert in this case if wti is falling then watch the cad closely and if it looks weak on its own merits get short with extra confidence but don t short it just because wti is falling be careful what you believe to be true you never have all the information on my radar the eur yen cross rate hit a 4 year low during the march 2020 covid panic and has rallied 15 since then in virtual lockstep with the rally in stocks and commodities in flow of funds terms speculators are very long euro and very short yen if for some reason the bullish enthusiasm that has driven stocks and commodities higher were to reverse then eur yen might reverse with the reversal exacerbated by position

drug distributors and importers have expressed concerns over the rising number of covid 19 cases in india which has inevitably led to a massive death toll and temporary closure of factories among other things they warned that patients especially those with chronic ailments such as cancer tuberculosis human immunodeficiency virus and diabetes were at risk due to an impending drug scarcity this is just as physicians in the country called for understanding adding that the situation could be managed without being panicky as of friday india s coronavirus infection had hit 30 million cases with around 4 000 deaths daily worried by the development the pharmaceutical wholesalers and distributors association of nigeria on thursday raised the alarm that nigeria risked running out of its current stock of pharmaceutical and medical supply the association premised its warning on the rising cases of covid 19 in india which is arguably nigeria s biggest drug importing hub the president of the nigerian association of pharmacists and pharmaceutical scientists in the americas dr anthony ikeme had also last year emphatically stated that the country expended an estimated 600m about n276bn annually on imported drugs from china and india ikeme warned that unless the federal government developed and executed a blueprint for the economic development of the pharmaceutical industry the country might pay heavily for its over reliance on the south asian country for most medical and pharmaceutical supplies speaking with sunday punch pwdan chairman dr ernest okafor expressed concerns that with the temporary closure of some factories shipping drugs from india was becoming a daunting task he said now that covid 19 is seriously ravaging the country we cannot even call our indian partners for products they won t answer you because they are not operating right now the truth is once you miss your source for water that channel dries up we are the feeder end not the source among the world powers it is said that when america sneezes africa catches a cold the same thing is playing out i am not a prophet of doom but i fear more is coming i say that because we have more of indian representation than chinese in the products portfolio that we are importing into the country according to the pharmacist the pandemic has resulted in massive disruptions in global supply chains adding that nigeria in particular is vulnerable as over 70 per cent of its drugs supply is imported from india and china he said i may not have the proper statistics but give or take about 60 per cent of imported products being circulated in the country are from india just as we have pwdan indian representatives also have their own association here in the country that is why i said whatever affects that region will definitely affect nigeria not to talk of the scarcity of active pharmaceutical ingredients instead of giving incentives to manufacturers what the government should do is put resources together to build a petrochemical industry if the federal government can take care of electricity and the petrochemical industry they will rev up the economy and create employment he said another drug distributor ogheneochuko omaruaye also confirmed the development omaruaye who doubles as pwdan vice chairman said drugs like paracetamol or branded essential medicines were gradually leaving pharmacy shelves he said the generic drugs are becoming scarce as a result of the pandemic ravaging the indian population it is naturally expected that things like this might happen however when the drugs become available again our responsibility in pwdan is to make them available in the same way and manner that they have been manufactured to retailers with patients as the end users we are hoping to properly address this matter a pharmacist and the national chairman association of pharmaceutical importers of nigeria nnamdi obi also said most factories in india were functioning below optimal level because of the situation in the asian country once we exhaust the stock we have presently in the market space and the situation in india doesn t improve the reality will dawn on nigeria he said another pharmacist olabanji obideyi said certain drugs had already been out of stock due to the situation in india for hiv tb and diabetes patients they are going to be badly hit because there is no drug security some drugs have been scarce in recent times there is no way the situation in india won t affect us most of the drugs we consume in nigeria are from india he said doctors allay fear eye china europe however some doctors have allayed the fears of nigerians over how the situation in india affects the importation of drugs into nigeria the doctors said the drugs usually imported from india could also be purchased at european countries and china though at higher prices a consultant clinical oncologist at the federal medical centre abeokuta dr alabi babatunde said the drug importers who would be affected were those procuring their drugs from pharmaceutical representatives and hospital pharmacies he said they procure their drugs from pharmaceutical representatives and hospital pharmacies it is likely they will be affected especially when the products are coming from india as it were i know that indian drugs are usually cheaper than those from european nations what it means is that most patients would be left with no choice but to buy the expensive ones available i understand that india s human capital is seriously affected by the pandemic when that happens a nation will have no choice but to close shops also a clinical oncologist at the college of medicine university of lagos prof francis durosinmi etti said there was no cause for alarm he said the probability of the country running out of cancer drugs for instance was low his optimism was equally shared by the director of the federal medical centre ebute metta dr adedamola dada it s true a large volume of pharmaceutical products comes from india and the ongoing pandemic would affect drug supply and prices all over the world but we are coping and we will continue to cope i am convinced nigerians would continue to get all necessary drugs he stated lasg converts covid 19 wards to tb hiv sections meanwhile the lagos state government has officially decommissioned the remaining volunteer health workers managing covid 19 patients at the infectious disease hospital in yaba the decommissioning became necessary after the isolation facility discharged the last set of covid 19 patients according to the state commissioner for information and strategy gbenga omotoso omotoso also confirmed that many of the previous icus that accommodated infected persons had been converted to admission wards for tb and hiv patients the commissioner told our correspondent that he did not see anything strange in readmitting tb and hiv patients in the former isolation wards because the facilities were originally established to accommodate infectious disease patients the development at the isolation facilities had taken a twist last week when some of the decommissioned volunteers in separate interviews accused the state of subtly throwing them out of the facilities without paying their three month remunerations how fair is it to decommission people who had worked from january to march taking care of covid 19 patients without paying them one of them identified only as bimpe had queried when our correspondent visited the facility to verify the claim it was gathered that only a few volunteers recruited from the private sector were paid two of their three month remunerations one of the workers who spoke on condition of anonymity disclosed that idh started admitting hiv and tb patients on april 30 which was their last day at the facility they have wards a b and c the tb and hiv patients were admitted at wards a and b while ward c was reserved for suspected and confirmed covid 19 cases as of the time we left they no longer had covid 19 patients again they were only taking care of hiv and tb patients the worker said mortality rate for very sick covid 19 patients in africa higher than normal study meanwhile a new groundbreaking study on covid 19 by africa based professors has indicated that adult mortality from 30 days of the coronavirus after being admitted to critical care with suspected or confirmed infection appeared considerably high in africa a critical factor in these excess deaths may be a lack of intensive care resources and underuse of it the researchers noted in the study published on friday in the british medical journal the lancet the news agency of nigeria reported that the study focused on 64 hospitals in 10 countries egypt ethiopia ghana kenya libya malawi mozambique niger nigeria and south africa prof akinyinka omigbodun of the university college hospital ibadan oyo state and prof adesoji ademuyiwa of the lagos university teaching hospital were the leads in the nigerian study the researchers said the challenges faced by critically ill nigerian covid 19 patients could be partly mitigated by ensuring the availability of the human and material resources needed for their care it can be demoralising for health personnel to watch helplessly as patients succumb to the shortage of oxygen needed to keep them alive till the body can tackle the

jill sims is an avid traveler with two goals in mind for this summer access to the great outdoors and avoiding crowds of people she and millions of americans are planning their getaways now that the pandemic is in retreat they are buying tickets to wide open spaces in nature be it mountains or beaches around the u s avoiding the quarantines and virus tests required to go abroad at minneapolis st paul international airport travelers are heading in outsized numbers to alaska and several spots in the northern rocky mountains like jackson hole wyo and kalispell mont it doesn t get much more open than alaska said joe esposito senior vice president of network planning at delta air lines last summer was a very big year for alaska and we think this summer s going to be even bigger airports are getting busier with security checkpoints now processing about 65 of pre pandemic passenger volumes and airplanes are filling up now that all the airlines have unblocked middle seats the centers for disease control and prevention gave the industry its latest boost in april by telling the public it was safe to travel once fully vaccinated booking lead times now stretch several months in advance rather than the two weeks that was typical during the pandemic there s no question there has been a mind set change said kyle potter editor of thrifty traveler a website providing airfare deal and consumer travel insights people are looking ahead and feeling confident in traveling in a way we haven t seen in the last 16 months and that confidence is most visible at msp in the surging number of flights to alaska up 30 this year compared with 2019 levels said brian ryks chief executive of the metropolitan airports commission that runs the airport people still want to travel and they are substituting international trips for domestic trips ryks said with many people deciding now is the time to check hawaii and alaska off their bucket lists those are as exotic of destinations that you can get while still flying domestically twin cities based sun country airlines has long been flying seasonally to anchorage from its hometown but added fairbanks to its alaska summer destinations this year a couple of months later the minnesota alaska corridor became a battleground in a simmering squabble between alaska airlines and delta over encroachments on each other s hub airports the competition between alaska and delta is absolutely cutthroat right now potter said that s good news for our region in march atlanta based delta announced a bevy of new or expanded nonstop service between the lower 48 states and alaska including doubling its daily flights between msp and fairbanks and adding a third daily flight from msp to anchorage exactly one week later alaska airlines announced the launch this summer of nonstop service between msp and anchorage for the first time ever airlines don t take kindly to their competitors going after each other s hubs potter said msp officials usually court airlines for months or years before landing a new route ryks said he and other airport staffers were caught off guard by alaska airlines new nonstop to anchorage to be honest we were a little bit there s obviously some competition there with delta no doubt ryks said but certainly we are pleased with that service the airline has a good customer service reputation scott habberstad director of sales for alaska airlines chuckled and shrugged off the suggestion that its route announcement was the latest tit for tat with delta the industry is trying new things to better understand where our consumers want to go and how they want to get there he said alaska airlines customers and employees in anchorage have been asking for a nonstop route to minneapolis st paul for years he said i can say with a straight face over the last 20 years there has not been an employee meeting in anchorage when somebody hasn t asked us to serve anchorage to minneapolis nonstop he said many area residents have family in minnesota or their kids come down to play college hockey in the north star state so you just have this flow of family and sport between the two habberstad said still a twice weekly nonstop is considerably less than delta s three daily round trips from msp to anchorage and its two daily round trips to fairbanks the connectivity is really strong in our network to get you up to alaska esposito of delta said without the return of business or international travel delta had to throw historical data of where people want to travel out the window when planning this summer s schedule so we had to go at it logically in terms where we think people want to book esposito said meanwhile sun country is trying to dodge the lunchroom food fight while also seeking to shuttle minnesotans to and from the 49th state sun country executives say the times of day and the days of the week scheduled for its msp anchorage and msp fairbanks trips are a better fit for minnesotans preferred travel times than alaska airlines flights we feel really good about our ability to service the needs of folks originating from minnesota said grant whitney sun country s chief revenue officer as for delta whitney and his colleagues at sun country prefer to avoid conflict with the behemoth they have a very powerful hub here in the twin cities whitney said we expect delta will always have a really big presence in alaska from the twin cities but we will coexist with them there like we do in many of the markets we serve out of here but take nothing away from them but alaska s popularity this summer faces an obstacle that air travelers across the country are encountering a shortage of rental cars at their destination sims who lives in minneapolis was initially thrilled to see delta launch a huge fare sale this spring for summer flights to anchorage she s been there once before and is itching to get back but after some consideration she decided to visit mount rainier national park in washington and acadia national park in maine this summer it is going to be so crowded sims said of alaska the rental car shortage does stress me out quite a bit when the pandemic grounded travel to a near halt last spring rental car companies lost their customers and revenue to stymie losses about one of every three rental cars in the u s were sold into the used car market the resurgence in travel is now happening faster than the rental car companies are able to replenish their stock and consumers fortunate enough to secure a rental reservation are paying hefty prices at the counter it is a challenge said habberstad who lives in anchorage it s something that i don t think anyone could ve predicted 12 13 months ago visitor bureaus in alaska have been working feverishly to explain alternative transportation from shuttle services to trains to private planes he said i would encourage people to think a little differently about alaska this year habberstad said

true national heroes and those unsung by gamini weerakoon view s view s tuesday may 18 was a day for celebration to most sinhalese but not tamils who appeared to consider it a day of reckoning at best having suffered most in the thirty year long â warâ the usual outcome of all prolonged military conflicts it is said inevitably leaves behind â an army of cripples an army of mourners and an army of criminalsâ the winners and losers of this â warâ too have not being exempted from the pathetic fallout of these â post war armiesâ however the official stand of sri lankan governments has been that it was a national triumph a triumph for the whole nation against a brutal separatist terrorist movement not a racist conflict true but as an independent observer of the political scene even 12 years after the terror group leader was killed in the swamps of nandikadal and his terrorist organisation wiped out we see no celebrations on the part of the tamils on this day as a fulltime journalist during the military operations against the terrorist group we were supportive of the operations and openly held out that the only solution against the intransigent megalomaniacal leader was a military solution our regret today is that even after 12 years of victory over terrorism we see no evidence of national reconciliation national heroes day has come and gone this year without the usual patriotic and nationalistic outbursts while paying tribute to the true national heroes to single out â a national heroâ in the context of the times is quite a difficult task because heroes are often created by powerful and influential individuals or groups who have subjective interests in their creations but on tuesday the nation paid tribute to an undisputed 28 619 national heroes who made the supreme sacrifice in defending their motherland from terrorists the true heroes comprised 23 962 from the army 1160 from the navy 443 from the air force 2 598 policemen and 456 personnel from the civil security department president gotabaya on this day 12 years after victory promoted 452 officers of the sri lanka armyâ s regular and volunteer force and 4 289 other ranks to their respective next rank our congratulations go out to these officers it will also be natural for state employees as well to hope for such promotions and attached perks unless these army promotions were routine ones made on heroes day in these days in the civilian sector pay cuts and retrenchment are the natural order of things countless number of civilians too suffered during the terrorist conflict and during the jvp insurrection some also making the supreme sacrifice in as much those heroes of the armed services they served the nation and kept the economy going despite the life threatening dangers hovering over them they served the government as well as the private sector but received no allowances compensation or even attention they are the heroes unknown unheard of and unsung who lived through the five turbulent decades in this paradise island the national heroesâ day reminds us that traditional civilian government service is now bristling with highly decorated service officers in key administrative posts two such posts are the defence and foreign secretary posts the expectation was that military men in key posts would get the processes â ticking awayâ but is it so ask doubting thomases foreign policy is in contagion at geneva and has now spread to ottawa national security was supposed to be the prime reason for moving top proven ex army veterans into key posts after the easter sunday bomb attacks but the issue after two years seems to be getting fruitier and nuttier with cardinal demands being made to fix the original sinner monks former pillars of the rajapaksa party alleging deep conspiracies and the attorney general saying police investigations havenâ t produced sufficient evidence to prosecute the real criminals meanwhile natural disasters have resulted in stalling implementation of gotabaya rajapaksaâ s election manifesto visions of splendour and prosperity national security now encompasses a much greater area than prevention of terrorism it involves protection of the populace from pandemics and providing them sufficient nutrition to live on rajapaksa wants to stick by his pledge in his manifesto of making lanka going green and has banned importation of inorganic fertilisers and insecticides on election platforms he promised free fertiliser to farmers but did not say it was organic fertiliser he was talking about and not the imported inorganic fertiliser that has been used for decades here and the world over imported inorganic fertiliser would cost billions of rupees rajapaksa is sticking to his guns and manifesto and is turning away ship loads of containers carrying the inorganic fertiliser that farmers want the issue obviously transcends all others for this involves the basic issue of the survival of the nation food security rice is lankaâ s only strategic produce for the survival like in most asian countries japan on losing world war ii succumbed to all pressures of the victorious americans except to relax controls on importation of american rice japan still steadfastly refuses importation of rice because it is of strategic importance despite all calamities that japan faced during and after the war the nation survived on the rice it produced in sri lanka the kandyan warriors successfully warded off portugese dutch and british invasions using the natural endowments the mountainous terrain access through which impeded invading forces greatly having invaded the hill capital they found it deserted without food while the natural allies of the inhabitants the malaria mosquito delivered the coup de grace sending invaders back to colombo groggy and raging with fever with the defenders hot on their heels historians of repute such as paul e pieris have described how the british finally overcame kandyan resistance they got to the their â bissasâ of villagers where stocks of rice were kept and destroyed them with the destructions of their stocks of rice and other food such as fruit trees the kandyans were starved to death and defeat the aim of d s senanayake lankaâ s pioneer fighter for independence even before independence was to make the country self sufficient in rice the clearing of jungles in the so called dry zone restoration of tanks of the ancients and the construction of new life giving tanks such as the gal oya were the beginning for 72 years this tradition has continued through successive governments the last being president sirisena whose contribution was the moragaskanda reservoir and complex the gotabaya rajapaksa decision of withholding in organic fertiliser to farmers would markedly reduce the output of rice in lanka unless he can produce an efficient substitute scientists have pointed out the impact of this move on the national security affecting the countryâ s only strategic produce needs rethinking â the writer is a former editor of the sunday island the island and former consultant editor of the sunday leader

tommy williams i m often asked about specific investment ideas that make sense for one s unique objectives though i m not allowed to make specific recommendations in this forum reporting on meaningful trends is deemed acceptable for example due to the global warming debate you might think the energy sector would be losing favor similarly financials might have seemed to be out of investor consideration wrong inside the s p 500 according to amundi asset management as of may 14th energy firms led the pack so far this year with a 42 8 return while financials are in second place at 29 1 most interesting is that technology is in last place with a return of 4 5 translation those who ve stuck with the high dividend paying old favorites in the energy and financial sectors have been well rewarded for their patience conversely though many are convinced that apple amazon facebook etc will rule the world that hasn t been the case so far this year it also is a reasonable argument for individual stocks if you own the right ones there is a tremendous spread between the sectors if you had simply owned the whole s p 500 index there was quite a difference between the big winners and the losers the amundi group anticipates this trend will continue for the foreseeable future another looming trend continues to be the progress on the pandemic according to the cdc as of friday may 14th 119 million americans had been fully vaccinated that s 36 of our 332 million population the wall street journal reports their concern that the communication recently about social gatherings masks distancing vaccines etc has been poorly delivered causing much risk concern and confusion the notion of being on the honor system regarding whether you ve been vaccinated or not is a bit baffling only time will tell if we ve moved too quickly in reopening up our society watching the trajectory of deaths though still disturbing is definitely heading downward we in the u s are now at 587 000 covid deaths and counting a recent day saw 291 deaths whereas recently as february we experienced 7 day averages in the 3500 range this is reminiscent of the 1960 s early 1970 s when we watched the vietnam war body count on television each night one can only hope the continuing vaccination process recently extended to teens as young as 12 will prevent future surges sending us back to where we were at the height of the pandemic though the general backdrop for your investment account continues to look very positive you cannot look past the inflation conversation philip orlando chief equity market strategist at federated hermes sums it up as follows the federal reserve whose mandate is the control of inflation interest rates and maximum employment has maintained a calm voice suggesting recent inflation spikes will prove temporary they call it transitory however orlando notes that wages grew at an annualized pace of 8 4 in the recent april report wages are the largest factor in computations of inflation commodity prices such as lumber copper oil corn and soybeans have gone vertical in the past year he contends that companies will be tempted to pass these costs on to consumers rendering the federal reserve too conservative in their estimates we ll see i can tell you that my un scientific observation as i navigate daily life looks like everything is costing more thankfully in terms of

just thought you might like to know what the federal government is doing on your behalf how the feds are spending your tax dollars on a crazy sounding lawsuit the dispute pits a south dakota farm family the fosters against the u s department of agriculture the fight is over a mud puddle yep you read that right said mud puddle is located smack in the middle of prime farmland the usda has decreed that the family may not fill in the muddy patch to plant more crops because it considers the 0 08 acre of land to be federally protected under the 1985 swampbuster act which protects wetlands no matter that the fosters puddle is not connected to any waterway and is not near any other officially designated wetlands property according to their lawyer if the family dares to tamper with the puddle they will lose access to crop insurance and other federal programs designed to help american farmers survive amazing right now consider that this dispute has been going on since 2004 imagine how many of your tax dollars the usda has spent over the years arguing about mud imagine how much the family has had to spend commissioning surveys and filing appeals the fosters obviously from hearty stock have refused to give in to the absurdity of it all the family s requests for reconsideration have been rejected by the usda as was their appeal in 2016 to the u s supreme court but the fosters continue to believe that the federal government should not dictate how a landowner uses their land and they certainly ought not to be punished with the threat of withholding federal programs other farmers get at a time when family farms are being gobbled up by big agriculture you d think uncle sam would see the value that the fosters land a total of 1 300 acres brings to both them and the surrounding community by any measure arlen and cindy foster have been good stewards to the property working it with their daughter son in law and six grandchildren they are third generation farmers who raise cattle corn soybeans and hay they practice no till farming and have a long history of conservation efforts dating back to 1900 when arlen s grandfather francis foster bought the land with a loan of 1 000 in 1938 as the dust bowl era saw farms across the country decimated grandpa francis planted stands of trees to prevent erosion today the fosters groves of trees are large and trap snow during the severe south dakota winters the spring melt creates a stream of water that seeps the lowland thus creating the controversial mud puddle but darn it it s their mud puddle to do with as they please they believe and that includes filling it in and planting more corn if they so choose but they can t undaunted the fosters recently filed a new federal lawsuit with the u s district court in sioux falls south dakota in a nutshell it declares that the government has overstepped its commerce powers and violated the fosters constitutional rights the suit was filed with assistance from the pacific legal foundation a nonprofit pro bono group that fights against government overreach and abuse i spoke with the foundation s lead attorney tony francois even if you re an ardent environmentalist i defy you to look at this puddle and say it s worth the money the feds have and will spend he told me francois said it s clear that the usda made a bad decision way back when and simply can t admit it this case really is about whether congress has the power to regulate that mud puddle if they do there is no constitutional limit on what they can do he said the fact that dirt gets wet so therefore they can ignore the u s constitution absurd the usda says it does not comment on pending litigation so i cannot report to you that side of the story these days many americans seem to embrace the idea of more government the idea that dear old uncle sam will take care of us with trillions in spending seems attractive but remember what the fosters have been dealing with at the hands of unchecked feds realize that more federal money means more control over your everyday lives diane dimond is the author of three books including be careful who you love inside the michael jackson case which is now updated with new chapters and is available as an audiobook contact her at diane dianedimond com or click here to read previous columns the opinions expressed are her own related stories

rising levels of income inequality over the last decades in most advanced economies have led to concerns regarding the stability of more unequal societies discussions about the drivers and consequences of higher income inequality have reached academic circles andersen et al 2021 dolado et al 2021 as well as the central banking community mersch 2014 bernanke 2015 with policymakers paying increasingly more attention to the distributional effects of monetary policy interventions yet how monetary policy decisions affect individuals income and thus its distribution is ambiguous since different channels of the monetary policy transmission mechanism operate in opposite directions coibion et al 2014 for example as argued by draghi 2016 if monetary policy is able to stimulate the real economy and reduce unemployment poorer households who are generally more affected by labour market fluctuations would be the main beneficiaries from expansionary interventions by contrast if the impact of a monetary policy change on the real economy is considerably smaller than the one on asset prices for example on stock market prices an expansionary intervention might disproportionately favour richer households acemoglu and johnson 2012 hence to properly understand the distributional consequences of monetary policy one needs to determine not only its overall effects on the distribution of incomes but also which are the respective roles of the different channels in driving the aggregate effect in a recent study we contribute to such an understanding by presenting novel empirical findings about the individual level income effects of monetary policy shocks amberg et al 2021 taken together our insights shed light on the overall distributional effects of monetary policy as well as their underlying drivers our analysis is conducted on the basis of an administrative panel dataset comprising detailed uncensored income data for every legal resident in sweden over the period 1999 2018 thus contrary to survey data which are typically top coded we are able to show that accounting for the extreme right tail of the distribution the top 1 is essential to get a better understanding of how monetary policy shapes individuals income our sample comprises 73 5 million individual year observations and 6 4 million unique individuals to identify exogenous monetary policy interventions we apply the most recent state of the art high frequency strategy we construct monetary policy surprises as changes in the yield of swedish treasury bills around the dates of policy announcements while also controlling for potential informational effects of monetary policy next we run a local projection regression of the change in individuals income over a given period on the identified monetary policy shock allowing the estimated slopes to vary according to the income groups they belong to figure 1 reports our main findings it depicts the effects on total income of an expansionary monetary policy intervention consisting of a cut of 25 basis points in the main policy rate controlled by the riksbank the income groups are reported on the horizontal axis we sort individuals into eleven income groups which correspond to deciles of the distribution of past average income except when it comes to the top decile which is split into two 90th to 99th and above the 99th respectively this allows us to capture income dynamics in the very top of the distribution while monetary policy shocks have large and statistically significant effects on total incomes across the entire income distribution these effects are particularly large at the tails more specifically a 25 basis point reduction in the policy rate increases the total incomes of the poorest and richest individuals by 2 3 and 3 1 respectively whereas the corresponding response for middle income individuals is 0 6 hence the effects of monetary shocks on total incomes are 4 5 times smaller in the middle of the distribution than at the tails yielding a pronounced u shaped pattern in the total income response also note that the total income response is almost three times as large in the top percentile as in the rest of the top decile hence there is substantial heterogeneity within the top decile of the income distribution figure 1 the effects of a 25 basis point shock on total income over a two year horizon next figure 2 shows the effects on each of the two main components of total income labour income and capital income the response of labour income is large and statistically significant in the bottom two deciles but small and statistically insignificant throughout the rest of the distribution the capital income response on the other hand is statistically significant across the entire income distribution with the exception of the bottom decile noticeably the effect is particularly large at the very top for example the capital income response is around seven times larger in the top percentile than in the middle part of the income distribution the underlying drivers of the strong responses of total incomes in the top and bottom of the income distribution are thus different labour income in the bottom and capital income in the top moreover we argue that the heterogeneity in the labour income response over the income distribution is accounted for by the earnings heterogeneity channel that is there is a higher sensitivity of labour incomes to monetary shocks in the bottom than elsewhere in the distribution the heterogeneity in the capital income response is on the contrary entirely due to the income composition channel that is to the fact that capital income constitutes a larger share of total income for high income individuals than for low and middle income individuals the sensitivity of capital incomes to monetary shocks is on the other hand quite stable over the income distribution figure 2 the effects of a 25 basis point shock on labour and capital income over a two year horizon what do the total income effects of monetary shocks imply for aggregate income inequality to answer this question we undertake a counterfactual exercise we start by computing the values of a number of conventional income inequality indices based on actual microdata to then simulate the two year effects of a 25 basis points monetary shock finally we compute the inequality measures for the simulated income distribution and compare them to their initial values on actual data absent the expansionary shock results are mixed the gini coefficient changes very little after the monetary policy loosening as the large effects in the top and bottom mostly offset each other on the contrary some inequality measures like the top income shares point towards higher income inequality while others like the standard deviation of log income indicate a lowering in income inequality our results imply that the most commonly used aggregate measures of income inequality in particular the gini coefficient are not well suited for characterising the distributional effects of monetary policy fully understanding the distributional consequences of monetary policy instead requires a thorough analysis of the impact of monetary policy over the entire income distribution which can only be done with large scale uncensored individual

as cattle producers we often look at ways to improve our bottom line where can we profit the most from our production is it from sales of feeder calves breeding stock finished cattle freezer beef or some combination this decision may change from year to year based on economic conditions feed availability and facilities one type of sale that sometimes gets overlooked is the sale of cull animals national studies estimate the value of these sales amounts to 15 to 30 of the revenue for beef farms these culls make up 20 of the beef consumed considering the value and importance of these animals to the supply chain we should look at ways we can manage them to increase our profits there are many reasons for culling animals physical problems poor performance age reproduction and falling outside of a calving window are all common reasons which can have a big effect on how and when we cull these individuals with the goal of receiving the highest income research out of the university of tennessee demonstrated that while a cow may be 4 or 5 years old when it reaches its breakeven point missing one calf can increase that by two to three years and if they miss two calves they may not break even in their lifetime culling those cows that miss a calf often is your best decision considerations there are two important factors that go into the price you receive for those cull animals the first is the time of year when the animal is being sold and the second is the body condition of the animal many years of market price evaluations have revealed rather consistent trends typically cull cow prices begin to rise in january peak in march and remain relatively constant until august from august until october they drop and then remain steady until january when they begin to rise again of course these are averages and any individual animal can fall outside of this pattern following these trends we would usually like to market culls between february and august while this fits the schedule for fall calving herds it is not such a good fit for most people with spring calving herds the second factor affecting price is body condition score cull cows are divided into three categories of marketing classes breakers are those with a bcs above 7 boners fall into the 5 to 7 bcs range while leans and lights have a bcs of 1 to 4 the lights are the very small light muscled individuals the dressing percentage and carcass quality grade also factor into the price several years of observations have shown that breakers do not bring more than boners so feeding culls beyond a 7 bcs will probably not improve profits breakers and boners typically earn 4 to 5 over leans while lights bring 16 less than leans given this information in an ideal world we would like to sell all our cull animals during the season high and have them at a body condition score above 5 with spring calving herds the problem is that we are weaning calves when the cows are both at their lowest bcs and at the seasonal low in price the positive is this can play into your favor if you can find a way to put those cows on feed for a little while thin healthy cows can have good feed conversion and compensatory gain on top of the increased price from weight gain you will likely receive a higher price because of seasonal variation research in south dakota showed that keeping thin cull animals on cornstalks and a supplement for 70 days from nov 15 to feb 1 resulted in an extra income over expenses of 125 per head in 2019 this capitalized on both increased value from weight gain and improvement in price by seasonal variation to feed or not not all culls should be put on feed cows with chronic physical conditions may get worse with time those animals should be marketed as soon as possible cows with a high bcs will probably cost more to feed than any price increase that may come from seasonal variations there likely is not an advantage of additional gain on these animals finally if you are in a seasonal high for the market such as in july additional feed costs of keeping culls for another 70 90 days and selling at a seasonal low probably would not make sense a final consideration for increasing the value of cull cows is to breed and market good young cows that fall outside of your calving window these bred cattle that may fall into someone else s calving window the value of good quality young bred cows would also provide a premium over normal slaughter prices finding individuals that have a use for these cows could be worth the effort when they would otherwise have become routine culls kreager is the osu extension educator for agnr in licking county he also is a member of the osu extension beef team that publishes the weekly ohio beef cattle letter which can be found at beef osu edu

you for joining the call today our earnings during the first quarter this year increased around 50 when compared to the same period last year as a result of higher sales volumes in almost all our business lines we are seeing positive price trends in our fertilizer markets and expected increase in average prices in the lithium market since the inflection point that we saw in the fourth quarter last year our diverse portfolio and the strong production performance should continue to have a very positive impact on our resource throughout the year as we mentioned last night global fertilizer markets have seen stronger demand as a result we expect our average prices in both spn and potassium nitrate business lines to be higher than average prices reported during 2020 gradually market is recovering and our sales volumes increased 30 when compared to the fourth quarter last year we expect this momentum to continue leading to an increase of sales volumes in 2021 of 10 to 15 compared to last year finally lithium market indicators have been very positive over the past few months demand growth for electric vehicles during the first quarter of the year was more than double what we saw last year as a result we believe that annual demand for lithium chemicals will grow more than 30 more than previously expected we also expect our sales volume will increase to at least 85 000 metric tons this year increasing our market share as anticipated prices during the first quarter increased when compared to the fourth quarter last year we believe the prices will continue increasing each quarter throughout the year as mentioned last night our capex plans remains on or ahead of schedule in chile our plans to reach 120 000 metric tons of lithium carbonate and 21 500 metric tons of lithium hydroxide by the end of this year remain on schedule however our plans to reach the 180 000 metric tons of lithium carbonate and 30 000 metric tons of lithium hydroxide as we move forward to an operating by the end 2022 mt holland lithium project in australia remains on track as a reminder that board has approved close to 500 million total capex plan for 2021 related to all our business lines thank you operator we may now go to the q a session questions and answers operator we will now begin the question and answer session first question will be from corinne blanchard of deutsche bank please go ahead corinne blanchard deutsche bank analyst hey good morning team thank you for taking my question this morning i think first i would like to get your view on nameplate capacity versus sales volume for this year and also maybe for 2022 with both expansion for hydroxide and carbonate now due next year rather than 2023 how do you view your sales versus full capacity and do you anticipate inventory piling up ricardo ramos chief executive officer hello as you may know we are increasing now to the 130 000 metric tons at the end of this year considering the group performance in our facility at the end of during second half last year i think that its reasonable to expect to have a total production for this year close to 90 000 metric tons to 95 000 metric tons that s my target for this year next year is going to be an average because we will start with the 120 000 metric tons and at the end of the year we expect to go to 180 000 metric tons that s why i think having a production total production for next year close to the 140 000 metric tons makes sense which is something in our plan we have today corinne blanchard deutsche bank analyst okay that s very helpful so yes i m assuming you guys are trying to say is whatever your projects that s very interesting i mean the second question is on lithium pricing and obviously i think we all agree what s in the bottom in 4q and pricing and such to improve in 1q and if you look at chinese crossing since late august 2020 in fee borne pricing as well in the past few months we all see like a positive trend how just wanted to try to get your view on where do you see pricing going to at the end of the year do you see it going by close to 10 000 per ton do you see it is still below or above this level pablo altimiras senior vice president sales lithium and iodine corinne thank you pablo altimiras speaking well as you know price always is the result of the supply and demand in the demand side we have been seeing a very positive trend for the demand actually we are increasing our estimation for this year so in that we only see that a positive trend so i mean so you are right we have been seeing a positive trend in pricing however the price always is not an unique price you need to go see it whether we have different qualities different type of customers different volumes that do commercialize with them a different commercial strategy so we don t have one price that can reflect the total reality of the market but having said that because of the positive trend of the demand i can say that today we have been seeing priced in double digit in the future well again everything will depend on supply and demand balance operator the next question will be from joel jackson of bmo robin fiedler bmo capital markets analyst hi this is robin on for joel i have a few questions i ll just ask them one at a time i had a follow up on that pricing discussion i mean i appreciate there are lags to the spot market but even so the april export data from chile didn t reflect higher pricing yet so i guess i m just trying to get a sense of when exactly we can start to see that maybe on a monthly basis even and by how much you mentioned quality one of your argentinean peers who has struggled quality in the past has even guided to 7 000 to 8 000 a ton for the june quarter so is that like a floor expectation for q2 is that reasonable pablo altimiras senior vice president sales lithium and iodine well i mean first of all export prices do not capture all the information of the market so that s one thing that we need to be careful when we take a look to those prices so that s my first comment regarding to our strategy i can say that in the first quarter the majority of our sales were agreed and contracted during 2020 so that explains the result of the price for q1 however the reality for the second half is different and more than 50 of the sales will get closed under the prevailing prices reality at the moment so that s the strategy we have now robin fiedler bmo capital markets analyst okay and my second question is on the proposed copper royalty changes in chile so is the lithium structure viewed as a model for this or are there changes that could be expected in the lithium royalty structure as well ricardo ramos chief executive officer yes there is a discussion about some royalty structure in chile as you may know we have no information other than what has appeared in the press as you may know it has been preliminary discussed and it has to be analyzed by the senate and finally by the government anyway we sent our preliminary opinion to the different industrial and mining groups in which we participate they are finally the ones who raised the opinion of the mining industries reagarding this issue just i want to add that spn contributes significantly to the development of the country throughout important factors and other contributions to the country and communities yes for sure there is no older economic activity in chile that contributes more resources both in absolute terms and in percentage terms for the country robin fiedler bmo capital markets analyst maybe just one last quick follow up to that given the recent political changes in chile as well do you foresee any potential increase spending for environmental reasons maybe the tax structure or anything like that or is it business as usual on your side no matter what the political climate is like ricardo ramos chief executive officer we continue to be very excited of our way our business strategy and our significant capex programs and we will continue of course advancing in our sustainability agenda we went public with our sustainability agenda last year we will continue to do so we think we re perfectly aligned with the demand of the community in chile and the world demand in terms of being very active in terms of environmental activities that s why we think that this just we confirm our role in terms of implementing all our bank charge of sustainability all those expenses or investment regarding the sustainability agenda that we made public last year are already included in the capex program for the next four years robin fiedler bmo capital markets analyst thank you operator the next question comes from pj juvekar of citigroup pj juvekar citigroup analyst yes hi good morning i look at your lithium contracts and they have tended to be shorter term in nature then you look at one of your larger competitors who is also trying to get some index pricing in their contracts so how do you see the market evolving in terms of contracts do you think the market and the big buyers the battery companies the ev companies are likely to go toward more index based pricing to some extent ricardo ramos chief executive officer okay thanks for the question i mean yes you are right i mean some customers are trying to have more visibility about prices so it s something that in sqm also we are looking at but the thing is this is still under development so that means that depending on customers different customers wants to produce in different ways relating to pricing so even if in spf we are flexible so in some cases we are considering to contract under the indexes or not because its up to customers but it is something that we are following for sure pj juvekar citigroup analyst okay and then you had good topline growth in lithium as well as in potash and spn but your costs were also higher and so the leverage did not come to the bottom line and i was wondering if there are any special costs that were there in the quarter coming out of the pandemic and can you talk about the leverage going forward as you get more pricing in the second half ricardo ramos chief executive officer yes i think it s not one clear message that the costs are high you have some product lines where the costs are lower some of the product lines where costs are slightly higher some product lines where costs are at the same level we don t foresee any costs situation nowadays of course with monetary as you know we re located in chile the value of the us dollar is very important for us that s why if the dollar goes up its good for us and if the dollar goes down its very bad because we have a lot of expenses in chilean peso nowadays the dollar is supporting our original projections that s why it s not a big news and i think we can continue with our original cost plan of course having these price of copper in the north and it s very high and the new copper price means that the pressure of the labor force in the north of chile is going up the same with the contractors and something we are working very hard in order to improve our to increase our productivity in order to avoid any additional cost but as a bottom line we don t foresee any cost issue or a significant issue during this year compared to the previous year pj juvekar citigroup analyst thank you and just a quick housekeeping question you had built up inventory last year that you are selling now how much of that inventory is still left thank you very much ricardo ramos chief executive officer depending on the business lines these inventory where we have we are very comfortable with the level of inventory we have today even though we are under the increasing sales volumes this year that s very good news that having inventory allow us to have the flexibility if we have additional volume sales i think that in volume strategy in inventory volume study is a very good one we continue to be very good for the company in order to perform our business strategy i don t foresee any big moves in the total inventory during this year operator the next question will be from isabella simonato of bank of america isabella simonato bank of america analyst thank you good afternoon everyone ricardo and pablo my question is on the spn and the potash business line on the potash side we are seeing prices rallying especially in the last couple of months your prices are going up but maybe not as much as we are seeing on the spot prices can you provide us an outlook for the next couple of quarters how you re seeing potash prices perform and a similar question to spn i mean you are guiding for a volume recovery this year and of course high growing prices are supportive of prices but what sort of acceleration do you anticipate in the coming quarters thank you ricardo ramos chief executive officer hi isabella yes you re right in terms of the potash price is going up we have had some agreements previously to this new trend price trend certainly i think the prices will be higher during the second quarter and a very positive pricing in potash during second half of the year i think second half of the year prices will be significantly higher than the prices that we are seeing in our sales for the first quarter as you know in the spn or specialty plant nutrition business the relation between potash price and potassium nitrate is not sold directly it means that when they go down we don t go down at the same level and when they go up we don t go up in the same level anyway having a very potash environment is a very good news and i foresee better pricing not at the level of the potash in terms of percentage increase but we think that prices during the second quarter of this year especially second half this year will be better than what we observed during the first quarter isabella simonato bank of america analyst that s clear thank you operator the next question comes from ben isaacson of scotiabank ben isaacson scotiabank analyst thank you very much i guess my first question is on the election that took place over the weekend obviously the stock market didn t like what happened at least as it relates to sqm so i guess ricardo in your opinion one of the reasons why the stock market is nervous about sqm is it only to do with the potential of increasing royalties or could it also have to do with issues related to water or extraction rights or maybe giving more resources to indigenous population is the market wrong to be this nervous right now ricardo ramos chief executive officer hi ben we if you review the prices has changed for sure in the last four days this monday tuesday wednesday and today we have to follow the trend in some way of the chilean stock market there is no big difference between whether the chilean stock market is growing and where sqm is going in the last few days you know i am not a market analyst and even less a good political analyst but the main investment bank still as you may know have issued various and very good analysis of the factors that may have affected the chilean stock market i think it is interesting to be able to read them i think there is many different opinions not all the opinions are the same that s why it is important to read different analysis but of course there is a lot of volatility today some uncertainty i think it s important to wait and see and its too early to have a clear opinion about where it is moving where the stock market is moving in chile but of course when you have these big big moves that we had in the last three or four days of course we follow that move i mean there is no way we are going to be independent of what s going on in the chilean market and again i think the last two days i had the opportunity to read different reports from investment banks local chilean investment banks and i think that s very good in order to have an idea of different factors that may or may not affect the stock market today ben isaacson scotiabank analyst so that s a good segue to my next question which is can you just talk a little bit about diversifying outside of chile obviously the mt holland project is front and center but are there other opportunities that you re looking at and are those in lithium what kind of regions are those in are they in potash etc ricardo ramos chief executive officer yes we are open for doing business not only because we want to have diversification of chile we are really positive about what we re doing in chile i think we are doing great investments in chile but anyway our m a activity is open for opportunities as always and as you know its been a very important decision for us to go ahead with the project in australia is going to be a big project i hope it is going to be the first big project in australia as you know we have the opportunity to move forward instead of being a 50 000 metric tons total capacity to close 100 000 metric tons in the future where we decide with wesfarmers in the next couple of years probably moving forward to maybe 100 000 metric tons i will try to look for opportunities in the lithium business outside chile of course yes we did it in australia if we have an good opportunity opportunity does then create value we will do it again potash is a very difficult market to be to getting in the market nowadays but of course we are open to review alternatives in potash nitrate we are also open for opportunities it seems like its difficult to find a plan outside chile but always open for opportunities and adding the same it means that it s not like we want to run out of chile we are very happy with what we are doing here but easily find a good opportunity outside chile as we did in australia with this ben isaacson scotiabank analyst just two more quick ones from me first is copper prices i think are now over 450 a pound i remember in the past you had interest from outsiders that wanted to come and look at what the potential was on your land are you seeing a pickup in that activity i think you had that as a revenue source several years ago and i haven t heard much in the past few years is that something that s new or coming back at least ricardo ramos chief executive officer yes you re right there is a lot of interest in copper in the last i think few months i mean copper is going in the right direction in terms of prices it seems like it s going to be a long term trend i hope so yes we do some internal activities in order to geological activity to find some potential copper resources in our land and of course we have so much meeting with third parties that they are looking for copper i think it will continue i think it will be more effective in the next six months considering what s going on with the pricing you re right it means there could be something very important in the future if we find something but yes we are quite active about this idea ben isaacson scotiabank analyst okay and very last one from me you have guidance of greater than 85 000 tons for the year you just did 24 000 tons so the math would suggest that s about 20 000 tons per quarter going forward but then you also came out and said your expectations for demand is 30 higher than what you originally expected so it just seems not to match up with respect to selling less in an environment where demand is better than expected can you just kind of triangulate those two comments pablo altimiras senior vice president sales lithium and iodine yes ben pablo speaking thanks for the question first of all i think that it s important to remark that during this first quarter we sold almost 3 times compared to the same quarter of last year so i think that it s important to remark that the second thing that is important to remark is that this year we will grow more than the global demand growth so that means that we are increasing our market share regarding the split among the quarters it is important to consider that customers have different strategies to buy the products sometimes they buy more or less and sometimes it is not in our control so that may sometimes explain difference among quarters but having said that it is important again to say that and we said at least 85 000 metric tons but our intention is to sell more if the market is there ben isaacson

of the five most expensive wars the united states has waged only one world war ii involved an armed enemy the other five poverty drugs terror and covid were all wars on nouns now the federal government appears to have inadvertently stumbled into another war the war on retirement unlike the other wars on nouns this one isn t only undeclared it wasn t even intended but the federal government has taken a series of steps that regardless of intent have yielded a situation in which retirement may end up a pipe dream for many ironically this war on retirement began with social security in 1935 rather than establishing a forced savings program wherein people would save money during their working years and have that money returned to them during retirement the government established a ponzi scheme wherein later participants paid off earlier participants as with all ponzi schemes the program was sustainable only if there were more people paying into the system than were receiving benefits from it by the early 1980s too few people were paying in and congress fired its first salvo at retirees by making previously tax free retirement benefits taxable this tweak in the rules breathed new life into the ponzi scheme and social security reserves once again grew but the scheme faltered again in 2010 and since then social security has been paying out more than it brings in current estimates have the trust fund becoming insolvent by 2035 to keep this bloated program afloat congress will eventually be forced to fire yet another salvo when it either raises workers taxes or reduces retirees benefits and with each passing year this albatross around workers necks will become heavier the federal reserve predictably has been an invaluable ally in the government s unwitting war on retirement since the late 1980s the federal reserve has been relentless in driving interest rates down interest rates on savings accounts certificates of deposit and even treasury bills are now functionally zero even the return on corporate bonds is so low as to barely keep pace with inflation fed policy has put such a squeeze on savers that the only way to save for retirement is to invest in stocks and while younger workers have plenty of time to weather the risks of waxing and waning stock markets forcing retirees and near retirees into stocks exposes them to risks that they can t weather nearly as well and now the biden administration presents the coup de grace president biden has proposed doubling capital gains tax rates you know the taxes you pay when you make a profit in the stock market the white house says that the elevated tax will only apply to those earning over 1 million but taxes on the rich have a solid history of eventually being applied to everyone else for reference look at the birth of the federal income tax politicians promised the new income tax would only be one percent and would only apply to the rich once instituted it took congress only five years to raise the income tax rate six fold and to apply it to everyone even the poor in a real war there are rules that require humane treatment for vanquished enemies retirees can expect no such treatment in the war on retirement those who manage to save enough for retirement despite social security s problems and despite near zero interest rates will be punished in death the biden administration intends to raise the tax on dying by slashing the estate tax exemption in half retirees heirs would have to hand over to the federal government 40 percent of whatever savings the retirees had left over above the exemption the proposed exemption around 5 million is high enough that it will apply mostly to the rich and to small business owners but like the federal income tax the estate tax will soon come for the rest of us and as biden is trying to push the estate tax exemption down to reach more estates simultaneously he is trying to push the values of those estates up to cross the exemption threshold by eliminating step up in basis rules the effect of which will be to increase capital gains taxes on inherited stock death and taxes indeed the war on retirement shares much in common with an actual war world war i a serbian killed the nephew of the austro hungarian emperor causing the empire to declare war on serbia but russia was allied with serbia and the declaration forced russia to mobilize that caused germany to declare war on russia which in turn caused france to declare war on germany world war i shouldn t have happened it was an unintended cascade of what should have been isolated events so too the war on retirement the government never intended to wage war on retirees but it has set in motion policies that collectively do just that the american version of the assassination of archduke ferdinand the event that began the steady march toward oblivion was the passage of the social security act in 1935 the dominos have been falling ever since and the last ones are about to tip over intentions be damned

companies furiously trying to stock up mattress producers to car manufacturers to aluminum foil makers are buying more material than they need to survive the breakneck speed at which demand for goods is recovering and assuage that primal fear of running out the frenzy is pushing supply chains to the brink of seizing up shortages transportation bottlenecks and price spikes are nearing the highest

this month clients are trying to get everything they can because they see high demand jennifer rumsey the columbus indiana based company s president said they think it s going to extend into next year the difference between the big crunch of 2021 and past supply disruptions is the sheer magnitude of it and the fact that there is as far as anyone can tell no clear end in sight big or small few

scarcity hong kong s momax technology ltd is delaying production of a new product because of a dearth of semiconductors further exacerbating the situation is an unusually long and growing list of calamities that have rocked commodities in recent months a freak accident in the suez canal backed up global shipping in march drought has wreaked havoc upon agricultural crops a deep freeze and mass blackout wiped out energy and petrochemicals operations across the central u s in february less than two weeks ago hackers brought down the largest fuel pipeline in the u s driving gasoline prices above 3 a gallon for the first time since 2014 now india s massive covid 19 outbreak is threatening its biggest ports for anyone who thinks it s all going to end in a few months consider the somewhat obscure u s economic indicator known as the logistics managers index the gauge is built on a monthly survey of corporate supply chiefs that asks where they see inventory transportation and warehouse expenses the three key components of managing supply chains now and in 12 months the current index is at its second highest level in records dating back to 2016 and the future gauge shows little respite a year from now the index has proven unnervingly accurate in the past matching up with actual costs about 90 of the time to zac rogers who helps compile the index as an assistant professor at colorado state university s college of business it s a paradigm shift in the past those three areas were optimized for low costs and reliability today with e commerce demand soaring warehouses have moved from the cheap outskirts of urban areas to prime parking garages downtown or vacant department store space where deliveries can be made quickly albeit with pricier real estate labor and utilities once viewed as liabilities before the pandemic fatter inventories are in vogue transport costs more volatile than the other two won t lighten up until demand does essentially what people are telling us to expect is that it s going to be hard to get supply up to a place where it matches demand rogers said and because of that we re going to continue to see some price increases over the next 12 months more well known barometers are starting to reflect the higher costs for households and companies an index of u s consumer prices that excludes food and fuel jumped in april from a month earlier by the most since 1982 at the factory gate the increase in prices charged by american producers was twice as large as economists expected unless companies pass that cost along to consumers and boost productivity it ll eat into their profit margins a growing chorus of observers are warning that inflation is bound to quicken the threat has been enough to send tremors through world capitals central banks factories and supermarkets the u s federal reserve is facing new questions about when it will hike rates to stave off inflation and the perceived political risk already threatens to upset president joe biden s spending plans you bring all of these factors in and it s an environment that s ripe for significant inflation with limited levers for monetary authorities to pull said david landau chief product officer at blujay solutions a u k based logistics software and services provider policymakers however have laid out a number of reasons they don t expect inflationary pressures to get out of hand fed governor lael brainard said recently that officials should be patient through the transitory surge among the reasons for calm the big surges lately are partly blamed on skewed comparisons to the steep drops of a year ago and many companies that have held the line on price hikes for years remain reticent about them now what s more u s retail sales stalled in april after a sharp rise in the month earlier and commodities prices have recently retreated from multiyear highs caught in the crosscurrents is dennis wolkin whose family has run a business making crib mattresses for three generations economic expansions are usually good for baby bed sales but the extra demand means little without the key ingredient foam padding there has been a run on the kind of polyurethane foam wolkin uses in part because of the deep freeze across the u s south in february and because of companies over ordering and trying to hoard what they can it s gotten out of control especially in the past month said wolkin vice president of operations at atlanta based colgate mattress a 35 employee company that sells products at target stores and independent retailers we ve never seen anything like this though polyurethane foam is 50 more expensive than it was before the covid 19 pandemic wolkin would buy twice the amount he needs and look for warehouse space rather than reject orders from new customers every company like us is going to overbuy he said even multinational companies with digital supply management systems and teams of people monitoring them are just trying to cope whirlpool corp ceo marc bitzer told bloomberg television this month its supply chain is pretty much upside down and the appliance maker is phasing in price increases usually whirlpool and other large manufacturers produce goods based on incoming orders and forecasts for those sales now it s producing based on what parts are available it is anything but efficient or normal but that is how you have to run it right now bitzer said i know there s talk of a temporary blip but we do see this elevated for a sustained period the strains stretch all the way back to global output of raw materials and may persist because the capacity to produce more of what s scarce with either additional capital or labor is slow and expensive to ramp up the price of lumber copper iron ore and steel have all surged in recent months as supplies constrict in the face of stronger demand from the u s and china the world s two largest economies crude oil is also on the rise as are the prices of industrial materials from plastics to rubber and chemicals some of the increases are already making their ways to the store shelf reynolds consumer products inc the maker of the namesake aluminum foil and hefty trash bags is planning another round of price increases its third in 2021 alone food costs are climbing too the world s most consumed edible oil processed from the fruit of oil palm trees has jumped by more than 135 in the past year to a record soybeans topped 16 a bushel for the first time since 2012 corn futures hit an eight year high while wheat futures rose to the highest since 2013 a united nations gauge of world food costs climbed for an 11th month in april extending its gain to the highest in seven years prices are in their longest advance in more than a decade amid weather worries and a crop buying spree in china that s tightening supplies threatening faster inflation earlier this month the bloomberg commodity spot index touched the highest level since 2011 a big reason for the rally is a u s economy that s recovering faster than most the evidence of that is floating off the coast of california where dozens of container ships are waiting to offload at ports from oakland to los angeles most goods are flooding in from china where government figures last week showed producer prices climbed by the most since 2017 in april adding to evidence that cost pressures for that nation s factories pose another risk if those are passed on to retailers and other customers abroad across the world s manufacturing hub of east asia the blockages are especially acute the dearth of semiconductors has already spread from the automotive sector to asia s highly complex supply chains for smartphones john cheng runs a consumer electronics manufacturer that makes everything from wireless magnetic smartphone chargers to smart home air purifiers the supply choke has complicated his efforts to develop new products and enter new markets according to cheng the ceo of hong kong based momax which has about two thirds of its 300 employees working in a shenzhen factory one example production of a new power bank for apple products such as the iphone airpods ipad and apple watch has been delayed because of the chip shortage instead of proving to be a short lived disruption the semiconductor crunch is threatening the broader electronics sector and may start to squeeze asia s high performing export economies according to vincent tsui of gavekal research it s not simply the result of a few temporary glitches tsui wrote in a note they are more structural in nature and they affect a whole range of industries not just automobile production in an indication of just how serious the chips crunch is south korea plans to spend roughly 450 billion to build the world s biggest chipmaking base over the next decade meanwhile running full tilt between factories and consumers are the ships trucks and trains that move parts along a global production process and finished goods to market container vessels are running at capacity pushing ocean cargo rates to record highs and clogging up ports so much so that columbia sportswear co s merchandise shipments were delayed for three weeks and the retailer expects its fall product lineup will arrive late as well executives at a p moller maersk a s the world s no 1 container carrier say they see only a gradual decline in seaborne freight rates for the rest of the year and even then they don t expect a return to the ultracheap ocean cargo service of the past decade more capacity is coming in the form of new ships on order but they take two or three years to build hsbc trade economist shanella rajanayagam estimates that the surge in container rates over the past year could raise producer prices in the euro zone by as much as 2 percent rail and trucking rates are elevated too the cass freight index measure of expenditures reached a record in april its fourth in five months spot prices for truckload service are on track to rise 70 in the second quarter from a year earlier and are set to be up about 30 this year compared with 2020 todd fowler a keybanc capital markets analyst said in a may 10 note we expect pricing to remain elevated given lean inventories seasonal demand and improving economic activity all of which is underpinned by capacity constraints from truck production limitations and driver availability challenges fowler said for london based packaging company ds smith plc challenges are coming from multiple sides during the pandemic customers rushed to online purchases raising demand for its epack boxes and other shipping materials by 700 then came the doubling of its supply costs to 243 a ton for the recycled fiber it uses to make its products that s a significant cost for a company that buys 4 to 5 million tons of used fiber annually said miles roberts ds smith s group chief executive who doesn t see the lockdown inspired web purchasing as a temporary trend the e commerce that has increased is here to stay at colgate mattress wolkin used to be able to order foam on mondays and have it delivered on thursdays now his suppliers can t promise anything what s clear

it was 1883 and richard burton was bored burton was a living legend victorian britain knew him as ruffian dick one of history s greatest adventurers a semi mythical figure who spoke 29 languages went on pilgrimage to mecca in disguise and put the fear of god into everyone he met burton was an explorer scholar and soldier like no other he travelled compulsively across the deserts of arabia the plains of india and the lakes of central africa he even undertook an expedition to the mormons of utah the mormons leader brigham young was reluctant to baptise burton and was even more reluctant to introduce him to any of his several dozen wives but burton was even better at causing trouble than he was at exploring the world sir he once remarked to a priest i m proud to say i have committed every sin in the decalogue in 1872 he was bundled off to the grey city of trieste as the british consul burton had joined the diplomatic service in 1868 he found trieste almost as irksome as the rocks of st helena to napoleon by 1883 he was wondering if his old life of travel and adventure would ever return richard francis burton s story began 200 years ago he was born in 1821 and was commissioned into the army of the british east india company in 1842 he arrived in india in the wake of the disastrous first anglo afghan war thousands of british soldiers had marched into afghanistan only one man escaped being killed or taken prisoner burton fell headlong for india he learned hindustani punjabi marathi persian and arabic soon he could recite the quran from memory all faith is false all faith is true he wrote truth is the shattered mirror strown in myriad bits while each believes his little bit the whole to own burton s fellow soldiers muttered suspiciously about his love for india but they took care to do so quietly because burton s reputation as a brawler was even greater than his reputation as a linguist when his commanding officer colonel henry corsellis made himself disagreeable burton fixed him with an unblinking glare and suggested some verses for the colonel s tombstone here lieth the body of colonel corsellis the rest of the fellow i fancy in hell is a more sympathetic superior sir charles napier assigned burton to undercover work burton grew his beard long acquired a wig and dressed in the fine linens of a merchant whenever there was trouble burton would arrive in town and rent a little shop in the bazaar he would stock it with items no one wanted clammy dates viscid molasses then he would sit back watch and listen when napier assigned burton to investigate the male brothels of karachi said to be favoured by the east india company s soldiers the resulting report left absolutely nothing to the imagination it was duly dispatched to the government house and just as swiftly suppressed
stock markets in canada and the united states are booming right now so why do so few companies want to join them with the exception of a couple of bad years the last two decades have been a great time to be a public company valuations are at record highs and executive compensation has more than doubled as a percentage of corporate profits nevertheless fewer and fewer companies and their managers want to take advantage of these opportunities as we show in a recent research study the number of companies choosing to go public in canada has been declining sharply since the late 1990s in fact so few companies have been interested in listing publicly that the total number of canada s public operating companies has declined by more than 40 per cent on a per capita basis american public markets are not much better they re about half the size they were back in the 1990s there is surprisingly little concern about this development among canada s regulators and politicians this inattention is probably a mistake canada has four times the number of public companies per capita as the united states and the united kingdom it depends on its public markets to finance and grow new businesses in a way no other developed country does tech pharma need public companies even more important is the impact canada s public markets has on the ability to grow companies in high value industries like technology or pharmaceuticals experts have pointed out that canada actually performs well at generating new ideas and starting new businesses the country fails however on scaling these new businesses up to a size where they can compete in world markets aside from one or two companies like shopify we don t create large technology software nanotechnology biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies canada starts with technology that s the best in the world in these sectors but something happens before our companies become big enough to kick start a new industry here what happens these valuable businesses get sold to larger companies within their industries most of which aren t canadian one study found that of 164 acquisitions of canadian technology companies between 2004 and 2012 only a single company was purchased by a canadian buyer this turns into a vicious cycle because we don t have large mature companies in many industries the buyers of our promising startups are foreign and because our startups are acquired early in their development we don t grow into large mature companies no spin off benefits this dynamic means we lose the spin off benefits of mature companies we don t train our workers in things like enterprise software sales or commercial nanotechnology research and we don t get new business ideas from older companies silicon valley wouldn t have become what it is today without beginning with large mature firms like xerox and hewlett packard most entrepreneurs get their world class ideas from working with more established companies what does canada s failure to scale technology businesses have to do with our public market problem when a startup raises capital from outsiders it must eventually provide them with an exit strategy so they can sell their shares there are basically two kinds of exit selling the company usually to a larger company in its line of business or taking the company public a public listing allows a company to continue to grow while permitting its early investors to sell their shares in the stock market over the past two decades an increasing number of companies have decided they would rather sell themselves than go public what happened explanations don t hold up in our research we find that the usual explanations for the public market decline aren t plausible they either don t explain why the decline is happening both in canada and the united states or they contradict the dominant fact of the last two decades public companies have been getting more and more valuable instead we look at the ways public markets have changed to make corporate governance more painful less effective and higher risk the biggest change over the past two decades or so has been a revolution in the ways public companies are run generally this has involved the transfer of power from managers and boards of directors to less informed and incentivized third parties like proxy advisers and even money managers by and large these initiatives haven t improved corporate performance but they have significantly increased the unpleasantness of going public they take decisions about compensation board composition strategy and selling the company out of the hands of the people who know the business best and as summarized in our research give it to outsiders who are less effective this transfer of power also disadvantages workers creditors and other constituencies important to the ultimate success of any business the way forward in our recently published paper we give a variety of concrete suggestions to reduce the penalties incurred by executives and boards if they take their companies public and to make going public more attractive they include eliminating the majority voting requirements that were adopted by the tsx in 2014 which can make directors more vulnerable to shareholder action introducing effective staggered boards to give corporations the option to provide their managers greater independence from shareholder pressure eliminating an executive compensation disclosure regime that has produced precisely the opposite results from those intended abandoning any suggestion there are one size fits all corporate governance best practices reining in the power of proxy advisers who have become the de facto sources of corporate governance and executive compensation regulation in this country these steps would clearly remove major barriers to canadian companies choosing to scale up in this country

source small business administration derek willis propublica the shoreline communities of ocean county new jersey are a summertime getaway for throngs of urbanites lined with vacation homes and ice cream parlors not exactly pastoral which is odd considering dozens of paycheck protection program loans to supposed farms that flowed into the beach towns last year as the first round of the federal government s relief program for small businesses wound down last summer ritter wheat club and deely nuts ostensibly a wheat farm and a tree nut farm each got 20 833 the maximum amount available for sole proprietorships tomato cramber up the coast in brielle got 12 739 while seaweed bleiman in manahawkin got 19 957 none of these entities exist in new jersey s business records and the owners of the homes at which they are purportedly located expressed surprise when contacted by propublica one entity categorized as a cattle ranch beefy king was registered in ppp records to the home address of joe mancini the mayor of long beach township there s no farming here we re a sandbar for christ s sake said mancini reached by telephone mancini said that he had no cows at his home just three dogs all of these loans to nonexistent businesses came through kabbage an online lending platform that processed nearly 300 000 ppp loans before the first round of funds ran out in august 2020 second only to bank of america in total propublica found 378 small loans totaling 7 million to fake business entities all of which were structured as single person operations and received close to the largest loan for which such micro businesses were eligible the overwhelming majority of them are categorized as farms even in the unlikeliest of locales from potato fields in palm beach to orange groves in minnesota the kabbage pattern is only one slice of a sprawling fraud problem that has suffused the paycheck protection program from its creation in march 2020 as an attempt to keep small businesses on life support while they were forced to shut down with speed as its strongest imperative the effort run by the federal small business administration initially lacked even the most basic safeguards to prevent opportunists from submitting fabricated documentation government watchdogs have said while that may have allowed millions of businesses to keep their doors open it has also required a massive cleanup operation on the backend the sba s inspector general estimated in january that the agency approved loans for 55 000 potentially ineligible businesses and that 43 000 obtained more money than their reported payrolls would justify the department of justice relying on special agents from across the government to investigate has brought charges against hundreds of individuals accused of gaming pandemic response programs drawn by generous fees for each loan processed kabbage was among a band of online lenders that joined enthusiastically in originating loans through their automated platforms that helped millions of borrowers who d been turned down by traditional banks but it also created more opportunities for cheating propublica examined sba loans processed by several of the most prolific online lenders and found that kabbage appears to have originated the most loans to businesses that don t appear to exist and the only concentration of loans to phantom farms in some cases these problems would ve been easy to spot with just a little more upfront diligence which the program s structure did not encourage pushing this through financial institutions created some pretty bad incentives said naftali harris the ceo of sentilink which helps lenders detect potential identity theft this is definitely a case where companies that decided they wanted to be more careful in terms of giving out loans were penalized for doing so presented with propublica s findings sba inspector general spokeswoman farrah saint surin said that her office had hundreds of investigations underway but that she did not have any information to share or available for public reporting at this time reuters reported that federal investigators were probing whether kabbage and other fintech lenders miscalculated ppp loan amounts and the doj declined to confirm or deny the existence of any investigation to propublica kabbage which was acquired by american express last fall did not have an explanation for propublica s specific findings but it said it adhered to required fraud protocols at any point in the loan process if fraudulent activity was suspected or confirmed it was reported to fincen the sba s office of the inspector general and other federal investigators with kabbage providing its full cooperation spokesman paul bernardini said in an emailed statement as soon as the pandemic swept across america kabbage was in trouble the online lending platform had launched in 2009 as part of a generation of financial technology companies known as non banks alternative lenders or simply fintechs that act as an intermediary between investors and small businesses that might not have relationships with traditional banks based in atlanta it had become a buzzy standout in the city s tech scene offering employees silicon valley perks like free catered lunches and beer on tap it advertised its mission as helping small businesses acquire funds they need for their big breaks as a recruiting video parody of michael jackson s thriller put it in 2016 the basic innovation behind the burgeoning fintech industry is automating underwriting and incorporating more data sources into risk evaluation using statistical models to determine whether an applicant will repay a loan that lower barrier to credit comes with a price kabbage would lend to borrowers with thin or checkered credit histories in exchange for steep fees the original partner for most of its loans celtic bank is based in utah which has no cap on interest rate allowing kabbage to charge more in states with stricter regulations with backing from the powerhouse venture capital firm softbank kabbage had been planning an ipo its model foundered however when kabbage s largest customer base small businesses like coffee shops hair salons and yoga studios was forced to shut down last march kabbage stopped writing loans even for businesses that weren t harmed by the pandemic days later it furloughed more than half of its nearly 600 person staff and faced an uncertain future the paycheck protection program which was signed into law as part of the cares act on march 27 2020 with an initial 349 billion in funding was a lifeline not just to small businesses but fintechs as well lenders would get a fee of 5 on loans worth less than 350 000 which would account for the vast majority of transactions the loans were government guaranteed and processors bore almost no liability as long as they made sure that applications were complete at first encouraged by the treasury department traditional banks prioritized their own customers an efficient way to process applications with little fraud risk since the borrowers information was already on file but that left millions of the smallest businesses including independent contractors out to dry they turned instead to a collection of online lenders that have sprung up offering short term loans to businesses kabbage lendio bluevine fundbox square capital and others would process applications automatically with little human review required for the platforms this was also easy money in the first funding round that ran out last august kabbage completed 297 587 loans totaling 7 billion it received 5 of each loan it made directly and an undisclosed cut of the proceeds for those it processed for banks its total revenue was likely in the hundreds of millions of dollars a lawsuit filed by a south carolina accounting firm alleges that kabbage was among several lenders that refused to pay fees to agents who helped put together applications even though the cares act had said they could charge up to 1 of the smaller loans a provision that was later reversed for kabbage that revenue kept the company alive while it sought a buyer for all of these guys it was like shooting fish in a barrel if you could do the minimum amount of due diligence required you could fill up the pipeline with these applications said a former kabbage executive one of four former employees interviewed by propublica they spoke on the condition of anonymity to avoid retaliation at their current jobs or from industry giant american express to handle the volume kabbage brought back laid off workers starting at 15 an hour when that failed to attract enough people they increased the hourly rate to 35 and then 40 and awarded gift cards for reaching certain benchmarks according to a former employee with visibility into the loan processing at a certain point they were like yes get more applications out and you ll get this reward if you do the former employee said bernardini said the company did not offer incentive compensation in a report on its ppp participation through last august kabbage boasted that 75 of all approved applications were processed without human review for every 790 employees at major u s banks the report said kabbage had one that s in part because traditional banks which also take deposits are much more heavily regulated than fintech institutions that just process loans to participate in the ppp fintechs had to quickly set up systems that could comply with anti money laundering laws the human review that did happen according to two people involved in it was perfunctory they weren t saying is this legitimate they were just saying are all the fields filled out said another former employee as acquisition talks proceeded the employee noted kabbage managers who held the most company stock had a built in incentive to process as many loans as possible if there s anything suspicious you can pass it along to account review but account review was full of people who stood to make a lot of money from the acquisition one situation in which kabbage approved a suspicious loan became public in a florida lawsuit filed by a woman latoya clark who received more than 1 million in ppp loans to three businesses when the funds were deposited into accounts at jpmorgan chase the bank discovered that clark s businesses hadn t been incorporated before the ppp program s cutoff and froze the accounts clark sued chase and chase then filed a counterclaim against the borrower and kabbage which had originated the loan despite its questionable documentation in its response kabbage said it had not yet completed its investigation of the incident although the justice department rarely names lenders that processed fraudulent ppp applications kabbage has been named at least twice one case involved two loans worth 1 8 million to businesses that submitted forged information and the other involved a business that had inflated its payroll numbers and submitted a similar application to u s bank which flagged authorities kabbage had simply approved the 940 000 loan american express bernardini declined to comment further on pending litigation shortly after the application period for ppp s first round closed on aug 8 american express announced the kabbage purchase but the transaction included none of kabbage s loan portfolios either from the ppp or its pre pandemic conventional loans the ppp loans had either been sold to sba approved banks or bought by the federal reserve bernardini wouldn t say which banks now own the loans however and said that no potentially fraudulent loans had been pledged to the fed in april an ocean county new jersey resident contacted propublica after seeing his name attached to a kabbage loan for a nonexistent melon farm to see whether it was an isolated incident propublica took basic information the government released after a freedom of information act lawsuit by propublica and others and compared it with state business entity registries although registries don t pick up all sole proprietorships and independent contractors the absence of a name is an indication that the business might not exist as it turned out kabbage had made more than 60 loans in new jersey to unlisted businesses fake farms also showed up repeatedly in the sba s economic injury disaster loan program according to reports from local a common tie became apparent when the resident of the home to which one nonexistent business was registered said that he was a client of the certified public accountants at ciccone koseff company in march 2020 the firm notified its clients of what it called an ultimately unsuccessful ransomware attack that occurred the previous month according to information filed with maine s attorney general the attackers acquired social security numbers and financial information several other clients of the accounting firm including mancini the long beach mayor also had loans registered to their addresses reached by phone firm founder ray ciccone declined to comment but that cpa s data breach didn t account for all of the suspicious loans propublica found across the country searches for ppp applicants that didn t show up in state registration records yielded hundreds in 28 more states with dense clusters in florida nebraska and virginia other lenders had nonexistent businesses as well but fake farms only showed up in kabbage loans most followed a distinctive naming convention with part of the name of a resident or former resident of the home to which the business is registered plus a random agricultural term some of the fake loans listed addresses of people who d also legitimately applied for their businesses hartington nebraska anesthesiologist bruce reifenrath received a ppp loan for his practice in nearby yankton south dakota that s why the idea of one being approved for a potato farm was so strange we did a ppp loan last spring and it s pretty extensive the documentation reifenrath said reifenrath was part of a cluster of dubious kabbage loans in hartington that also included the home of j scott schrempp the president of the bank of hartington who confirmed that he did not own a strawberry farm schrempp said he had noticed the fake loan and reported it to the sba the sba data only reflects approved applications received from lenders some of which are then caught and not funded the sba also periodically updates its dataset to remove loans canceled by lenders but none of the suspicious loans pulled by propublica show undisbursed funds and they all have remained in the dataset for more than eight months one possible mechanism for the invented businesses is a technique known as synthetic identity theft in which a criminal obtains pieces of personally identifiable information such as a home address a social security number and a birthdate and combines it with fake information to build a credit profile the associated bank account then routes to the fraudster not the owner of the original information none of the residents of the phony farms propublica contacted were getting notices that they needed to repay the loans they didn t apply for because they didn t get any money but that doesn t mean they re not at risk according to james lee chief operating officer at the identity theft resource center just having an address linked to your name on a fraudulent loan can impact your credit lee said it can also pose problems for pre employment background checks insurance applications or new identification documents like passports and driver s licenses meanwhile if not corrected the fabricated identities will stay in circulation and become better at fooling other financial institutions those records get built into the credit and authentication systems used by government and commercial entities lee said each next time they are used and authenticated the more real they become that s what makes synthetic identity fraud so insidious this however is largely not kabbage s problem anymore after its huge blitz of ppp loans last summer kabbage had hundreds of thousands of borrowers whose loans would need to be serviced until they were closed out the loans could either be forgiven if the borrower demonstrated that they spent most of the money on payroll or paid back with interest but american express didn t acquire the part of kabbage s business that owned those loans instead a separate entity called k servicing would handle loan forgiveness and take applications for a second ppp draw that congress funded in december the servicer is led by former kabbage employees and its website looks very similar to kabbage s but american express says it has no affiliation if kabbage was understaffed for the volume of ppp loans it took on before the acquisition the situation has apparently worsened since then reddit yelp trustpilot facebook and better business bureau threads are replete with complaints from customers whose applications were denied or who received no communication from the company when the sba changed the rules in february to make the program more generous to independent contractors k servicing couldn t incorporate the new forms into its processing system so it told all new applicants to apply throughcompany smartbiz which had operated as a mostly online processor of sba loans even before the pandemic k servicing is run by kabbage s former head of program management laquisha milner who also runs her own consulting firm due to extenuating circumstances beyond our control currently our processing function is delayed milner emailed in response to detailed questions from propublica we are relentlessly exploring all available options to ensure our existing customers are able to maximize their loan forgiveness jennifer dienst is a freelance travel and events writer who received her first draw loan from kabbage and wants to apply for forgiveness before her window for doing so closes in the fall but she has been stymied by k servicing s failure to make the forms available please be patient with us as we prepare for the new forms a message on the loan portal reads meanwhile dienst s account has started accruing interest which milner said will not be charged if the loan is forgiven but it s making dienst nervous it s always the same response from k servicing we re updating our forgiveness forms and they ll be made available soon dienst said they ve been saying that for months

first things first cheap stocks are not necessarily better stocks in fact cheap stocks may have fallen from a higher price for good reason and now they are simply a fraction of their former size furthermore slicing a 500 million company into 100 million shares worth 5 each or 1 million shares worth 500 each is really just an academic exercise as the underlying business itself does not change does a pizza taste differently if it s cut into 80 very small pieces instead of eight big ones with that out of the way let s acknowledge that many investors look at high priced stocks and wonder if they should bother adding such a pricey investment to their portfolio when they can only buy one or two shares instead they find cheap stocks under 10 as a more attractive option if you re one of these people looking to add some lower priced investments to your portfolio then we at kiplinger can offer up a list of cheap stocks to buy and we re not the only ones saying it all the names here have consensus buy or strong buy recommendations from wall street according to analyst data collected from s p global market intelligence to that end here are 10 cheap stocks under 10 to consider based on current performance and bullish outlooks from the pros

the individual level and when i expanded the what if to the world at large it really raised some interesting questions that s when i felt like i needed to write it all out we re living in an interesting time where more and more people are taking more control regarding their place in our capitalistic society people are quiet quitting it s the age of the great resignation there s an increasing frequency of success stories in labor organizing and there s a record number of socialists in congress i wanted this story to be in conversation with what s going on in the world to interrogate why and how we participate in capitalism 2 a little surprise google double asteroid redirection test then wait a moment 3 he s got nothing but somebody else has something this teaser for

anniversary we spoke to nearly two dozen people involved in its making including zemeckis foster mcconaughey druyan sasha sagan and veteran producer lynda obst they disagreed on several aspects of contact s development saga but settled on some consensus contact was a lightning in a bottle project the kind of thing big movie studios barely made before and would probably never make again intellectually challenging emotionally messy heavy with metaphor wherein nobody shoots an alien in the face in front of an american flag we used to do that said foster we used to make movies that were resonant and were entertaining ann druyan this is 1978 carl and i are still working on cosmos at the time it was popular to say things like well if men are as smart as women then how come there are no female leonardos no female einsteins this made both of us furious i had just co written the part of cosmos about the great library of alexandria and the fact that hypatia who was the leader of the library was a mathematician focusing on the diophantine equations that newton would later become interested in her reward for being the great intellectual light of the library in 415 ad was to be ripped from her chariot that she was driving herself and carved to bits with abalone shells people were throwing everything at carl then he was such a phenomenon in the culture and everybody wanted to do something with him so we knew we could get a book and a movie contract we agreed one night sitting in the pool at our little rented house in west hollywood that we were going to tell a story in which not only would a woman be the intellectual hero but in the great tradition of gilgamesh she was going to go on the voyage and the guys would stay home 5 unionizing publishing uaw local 2110

admire the unstoppable fearsome delicious allure of the witch at crimereads witches are powerful women like all powerful women they have been maligned persecuted hated desired feared they are eternal mythical subjects a source of endless fascination in american history they occupy a unique place where folklore blurs the lines of reality we remember the witches of salem massachusetts who were not actually witches they have become totemic figures in television movies books and pop culture and their appeal shows no signs of waning as of this writing the peabody essex museum in salem is devoting a full scale exhibit to the power and imagery of the witch 8 investing time camestros felapton is inspired to think about time travel and energy after reading sheila jenne s theories of time travel his post was published on september 28 which is only appropriate too i was reading this neat summary of time travel rules in fiction and thinking about a couple of things basically angles and effort the idea that a small change at one point leads to a big change in the future aka two different kinds of things both known as a butterfly effect predates modern science fiction the proverb of consequences that typically starts with for want of a nail dates back to at least the 13th century and describes a causal chain of circumstances where a small issue the nail in a horseshoe leads to a major outcome put another way a small amount of effort in the past can lead to a result that would require a huge amount of effort if you were to attempt the same outcome in the present i think that gives a neat rationale for fiction where you want time travel that allows changes to the future but where you don t want an oops i stepped on a butterfly now donald trump is president situation 9 holding hands with death terry pratchett a life with footnotes by rob wilkins review anecdotes elephants and an embuggerance the guardian s frank cottrell boyce comes away wondering why pratchett was so underestimated caring for someone who has dementia is an overwhelmingly vivid experience full of pain and comedy there are heartbreaking and funny stories in a life with footnotes started by pratchett himself but written and completed by his longtime assistant rob wilkins about the things that pratchett s shrinking brain made him do he once accidentally donated 50 000 to bath postal museum for instance moments like that can supplant your memories of what a person was like before here wilkins who started working for the author in 2000 attempts to recover pratchett pre dementia his closeness to the subject means that the book is sometimes joyfully sometimes painfully intimate the description of the day pratchett s daughter rhianna was born for example is so animated by love it s as if this treasured moment was a jewel that pratchett placed in wilkins s care to ensure it would not be stolen away by the embuggerance 10 chan davis 1926 2022 author chandler davis died september 24 reports olav rokne who tweeted an extensive tribute that begins here chan davis 1926 2022 died on saturday an active fan an underappreciated author and in his day one of the few truly radical thinkers in the field davis was ahead of his time in terms of antiracism antifascism workers rights and gender equality 1 pic twitter com imzu8hu0lr h book club blog hugo_book_club september 27 2022 side note i became aware of chandler davis as a science fiction author only a couple of years ago because of gautambhatia88 but by an odd coincidence it turns out i met him several times in the 1980s as he worked on some math papers with my godfather dr peter lancaster 11 media birthday 1968 this i believe was truly one of the the classic episodes of the original star trek series airing fifty four years ago on nbc it scripted by d c fontana one of eleven episodes that she would write including catspaw that i dearly love and directed by john meredyth lucas as the second episode of the final season if you ve forgotten the story is kirk violated the neutral zone the romulans have a new bit of technology called a cloaking device just go with the idea please kirk pretends to be crazy then pretends to be a romulan to get to it meanwhile spock pretends to be in love but is he pretending who knows d c fontana says she based her script very loosely upon the pueblo incident but i ll be damned i can see this it s a cold war espionage thriller at heart and most excellently played out you did note the romulnan commander never gets named later novels including vulcan s heart by josepha sherman and susan shwartz gave her the name of liviana charvanek speaking of vulcans fontana deliberately kept the romance between her and spock low key to the finger games they did and then there s roddenberry s idea never done spock raining kisses on the bare shoulders of the romulan commander oh awful season three had no budget i repeat no budget for frills so this episode suffered several times from that kirk was supposed to have surgery done on him after dying but that got deep sixed and mccoy was supposed to accompany him back to the romulan ship but my oh my ears are expensive aren t they fontana would co write with derek chester a sequel star trek year four the enterprise experiment a graphic novel published by idw publishing in 2008 critics then and now love it it s airing on

me to furnish the post with a better graphic having laboured on the graphic i realised i had very little to say leaving the post as little more than my drawing of wright s windrose now mr wright

inquiry into the governance of artificial intelligence ai in july the uk government set out its emerging thinking on how it would regulate the use of ai it is expected to publish proposals in a white paper later this year which the committee would examine in its inquiry used to spot patterns in large datasets make predictions and automate processes ai s role in the uk economy and society is growing however there are concerns around its use mps will examine the potential impacts of biased algorithms in the public and private sectors a lack of transparency on how ai is applied and how automated decisions can be challenged will also be investigated in the inquiry mps will explore how risks posed to the public by the improper use of ai should be addressed and how the government can

february 2023 only those barcoded will be valid to swap out any remaining oldies we will have to fill out a request form and send it for free to a depot in edinburgh the ironic loop the loop of freeposting postage to receive same value postage in the post in order to in the beleaguered company s own words connect physical stamps to the digital world is not lost on me it s more than curmudgeonly irritation though i feel bewildered why does one stamp having the ability to play you shaun the sheep videos mean that all those other beauties have to go does the royal mail not realise

of the finest works that bradbury crafted was the illustrated man it was published seventy one years ago by doubleday company and consists of eighteen stories of which isfdb claims three are original to here let s note that the british edition published a year later by hart davis omits the rocket man the fire balloons the exiles and the concrete mixer and adds usher i from the martian chronicles and the playground the unrelated stories are weaved together by the framing story of the illustrated man involving a now wandering member of a carnival freak show with an almost completely tattooed body save one spot whom the unnamed narrator and a few other people meet my assumption there the man s tattoos supposedly created by a time traveling woman are individually animated and each tells a different story the stories would be adapted elsewhere some of the stories including the veldt the fox and the forest changed to to the future marionettes inc and zero hour were also dramatized for the fifties x minus one radio series the ray bradbury theater series used the concrete mixer the long rain marionettes inc the veldt zero hour whereas the fox and the forest was adapted for out of the unknown series seventeen years after it was published it would debut as a film the screenplay was by howard b kreitsek who adapted three of the stories from the collection the veldt the long rain and the last night of the world the last one a good choice i think to end the film spoilers now as we consider a beginning and a possible end the prologue tells of how the illustrated man came to be so after he encountered a mysterious woman named felicia our film narrator encounters our the illustrated man and watches the three stories play out as animated stories the plot comes to a terrifying conclusion when one of the people accompanying the illustrated man on his journey looks at the only blank patch of skin on his body and sees an image of his own murder at his hand of the illustrated man then attempts to kill the illustrated man and then flees into the night pursued by a still living illustrated man with the audience left undetermined as to his fate of either now back to our regular programming jack smight the film director decided that the carnival sideshow freak who appeared in the collection s prologue and epilogue made the best primary narrative device as for the illustrated man he cast rod steiger whom he had known since the fifties it failed horribly at the box office and critics hated it it was nominated for a hugo at the heicon 70 worldcon held in heidelberg germany but did not win i will let our writer have the last word here rod was very good in it but it wasn t a good film the script was terrible 10 today s birthdays born october 29 1906

by james h burns i couldn t believe i found myself talking to a dinosaur jim my father told me some years ago i should have felt silly but there i was with this happy tyrannosaur saying good afternoon my friend some people of course would have seen the t rex as glowering rather than with a smile my parents had gone to what must have been one of the very first editions of dinosaurs alive in 1989 a neat attraction featuring life sized primevals in a natural setting moving and roaring in animatronic splendor one could actually walk around the dinosaurs my folks saw this prehistoric park at sand points along the long island sound in new york also the site of the magnificent 1923 medieval styled castle falaise my dad hugh known to almost all by the nickname hy derived from his original birth name hyman birnbaum was a retired mechanical engineering professor at nyu polytechnic and the city college of new york and a decorated world war ii veteran in other words he wasn t necessarily one to be overwhelmed by whimsy although he certainly embraced that part of his personality if you were there with the dinosaurs by the woods you might have seen a rather dignified looking gentleman about six feet tall imagine if you will telly savalas with a grey crewcut and beard or from certain angles dean martin under similar accoutrements he was also a science fiction guy going back to the golden age of flash gordon in the newspapers and stanley g weinbaum and jack williamson and astounding and planet stories magazines on the newsstands in the 1930s he first must have seen dinosaurs come to life in the halcyon era of 1933 s king kong probably later in its run when a movie really could only cost a nickel one of the few easily accessible miracles of the depression still the greatest economic calamity to ever face our nation was that any american for the equivalent today of about a buck could see a cinematic miracle or for a bit more purchase over one hundred pages of pulp parables and for absolutely free tune into wonder on the radio with a myriad of adventure serials comedies and other entertainment as others have pointed out has there been a child of the century who wasn t fascinated by dinosaurs the first dinosaurs we would have shared must have been at the new york world s fair in 1965 in flushing meadows queens where the baseball mets still play in the second and final year of that unparalleled spectacular s existence we saw dinoland sinclair oil s famous dinosaur garden a small plastic stegosaurus soon became one of my prized possessions but the most stunning experience at the fair and a highlight not only of childhood but of many attendees lifetimes was the magic skyway the ford motor company in collaboration with walt disney and associates fashioned a ride where you actually sat in a real car the brand new automobile first took you through the distant past dinosaurs and early man and then as you went through what felt like a tunnel in time you were suddenly surrounded by dioramas of the worlds of tomorrow including a happy future in space for decades before the internet s inception and the ability to prove a veracity of memory people would doubt my toddler s reminiscence that the ford vehicles first went through a window and journeyed on a track outside the building several stories high in what resembled a glass corridor before reentering and commencing this voyage through the eons memory of course can be tricky my father beginning in the 1980s swore that as a three year old i insisted that the family wait for a ford convertible but when fact checking this small memoir i discovered that every one of the cars used for the exhibition was a convertible perhaps in 1965 i urged that we should wait for a mustang which was debuted at the fair a year earlier the other featured automobiles included galaxie 500s lincoln continentals mercury montereys ford falcons thunderbirds and mercury comets sadly disney felt that the magic skyway was too expensive to remount at disneyland but some of the dinosaurs were transferred to the park as well as a reconfigured cave man certainly much of the spirit of the flushing meadows exposition lives on in certain venues at disney s epcot in orlando florida there was also of course the hall of dinosaurs at new york s museum of natural history a chamber of awe that my dad first saw in his own youth there are few places i have been in my life that seem permeated with such reverence and in 1968 on one of my first trips to a movie theatre to see an adult motion picture as opposed to a kiddie matinee we saw a saturday afternoon double bill of one million years b c featuring the incredible stop motion animation dinosaurs of ray harryhausen seventh voyage of sinbad jason and the argonauts and the particularly resplendent raquel welch paired remarkably with planet of the apes virtually forgotten today though is what must have been one of the most widely viewed of filmed dinosaur depictions or at least the one in the most american homes in 1956 irwin allen lost in space the poseidon adventure put together a theatrical documentary the animal world which included a lengthy sequence on dinosaurs created by stop motion animation filmmakers willis o brien king kong mighty joe young and the aforementioned harryhausen viewmaster the amazing company that innovated three dimensional images released on circular reels that could be seen through a special hand held dual lens device licensed the movie using its mesozoic sequences for a packet entitled battle of the monsters unexpectedly and rather incredibly the reels make a cameo in jurassic world before home video viewmasters offered the most readily affordable chance to own a tv show or movie that one liked or at least a reproduction of such it can still be a thrill to see 3 d shots from other genre fare as zorro the man from u n c l e voyage to the bottom of the sea the addams family batman star trek the green hornet there were also excellent sets devoted to nasa and our early manned space missions the most fantastic viewmaster reels may have been their fairytale and mythology editions for which they devised their own models and dioramas the inherent enchantment of these hand crafted vistas seemed to touch a special place in the imagination and have remained timeless these miniatures and their photography were largely the work of florence thomas and later her assistant joe liptak in portland oregon thanks to their artistry and ingenuity it was also marvelous to see many of the most famous cartoon characters including bugs bunny and woody woodpecker be brought to realistic stereoscopic life i can still remember my shock as a boy in seeing the animal world s ceratosaurus through the viewer drawing bloood from its prey although i can guarantee you that at the time i had no idea of the first dinosaur s name battle of the monsters was released under different titles over the decades its model work easily holding its own against more contemporary effects outings and coincidental to this article it s intriguing to note that viewmaster was introduced at the very first world s fair in 1939 i felt bad when my father lay dying in the summer of 1993 that he may have missed jurassic park a movie that could have fulfilled what might have been some of his early dreams it was of course the least of my family s sorrows but my mother told me that he had gone out one july afternoon to catch it locally i knew that he had already been impressed by a sequence he saw on tv which he recounted as the heroes being afraid that they re about to be trampled by a herd of dinosaurs only to be ultimately ignored by the charging horde action which reminded him of a jungle stampede he thought he once saw in king solomon s mines or one of the other africa movies of the past somehow my dad wound up conveying to me that he did indeed love the movie i wasn t as crazy about jurassic park apparently but especially enjoyed and admired and was struck by really its last moments when the paleontologist gazes through the window of a soaring helicopter watching a flock of pelicans flying over the sea the film s subtle reflection on the long held theory that birds may be the modern descendants of dinosaurs i m not sure when i first encountered that premise but it has resonated with me as a lovely possibility for what now seems ages my parents always had a deep affinity for all creatures i grew up watching my mom with my dad s encouragement put food out daily for the birds and squirrels a habit i continue to this day often now for years as i watch the sparrows and mourning doves and starlings a dancing i think how lucky i ve been to know all these primordial and blissful kingdoms
1 antitrust action justice department sues to stop penguin random house s purchase of simon schuster reports cnn the justice department is suing to block penguin random house s proposed acquisition of simon schuster arguing that the combination of the two book business giants would likely harm competition in the publishing industry tuesday s complaint in united states district court is one of the first major antitrust actions by the biden administration the publishers said they are prepared to defend the deal in court calling it a pro consumer pro author and pro book seller transaction penguin random house and simon schuster are two members of the big five the industry s term for the five biggest publishers in the united states in a court filing on tuesday doj lawyers said the companies should not be allowed to combine because it would give penguin random house outsized influence over who and what is published and how much authors are paid for their work the new york times has a bit more about the government s legal arguments justice dept sues penguin random house over simon schuster deal in a publishing landscape dominated by a handful of mega corporations penguin random house towers over the others it operates more than 300 imprints worldwide and has 15 000 new releases a year far more than the other four major u s publishers with its 2 2 billion proposed acquisition of simon schuster penguin random house stood to become substantially larger the deal was challenged amid a shifting atmosphere in washington toward consolidation where there has been increased scrutiny on competition and the power wielded by big companies like amazon and facebook the move provides a window into how the biden administration will handle these concerns going forward rather than concerns solely over harm to consumers the department of justice said the acquisition could be detrimental to producers in this case authors in what is called a monopsony as opposed to a monopoly the biden administration filed its case against penguin random house in the united states district court for the district of columbia on tuesday a combined statement issued by penguin random house and simon schuster contends doj s lawsuit is wrong on the facts the law and public policy daniel petrocelli vice chair of o melveny meyers and prh s lead trial attorney said importantly doj has not found nor does it allege that the combination will reduce competition in the sale of books the publishing industry is strong and vibrant and has seen strong growth at all levels we are confident that the robust and competitive landscape that exists will ensure a decision that the acquisition will promote not harm competition prh and s s attorneys make additional arguments in the linked statement 2

the full moon nine 10ths of a triumph on john steinbeck s murder at full moon at la review of books at first glance murder at full moon seems to consist primarily of the clichéd routines and tropes of detective fiction circa 1930 the whodunnit structure the eccentric but all knowing detective the hapless sidekick the events that abide by twenty rules for writing detective stories laid out by s s van dine in 1928 and by the ten commandments for mystery stories conceived of by ronald knox in 1929 the gathering of the characters at the end to watch the detective reveal and apprehend the murderer and so on a superficial reading of murder at full moon could indeed lead one to claim that it is a shameless commercial satire of pulp detective novels or a cynical attempt at a standard commercial mystery thriller but what steinbeck clearly attempted to do and mostly succeeded at doing was tell a mystery story about mysteries as they were written in 1930 and to challenge his fellow mystery authors to write more ambitious material in a more intelligent way to step up their game 6 under construction cora buhlert s newest fancast spotlight interview features hugo finalist worldbuilding for

in our literary family tree you might need mental floss after reading this sentence repeatedly a dark and stormy night the history of literature s worst sentence but can it be true that edward bulwer lytton inspired a forerunner of sf fandom if you want to start a novel your options for an opening line are just this side of infinite but if you want to start a novel badly any cartoon beagle can tell you that there s only one choice it was a dark and stormy night the phrase has become so ingrained in our literary culture that we rarely give much thought to its origin and when he put pen to paper it s likely that author and politician edward bulwer lytton had no idea just how infamous his dark and stormy night would become bulwer lytton was once as widely read as his friend charles dickens but today he s remembered almost exclusively for one bad sentence it s an ironic legacy for a prolific author who influenced some of the most popular novels in english literature helped invent sci fi fandom laid the groundwork for modern crime fiction and accidentally sparked a movement for an important social reform bulwer lytton s 1862 novel a strange story is thought to have influenced dracula and his 1871 science fiction novel the coming race inspired the world s first sci fi convention and gave rise to an exceptionally bizarre nazi conspiracy theory 9 memory lane 2001 twenty years

by his estate is always interesting john steinbeck s estate urged to let the world read his shunned werewolf novel in the guardian years before becoming one of america s most celebrated authors john steinbeck wrote at least three novels which were never published two of them were destroyed by the young writer as he struggled to make his name but a third a full length mystery werewolf story entitled murder at full moon has survived unseen in an archive ever since being rejected for publication in 1930 now a british academic is calling for the steinbeck estate to finally allow the publication of the work written almost a decade before masterpieces such as the grapes of wrath his epic about the great depression and the struggles of migrant farm workers there would be a huge public interest in a totally unknown werewolf novel by one of the best known most read american writers of the 20th century said professor gavin jones a specialist in american literature at stanford university but steinbeck s literary agents mcintosh otis told the observer they would not be publishing the novel as steinbeck wrote murder at full moon under a pseudonym and did not choose to publish

by his estate is always interesting john steinbeck s estate urged to let the world read his shunned werewolf novel in the guardian years before becoming one of america s most celebrated authors john steinbeck wrote at least three novels which were never published two of them were destroyed by the young writer as he struggled to make his name but a third a full length mystery werewolf story entitled murder at full moon has survived unseen in an archive ever since being rejected for publication in 1930 now a british academic is calling for the steinbeck estate to finally allow the publication of the work written almost a decade before masterpieces such as the grapes of wrath his epic about the great depression and the struggles of migrant farm workers there would be a huge public interest in a totally unknown werewolf novel by one of the best known most read american writers of the 20th century said professor gavin jones a specialist in american literature at stanford university but steinbeck s literary agents mcintosh otis told the observer they would not be publishing the novel as steinbeck wrote murder at full moon under a pseudonym and did not choose to publish the work during his lifetime we uphold what steinbeck had wanted they said as the estate s agents we do not further exploit the works beyond what had been the author and estate s wishes 3 take the

the fact that some children in this country went without in classroom learning for over a year because of the pandemic is certainly tragic but not merely because students went without a proper education and proper socializing there s a staggering economic cost as well as bryan walsh reported for axios such a long term economic cost could reach into the trillions advertisement walsh cites covid 19 school closures long run macroeconomic effects from the wharton school at the university of pennsylvania researchers note that pwbm estimates that the learning loss from school closures reduced gdp by 3 6 percent in 2050 extending the 2021 22 school year by one month would cost about 75 billion nationally but would limit the reduction in gdp to 3 1 percent this smaller reduction in gdp produces a net present value gain of 1 2 trillion over the next three decades equal to about a 16 return for each 1 invested in extending the 2021 22 school year a drop in productivity drags down economic growth and wages overall we project that the productivity losses current k 12 students experience as a result of school closures lead to a 3 6 percent decrease in gdp and a 3 5 percent decrease in hourly wages by 2050 relative to the counterfactual where there had been no disruption to learning government tax revenues decline and consequently government debt cumulates more quickly higher debt along with less total savings by individuals with lower incomes leads to a lower real capital stock lowering wages and gdp further by 2050 the nation s capital stock will be 4 1 percent lower and government debt will be 5 2 percent higher note that current primary schoolers will be aged 34 to 40 in 2050 so the drop in their productivity will continue to affect the economy for many years afterwards walsh also writes that s a result of lowered labor productivity in the workers of tomorrow due both to disrupted education and the generally inferior substitution of remote learning especially as it was practiced during the pandemic linking to why education technology can t save remote learning by ashley gold truly our children and our economy are being subject to a significant disadvantage made all the more frustrating by just how cozy the biden administration and the teachers union were reported to have been according to the burbio school opening tracker more than 30 percent of k 12 students still aren t attending school every day the tracker explains that states are calculated by weighting virtual instruction at 0 hybrid instruction 2 3 days per week in person at 50 and traditional 5 days in person at 100 while 12 states are at 100 percent hawaii as the worst state is at 38 5 percent and california as the next is at 53 5 percent

the shoreline communities of ocean county new jersey are a summertime getaway for throngs of urbanites lined with vacation homes and ice cream parlors not exactly pastoral which is odd considering dozens of paycheck protection program loans to supposed farms that flowed into the beach towns last year as the first round of the federal government s relief program for small businesses wound down last summer ritter wheat club and deely nuts ostensibly a wheat farm and a tree nut farm each got 20 833 the maximum amount available for sole proprietorships tomato cramber up the coast in brielle got 12 739 while seaweed bleiman in manahawkin got 19 957 none of these entities exist in new jersey s business records and the owners of the homes at which they are purportedly located expressed surprise when contacted by propublica one entity categorized as a cattle ranch beefy king was registered in ppp records to the home address of joe mancini the mayor of long beach township there s no farming here we re a sandbar for christ s sake said mancini reached by telephone mancini said that he had no cows at his home just three dogs all of these loans to nonexistent businesses came through kabbage an online lending platform that processed nearly 300 000 ppp loans before the first round of funds ran out in august 2020 second only to bank of america in total propublica found 378 small loans totaling 7 million to fake business entities all of which were structured as single person operations and received close to the largest loan for which such micro businesses were eligible the overwhelming majority of them are categorized as farms even in the unlikeliest of locales from potato fields in palm beach to orange groves in minnesota the kabbage pattern is only one slice of a sprawling fraud problem that has suffused the paycheck protection program from its creation in march 2020 as an attempt to keep small businesses on life support while they were forced to shut down with speed as its strongest imperative the effort run by the federal small business administration initially lacked even the most basic safeguards to prevent opportunists from submitting fabricated documentation government watchdogs have said while that may have allowed millions of businesses to keep their doors open it has also required a massive cleanup operation on the backend the sba s inspector general estimated in january that the agency approved loans for 55 000 potentially ineligible businesses and that 43 000 obtained more money than their reported payrolls would justify the department of justice relying on special agents from across the government to investigate has brought charges against hundreds of individuals accused of gaming pandemic response programs drawn by generous fees for each loan processed kabbage was among a band of online lenders that joined enthusiastically in originating loans through their automated platforms that helped millions of borrowers who d been turned down by traditional banks but it also created more opportunities for cheating propublica examined sba loans processed by several of the most prolific online lenders and found that kabbage appears to have originated the most loans to businesses that don t appear to exist and the only concentration of loans to phantom farms in some cases these problems would ve been easy to spot with just a little more upfront diligence which the program s structure did not encourage pushing this through financial institutions created some pretty bad incentives said naftali harris the ceo of sentilink which helps lenders detect potential identity theft this is definitely a case where companies that decided they wanted to be more careful in terms of giving out loans were penalized for doing so presented with propublica s findings sba inspector general spokeswoman farrah saint surin said that her office had hundreds of investigations underway but that she did not have any information to share or available for public reporting at this time reuters reported that federal investigators were probing whether kabbage and other fintech lenders miscalculated ppp loan amounts and the doj declined to confirm or deny the existence of any investigation to propublica kabbage which was acquired by american express last fall did not have an explanation for propublica s specific findings but it said it adhered to required fraud protocols at any point in the loan process if fraudulent activity was suspected or confirmed it was reported to fincen the sba s office of the inspector general and other federal investigators with kabbage providing its full cooperation spokesman paul bernardini said in an emailed statement as soon as the pandemic swept across america kabbage was in trouble the online lending platform had launched in 2009 as part of a generation of financial technology companies known as non banks alternative lenders or simply fintechs that act as an intermediary between investors and small businesses that might not have relationships with traditional banks based in atlanta it had become a buzzy standout in the city s tech scene offering employees silicon valley perks like free catered lunches and beer on tap it advertised its mission as helping small businesses acquire funds they need for their big breaks as a recruiting video parody of michael jackson s thriller put it in 2016 the basic innovation behind the burgeoning fintech industry is automating underwriting and incorporating more data sources into risk evaluation using statistical models to determine whether an applicant will repay a loan that lower barrier to credit comes with a price kabbage would lend to borrowers with thin or checkered credit histories in exchange for steep fees the original partner for most of its loans celtic bank is based in utah which has no cap on interest rate allowing kabbage to charge more in states with stricter regulations with backing from the powerhouse venture capital firm softbank kabbage had been planning an ipo its model foundered however when kabbage s largest customer base small businesses like coffee shops hair salons and yoga studios was forced to shut down last march kabbage stopped writing loans even for businesses that weren t harmed by the pandemic days later it furloughed more than half of its nearly 600 person staff and faced an uncertain future the paycheck protection program which was signed into law as part of the cares act on march 27 2020 with an initial 349 billion in funding was a lifeline not just to small businesses but fintechs as well lenders would get a fee of 5 on loans worth less than 350 000 which would account for the vast majority of transactions the loans were government guaranteed and processors bore almost no liability as long as they made sure that applications were complete at first encouraged by the treasury department traditional banks prioritized their own customers an efficient way to process applications with little fraud risk since the borrowers information was already on file but that left millions of the smallest businesses including independent contractors out to dry they turned instead to a collection of online lenders that have sprung up offering short term loans to businesses kabbage lendio bluevine fundbox square capital and others would process applications automatically with little human review required for the platforms this was also easy money in the first funding round that ran out last august kabbage completed 297 587 loans totaling 7 billion it received 5 of each loan it made directly and an undisclosed cut of the proceeds for those it processed for banks its total revenue was likely in the hundreds of millions of dollars a lawsuit filed by a south carolina accounting firm alleges that kabbage was among several lenders that refused to pay fees to agents who helped put together applications even though the cares act had said they could charge up to 1 of the smaller loans a provision that was later reversed for kabbage that revenue kept the company alive while it sought a buyer for all of these guys it was like shooting fish in a barrel if you could do the minimum amount of due diligence required you could fill up the pipeline with these applications said a former kabbage executive one of four former employees interviewed by propublica they spoke on the condition of anonymity to avoid retaliation at their current jobs or from industry giant american express to handle the volume kabbage brought back laid off workers starting at 15 an hour when that failed to attract enough people they increased the hourly rate to 35 and then 40 and awarded gift cards for reaching certain benchmarks according to a former employee with visibility into the loan processing at a certain point they were like yes get more applications out and you ll get this reward if you do the former employee said bernardini said the company did not offer incentive compensation in a report on its ppp participation through last august kabbage boasted that 75 of all approved applications were processed without human review for every 790 employees at major u s banks the report said kabbage had one that s in part because traditional banks which also take deposits are much more heavily regulated than fintech institutions that just process loans to participate in the ppp fintechs had to quickly set up systems that could comply with anti money laundering laws the human review that did happen according to two people involved in it was perfunctory they weren t saying is this legitimate they were just saying are all the fields filled out said another former employee as acquisition talks proceeded the employee noted kabbage managers who held the most company stock had a built in incentive to process as many loans as possible if there s anything suspicious you can pass it along to account review but account review was full of people who stood to make a lot of money from the acquisition one situation in which kabbage approved a suspicious loan became public in a florida lawsuit filed by a woman latoya clark who received more than 1 million in ppp loans to three businesses when the funds were deposited into accounts at jpmorgan chase the bank discovered that clark s businesses hadn t been incorporated before the ppp program s cutoff and froze the accounts clark sued chase and chase then filed a counterclaim against the borrower and kabbage which had originated the loan despite its questionable documentation in its response kabbage said it had not yet completed its investigation of the incident although the justice department rarely names lenders that processed fraudulent ppp applications kabbage has been named at least twice one case involved two loans worth 1 8 million to businesses that submitted forged information and the other involved a business that had inflated its payroll numbers and submitted a similar application to u s bank which flagged authorities kabbage had simply approved the 940 000 loan american express bernardini declined to comment further on pending litigation shortly after the application period for ppp s first round closed on aug 8 american express announced the kabbage purchase but the transaction included none of kabbage s loan portfolios either from the ppp or its pre pandemic conventional loans the ppp loans had either been sold to sba approved banks or bought by the federal reserve bernardini wouldn t say which banks now own the loans however and said that no potentially fraudulent loans had been pledged to the fed in april an ocean county new jersey resident contacted propublica after seeing his name attached to a kabbage loan for a nonexistent melon farm to see whether it was an isolated incident propublica took basic information the government released after a freedom of information act lawsuit by propublica and others and compared it with state business entity registries although registries don t pick up all sole proprietorships and independent contractors the absence of a name is an indication that the business might not exist as it turned out kabbage had made more than 60 loans in new jersey to unlisted businesses fake farms also showed up repeatedly in the sba s economic injury disaster loan program according to reports from local news outlets a common tie became apparent when the resident of the home to which one nonexistent business was registered said that he was a client of the certified public accountants at ciccone koseff company in march 2020 the firm notified its clients of what it called an ultimately unsuccessful ransomware attack that occurred the previous month according to information filed with maine s attorney general the attackers acquired social security numbers and financial information several other clients of the accounting firm including mancini the long beach mayor also had loans registered to their addresses reached by phone firm founder ray ciccone declined to comment but that cpa s data breach didn t account for all of the suspicious loans propublica found across the country searches for ppp applicants that didn t show up in state registration records yielded hundreds in 28 more states with dense clusters in florida nebraska and virginia other lenders had nonexistent businesses as well but fake farms only showed up in kabbage loans most followed a distinctive naming convention with part of the name of a resident or former resident of the home to which the business is registered plus a random agricultural term some of the fake loans listed addresses of people who d also legitimately applied for their businesses hartington nebraska anesthesiologist bruce reifenrath received a ppp loan for his practice in nearby yankton south dakota that s why the idea of one being approved for a potato farm was so strange we did a ppp loan last spring and it s pretty extensive the documentation reifenrath said reifenrath was part of a cluster of dubious kabbage loans in hartington that also included the home of j scott schrempp the president of the bank of hartington who confirmed that he did not own a strawberry farm schrempp said he had noticed the fake loan and reported it to the sba the sba data only reflects approved applications received from lenders some of which are then caught and not funded the sba also periodically updates its dataset to remove loans canceled by lenders but none of the suspicious loans pulled by propublica show undisbursed funds and they all have remained in the dataset for more than eight months one possible mechanism for the invented businesses is a technique known as synthetic identity theft in which a criminal obtains pieces of personally identifiable information such as a home address a social security number and a birthdate and combines it with fake information to build a credit profile the associated bank account then routes to the fraudster not the owner of the original information none of the residents of the phony farms propublica contacted were getting notices that they needed to repay the loans they didn t apply for because they didn t get any money but that doesn t mean they re not at risk according to james lee chief operating officer at the identity theft resource center just having an address linked to your name on a fraudulent loan can impact your credit lee said it can also pose problems for pre employment background checks insurance applications or new identification documents like passports and driver s licenses meanwhile if not corrected the fabricated identities will stay in circulation and become better at fooling other financial institutions those records get built into the credit and authentication systems used by government and commercial entities lee said each next time they are used and authenticated the more real they become that s what makes synthetic identity fraud so insidious this however is largely not kabbage s problem anymore after its huge blitz of ppp loans last summer kabbage had hundreds of thousands of borrowers whose loans would need to be serviced until they were closed out the loans could either be forgiven if the borrower demonstrated that they spent most of the money on payroll or paid back with interest but american express didn t acquire the part of kabbage s business that owned those loans instead a separate entity called k servicing would handle loan forgiveness and take applications for a second ppp draw that congress funded in december the servicer is led by former kabbage employees and its website looks very similar to kabbage s but american express says it has no affiliation if kabbage was understaffed for the volume of ppp loans it took on before the acquisition the situation has apparently worsened since then reddit yelp consumer affairs trustpilot facebook
