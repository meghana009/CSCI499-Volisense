barbara ortutay and michael liedtke the associated press san francisco ap sheryl sandberg the no 2 executive at facebook owner meta who helped turn its business from startup to digital advertising empire while also taking blame for some of its biggest missteps is stepping down sandberg has served as chief operating officer at the social media giant for 14 years she joined from google in 2008 four years before facebook went public when i took this job in 2008 i hoped i would be in this role for five years fourteen years later it is time for me to write the next chapter of my life sandberg wrote on her facebook page wednesday sandberg has led facebook now meta s advertising business and was responsible for nurturing it from its infancy into an over 100 billion a year powerhouse as the company s second most recognized face after ceo mark zuckerberg sandberg has also become a polarizing figure amid revelations of how some of her business decisions for facebook helped propagate misinformation and hate speech as one of the most prominent female executives in the tech industry she was also often criticized for not doing enough both for women and for others harmed by facebook s products her public speaking expertise her seemingly effortless ability to bridge the worlds of tech business and politics served as a sharp contrast to zuckerberg especially in facebook s early years but zuckerberg has since been catching up trained in part for the several congressional hearings he s been called to testify in to defend facebook s practices neither sandberg nor zuckerberg gave any indication that sandberg s resignation wasn t her decision but she s also appeared somewhat sidelined in recent years with other executives close to zuckerberg such as chris cox who returned in 2020 as chief product officer after a yearlong break from the company becoming more prominent sheryl sandberg had an enormous impact on facebook meta and the broader business world she helped facebook build a world class ad buying platform and develop groundbreaking ad formats said debra aho williamson an analyst at insider intelligence but she added that facebook faced huge scandals under sandberg s watch including the 2016 u s presidential election the cambridge analytica privacy debacle in 2018 and the 2021 riot at the u s capitol and now meta is facing a slowdown in user growth and ad revenue that is now testing the business foundation that the company was built on she said the company needs to find a new way forward and perhaps this was the best time for sandberg to depart sandberg is leaving meta in the fall and will continue to serve on the company s board zuckerberg said in his own facebook post that javier olivan who currently oversees key functions at meta s four main apps facebook instagram whatsapp and messenger will serve as meta s new coo but it will be a different job than the one sandberg held for the past 14 years it will be a more traditional coo role where javi will be focused internally and operationally building on his strong track record of making our execution more efficient and rigorous zuckerberg wrote while sandberg has long been zuckerberg s no 2 even sitting next to him pre pandemic at least in the company s menlo park california headquarters she also had a very public facing job meeting with lawmakers holding focus groups and speaking out on issues such as women in the workplace and most recently abortion i think meta has reached the point where it makes sense for our product and business groups to be more closely integrated rather than having all the business and operations functions organized separately from our products zuckerberg wrote sandberg who lost her husband dave goldberg suddenly in 2015 said she is not entirely sure what the future will bring but i know it will include focusing more on my foundation and philanthropic work which is more important to me than ever given how critical this moment is for women she wrote adding that she is also getting married this summer and that parenting their expanded family of five children will also be a part of this future the adult in the room sandberg now 52 first helped google build what quickly became the internet s biggest and most lucrative advertising network but she left that post to take on the challenge of transforming facebook s freewheeling social

digital advertising empire while also taking blame for some of its biggest missteps is stepping down sandberg has served as chief operating officer at the social media giant for 14 years she joined

of my life sandberg wrote on her facebook page wednesday sandberg has led facebook now meta s advertising business and was responsible for nurturing it from its infancy into an over 100 billion a year powerhouse as the company s second most recognized face after ceo mark zuckerberg sandberg has also become a polarizing figure amid revelations of how some of her business decisions for facebook helped propagate misinformation and hate speech as one of the most prominent female executives in the tech industry she was also often criticized for not doing enough both for women and for others harmed by facebook s products her public speaking expertise her seemingly effortless ability to bridge the worlds of tech business and politics served as a sharp contrast to zuckerberg especially in facebook s early years but zuckerberg has since been catching up trained in part for the several congressional hearings he s been called to testify in to defend facebook s practices neither sandberg nor zuckerberg gave any indication that sandberg s resignation wasn t her decision but she s also appeared somewhat sidelined in recent years with other executives close to zuckerberg such as chris cox who returned in 2020 as chief product officer after a yearlong break from the company becoming more prominent sheryl sandberg had an enormous impact on facebook meta and the broader business world she helped facebook build a world class ad buying platform and develop groundbreaking ad formats said debra aho williamson an analyst at insider intelligence but she added that facebook faced huge scandals under sandberg s watch including the 2016 u s presidential election the cambridge analytica privacy debacle in 2018 and the 2021 riot at the u s capitol and now meta is facing a slowdown in user growth and ad revenue that is now testing the business foundation that the company was built on she said the company needs to find a new way forward and perhaps this was the best time for sandberg to depart sandberg is leaving meta in the fall and will continue to serve on the company s board zuckerberg said in his own facebook post that javier olivan who currently oversees key functions at meta s four main apps facebook instagram whatsapp and messenger will serve as meta s new coo but it will be a different job than the one sandberg held for the past 14 years it will be a

on sunday mar 16 2008 bear stearns was bought by jpmorgan chase co nyse with support and financial guarantees from the fed for 2 a share it was quite the fall from 170 a year earlier wall street was in the early rounds of a bout with unprecedented financial instability and the economy would soon follow investors were relieved bear stearns avoided bankruptcy in spite of the ominous clouds on the horizon and recent financial instability within hours of the market opening following the bear stearns takeover stocks started rising and didn t look back for a month as shown below the rallied nearly 15 for a month following the collapse of a significant 85 year old investment bank while the market didn t regain its october 2007peak animal spirits were rekindled for a brief while investors looked the other way they assumed whatever killed bear stearns was resolved despite improving investor sentiment underlying fundamental conditions continued to worsen wall street s largest banks took advantage of the short lived market stability to unload their riskiest positions on unsuspecting investors telling the tale of the bear stearns rally and investors myopic vision in the spring of 2008 is a valuable lesson for today bear stearns the failure of bear stearns was not a shock to most investors in fact many banks and a few notable hedge funds met a similar demise in the preceding two years further house prices were falling subprime loans were defaulting cdos were breaking and a housing bubble of massive proportions was popping low mortgage rates relaxed borrowing standards and poor banking regulation led to a housing bubble newly invented exotic financial derivatives tied to subprime mortgages multiplied the financial hardship for investors we highly recommend reading or watching the big short by michael lewis for more information on the housing bubble the pin was nearing the bubble when bear stearns failed despite the proximity to a system wide failure investors ignored the writing on the wall after a brief respite and a double digit rally new financial leaks started springing by late summer it was apparent that fannie mae otc freddie mac otc aig nyse and countrywide were failing even the biggest banks and brokers like jp morgan goldman sachs nyse and bank of america nyse were in trouble the post bear stearns rally was an opportunity to sell stocks and reduce risks many investors paid dearly for ignoring the fundamentals and hoping the worst was behind them the current situation in march 2020 the s p 500 fell 30 in a matter of weeks as covid wreaked havoc on markets with many facets of the economy primarily shuttered the government became the economy they flooded the economy with money including the unprecedented step of writing checks directly to citizens and businesses the unemployment rate soared from 3 5 in february to 14 7 in april but within months the unemployment rate fell sharply it ended december 2020 at 6 7 and sits near 50 year lows the federal reserve via qe and very low interest rates was fully supportive of government deficits in march 2020 the fed lowered fed funds from 1 50 to 0 further they embarked on a 120 billion a month bond buying spree qe by dec 31 2021 the government deficit had grown by over 6 trillion the feds balance sheet nearly matched the increase despite a full economic recovery occurring much earlier in 2021 the government and fed kept the fiscal and monetary gas pedals floored investors quickly overcame their fear of covid they were enamored by the monetary magic of the fed and the direct and indirect liquidity it supplies markets investors didn t fight the fed they embraced the government s actions and bought relentlessly don t fight the fed since 2008 fed liquidity via lower rates and qe has correlated well with increasing asset prices and valuations similarly lower asset prices occurred in the brief instances where the fed raised rates and did qt valuations and fundamentals take a

example video title will go here for this video example video title will go here for this video gov mike dewine is expected to sign the bill columbus ohio a bill that would allow ohio s school employees to arm themselves once again is now at gov mike dewine s desk house bill 99 was passed by the ohio senate and house on wednesday the legislation aims to undo the effect of an ohio supreme court ruling last year which held that under current law armed school workers would need hundreds of hours of training democrats said the legislation sends the wrong message a week after the massacre of 19 children and two teachers at an elementary school in uvalde texas republicans say the measure could prevent such shootings under the latest version of the bill school employees who carry guns would need up to 24 hours of initial training then up to eight hours of requalification training annually the bill didn t specify a total minimum training requirement leading to criticism from democrats that the legislation is being pushed too quickly without all the details training must include how to stop an active shooter how to de escalate a violent situation trauma and first aid care at least four hours in scenario based or simulated training exercises and completing tactical live firearms training according to the bill the bill is opposed by major law enforcement groups and gun control advocates and supported by a handful of police departments and school districts more than two dozen states allow the arming of school employees under some circumstances the gop controlled senate approved the measure wednesday along mostly partisan lines a day after its passage in committee debate was lengthy and charged sen theresa fedor a toledo democrat called the training requirements inadequate and warned that lawmakers supporting the bill will have blood on your hands if the legislation leads to an accidental shooting incident in a school sen niraj antani a dayton area republican accused democrats of crying crocodile tears by continually exaggerating the negative consequences of bills expanding access to guns republican gov mike dewine supports the legislation as long as it requires adequate and annual training for armed employees dewine underscored his support last week as he announced plans to spend a significant amount of money to help schools create physical barriers against attacks without going into details the supreme court ruling came after madison local schools in southwestern ohio voted to allow teachers and staff who received 24 hours of one time concealed weapons training to carry firearms following a 2016 school shooting after the district adopted the armed program in 2018 a group of parents successfully sued the district to prevent teachers from being armed without extensive training equivalent to what a police officer undergoes one of those parents erin gabbard testified in opposition to the bill tuesday calling it radical and reckless this does not protect our children it endangers them gabbard said allowing teachers to go armed with our children at school with at most 24 hours of training is woefully inadequate it makes our children less safe bill opponents including educators and gun control advocates far outnumbered supporters at tuesday s hearing one supporter buckeye firearms association lobbyist rob sexton said arming teachers would give children a fighting chance in the event the worst happens in our schools he also warned against making training so rigorous that it becomes a disincentive that people don t actually wind up enrolling in the program we actually want school districts and people to be willing to take advantage of this option to protect our kids since the bill requires that armed employees have a concealed weapons permit that adds eight hours to the training requirement sexton said the bill is opposed by major law enforcement groups and gun control advocates and supported by a handful of police departments and school districts dewine released a statement indicating he intends to sign the bill last week i called on the general assembly to pass a bill that would allow local school districts if they so chose to designate armed staff for school security and safety my office worked with the general assembly to remove hundreds of hours of curriculum irrelevant to school safety and to ensure training requirements were specific to a school environment and contained significant scenario based training house bill 99 accomplishes these goals and i thank the general assembly for passing this bill to protect ohio children and teachers i look forward to signing this important legislation

nasdaq new york a scorching rally in u s energy shares has left investors facing a tough decision hold on despite growing worries that global growth will slow or lock in profits in one of the few areas of the stock market that has thrived this year the s p 500 energy sector spny has surged 55 7 year to date on the back of soaring oil prices making it a welcome counterweight in portfolios during a year in which the broader s p 500 spx has declined by 13 3 some individual energy names have delivered returns more typically seen in high flying technology over the past decade exxon mobil corp xom n and chevron corp cvx n have gained 57 and 49 year to date respectively while occidental petroleum corp oxy n has soared about 140 u s crude oil prices clc1 have jumped 53 year to date supporting oil and gas shares even as they help spur the steepest inflation in decades so far energy shares have weathered hawkish pivots from the federal reserve and other central banks which have stoked worries about slowing growth that could crimp energy demand still there are signs some investors may be taking profits while the sector is up 11 since late april there have been five straight weeks of net outflows for energy sector funds overall according to refinitiv lipper data the fundamentals have really improved this year for the group said james ragan director of wealth management research at d a davidson the risks are that if we do go into some type of deeper recession globally that you could see some demand destruction investors sticking with their energy bets cite the sector s strong earnings prospects valuations that remain low on a historical basis and expectations oil prices will stay elevated following the conflict in ukraine that tightened supply s p 500 energy company earnings overall topped expectations in the first quarter and are expected to more than double in 2022 versus a 9 rise for the broad s p 500 according to refinitiv companies in the 21 stock energy sector trade at 10 times forward earnings estimates overall compared with a long term median of 15 5 times according to refinitiv datastream the s p 500 trades at about 17 times by comparison energy stocks don t have a secular growth story like tech so investors only pay attention to these names when they are dramatically outperforming on the bottom line and estimates are going up wrote nicholas colas co founder of datatrek research in a recent note that is happening now and given how low 2023 estimates are we expect that will continue some investors believe more disciplined capital spending from companies is adding support for the sector for example 727 rigs are operating in the united states according to the latest count from baker hughes bkr n compared with more than 1 800 in mid 2014 when u s crude last topped 100 a barrel in prior cycles companies would be spending like drunken sailors to put new rigs in the ground and find oil said walter todd chief investment officer at greenwood capital which owns stocks including chevron and eog resources inc eog n now the cash flow profile of these companies is like nothing we have seen in this space for a long long time others however are concerned demand may wane as china s economy is hit by coronavirus related lockdowns or if the u s economy slides into a recession a possibility as the fed pledges to tighten monetary policy until it tames inflation cfra last month lowered its recommended exposure to the energy sector to marketweight from overweight saying that as a result of the rising risk of recession or stagflation cfra thinks global demand will have a hard time remaining strong shares could also suffer if investors rotate back in to technology or other areas of the market punished in this year s selloff the energy sector is up some 40 over the past decade versus a roughly 450 gain for the s p 500 technology sector splrct part of that underperformance has stemmed from investors shunning oil companies and fossil fuel for environmental reasons still investors are recognizing that it may be a while before alternative energy sources become more widespread said hans olsen chief investment officer at fiduciary trust company who has a positive outlook on the energy sector you have both a valuation argument and the operating environment we are in right now is really quite positive for the energy companies olsen said
the days of netflix releasing 125 new titles in a single month as they are doing this june somehow could soon come to an end in the wake of netflix s disappointing subscriber numbers last quarter and a subsequent dip in the company s stock price the streaming service reportedly has reassessed its production priorities according to a new piece in the hollywood reporter netflix executives in charge of film production are now given a new directive in their priorities to make bigger better fewer movies in other words you may start to see fewer films coming from netflix particularly in the lower budget range here was an example cited in the piece expect to a see a more subtle change instead of making two movies for 10 million as an example the company will make one for 20 million the goal will be to make the best version of something instead of cheapening out for the sake of quantity says one insider the piece ends claiming netflix is entering a new era marked by discipline and also cited one anonymous source who claimed the tendency to do anything to attract talent and giving them carte blanche is going away the example given of such a past tendency was martin scorsese s massive mob movie the irishman which cost a reported 175 million but the irishman was a huge hit on netflix it remains among the seventh most watched film in the service s entire history according to their own publicly released data and if the studio is going to continue to make bigger movies and maybe concentrate even more on big movies it s not entirely clear how that equates to more discipline that feels like a contradiction we re going to be disciplined in how he make obscenely expensive movies the reality is netflix makes so many movies right now upwards of a dozen every single month of the year that even if they throttled back a little bit i doubt most subscribers would even notice and if your paying customers wouldn t notice if you spent less money on the product you offer them isn t that something you should probably do the most popular non english shows on netflix these are the most popular tv shows that are not in english based on the amount of hours of the show watched on netflix in its first 28 days on the service

gridlock could delay covid funds until fall or longer original publication date june 01 2022 8 21 am washington ap the u s is headed for a lot of unnecessary loss of life the biden administration says if congress fails to provide billions more dollars to brace for the pandemic s next wave yet the quest for that money is in limbo the latest victim of election year gridlock that s stalled or killed a host of democratic priorities president joe biden s appeal for funds for vaccines testing and treatments has hit opposition from republicans who ve fused the fight with the precarious politics of immigration congress is in recess and the next steps are uncertain despite admonitions from white house covid 19 coordinator dr ashish jha of damaging consequences from every day we wait administration officials say they re running low on money to stock up on or even begin to order the latest vaccines tests and treatments also lacking are funds to reimburse doctors treating uninsured patients and to help poor countries control the pandemic house and senate democrats have been wrangling over how to resolve the stalemate and even over which chamber should vote first it s an open question whether they ll ever get the gop votes they ll need to pull the legislation through the 50 50 senate and prospects in the narrowly divided house are unclear as well there is still an urgency to pass a covid relief package senate majority leader chuck schumer d n y said last week it s very very much needed optimists hope the measure could start rolling once congress returns next week pessimists say without quick resolution democrats may not have enough leverage to push the money to passage until early fall that s when they could stuff it into legislation that will probably be needed to finance government a bill that would avert a federal shutdown a pre election distraction republicans will be desperate to avoid the heap of sidelined democratic initiatives has grown this year a victim of gop opposition and rebellions by centrists like sen joe manchin d w va casualties include bills on voting rights health care environment taxes gun curbs abortion rights policing tactics and an investigation of the 2021 capitol storming by then president donald trump s supporters while lawmakers have approved massive packages financing federal agencies through september and helping ukraine counter russia s invasion other priorities are dead or drifting even as democrats days running congress are likely dwindling republicans are favored to win house control in november s elections and could grab the senate as well and democrats frustration is clear so far it hasn t moved sen mazie hirono d hawaii said of biden s latest 22 5 billion request for covid 19 which he initially sent congress three months ago but then neither has sensible gun legislation neither has voting rights the 50 50 senate sucks she said the covid money is needed quickly officials say their warnings have come with over 1 million u s deaths from the disease and a fresh variant that daily is hospitalizing over 100 000 americans and killing more than 300 both numbers are rising officials say that lacking fresh funds the u s is falling behind other countries that are already lining up for supplies needed for fall and winter that s prompted jha to plan for the chance that congress provides no new money at all threatening painful choices about what to do if there aren t enough vaccines or therapeutics for all who need them it would be terrible jha told reporters recently i think we would see a lot of unnecessary loss of life if that were to happen congress has provided 370 billion for purchasing supplies for research and other public health initiatives to combat the pandemic according to administration tallies obtained by the associated press around 14 billion of it was unspent or not committed to contracts as of april 5 the documents show serious money but an amount the administration says falls below the ultimate need most republicans are skeptical about added pandemic funding i have a hard time believing that there s not enough money and not enough flexibility already to use it said sen kevin cramer r n d counterintuitively but unsurprisingly for the always perplexing senate one intractable puzzle stymying democrats is immigration senate republicans are demanding a vote an amending the pandemic legislation with language retaining trump era curbs that citing covid 19 have made it easier to bar migrants from entering the u s a federal judge has blocked biden from ending those restrictions liberals want congress to eliminate the clampdown but moderate democrats in both chambers facing tough reelections want to vote to retain it the result testy divisions between the democrats two ideological factions and knotty questions for party leaders about how to resolve them and push a pandemic package to passage their task is compounded by disputes between house and senate democrats over why the covid 19 battle remains unresolved senate democrats note a bipartisan 15 6 billion pandemic compromise was on the cusp of house passage in march until that chamber s progressive democrats rebelled against spending cuts to pay for it derailing the money we re waiting for the house to send us something schumer said last week house democrats say even if they do the biggest hurdle will still be the senate where 10 gop votes will be required to reach that chamber s usual 60 vote threshold for passage they note that an april deal between schumer and sen mitt romney r utah for 10 billion in covid 19 money collapsed after republicans demanded the immigration vote we want to get covid 19 done but the only impediment right now is the united states senate house majority leader steny hoyer d md told reporters recently that s left republicans waiting for democrats next move i would imagine at this point way over half of our members will vote against this no matter what so the question is what do you do to get it acceptable to 10 or 12 republican senators said sen roy blunt of missouri a member of gop leadership and i don t know

outperformed the u s treasury index which returned 0 2 in may municipal bonds rallied into what may well be sustainable gains last week bolstered by buying ahead of the massive june reinvestment a record surge into muni exchange traded funds and stronger treasuries said matt fabian partner at municipal market analytics the power of june s nearly 50 billion of reinvestment demand which includes 16 billion of principal payoffs for california and new york investors alone mitigated around another 3 billion outflows from the traditional funds he said the investment company institute reported investors pulled 4 367 billion from muni bond mutual funds in the week ending may 25 down from 5 398 billion of outflows in the previous week it was the 19th consecutive week bringing ici s 2022 total

million of inflows the week prior per ici data this is the largest amount since march 2020 while the high yield sector faces materially more challenges ahead muni high yield fund navs were near vertical last week boosted in part by nuveen s reopening of its main fund to new investors and the related market action that implies according to fabian this week he said june properly starts and reinvestment demand should continue a material driver of momentum in a space tax exempts that is still fundamentally marked by product scarcity the bond buyer 30 day visible supply sits at 13 44 billion in particular once mutual fund inflows turn positive any secondary supply still available after last week will disappear and long 3s and 2s will find more support boosting evaluations of 4s

andrew demillo the associated press little rock ark ap the gunmen in two of the nation s most recent mass shootings legally bought the semi automatic rifles they used in their massacres after they turned 18 that s prompting congress and some governors and state lawmakers to revisit the question of whether to raise the minimum age for purchasing such high powered weapons only six states require someone to be at least 21 years old to buy rifles and shotguns advocates argue that such a limit might have prevented the elementary school shooting in uvalde texas that left 19 children and two teachers dead and the racially motivated supermarket attack in buffalo new york that killed 10 lawmakers in new york and utah have proposed legislation that would raise the minimum age to buy ar 15 style rifles to 21 a similar restriction is expected to move as soon as next week in the u s house where it has some bipartisan support but the legislation faces uncertainty in the closely divided senate arkansas gov asa hutchinson a republican who chairs the national governors association said the idea should be up for discussion i think you ve got to be able to talk about the ar 15 style weapons and whether that s an 18 or 21 age hutchinson told cnn this week you have to at least have a conversation about that but hutchinson who leaves office in january isn t pushing for the limit in his own state any proposed gun restrictions there are unlikely to find support among republicans who control the legislature arkansas republicans are echoing their party s calls at the national level to focus instead on beefing up school security or addressing mental health if we move to 21 and the shooter is 21 then they ll want to move to 25 said republican state sen bart hester who will serve as senate president next year we have established that 18 in our society is an adult who can make adult decisions and i m good with that a recent survey of governors by the associated press highlighted the partisan split over whether the minimum age should be higher many democratic governors who responded supported restrictions such as increasing the age to buy semi automatic weapons but only one republican vermont gov phil scott whose state already has a minimum age of 21 to buy guns with some exceptions supported such a move gun control advocates say raising the age offers one of the clearest steps that could have stopped or prevented the most recent mass shootings the uvalde attacker salvador ramos bought the ar 15 he used shortly after he turned 18 if ramos hadn t been able to buy the weapon maybe he would have gotten the mental health treatment he needed and this never would have happened or maybe someone would have called some signs out to law enforcement that this person was acting erratically said sean holihan state legislative director with the gun control advocacy group giffords but it s clear if there had been a law in place where he would have been 21 years old he wouldn t have been able to purchase that gun federal law already prohibits federally licensed dealers from selling handguns to anyone under age 21 but people age 18 to 20 can still buy handguns from unlicensed dealers in their state florida is a rare example of a republican led state that took swift action on gun restrictions after a mass shooting in 2018 weeks after the deadly shooting at marjory stoneman douglas high school in parkland then gov rick scott signed legislation raising the minimum age to buy rifles from 18 to 21 along with a host of other school safety and gun control measures the law narrowly passed in both chambers of the gop controlled legislature following intense lobbying from student survivors and grieving families marking a moment of compromise in a state that previously shunned restrictions on firearms scott a republican said at the time that the law balanced our individual rights with the need for public safety now a u s senator scott did not immediately return an emailed request for comment on whether such legislation should be implemented in other states the buffalo and uvalde attacks are similarly prompting new york lawmakers this week to consider an age limit increase for buying semiautomatic rifles as part of a package of gun safety bills under the proposal those age 21 and older who want to buy or possess a new semiautomatic rifle would have to obtain a license new york already has some of the toughest gun laws in the country but clearly we need to make them even stronger democratic gov kathy hochul said new yorkers deserve to feel safe in schools in grocery stores in movie theaters in shopping malls and on our streets and we must do everything in our power to protect them a proposal in utah which would raise the minimum age to buy any firearm to 21 is more of a longshot in the republican controlled legislature if you are not able to consume alcohol why should you be able to buy a gun democratic sen derek kitchen said of his proposal the age provision in the bill before the u s house has some bipartisan support but it remains unclear which aspects of the legislation will pass and get taken up in the senate any measure there needs support from at least 10 republicans to pass the house bill also would create a grant program to buy back large capacity magazines establish voluntary safe practices for firearms storage and add to steps in the executive branch that ban bump stock devices and so called ghost guns made from 3 d printers democratic rep anthony brown of maryland is leading efforts to increase the age for buying semi automatic rifles he said such guns have no place in our neighborhoods let alone in the hands of an 18 year old raising the age to buy weapons capable of this kind of mass death is as commonsense as it gets he said several republicans have pointed to a ruling by a federal appeals court panel that found california s ban on the sale of semi automatic weapons to adults under 21 is unconstitutional republican governors who decline to pursue the age increase also cite the political reality in their gop controlled legislatures for ohio gov mike dewine raising the age limit to buy an ar 15 style rifle to 21 falls into the category of items the governor feels would not pass or be considered by the ohio general assembly said press secretary dan tierney eighteen year olds already are allowed to do many things in society including joining the military said state sen terry johnson a southern ohio republican who sponsored the state s new law that makes concealed weapons permits optional for people legally allowed to carry a firearm they re adults and they re americans and they are protected by the second amendment johnson said west virginia gov jim justice this week said he supports raising the minimum age for buying an ar 15 style rifle to 21 but isn t proposing such a change in his state first of all do i really feel like an 18 year old ought to be able to walk in and buy an assault weapon i don t the republican governor told reporters this week he appeared pessimistic about that or any other gun control measure gaining traction in his state i can call 1 000 special sessions he said and if all i m doing is calling 1 000 special sessions for people just to come and talk and get up on a soap box and get nothing done why associated

democratic colorado sen john hickenlooper recently disclosed asset trades potentially worth over 1 million an average of roughly 333 days after execution filings show multiple watchdog groups say the senator s move is a clear stock act violation and criticized him for failing to follow the law members need to take the act seriously said gary kalman director of transparency international u s it is an important anti corruption tool to dissuade potentially illegal behavior and help identify when a member does cross the line democratic colorado sen john hickenlooper disclosed asset trades in may an average of roughly 333 days late filings show which experts told the daily caller news foundation violates a law in place to track lawmakers financial conflicts of interest hickenlooper disclosed on may 16 that his wife sold between 350 000 to 750 000 combined shares of liberty media where she is senior vice president of corporate development in march 2021 and november 2021 the senator s wife also sold between 200 000 to 500 000 in combined liberty broadband shares in march and september of last year while hickenlooper bought between 15 000 to 50 000 of non public stock in a denver bar and music lounge hickenlooper and his spouse in total made three trades that were 185 257 and 370 days late and two trades that were each 427 days late or 333 days late on average according to data from capitol trades hickenlooper s disclosure is a clear violation of the stock act experts explained to thedcnf which holds that lawmakers must publicize all transactions of 1 000 or more within 30 days of receiving notice and within 45 days of the transaction s date his filing damages the efficacy of the law as a mechanism to prevent corruption track apparent conflicts of interests and insider trading experts said ultimately this instance involving senator hickenlooper is just one more of many manifestations of the problem with the stock act namely it is insufficient and isn t working toward its intended objective dylan hedtler gaudette government affairs manager for the project on government oversight told thedcnf kendra arnold executive director of the foundation for accountability and civic trust told thedcnf it becomes harder to track conflicts of interest as time passes it is very difficult to nearly impossible to reconstruct what members were working on a year ago and thus making it difficult to monitor for conflicts of interest said arnold this is the only mechanism that can reveal conflicts of interest although disclosing a conflict does not remedy the actual conflict if one exists a major problem with late disclosure is that members are not able to recuse from votes that could present a conflict of interest said arnold related sen blumenthal s family splurged on intel stock before he voted for a massive subsidy bill a spokeswoman for hickenlooper did not respond to thedcnf s request for comment hickenlooper and his wife have traded more than two dozen stocks in the past three years records show the senator who sits on the senate commerce committee sold between roughly 2 million to 4 million of tech stock shares in november 2021 and october 2021 these included holdings in amazon google parent company alphabet facebook parent company meta microsoft and paypal hickenlooper disclosed the 10th most financial trades out of all members between january 2020 and january 2022 axios reported the senator has reported owning six figures worth of oil and gas stocks while sitting on the energy and natural resources committee insider reported as of now timely transaction disclosure is important to ensure public officials are not unfairly benefiting from insider information gary kalman director of transparency international u s told thedcnf members need to take the act seriously said kalman it is an important anti corruption tool to dissuade potentially illegal behavior and help identify when a member does cross the line in january democratic georgia sen jon ossoff sponsored the ban congressional stock trading act which has stalled since being introduced over 125 republican and democratic members have backed some form of legislation seeking to ban members of congress from trading stocks opensecrets reported voters have signaled support for restrictions on members trading stocks with three out of four respondents saying so in a january poll by the convention of states action only 5 of respondents said they approve of members trading members and their immediate families should be banned from stock trading according to hedtler gaudette this fact demands action from congress that addresses the problem at the root and flat out prohibits members of congress and their immediate families from trading stocks and other similar assets at all full stop he said this is the only way to ensure that certain kinds of conflicts of interest are mitigated and that insider trading is prevented once and for all all

sandberg has served as chief operating officer at the social media giant for 14 years san francisco sheryl sandberg the no 2 executive at facebook owner meta is stepping down sandberg has served as chief operating officer at the social media giant for 14 years she joined from google in 2008 four years before facebook went public when i took this job in 2008 i hoped i would be in this role for five years fourteen years later it is time for me to write the next chapter of my life sandberg wrote on her facebook page wednesday sandberg has led facebook now meta s advertising business and was responsible for nurturing it from its infancy into an over 100 billion a year powerhouse she s leaving meta in the fall and will continue to serve on the company s board meta ceo mark zuckerberg said in his own facebook post that javier olivan will serve as meta s new coo although it will be a different job than the one sandberg held for the past 14 years it will be a more traditional coo role where javi will be focused internally and operationally building on his strong track record of making our execution more efficient and rigorous zuckerberg wrote while sandberg has long been zuckerberg s no 2 even sitting next to him pre pandemic at least in the company s menlo park california headquarters she also had a very public facing job meeting with lawmakers holding focus groups and speaking out on issues such as women in the workplace and most recently abortion i think meta has reached the point where it makes sense for our product and business groups to be more closely integrated rather than having all the business and operations functions organized separately from our products zuckerberg wrote sandberg who lost her husband dave goldberg suddenly in 2015 said she is not entirely sure what the future will bring but i know it will include focusing more on my foundation and philanthropic work which is more important to me than ever given how critical this moment is for women she wrote adding that she is also getting married this summer and that parenting their expanded family of five children will also be a part of this future the adult in the room sandberg 52 first helped google build what quickly became the internet s biggest and most lucrative advertising network before leaving that company to take on the challenge of transforming facebook s freewheeling social network into a money making business while also helping to mentor zuckerberg she proved to be exactly what the then immature zuckerberg and the company needed at the right time helping to pave the way to facebook s highly anticipated initial public offering of stock a decade ago while zuckerberg remained facebook s visionary and controlling shareholder sandberg became engine of a business fueled by a rapidly growing digital ad business that has become nearly as successful as the one that she helped cobbled together around google s dominant search engine just like google s ad empire facebook s business thrived on its ability to keep its users coming back for more of its free service while leveraging its social networking services to learn more about people s interests habits and whereabouts a nosy model that has repeatedly entangled the company into debates about whether a right to personal privacy still exists in an increasingly digital age as one of the top female executives in technology sandberg has at times has been held up as an inspiration for working women a role she seemed to embrace with a best selling 2013 book called lean in women work and the will to lead but lean in received immediately criticism new york times columnist maureen dowd called sandberg a powerpoint pied piper in prada ankle boots and critics suggested she is the wrong person to lead a women s movement she addressed some of that criticism in a subsequent book that addressed the death of her husband dave goldberg in 2015 she became a symbol of heartbreaking grief when goldberg died during an accident while working out on vacation widowing her with her two children as she continued to help run one of the world s best known companies cracks in the façade in more recent years sandberg became a polarizing figure amid revelations of how some of her business decisions for facebook helped propagate misinformation and hate speech critics and a company whistleblower contend that the consequences have undermined democracy and caused severe emotional problems for teens particularly girls the author of the age of surveillance capitalism shoshana zuboff said sandberg is as responsible as anyone for what zuboff considers one of big tech s most insidious invention the collection and organization of data on social media users behavior and preferences that data was shared with advertisers who might also sell it to data brokers and proved immensely profitable sandberg did it wrote zuboff through the artful manipulation of facebook s culture of intimacy and sharing zuboff calls sandberg the typhoid mary of surveillance capitalism sandberg may fancy herself a feminist but under her leadership facebook has become a right wing playground where misogyny racism disinformation violent organizing and hateful conspiracy theories grow and spread said shaunna thomas co founder of ultraviolet a gender justice advocacy organization in an april 22 email calling for sandberg s resignation for years sandberg has been in an optimal position to make facebook safer for women but like ceo mark zuckerberg she has consistently failed to take action sandberg has had some public missteps at the company including her attempt to deflect blame from facebook for the jan 6 2021 insurrection at the u s capitol in an interview later that month that was streamed by reuters she said she thought the events of the day were largely organized on platforms that don t have our abilities to stop hate don t have our standards and don t have our transparency that turned out to be untrue internal documents revealed by whistleblower frances haugen later that year showed that facebook s own employees were concerned about the company s halting and often reversed response to rising extremism in the u s haven t we had enough time to figure out how to manage discourse without enabling violence one employee wrote on an internal message board at the height of the jan 6 turmoil we ve been fueling this fire for a long time and we shouldn t be surprised it s now out of control ___

senior loans risk the london interbank offered rate libor is the average offered rate for various maturities of short term loans between major international banks who are members of the british bankers association libor is the most common benchmark interest rate index used to make adjustments to variable rate loans it is used throughout global banking and financial industries to determine interest rates for a variety of financial instruments such as debt instruments and derivatives and borrowing arrangements due to manipulation allegations in 2012 and reduced activity in the financial markets that it measures in july 2017 the financial conduct authority the fca the united kingdom financial regulatory body announced a desire to phase out the use of libor by the end of 2021 although the period from the fca announcement until the end of 2021 is generally expected to be enough time for market participants to transition to the use of a different benchmark for new securities and transactions there remains uncertainty regarding the future utilization of libor and the specific replacement rate or rates as such the potential effect of a transition away from libor on the trust or the financial instruments utilized by the trust cannot yet be determined the transition process may involve among other things increased volatility or illiquidity in markets for instruments that currently rely on libor the transition may also result in a change in i the value of certain instruments held by the trust ii the cost of temporary borrowing for the trust or iii the effectiveness of related trust transactions such as hedges as applicable when libor is discontinued the libor replacement rate may be lower than market expectations which could have an adverse impact on the value of preferred and debt securities with floating or fixed to floating rate coupons any such effects of the transition away from libor as well as other unforeseen effects could result in losses to the trust

hello and welcome to the epoch health podcast i m your host dr ann corson today we have with us someone who i think is really a remarkable person i first learned of dr stella immanuel when she stood on the steps of the supreme court building in the summer of 2020 and told us that no one had to be afraid anymore and that we actually had a cure for covid 19 i actually saw that video that same day not live time but that same day i saw it downloaded it and i was amazed that it got 17 million views you know in the first few days before facebook succeeded in scrubbing it i was so impressed by your impassioned talk at that time dr stella immanuel thank you so much dr ann for having me i would say it s providence or maybe it was god s plan for my life i m from cameroon central africa i went to medical school in nigeria west africa i did general medicine and in most countries we are not hyper specialized all doctors go through general medicine first and then sometimes later they go specialize so i did general medicine i came to this country in 1992 i got into residency and i took the first residency i got i got into pediatrics got to love pediatrics and i practice pediatrics when i finished residency i moved to alexandria louisiana and i was practicing pediatrics i was also working in the emergency room to keep my general practice skills and then kind of you know when it got busy in my practice i just stayed with my practice a few years ago i went back to doing the emergency room and eventually closed my practice when my children got older and i just went did the emergency room got me a good schedule where i could do whatever i want you know i did emergency room for a while and then the lord told me to move to texas i was in louisiana so i moved to houston and i was going back and forth working in the er in texas and in louisiana until i got my texas license in september of 2019 and then i acquired a practice that was right next door to a bookstore we owned this guy had passed away god bless his soul he was a japanese doctor so he had a lot of patients from china japan and asia this is where we were in february 2020 when they started talking about the pandemic i m sitting here a good 15 20 of my patients are from asia and i am terrified about this pandemic coming out of asia we had to learn how to take care of covid initially we got all the ppe we got the masks we got everything we got the ppe suits we were wearing masks and shields and we looked as if we re going to outer space a friend of mine who is a pharmacist came and told me that they were using hydroxychloroquine in asia in china and in italy being that i trained in west africa i was used to the quinones we took mefloquine we took camoquin levaquin growing up we took it as sunday medicine for malaria and while i ve been practicing in america i ve been putting people on you know hydroxychloroquine mefloquine or whatever for traveling abroad so this was something that was right up my alley i was used to this medicine i took it growing up treated patients with it we gave it to pregnant women we gave it to babies we gave it to everyone you know i mean chloroquine used to itch but chloroquine had very little side effect apart from itching so i was very happy i jumped on board and i started using it initially i just used the malaria dose and i found out that it worked wonders on a patient that came in with covid within the first one or two days they got well almost immediately it was almost miraculous i was so impressed with the results i was getting i went online i was part of this big medical doctor group i went online and i was excited i told them wow listen hydroxychloroquine is working and you know people are getting well at that time president trump had got it but it wasn t much by then president trump had just come out to say that hydroxychloroquine worked of course the left and everybody collectively lost their minds a friend of mine who is a pharmacist came and told me that they were using hydroxychloroquine in asia in china and in italy being that i trained in west africa i was used to the quinones we took mefloquine we took camoquin levaquin growing up we took it as sunday medicine for malaria and while i ve been practicing in america i ve been putting people on you know hydroxychloroquine mefloquine or whatever for traveling abroad so this was something that was right up my alley i was used to this medicine i took it growing up treated patients with it we gave it to pregnant women we gave it to babies we gave it to

getting well at that time president trump had got it but it wasn t much by then president trump had just come out to say that hydroxychloroquine worked of course the left and everybody collectively lost their minds doctors stopped being doctors and were just taking evidence from other doctors because usually that s what we do we talk among each other what do you think is working what are you using and if something is working we usually copy it we don t sit down and like oh no it doesn t work it was very surprising that doctors were threatening me some were threatening to report me to the boards it became really wild you know i got kicked out of many of these doctor groups i got attacked i got vilified it was crazy that is how we started meeting with like dr richard urso all of us that were just coming out to take care of patients dr ann corson how did you get to connect with these other doctors like how did you get to connect with dr richard urso i looked for them online i met dr urso also i saw him on twitter so i looked for his office and i called him i said hey richard i see that you re seeing patients he was so excited to hear from me we were just like holding on to each other like oh my god finally there s somebody else that s doing this you know so we started just connecting like that and talking to each other and that is how we got to meet dr simone gold who had done a program in washington d c two summits that was the second summit that we were going to d c for so they invited me and of course this was already in july but prior to july around may covid hit houston it hit texas it was crazy people were lining up in front of my clinic as if it was black friday we were taking care of patients like i had seen over 300 400 patients about 300 something patients and to me it didn t make any sense that people were getting well and they were allowing people to die each time i heard about people dropping dead in new york and all over the country it just broke my heart and by may i realized this was not just a medical battle this was a propaganda battle something sinister was going on dr ann corson when i heard you talking about hydroxychloroquine in my practice i ve used it for years we call it plaquenil as the brand name here because it works very well in lyme patients because it helps with babesia babesia is a temperate form of malaria it s a similar organism to malaria that is transmitted by the bite of ticks in this hemisphere and or in this latitude and so we also use it in autoimmune diseases so i was very comfortable using hydroxychloroquine because it helps with lyme disease it helps with babesia and helps with viruses so it made perfect sense to me and initially in that first wave i didn t have as many patients getting sick because of the way i treat my patients in a really integrative way they mostly had their vitamin d optimized they had their trace minerals optimized most of them were on zinc so a lot of them you know got by it without any problem in that first wave so you started to treat and you started to treat a lot of people and people started to come to you how did you sort of deal with this all of a sudden this horrible censorship and criticism you know for me i ve been dealing with that in the integrative medicine world for 20 years because doctors who treat lyme disease are very ostracized and you know they think we re quacks but we re the ones who are getting people well so i m used to that kind of censoring and censorship but i suspect that was a new thing for you so how did you handle that dr stella immanuel it was kind of new but like i said it took me a few weeks to realize that what was going on was not really science it was propaganda so by may i told my friends and doctors i said guys we are in a spiritual battle of course there s deep spiritual stuff behind it and we re in a propaganda battle and i told them i said you cannot keep coming into a street fight with a suit so by may i took off the suit and i started kicking back and fighting back just as much if i went on facebook or on twitter and somebody said something crazy i hit back with everything that i had i hit back with the physical the medical the spiritual i just hit back so we started actually just attacking attacking back you know if some if one of my colleagues was attacked they d send us a message i m being attacked over here we d all go and fight back it became like a war basically it was crazy and people were threatening to report me to the boards and there was so much going on so we just had to stand and by july we were i was at that point of you know what if i perish i perish when i was leaving for d c that week i called my family and i told them i said you know i m going to d c i m going to expose this i m not going to let the american people die i m not gonna let these demons kill us i m going to expose it and if i perish i perish if i don t come back alive so be it i m not gonna sit back and let this happen so i was at that point of i don t care if they kill me so that is where i was and you know whenever you get to that if i perish i perish you don t perish so i was at that point where i could say anything i was not afraid of anybody or anything because i was at that point you know when you get to that point where you re ready to lose everything you re ready to say anything and you re ready to fight the battle properly so that is where i was most of the other doctors were still being nice mr doctor but i went off i just went off but god in his infinite mercy just used my voice that day to bring hope to the world before then the whole world was terrified everybody was terrified the whole world was caged and that day my voice rang out and he brought hope it was like a watershed moment people had been locked up in their homes for three months nobody was coming out of the house the two week lockdown had become almost a four months lockdown everybody was terrified and god in his infinite mercy just wanted to give humanity a respite so when i spoke that something went off in the spirit oh and of course the devil decided to attack me they came against me and ah it was wild but like i said i was trained for this if you read my book let america live you ll realize i was trained for this this my destiny god had trained me for years and years and prepared me for just this time you know i was called and trained for such a time as this just like esther in the bible so when they came after me they attacked me they vilified me they called me names they oh my god the more they attacked me the more people talked about me some vilified me the more people wanted to go see who this lady was and it was crazy you know nothing had ever gone viral and only god could have made it viral so it was wild after that i came home and the clinic was wild people were lined up in the clinic some were cussing me out some were throwing flowers some wanted my autograph it was the craziest thing ever you know people wanted interviews the ones that wanted to interview me to twist my words and make me look crazy the others called me from trump s demon sperm they associated me with president trump and all the rats against president trump ate me i ve never met president trump in fact when he retweeted me he said i don t know the lady and it s true i ve never met president trump oh my god it made some say that i was being bribed by president trump to say that and oh it was wild but like i said i was trained for this we are warriors spiritual warriors and trained for this so it didn t faze me that much i came back home we started a telehealth service and then we made sure that we re here practically to take care of the american people we ve seen over 120 000 patients over this two year period and my team also put together different supplements we created like the covid supplements it had vitamin c d zinc and more because we realized that a lot of people were getting sick because they didn t have enough supplements i m telling you dr ann i was one of those doctors i would have laughed at you in the past but my mindset has shifted you know something i m an md that for years just treated disease and we didn t think about wellness and most of us doctors are like that to make things worse a lot of us were so naïve we need to do a postmortem every single one of us as i sat in my clinic big pharma would come and give me studies that they did for their medication and i would take their studies and their results and i would believe it without questioning it and i would start prescribing these medications when i mean we just did not check we just did not think how evil big pharma was we did not even think that these people were trying to sell something but they were trying to tell us what results they got i tell people right now for years i gave vaccines to children without questioning right now i will not recommend any vaccine until we have independent studies i m not casting away all vaccines i grew up in tropical west africa i saw children die of tetanus and of measles so i know that vaccines are effective but right now what ten 15 20 vaccines i mean it s for a little baby that s a little too much for me now and i think that we as doctors need to take a postmortem or we need to start looking at everything that big pharma tells us and have independent studies that show us that these things are safe and effective look at how they caged us with the covid shot and told us it was safe and effective and how much it s destroying lives you know so i m saying we ve got to do that postmortem and i ve woken up i ve woken up not just to the devil is bad and we need jesus i ve woken up to the medical system is corrupted and we as doctors have to take responsibility and that is one of the greatest shifts i ve had in my mind in the past two years that is why right now we re developing a lot of supplements we re developing a lot of things you know imagine right now we ve put together what we call covilyte that has a lot of supplements in it for people that have had covid and they have covid long symptoms or have vaccine injury i mean now we can have elderberries and ginkgo biloba and stuff like that in the supplements we re thinking now on wellness you know and thinking on preparedness because a lot of us were not prepared and right now they ve given us a little respite again i think we should be prepared because it is not over they just want to win elections after elections this thing is going to be on and popping up again and people are just sitting there like oh great finally we can go out and go to the mall and go and do a barbecue we are lying to ourselves right now with the war that s going on you ve got to have iodine in your house we re preparing iodine where people can order the last time i tried to order iodine potassium iodine i couldn t find it i had to go through two or three manufacturers to get one that will produce potassium iodine for us it s insane we have to be prepared people have to make sure if you re on insulin if you re on high blood pressure medication make sure you have enough make sure you have food or water everything we have to be prepared dr ann corson what i think has really been most interesting to me over this process of the last two a couple years now i mean two years and a few months you know as i said i had my awakening years ago and you know really although i was classically trained as an md i really came to learn a lot of naturopathic medicine and nutraceutical medicine and using all kinds of wonderful tools and herbal tools and homeopathic tools to help my patients but what i think has happened so well is that there are so many doctors like you that have had this awakening and i think that this is a very special time for people to introspect like you said and start to really look at themselves and what they ve been doing in the practice of medicine unfortunately i ve also found that there are doctors that are still very blinded to the official paradigm the official dogma that is being propagandized out and that s concerning especially the way that the hospitalists are treating covid patients they re not listening to those of us that have treated outpatients successfully and kept people out of hospitals is there any other thing that you can think of that would help the medical establishment especially the hospitals try to regain some of the trust that they ve lost of the american people dr stella immanuel we need to look at this thing a little deeper the hospitals or the echelon of it are not people that are good people these are like demons demon possessed people or something i m not talking about the regular doctors that are just trying to make a living or the nurses that are taking orders that are being given to them i m talking about people that run the death camps our hospitals have become death camps that put together all the protocols and decide what medications are on the formulary or not there are doctors that have wanted to give people ivermectin in the hospitals and it was refused and there are doctors that are scared to lose their jobs one of the things that we re putting together right now is a paramedical system we created i m a very practical person doc so when i get a paradigm shift i shift practically one of the things we did we started the telehealth system i was very very fortunate to have had the foresight to build our own telehealth system from scratch i didn t use any person s platform like as not in that craziness they d de platform us so we built our own telehealth system from scratch which is a thing that nobody can take down we started initially without medications to pharmacists pharmacists will stop filling them and they will not fill them they will not tell the patients and they will have a whole bunch of things going on with patients not getting their medicine so we called and we established a lot of mom and pop pharmacies we built a pharmacy portal that they can just go on our website when we see patients we drop it in the pharmacy portal for mom or pop pharmacists that are licensed in all 50 states they ll be able to just pick up the scripts and fill them we have doctors licensed in all 50 states that will be able to see our patients so we actually started creating a parallel system we re expanding that to be able to give doctors i want to come out of the medical industrial complex give them the ability to help them start their own cash based practices our practices are cash based thank god we have no insurance because they cannot catch us through insurance so doctors have to come out of the system either you re in the system or you re out of the system we have to come out of the system and create parallel health care systems we have doctors that are able to that need to start running doctor hospitals that are owned and operated by doctors and the ceos are doctors and patriots and are not willing to let our people just die like that dr ann corson i ve heard dr simone gold talk about starting hospitals hasn t she talked about that dr stella immanuel i think she is willing to give us something there are many people working on that there are some things that we ve done i also think it s the greatest thing that people could do is to create urgent care centers nationwide but most importantly was starting a telehealth care system that lets you see patients around the nation and we have a network with a company that can bring oxygen to people s houses nationwide that is so important a lot of people went to the hospital with this pandemic because of low oxygen we have actually what we call the respiratory care kit every person needs to get a respiratory care kit which has a nebulizer a pulse oximeter and incentive spirometer so that you can have it in your house there were times where i will call in prescriptions and people will not be able to get the nebulizers because the pharmacies will not give them they do not have them they have not stocked up there was a high demand get it in your house now my thing is get prepared you know if you can get prepared for example iodine get iodine if there is a nuclear threat or nuclear war right now with the threat that is with russia have iodine that you can take in your house make sure we need to start decentralizing the hospital thing and many people go to hospitals that don t even need to go to the hospital a lot of people go to the hospital with covid because their oxygen got low and if you have the pulse oximeter you can monitor your oxygen at home your doctor can know about it we can know about it if we re taking care of you we can send people into your home to give you oxygen in the house and give you iv fluids in the house and monitor you at home until you get better that is what we need to do and then make sure that we have surgical centers by doctors themselves that are going to take care of our patients if these centers if we have two or three centers cannot take care of the patients you need to fly them in we need to create that we need to just go create parallel systems you know dr ann corson i really liked that idea of parallel systems dr stella immanuel yeah right now like i said we re putting together a lot of things one of the things that we ve done we have our supplements we have the covid vitamins we have the covilyte and we have iodine we have supplements for hair loss because a lot of people with covid have a lot of hair loss and a whole bunch of stuff so one thing we want to do is put our patients on an auto ship preferred client system and those are the patients that we will take care of in the thick of the delta we had seen 700 to 800 to 1 000 patients a day we could not cope so right now my thing is that everybody gets hooked up whatever the main goal is wouldn t you get to work putting together getting hooked up with this system that we are putting up together so that way you have that okay we have 10 000 patients that are our patients that if something happens in there pull up my book right now we know that we have 10 000 patients to take care of it s easier than to have 1 000 patients showing up each day and they don t know what to do so the american people themselves have to take responsibility if they re going to be hooked up to you they need to be hooked up to our system they need to do it now when things are good when things are not like crazy because when things get crazy it is difficult to sort out who is who we have been through times when we could not sleep we were working around the clock at any time too we had 2 000 patients waiting to be seen we had this stomping around to get doctors from all over it was crazy so that is why we re establishing these systems right now if you join dr ann corson yeah it s good that you have this network in place now which is going to be very helpful i just want to explain to the listeners what the iodine is for in case of nuclear fallout just like there was worry on the west coast after the japanese nuclear power plant accident iodine protects your thyroid the thyroid gland sits in your neck here and the radiation will really damage it unless you have iodine which is a protective thing for the thyroid so that s why dr immanuel was talking about iodine but now i d like you to tell us a little bit about your book let america live because i ve heard you describe that you know we re really in a spiritual battle of good versus evil and i know that that can be purchased on your website your website i understand is drstellamd com so you ve talked about how you know people really need to invoke the power of god to fight the power of the devil and that the bad people or the bad guys you said are sort of running on devil power and the good guys have to invoke the help of the divine now because human beings alone can t win this battle we need god s help dr stella immanuel yes my book my book actually gives you the journey that i took because the lord has prepared me for this journey from 2011 when god showed me even way back in 2005 that there was a manipulation and like they were manipulating the minds of people or the globalists working with the devil you know and you can listen to what they re saying klaus schwab bill gates and all of them and yuval noah these people they re not hiding it anymore they re out in the open they plan to take away our free will they plan to stop us and turn us into human 2 0 they want to corrupt us and they want to do it through the vaccine yuval noah said that covid is the best time the best time that surveillance went under the skin people think it s just surveillance it s not if you read in revelation 13 it talks about the mark of the beast the name of the beast the number of the beast the devil wants to mark you he wants to take your humanity and turn you into a cyborg or something and they re doing that by injecting these vaccines or these jabs that have graphene oxide that have luciferase that have nanoparticles that they can use to monitor you but not just that it changes you spiritually so that you will no longer heal you re corrupted and they can reach you they can connect you to the internet of things so i tell people that have been vaccinated you have been corrupted repent repent there s still time this is not the mark of the beast yet if you read in revelation 13 from verses 14 to 17 it talks about the mark of the beast the name of the beast and the number of the beast i do believe the mark has not been given yet but the name and the number of the beast is being injected into people the moderna ceo tried to hack the software of life so we know this moderna vaccine is created with luciferase which is like lucifer race you know so i m telling everybody this is a spiritual battle we need to wake up to not just this globalist app but we need to wake up to we need jesus we need god we need him to intervene on our behalf if you read my book it explains it deeply i advise everybody to get a copy not just that it has prayers in the back to pray for the nation to pray for yourself because right now yuval noah is saying that they re going to take our free will they re going to corrupt all of us they re going to teach you things that you will learn without knowing so we have prayers that you re going to pray to cleanse yourself to purge yourself of all this stuff that is being injected inside of you and so it s good that we also have the spiritual power to deal with this physical power and the spiritual nature yes the devil is working with these people we know that because they are getting away with it just human beings cannot get away with this level of evil and if you listen to them they want to depopulate us they want to kill us they think that we re useless feeders earth was created for humanity not for demons not for nephilim they say they want to create an inorganic life that is practically the nephilim of genesis 6 earth was not created for inorganic human beings they want to create human beings they want to create ai s that look like you and i and there are a lot of them around already they account for some of the craziness that happened during this pandemic for some of the doctors and pharmacies that will not take care of patients and nurses some of them are just those ai s that have already been created and we need to wake up to that and know that only jesus can fight the devil so if you go on our website on drstellamd com right in front there s a prayer there if you ve been vaccinated how to repent how to get your genetic material re cleansed and regenerated by the lord jesus so you can take it you can take care of the spiritual battle and then you can also prepare yourself physically by like i said getting all your medications that you need if you re on insulin stock up if you re on high blood pressure medication stock up go to your doctors go to a random urgent care and pay them so that you can get more of your medications just make sure that you have enough medicine stock up food and water make sure you have a charcoal grill in the house or something what if they take down the grid so we have to be ready ready spiritually ready physically ready ready mentally and make sure you have food water get some solar lights get something just make sure you re ready toothpaste toothbrush and everything that you can use learn to create a place where you can survive without electricity how can you cook your food do you have like you know something we need to be ready we cannot just sit down again and be caught off guard again we need to be ready dr ann corson i think it s very very important that people understand that we need to reconnect with god we need to invoke god s help because only god can help us in this situation as you said the forces of evil have been so powerful like you said that human beings couldn t have created that much evil they couldn t have conceived of that much evil and so people really need to understand that they have to ask for god s help like you said and they need to open themselves to that before it s too late before they ve run out of the chance and they have to understand that you know human beings were created in the image of god and that they need to honor that and they need to honor the divine within themselves and that s one of the most important things i think that we re going to help people through this i have discovered that a lot of the people that have not been taken up and not become part of the mass formation that mattias desmet talks about you know so hypnotized by the propaganda are often people of faith and that their faith is really you know giving them that perspective to be able to break through the propaganda and to see what s really going on so i think that s wonderful that you have those prayers available on your website to help people in this journey because it s not just a medical journey it s a spiritual journey as well dr stella immanuel and most times like i tell people christians and otherwise if you don t yuval noah said something that those that believe in free will those are the ones that are easy for you to manipulate because when you manipulate them they think it s their free will what it s actually saying is that if you are willful and self willed and self driven and you feel that you don t need god that it s just going to be you it s going to be easy for you to be captured you got to realize the frailty of your humanity and realize that as human beings we are going to be influenced by the devil or by god we cannot just stand on our own human beings have authority over this world but spiritual power is going to influence you one way or another so you have to choose between darkness and light you cannot be independent or stand on the defense stand on defense and you re gonna get programmed so i tell people don t be willful submit your life commit your life to jesus because when you submit your life to jesus he takes care of you read the bible read revelation 6 you ll see read revelation 13 14 you will see these things so now you know what s coming read matthew 24 read daniel chapter 2

investment grade are commonly referred to as high yield securities or junk securities they are regarded as predominantly speculative with respect to the issuing company s continuing ability to meet principal and interest payments non payment of scheduled interest and or principal would result in a reduction of income to the fund a reduction in the value of the senior loan experiencing non payment and a potential decrease in the nav of the fund investments in high yield senior loans and other securities may result in greater nav fluctuation than if the fund did not make such investments senior loans risk the london interbank offered rate libor is the average offered rate for various maturities of short term loans between major international banks who are members of the british bankers association libor is the most common benchmark interest rate index used to make adjustments to variable rate loans it is used throughout global banking and financial industries to determine interest rates for a variety of financial instruments such as debt instruments and derivatives and borrowing arrangements due to manipulation allegations in 2012 and reduced activity in the financial markets that it measures in july 2017 the financial conduct authority the fca the united kingdom financial regulatory body announced a desire to phase out the use of libor by the end of 2021 although the period from the fca announcement until the end of 2021 is generally expected to be enough time for market participants to transition to the use of a different benchmark for new securities and transactions there remains uncertainty regarding the future utilization of libor and the specific replacement rate or rates as such the potential effect of a transition away from libor on the trust or the financial instruments utilized by the trust cannot yet be determined the transition process may involve among other things increased volatility or illiquidity in markets for instruments that currently rely on libor the transition may also result in a change in i the value of certain instruments held by the trust ii the cost of temporary borrowing for the trust or iii the effectiveness of related trust transactions such as hedges as applicable when libor is discontinued the libor replacement rate may be lower than market expectations which could have an adverse impact on the value of preferred and debt securities with floating or fixed to floating rate coupons any such effects of the transition away from libor as well as other unforeseen effects could result in losses to the trust since the usefulness of libor as a benchmark could deteriorate during the transition period these effects could occur prior to the end of 2021 real estate industry risk issuers principally engaged in

sandberg has served as chief operating officer at the social media giant for 14 years san francisco sheryl sandberg the no 2 executive at facebook owner meta is stepping down sandberg has served as chief operating officer at the social media giant for 14 years she joined from google in 2008 four years before facebook went public when i took this job in 2008 i hoped i would be in this role for five years fourteen years later it is time for me to write the next chapter of my life sandberg wrote on her facebook page wednesday sandberg has led facebook now meta s advertising business and was responsible for nurturing it from its infancy into an over 100 billion a year powerhouse she s leaving meta in the fall and will continue to serve on the company s board meta ceo mark zuckerberg said in his own facebook post that javier olivan will serve as meta s new coo although it will be a different job than the one sandberg held for the past 14 years it will be a more traditional coo role where javi will be focused internally and operationally building on his strong track record of making our execution more efficient and rigorous zuckerberg wrote while sandberg has long been zuckerberg s no 2 even sitting next to him pre pandemic at least in the company s menlo park california headquarters she also had a very public facing job meeting with lawmakers holding focus groups and speaking out on issues such as women in the workplace and most recently abortion i think meta has reached the point where it makes sense for our product and business groups to be more closely integrated rather than having all the business and operations functions organized separately from our products zuckerberg wrote sandberg who lost her husband dave goldberg suddenly in 2015 said she is not entirely sure what the future will bring but i know it will include focusing more on my foundation and philanthropic work which is more important to me than ever given how critical this moment is for women she wrote adding that she is also getting married this summer and that parenting their expanded family of five children will also be a part of this future the adult in the room sandberg 52 first helped google build what quickly became the internet s biggest and most lucrative advertising network before leaving that company to take on the challenge of transforming facebook s freewheeling social network into a money making business while also helping to mentor zuckerberg she proved to be exactly what the then immature zuckerberg and the company needed at the right time helping to pave the way to facebook s highly anticipated initial public offering of stock a decade ago while zuckerberg remained facebook s visionary and controlling shareholder sandberg became engine of a business fueled by a rapidly growing digital ad business that has become nearly as successful as the one that she helped cobbled together around google s dominant search engine just like google s ad empire facebook s business thrived on its ability to keep its users coming back for more of its free service while leveraging its social networking services to learn more about people s interests habits and whereabouts a nosy model that has repeatedly entangled the company into debates about whether a right to personal privacy still exists in an increasingly digital age as one of the top female executives in technology sandberg has at times has been held up as an inspiration for working women a role she seemed to embrace with a best selling 2013 book called lean in women work and the will to lead but lean in received immediately criticism new york times columnist maureen dowd called sandberg a powerpoint pied piper in prada ankle boots and critics suggested she is the wrong person to lead a women s movement she addressed some of that criticism in a subsequent book that addressed the death of her husband dave goldberg in 2015 she became a symbol of heartbreaking grief when goldberg died during an accident while working out on vacation widowing her with her two children as she continued to help run one of the world s best known companies cracks in the façade in more recent years sandberg became a polarizing figure amid revelations of how some of her business decisions for facebook helped propagate misinformation and hate speech critics and a company whistleblower contend that the consequences have undermined democracy and caused severe emotional problems for teens particularly girls the author of the age of surveillance capitalism shoshana zuboff said sandberg is as responsible as anyone for what zuboff considers one of big tech s most insidious invention the collection and organization of data on social media users behavior and preferences that data was shared with advertisers who might also sell it to data brokers and proved immensely profitable sandberg did it wrote zuboff through the artful manipulation of facebook s culture of intimacy and sharing zuboff calls sandberg the typhoid mary of surveillance capitalism sandberg may fancy herself a feminist but under her leadership facebook has become a right wing playground where misogyny racism disinformation violent organizing and hateful conspiracy theories grow and spread said shaunna thomas co founder of ultraviolet a gender justice advocacy organization in an april 22 email calling for sandberg s resignation for years sandberg has been in an optimal position to make facebook safer for women but like ceo mark zuckerberg she has consistently failed to take action sandberg has had some public missteps at the company including her attempt to deflect blame from facebook for the jan 6 2021 insurrection at the u s capitol in an interview later that month that was streamed by reuters she said she thought the events of the day were largely organized on platforms that don t have our abilities to stop hate don t have our standards and don t have our transparency that turned out to be untrue internal documents revealed by whistleblower frances haugen later that year showed that facebook s own employees were concerned about the company s halting and often reversed response to rising extremism in the u s haven t we had enough time to figure out how to manage discourse without enabling violence one employee wrote on an internal message board at the height of the jan 6 turmoil we ve been fueling this fire for a long time and we shouldn t be surprised it s now out of control ___
since facebook s ipo in 2012 sheryl sandberg was named as a key person alongside mark zuckerberg a series of scandals at the company tarred her reputation sandberg departs as revenue slows dramatically potentially even declining in the second quarter when facebook held its nasdaq debut 10 years ago the prospectus named six executive officers only one still remains mark zuckerberg sheryl sandberg announced her departure from the company now named meta on wednesday leaving behind a complicated 14 year legacy at the social media giant a job that turned her into a billionaire and one of the most powerful women in the business world get philly local news weather forecasts sports and entertainment stories to your inbox sign up for nbc philadelphia newsletters in 2012 she was seen as so crucial to facebook s credibility with customers and investors that the company s ipo filing named her as one of two key people we currently depend on the continued services and performance of our key personnel including mark zuckerberg and sheryl k sandberg facebook wrote in the risk factors section of its prospectus the language stuck and is repeated all the way through the company s latest annual filing but it s become increasingly divorced from reality in the last few years sandberg s star has faded as unflattering reports emerged of her mishandling of the russian disinformation story following the 2016 presidential election according to a 2018 report in the wall street journal zuckerberg blamed sandberg for the fallout over the scandal surrounding cambridge analytica the data analytics firm that improperly used facebook profiles for political research as a champion of women in tech sandberg also caught flack last year after former employee frances haugen revealed internal documents showing the company knew its products could harm the mental health of teenage girls and refused to make changes investor whitney tilson published a letter he wrote to sandberg in october after haugen appeared on 60 minutes horrified doesn t even begin to describe my feelings tilson wrote if you and mark think that you can run the old playbook that s worked every time in the past apologize and take a few token steps but not really change anything and that this will just blow over you are sorely mistaken sandberg 52 continued to appear on earnings calls to talk about the ad business and issues like regulation there too she s found herself in a difficult spot far from its days as a silicon valley growth engine facebook recently reported its first ever quarter of growth under 10 and said that revenue in the second quarter could decline from a year earlier the company needs to find a new way forward and perhaps this was the best time for sandberg to depart debra aho williamson an analyst at research firm insider intelligence wrote in an emailed statement zuckerberg has tried to change the conversation focusing on the metaverse and a future of virtual leaning play and work in his new world sandberg was an outsider during the 77 minute presentation in october that zuckerberg used to announce the name change and to show off what meta is trying to build the company s no 2 was nowhere to be found still zuckerberg praised sandberg on wednesday declaring it the end of an era while javier olivan meta s chief growth officer will assume the title of chief operating officer later this year zuckerberg wrote in a facebook post that he doesn t plan to replace sheryl s role and i m not sure that would be possible since she s a superstar who defined the coo role in her own unique way move fast and break things fourteen years older than zuckerberg sandberg brought to facebook a hefty resume from her years at google and her work in washington as part of former president bill clinton s treasury department zuckerberg by contrast was a college dropout who d never had a real job sandberg had an undeniable impact on building facebook s advertising business and its internal operations including marketing and human resources but the vision of the company has always been crafted by one person and one person only for zuckerberg realizing that vision was a task for engineers we have a saying move fast and break things zuckerberg famously wrote in his letter to prospective shareholders in the ipo filing the idea is that if you never break anything you re probably not moving fast enough for zuckerberg moving fast meant serving as facebook s singular head of business development for some of its most important decisions he offered to buy instagram shortly before the ipo without input from the board and he reportedly orchestrated the 19 billion purchase of whatsapp after seeing data that showed the messaging app was an existential threat to his business cnbc sandberg joined facebook s board in 2008 and indicated on wednesday that she will continue to serve as a director but zuckerberg has permanent control over voting rights for the company s stock thanks to his super voting shares that means he gets to choose the board members who will adhere to his vision that s why zuckerberg gets to decide when he wants to change the name of the company to meta and spend 10 billion this year building a metaverse that may or may not turn into a real business by the end of the decade sandberg told cnbc that she s planning to focus on philanthropy specifically helping women adding that she s very optimistic about the future of the company but investors have been bailing with the stock losing half its value since peaking in

since facebook s ipo in 2012 sheryl sandberg was named as a key person alongside mark zuckerberg a series of scandals at the company tarred her reputation sandberg departs as revenue slows dramatically potentially even declining in the second quarter when facebook held its nasdaq debut 10 years ago the prospectus named six executive officers only one still remains mark zuckerberg sheryl sandberg announced her departure from the company now named meta on wednesday leaving behind a complicated 14 year legacy at the social media giant a job that turned her into a billionaire and one of the most powerful women in the business world get southern california news weather forecasts and entertainment stories to your inbox sign up for nbc la newsletters in 2012 she was seen as so crucial to facebook s credibility with customers and investors that the company s ipo filing named her as one of two key people we currently depend on the continued services and performance of our key personnel including mark zuckerberg and sheryl k sandberg facebook wrote in the risk factors section of its prospectus the language stuck and is repeated all the way through the company s latest annual filing but it s become increasingly divorced from reality in the last few years sandberg s star has faded as unflattering reports emerged of her mishandling of the russian disinformation story following the 2016 presidential election according to a 2018 report in the wall street journal zuckerberg blamed sandberg for the fallout over the scandal surrounding cambridge analytica the data analytics firm that improperly used facebook profiles for political research as a champion of women in tech sandberg also caught flack last year after former employee frances haugen revealed internal documents showing the company knew its products could harm the mental health of teenage girls and refused to make changes investor whitney tilson published a letter he wrote to sandberg in october after haugen appeared on 60 minutes horrified doesn t even begin to describe my feelings tilson wrote if you and mark think that you can run the old playbook that s worked every time in the past apologize and take a few token steps but not really change anything and that this will just blow over you are sorely mistaken sandberg 52 continued to appear on earnings calls to talk about the ad business and issues like regulation there too she s found herself in a difficult spot far from its days as a silicon valley growth engine facebook recently reported its first ever quarter of growth under 10 and said that revenue in the second quarter could decline from a year earlier the company needs to find a new way forward and perhaps this was the best time for sandberg to depart debra aho williamson an analyst at research firm insider intelligence wrote in an emailed statement zuckerberg has tried to change the conversation focusing on the metaverse and a future of virtual leaning play and work in his new world sandberg was an outsider during the 77 minute presentation in october that zuckerberg used to announce the name change and to show off what meta is trying to build the company s no 2 was nowhere to be found still zuckerberg praised sandberg on wednesday declaring it the end of an era while javier olivan meta s chief growth officer will assume the title of chief operating officer later this year zuckerberg wrote in a facebook post that he doesn t plan to replace sheryl s role and i m not sure that would be possible since she s a superstar who defined the coo role in her own unique way move fast and break things fourteen years older than zuckerberg sandberg brought to facebook a hefty resume from her years at google and her work in washington as part of former president bill clinton s treasury department zuckerberg by contrast was a college dropout who d never had a real job sandberg had an undeniable impact on building facebook s advertising business and its internal operations including marketing and human resources but the vision of the company has always been crafted by one person and one person only for zuckerberg realizing that vision was a task for engineers we have a saying move fast and break things zuckerberg famously wrote in his letter to prospective shareholders in the ipo filing the idea is that if you never break anything you re probably not moving fast enough for zuckerberg moving fast meant serving as facebook s singular head of business development for some of its most important decisions he offered to buy instagram shortly before the ipo without input from the board and he reportedly orchestrated the 19 billion purchase of whatsapp after seeing data that showed the messaging app was an existential threat to his business cnbc sandberg joined facebook s board in 2008 and indicated on wednesday that she will continue to serve as a director but zuckerberg has permanent control over voting rights for the company s stock thanks to his super voting shares that means he gets to choose the board members who will adhere to his vision that s why zuckerberg gets to decide when he wants to change the name of the company to meta and spend 10 billion this year building a metaverse that may or may not turn into a real business by the end of the decade sandberg told cnbc that she s planning to focus on philanthropy specifically helping women adding that she s very optimistic about the future of the company but investors have been bailing with the stock losing half its value since peaking in

in september 2021 in united food and commercial workers union v zuckerberg the delaware supreme court embraced the court of chancery s suggestion that the analysis for evaluating demand futility in derivative cases should be streamlined rather than employing the prior aronson v lewis or rales v blasband standards the supreme court set forth a new three part test that is consistent with and enhances those standards so that cases properly construing aronson rales and their progeny remain good law 1 under zuckerberg when ruling on a motion to dismiss where the plaintiff asserts demand futility delaware courts will examine whether a director 1 received a material personal benefit from the alleged misconduct 2 would face a substantial likelihood of liability on any of the claims that would be the subject of the litigation demand or 3 lacks independence from someone who received a material benefit from the alleged misconduct or would face a substantial likelihood of liability on any of the claims that are the subject of the litigation demand if the answer to any of those questions is yes for at least half of the members of the board that would be considering the demand then demand would be excused as futile see our september 28 2021 client alert delaware supreme court issues two opinions simplifying delaware law on derivative claims since zuckerberg practitioners companies and directors have watched to see how the new standard was applied and if it would alter delaware s traditional approach to evaluating demand futility including deference to directors ability to make decisions about litigation brought in the company s name in a series of opinions discussed below the court of chancery has applied the zuckerberg formulation to evaluate director disinterest and independence and found that a demand would not have been futile in re vaxart inc stockholder litigation november 30 2021 in september 2020 plaintiffs filed a stockholder class action derivatively on behalf of vaxart inc a small biotechnology company that was developing a vaccine for covid 19 in the early stages of the pandemic plaintiffs challenged amendments to two warrant agreements between the company and a purported controlling stockholder armistice which n effect enabled the stockholder to exercise and dispose of the warrant shares faster than under the terms of the original warrants 2 plaintiffs alleged that the vaxart board and armistice had advance knowledge of the company s participation in a non human primate study sponsored by the federal government s operation warp speed vaccine development program plaintiffs alleged that the board amended these documents to the benefit of directors and armistice in advance of a jump in vaxart s stock price that occurred on announcement of the participation the court first found that armistice was not a controller at the time of the challenged transaction because at the time it did not own more than 50 of vaxart s voting power or exercise actual control over vaxart the court of chancery then applied the zuckerberg test and conclude that plaintiffs have failed to establish that at least half the members of the demand board were incapable of fairly and impartially considering a litigation demand as to the warrant amendments 3 whether a majority of the demand board was able to impartially consider a demand turned on the disinterest and independence of two directors wouter latour and andrei floroiu the court rejected the allegations that latour was not independent from the armistice directors because the armistice directors supported latour s stock option grant supposedly in exchange for latour s support of the warrant amendments and the armistice directors allowed latour to remain on the board after his resignation as ceo and approved his separation package with respect to floroiu the court rejected the claim that he was indebted to the armistice directors because the armistice directors appointed him as ceo of vaxart and approved his enormously lucrative stock options in doing so the court reiterated that ithout more pleading that a board of directors elevated an executive to her current role or approved her compensation is insufficient to establish that the recipient is beholden to any director who approved that decision turning to the third zuckerberg prong the court found that the complaint failed to plead that a majority of the board would receive a material benefit or face a substantial risk of personal liability for the claims related to the warrant amendments because the board did not amend the warrant agreements in bad faith since such amendments were hardly a gift their exercise increase the company s cash on hand by 5 million 4 in re kraft heinz company december 15 2021 in july 2019 stockholders began filing derivative complaints on behalf of the kraft heinz company related to the sale by 3g capital inc of a 7 stake in kraft resulting in proceeds of over 1 2 billion for 3g which owned 24 before the sale plaintiffs alleged that 3g entities affiliated with it and certain dual fiduciaries of 3g and kraft breached their fiduciary duties to kraft stockholders by either approv 3g s stock sale based on adverse material nonpublic information or allow 3g to effectuate the sale to the detriment of kraft heinz and its non 3g stockholders 5 in analyzing demand futility the court of chancery applied the zuckerberg universal test to count heads to determine whether a majority of the kraft board of directors were disinterested and independent the court analyzed only six of the 11 directors as defendants conceded that three 3g affiliated directors could not exercise impartial judgment regarding a demand and plaintiffs allowed that two other directors were independent and disinterested the court focused on just the third prong of zuckerberg lack of independence because no director was alleged to have sold kraft stock during the relevant period or personally benefitted from 3g s sale the court ultimately concluded that plaintiffs failed to plead particularized facts sufficient to create reasonable doubt about the independence of four of the six examined directors in particular the court rejected plaintiffs argument that two directors were not independent because both had close ties and affiliations with warren buffett and berkshire hathaway inc which has a close co investing relationship with 3g one of those directors had worked as a financial assistant to buffett served as a director and ceo of berkshire hathaway subsidiaries and buffett allegedly walked her down the aisle at her wedding in 2013 6 the court explained that plaintiffs transitive theory of independence disqualifying directors tied to berkshire hathaway because of its relationship to 3g failed for several reasons including that the complaint failed to plead particularized allegations supporting a conclusion that either director felt subject to 3g s dominion or beholden to 3g based on its history of co investing with berkshire simons v brookfield asset management inc january 21 2022 in 2021 plaintiff filed a stockholder class action derivatively on behalf of graftech international ltd challenging the fairness of the price graftech paid to repurchase stock from its controlling stockholder brookfield asset management inc after the share repurchase and seven months after plaintiff served a section 220 books and records demand but beforeplaintiff filed suit graftech s board voted to expand from eight to nine seats and filled the vacancy with an independent director to improve his odds the plaintiff to exclude from the head counting analysis the independent director however the court concluded that graftech s certificate of operation and stockholder agreement permitted the board s expansion and dismissed plaintiff s claim that it was a breach of fiduciary duty saying that the timing of the director s appointment does not render it reasonably conceivable that the directors breached their fiduciary duties by appointing a concededly independent director to the board 7 ultimately the court concluded that demand was not futile under zuckerberg because no outside director i received a material personal benefit from the transaction ii faced a substantial likelihood of liability or iii lacked independence notably the court specifically held that one director did not lack independence simply because he was retired and the 140 000 he received annually in cash and stock as director fees were his sole source of income because that was not excessive in re camping world derivative litigation january 31 2022 following disclosures in 2017 by camping world holding inc about its integration of stores purchased in bankruptcy from gander mount company plaintiffs filed a derivative action for breach of fiduciary duty and unjust enrichment plaintiffs alleged that a majority of the camping world board was not independent because they faced a substantial likelihood of liability based on three claims i a brophy claim against certain directors and officers selling camping world stock on the basis of the knowledge of improper information before that information was revealed to the company s stockholders 8 ii a related disclosure claim for issuing false and misleading disclosures and iii a caremark claim for the board allegedly disregarding its oversight duties conducting the zuckerberg test on a director by director and claim by claim basis the court of chancery held that demand was not futile because a majority of camping world s nine member board could exercise independent and disinterested judgment in responding to a demand plaintiffs did not challenge the independence of four directors and two were assumed to be interested so the court s examination was limited to two outside directors k dillon schickli and andris baltins the court found that schickli did not lack independence simply because he was appointed to the board by an alleged controller or was compensated approximately 200 000 per year for his services the court held that plaintiffs failed to adequately plead materiality the court also stated that the fact that schickli served as the coo 25 years earlier for a company controlled by an assumed interested director cannot by itself create a disabling interest today 9 with the determination that schickli was able to consider a demand impartially the court held that a majority of the board was disinterested and independent for demand futility purposes and therefore did not reach the issue of whether baltins lacked independence because he was a partner in a law firm that previously received fees from camping world takeaways under the new zuckerberg test delaware courts no longer have to decide whether the aronson or rales tests apply but will instead apply a combined three part test to count heads to determine whether a majority of directors that would be evaluating a demand are capable of doing so delaware courts continue to scrutinize directors independence carefully when transactions are challenged and have not strayed from traditional delaware law in the demand context recent cases applying zuckerberg have reiterated long standing delaware law that simply being appointed by a controlling stockholder does not establish that the director lacks independence from the controlling stockholder likewise the receipt of standard directors fees without more is insufficient to render a director interested delaware courts continue post zuckerberg to examine whether directors face a substantial likelihood of liability even if one or more directors potentially do the key for the demand futility analysis will be whether a majority of the directors face a substantial likelihood of liability or are otherwise unable to consider a demand because they are not independent from someone who does as before zuckerberg delaware courts are not hesitant to dismiss derivative claims on demand futility grounds if a majority of directors would be able to impartially consider a demand _______________ 1 united food commercial workers union

testing and treatments has hit opposition from republicans who ve fused the fight with the precarious politics of immigration congress is in recess and the next steps are uncertain despite admonitions from white house covid 19 coordinator dr ashish jha of damaging consequences from every day we wait administration officials say they re running low on money to stock up on or even begin to order the

the issue russia has failed to achieve most of its objectives in ukraine because of poor military planning significant logistical problems low combat readiness and other deficiencies which undermined russian military effectiveness these and other challenges including ukrainian military efforts and western aid severely impacted russian air ground cyber and maritime operations russia s failures will force the russian military to fundamentally rethink its training practices organizational structure culture logistics recruitment and retention policies and planning efforts nevertheless russia is still attempting a de facto annexation of parts of eastern and southern ukraine that it controls this analysis examines lessons from russian air ground cyber and other domains following moscow s february 2022 invasion of ukraine it asks what are some of the most important military lessons from the first three months of the war what do these lessons suggest about the future of the war the assessment focuses predominantly on the operational level of warfare especially the planning and conduct of the military campaign 1 the operational level links the tactical utilization of forces to strategic objectives and includes such aspects as fire and maneuver logistics intelligence command and control and planning 2 to answer the main questions this analysis relied on several types of information one included collecting and analyzing primary and secondary sources on the war including military and intelligence assessments from western countries another was a force disposition map of the battlefield in which csis analysts compiled and assessed russian and ukrainian tactical and operational activity the final involved background interviews with western government officials and other subject matter experts while the war in ukraine is likely far from over this analysis comes to several initial conclusions first the russian military faced considerable logistics challenges in part because of poor training and planning during the russian push to kyiv in the early phase of the war for example russian ground forces faced massive logistical and command and control challenges operating in contested areas inside of ukraine without access to rail transport and with roads clogged with russian vehicles russian ground forces failed to move fuel munitions spare parts and other matériel quickly and efficiently to forward deployed units supply lines could not keep up with the long combat pushes and logistics vehicles were not properly protected the effectiveness of russian long range strike a key aspect of russian military operations was also severely impacted by logistical challenges including an insufficient supply of precision guided munitions second the russian ground offensive appears to have been planned and executed based on poor assumptions about how the ukrainian military and the population would respond as well as how the west might react seizing and holding territory was a major political objective of russian policymakers but controlling territory in a foreign country with a hostile ukrainian population was deeply problematic for the russian military particularly since the conflict began to resemble a people s war 3 in addition russian forces failed to effectively integrate combined arms to seize and hold ukrainian territory including coordination between land power air power and long range fires the russian invasion force was also far too small to achieve its objectives and neglected to block ukraine s western border and prevent the supply of foreign weapons systems fuel and other aid to ukraine third russian offensive cyber operations and electronic warfare failed to blind ukrainian command and control efforts or threaten critical infrastructure for a prolonged period russian military and intelligence agencies conducted cyberattacks and utilized electronic warfare against ukrainian targets including destructive cyberattacks on hundreds of ukrainian government and critical infrastructure systems but these attacks did not notably impact the ukrainian will or ability to fight or communicate ukraine was able to blunt most of the effects of these cyberattacks through an aggressive cyber defense with help from private companies western governments and other state and non state actors the rest of this brief is organized into three sections it begins by providing an update on the war including a tactical map of russian and ukrainian force disposition the brief then focuses on russian challenges in several domains of warfare it concludes with policy implications for the united states and its western allies and partners setting the stage an evolving front in the initial phase of the war russian ground forces invaded on four main fronts northern front russian forces pushed toward kyiv from belarus led by units from the eastern military district including the 29th 35th and 36th combined arms armies russian forces pushed toward kyiv from belarus led by units from the eastern military district including the 29th 35th and 36th combined arms armies northeastern front russian forces moved west toward kyiv from russian territory led by units from the central military district including the 41st combined and 2nd guards combined arms armies russian forces moved west toward kyiv from russian territory led by units from the central military district including the 41st combined and 2nd guards combined arms armies eastern front russian forces pushed toward kharkiv and out of the donbas led by units from the western military district including the 1st guards tank army and 20th and 6th combined arms armies russian forces pushed toward kharkiv and out of the donbas led by units from the western military district including the 1st guards tank army and 20th and 6th combined arms armies southern front russian forces moved from crimea west toward odesa north toward zaporizhzhia and east toward mariupol they were led by units from the southern military district including the 58th 49th and 8th combined arms armies vdv s 7th air assault division and vdv s 11th air assault brigade after suffering a series of setbacks that are highlighted later in this analysis the russian military began to withdraw forces from kyiv around april 2022 and concentrate its efforts on eastern and southern ukraine today the distinctive feature of the war is a roughly 600 mile front that extends just west of kherson along the black sea moves east through melitopol mariupol and other southern cities cuts northeast through the donbas in eastern ukraine including the cities of luhansk and donetsk continues northwest near izyum and then intersects the russian border north of kharkiv figure 1 highlights the force disposition by early june 2022 4 russia deployed roughly 110 battalion tactical groups btgs in ukraine for a total of approximately 142 000 forces utilized irregular forces including militias from donetsk and luhansk dug trenches and placed mines at and near the lines of contact and constructed rail lines and repaired bridges and roads to improve russian lines of communication 5 control of territory will continue to ebb and flow around these lines including around such areas as the donbas in addition russian ships in the black sea have conducted a naval blockade of ukraine halting commerce at ukrainian ports and struck ukrainian targets with cruise missiles and other stand off weapons russia has attempted to annex some of this territory through a crude form of state building it has forcibly deported or in some cases tortured and executed pro ukrainian civilians and encouraged ethnic russians and pro russian civilians to remain 6 russia has also replaced ukrainian government officials with hand picked pro russian officials for instance moscow appointed volodymyr saldo a former mayor of kherson as head of the kherson regional military civilian administration in may he announced that the area will become the kherson region of the russian federation 7 russian state building covers a broad swath of economic cultural nationalist governance and security measures moscow has replaced the ukrainian currency the hryvnia with the russian ruble in such cities as melitopol it has taken control of critical infrastructure such as nuclear power plants and steel plants and rerouted internet through russia in addition russia has issued newly married couples with russian federation wedding certificates russian flags now fly at numerous government buildings while ukrainian flags have been taken down and ukrainian symbols have been removed from buildings and repainted russia is creating russian language schools and revising the education system including the curriculum in these areas as moscow attempts to reeducate locals in russian controlled areas of ukraine russian military intelligence and police officials have penetrated cities and villages rounding up and detaining protesters and pro ukrainian sympathizers 8 for russia annexation of these areas is a fait accompli it s out of the question to return the kherson region back to nazi ukraine said kirill stremousov the russian appointed deputy head of the military civil administration of kherson region kyiv will no longer be able to force its ugly nazi policies upon our land 9 sergei aksyonov the head of the republic of crimea similarly indicated that the kherson and zaporizhzhia regions would be annexed 10 and russia s deputy prime minister marat khusnullin remarked that the kherson region will take a worthy place in our russian family 11 to expand russia s control of territory the russian military is likely to continue its attrition campaign in eastern and southern ukraine russian military failures russia failed to achieve what was likely its main political objective to overthrow the kyiv government in a blitzkrieg military operation the russian military also faced significant challenges seizing and holding territory these problems contributed to the suspension or firing of several senior military officials such as lieutenant general serhiy kisel commander of the 1st guards tank army for dereliction during the offensive against kharkiv lieutenant general vlaislav yershov commander of the 6th combined arms army for failing to capture kharkiv and vice admiral igor osipov commander of the black sea fleet following the sinking of the flagship cruiser moskva 12 in addition roughly a dozen russian generals and other senior officials were killed on the battlefield such as lieutenant general andrei mordvichev lieutenant general yakov rezantsev major general andrei sukhovetsky major general vitaly gerasimov major general kanamat botashev major general andrey kolesnikov and major general oleg mityaev 13 these firings and deaths may have exacerbated command and control problems that the russian military was already experiencing in an effort to improve overall command and control of russian operations particularly air ground integration russian president vladimir putin appointed general aleksandr dvornikov to oversee military operations in april still russia continued to experience command and control challenges during its offensive operations in donetsk and luhansk oblasts in may and june 2022 the rest of this section examines russian difficulties in the air ground and cyber domains of warfare it also highlights russian challenges in other domains such as maritime air operations russian air operations in ukraine have been characterized by a heavy focus on long range strike against ukrainian military and civilian targets to undermine the ukrainian military s ability to wage war weaken morale of the ukrainian population and punish the country for its shift toward the west over the previous several years russia had developed command control communications computers intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance c4isr systems on the battlefield providing data to enable a higher throughput of airstrikes these systems were integrated into russia s overarching systems of reconnaissance strike complexes which were designed for the coordinated employment of high precision long range weapons linked to real time intelligence data and accurate targeting 14 as general valery gerasimov chief of the general staff of the russian armed forces remarked the principal features of future conflicts will be the extensive employment of precision weapons and other types of new weapons 15 to identify targets in a relatively contested environment the russian military also utilized some airborne platforms including unmanned aerial vehicles uavs in the early phases of the war russia aimed to pin down ukrainian air defenses around the country by conducting ballistic and cruise missile strikes across the country including kh 101 cruise missiles deployed from tu 95 bear and tu 160 blackjack bombers flying in russian and belarusian airspace 16 the russian air force then expanded its target list to include ukrainian military infrastructure arms shipments from the west fuel facilities bridges and even civilian targets russia launched more than 1 100 missiles at ukrainian targets over the first 21 days of the war and a total of 2 125 missiles over the first 68 days of the war 17 nevertheless the russian military faced numerous challenges in conducting its air campaign first the russian air force failed to achieve air superiority against a ukrainian military with notable air defense capabilities such as stinger man portable air defense systems s 300 surface to air missile systems and other systems thanks in part to western aid the success of ukrainian air defenses deterred russian aircraft from freely operating over most of ukrainian controlled territory this meant that one of russia s primary ways to strike deep into ukraine was through cruise missiles launched from russia belarus and maritime vessels in the black sea second the russian air force faced recurring logistics challenges including running low on stocks of long range precision guided munitions three weeks into the war for example the russian air force began to run low on precision guided munitions such as laser and satellite guided bombs which caused the russians to use a growing number of unguided artillery shells rockets and missiles from the ground forces 18 when it came to weapons systems such as the iskander m short range ballistic missile system the russian military was also hesitant to expend a portion of its stockpile which it needed for defense against the north atlantic treaty organization nato and other threats 19 in addition dozens of russian uavs such as the orlan 10 orlan 20 orlan 30 eleron 3 and forpost were shot down on the battlefield or subject to electronic jamming 20 these challenges were exacerbated by the inability of russia s domestic arms industry to replace these uavs quickly 21 over the long run russia may face a supply chain challenge because of u s and other western sanctions for example the 9m729 cruise missile which is fired from the iskander k short range ballistic missile system is one of the russian military s most advanced weapons systems with precision strike capabilities 22 the cruise missile has roughly a half dozen socket attachment points that permit data to move through the heat shield some of these socket attachment points were manufactured by u s companies in addition the rails that affixed the circuit boards to the computer housing as well as the circuit boards were manufactured by u s companies the 9m949 300 mm rocket which is used in russia s tornado s multiple rocket launcher system also used a fiber optic gyroscope manufactured in the united states finally the russian tor m2 air defense system utilized an oscillator designed in the united kingdom which is located in the computer that controls the radar 23 these supply chain challenges will likely impact russia s short and long term supply of components to conduct stand off attacks forcing russia to look for substitute markets these challenges undermined moscow s attempt to establish air dominance over ukraine conduct effective precision strikes and support advancing russian ground forces ground operations in the initial phase of the war russian forces along the northern front relied on the roads to avoid ukraine s marshes and forests while the advantage in numbers artillery and cannon fire from armored vehicles allowed russian forces to quickly advance toward kyiv ukrainian forces inflicted significant casualties using anti tank ambushes as russian forces moved through ukrainian villages and towns local civilians provided intelligence on their location and movement while ukrainian special forces and uavs marked targets for artillery 24 as figure 2 highlights many of russia s vehicles were marked with a z to delineate that they were from the russian military figure 2 russian army vehicles with invasion z markings the bulk of russian ground forces is composed of btgs which are combined arms units typically drawn from companies and battalions in existing brigades while the structure of btgs varies somewhat based on operational needs and available personnel most include roughly 600 to 800 soldiers and in ukraine perhaps closer to 600 soldiers they are generally mechanized battalions with two to four tank or mechanized infantry companies and attached artillery reconnaissance engineer electronic warfare and rear support platoons including motor transport field mess vehicle recovery maintenance and hygiene squads the result in theory is a fairly self sufficient ground combat unit with fire and rear support 25 in practice the btgs were likely understrength and lacked sufficient infantry overall russian ground forces encountered serious problems in ukraine first the russian army faced significant logistical and maintenance challenges operating in contested areas inside of ukraine russia s approach to combined arms warfare was generally to hammer ukrainian positions with artillery and other stand off weapons and then to send armored vehicles forward on a maneuver termed reconnaissance to contact designed to overwhelm what remained of ukrainian defensive lines 26 but because of the ukrainian military s effective use of anti armor munitions such as anti tank guided missiles and loitering munitions russian ground forces had difficulty advancing and seizing ground this was true even when the speed of some russian armored units allowed them to push into kyiv s suburbs only 48 hours into the war some of these russian units were isolated with limited or no logistics miles ahead of the main body of russian ground units 27 the russian army also operated with fewer support soldiers than many other militaries roughly 150 of the troops in a btg could be considered support which is notably lower than some militaries such as the u s army which deploys approximately 10 support soldiers for every combat soldier 28 without access to rail transport that usually moves russian heavy equipment and with the few roads available clogged with traffic it became increasingly difficult for the russian army to move food fuel munitions spare parts and other supplies to forward deployed forces these problems were compounded by the russian army s failure to provide convoy security to logistics vehicles such as those carrying food water medical supplies mobile kitchens fuel engineers and spare parts forward deployed russian vehicles broke down and many had to be abandoned because of a lack of spare parts mechanics and recovery vehicles 29 in short the russian army failed to secure its critical lines of communication 30 the russian advance to kyiv for instance came at an increasingly heavy price by the time russian forces had secured hostomel airport in late february 2022 and were in place to launch an attack on kyiv they lacked the combat power to seize the city russian forces came into range of ukrainian artillery units and exposed more of their depth to raiding 31 russian forces also ran into numerous logistical challenges in their failed effort to seize and hold the city of kharkiv bans by the west on the export of sensitive technologies to russia could also cut into moscow s ability to prosecute a protracted ground war two of russia s largest tank manufactures for example were forced to halt production because of a lack of parts 32 second the russian invasion force was far too small to seize and hold territory particularly with a ukrainian population that rose up against the russian military in a variation of what the chinese revolutionary leader mao zedong referred to as a people s war as mao wrote in his book on protracted war the richest source of power to wage war lies in the masses of the people mao argued that in a well organized resistance effort the invading force will be surrounded by hundreds of millions of our people standing upright and he will be burned to death 33 russia utilized between 150 000 and 190 000 soldiers including regular and irregular forces for the initial invasion of ukraine a country of approximately 44 million people with an area of over 600 000 square kilometers 34 those numbers translate into a force ratio of 4 russian soldiers per 1 000 ukrainian inhabitants there are no exact formulas for how many soldiers are required to hold conquered territory but a force ratio of as many as 20 soldiers per 1 000 inhabitants has sometimes been necessary to pacify a hostile local population 35 large numbers of troops are generally essential to establish basic law and order by the end of world war ii for example there were 101 u s soldiers per 1 000 inhabitants in the u s controlled sector of germany more recently there were 19 u s and european soldiers per 1 000 inhabitants in bosnia in 1995 and 20 soldiers per 1 000 inhabitants in kosovo in 2000 36 lower ratios are generally insufficient to pacify hostile populations in iraq for instance the united states had 7 soldiers per 1 000 inhabitants and faced a persistent deadly insurgency even with the help of iraqi government forces and sunni militia members u s army chief of staff general eric k shinseki warned congress in february 2003 that several hundred thousand troops would likely be needed to secure postwar iraq 37 in afghanistan the united states had only 1 soldier per 1 000 inhabitants along with the help of afghan national security forces with such small numbers the united states and its nato allies faced a prolonged insurgency that led to the overthrow of the afghan government in 2021 38 the force ratio of russian soldiers in ukraine was far too small to hold territory including cities for long the low ratio was also problematic because of the substantial number of conscripts deployed to ukraine who were ineffective and suffered from poor morale russian conscripts are generally prohibited from serving in military operations abroad except when moscow formally declares war unless they volunteer as soldiers still their compulsory service typically lasts for only a year and conscripts have generally not been effective fighters 39 russian soldiers were given limited advanced notice that they were going to invade ukraine undermining readiness and logistics planning 40 third russian forces failed to conduct basic maneuver warfare against ukrainian forces preferring instead to bombard ukrainian cities and villages in a war of attrition 41 problems on the ground were complicated by russia s broader failure to conduct an effective combined arms campaign and to synchronize effects russia s challenges raised serious questions about its competence in fire and maneuver for example where were the russian infantry that were supposed to target ukrainian ambushes where was the fire from artillery mortars and close air support that was supposed to suppress ukrainian anti tank guided munitions 42 part of the challenge may have been poor leadership within the russian army and a highly centralized russian command and control structure that lacked a professional corps of noncommissioned officers there were also signs of declining professionalism in the russian officer corps including prohibiting drivers from evacuating wounded russian soldiers to preserve military equipment 43 the quality of ukrainian forces was a major change from syria where russia syria iran lebanese hezbollah and militia units from iraq afghanistan palestinian territory and other areas faced a relatively weak mix of insurgents russian mechanized formations in northern ukraine were targeted by lethal ukrainian light infantry armed with modern weapon systems such as the javelin anti tank missile system next generation light anti tank weapon nlaw and stugna p anti tank guided missile system ukrainian attacks during russia s initial advance also made the russians unwilling to push sensitive electronic warfare and air defense systems into ukraine in case they were captured consequently russia had to back off on its electronic suppression of ukrainian radar and communications senior russian officers began to deploy forward where they became targets for snipers and artillery strikes in addition russian forces encountered numerous command and control problems including a paucity of secure communications which undermined their ability to synchronize and coordinate attacks russian soldiers frequently used unencrypted communications including civilian cell phones which allowed ukrainian intelligence and military units to target them 44 russian difficulties in seizing territory created problems in the maritime domain on april 13 for example ukrainian forces struck the rts moskva a guided missile cruiser that was the flagship vessel of the russian black sea fleet with neptune anti ship missiles 45 the russian navy lost several other ships to ukrainian stand off attacks including the rts saratov an alligator class landing ship two raptor class patrol boats and a serna class landing craft ukrainian bayraktar tb2 uavs apparently sank the patrol boats and landing craft 46 cyber and space challenges russia conducted multiple cyber operations including cyberattacks and espionage operations in concert with russian land air and maritime attacks a day before the military invasion for example cyberattackers associated with the main intelligence directorate gru launched destructive wiper attacks on hundreds of systems in the ukrainian government and in ukraine s energy information technology media and financial sectors russia s goal was likely to undermine ukraine s political will weaken ukraine s ability to fight and collect intelligence that russia could use to gain tactical operational and strategic advantages over the next several weeks russian actors linked to the gru foreign intelligence service svr and federal security service fsb conducted numerous cyberattacks utilizing such malware families as whispergate whisper kill the worst outcome for ukraine foxblade or hermetic wiper sonicvote or hermeticransom caddywiper desertblade industroyer2 lasainraw or isaacwiper fiberlake or doublezero 47 these types of malware are designed to do a range of malicious activities such as overwriting data and rendering machines unbootable deleting data and destroying or attempting to destroy critical infrastructure such as industrial production and processes russian linked hackers used a range of common intrusion techniques such as exploiting public facing web based applications sending spear phishing e mails with attachments or links and stealing credentials and using valid e mail accounts over the first month and a half of the war more than 40 percent of russia s destructive cyberattacks were aimed at ukrainian critical infrastructure sectors while another 32 percent targeted ukrainian government sites 48 russia also conducted an electronic warfare campaign against ukrainian forces over the previous few years russia had invested heavily in electronic warfare systems capable of shutting down communications and signals across a broad spectrum this capability is grouped under the concept of the radio electronic battery 49 in the early morning of february 24 2022 for example russia jammed ukrainian air defense radar across all frequency bands russian e95m uavs which simulated russian aircraft harassed ukrainian radar to draw out their air defenses 50 nevertheless cyber was largely a bust for russia in the war the russian military faced considerable operational challenges in part because of outside state and non state assistance to ukraine to identify cyber and electronic warfare attacks attribute the perpetrators and assist with remediation some western governments including u s cyber command and the national security agency provided help to the ukrainian government as general paul nakasone commander of u s cyber command and director of the national security agency remarked coordinating with the ukrainians in an effort to help them harden their networks we deployed a hunt team who sat side by side with our partners to gain critical insights that have increased homeland defense for both the united states and ukraine 51 private sector firms also responded microsoft worked closely with the ukrainian government and cybersecurity staff from other governments and private companies to identify and remediate russian threat activity against ukrainian networks before and after the russian invasion 52 in january 2022 the microsoft threat intelligence center identified wiper malware in over a dozen ukrainian networks and alerted the ukrainian government 53 microsoft established a secure line of communication with ukrainian cyber officials to provide real time threat information and offer technical support to assist ukrainian efforts to identify and defeat russian linked cyberattacks over the course of the war 54 microsoft worked with ukrainian government officials to enable controlled folder access a microsoft defender feature and helped ukraine run endpoint detection and response solutions 55 in addition elon musk s company spacex activated starlink a satellite internet constellation that provides high speed low latency broadband internet using advanced satellites in low earth orbit in ukraine and sent additional network terminals including over 10 000 dish antennas 56 starlink enabled members of the ukrainian military to carry out sophisticated intelligence collection and fire support operations against russian positions 57 many of the starlink kits donated to ukraine included a 23 inch wide receiver dish that needed to be mounted outside as well as a cord that connected to a simple router that projected a wi fi internet signal 58 starlink helped blunt russia s attempt to jam signals block the internet and undermine ukrainian command and control capabilities implications for the future what do these lessons indicate about the future of the war in ukraine this analysis suggests that russia made significant mistakes during the planning and execution phases of its military campaigns in ukraine which will be difficult to fix quickly the russian air force is not likely to possess air superiority over ukraine and it has run low on stocks of long range precision guided munitions russia will also likely face long term supply chain challenges for some weapons systems because of western economic sanctions in addition the tendency of poorly trained russian forces to conduct massive bombardments of towns and cities in a war of attrition rather than conducting basic fire and maneuver will make it difficult to seize and hold substantial territory against entrenched ukrainian ground units with western weapons systems and a pipeline of western logistical support russian cyber and electronic warfare capabilities have largely been neutralized by effective ukrainian countermeasures with help from western state and non state entities these and other challenges contributed to high attrition rates for the russian military including the partial or complete destruction of at least 1 000 main battle tanks 350 pieces of artillery 36 fixed wing aircraft and 50 helicopters 59 however russia will likely make some adjustments over the course of the war including improving logistics for example russia s decision during the second phase of the war to regroup along a southern and eastern front improved russian lines of communication russian forces constructed and reinforced some railheads bridges and roads and russian naval successes along the sea of azov allowed russian ships to resupply russian forces by water these adjustments improved russia s ability to move spare parts munitions fuel and other matériel to forward deployed russian forces yet many of russia s failures will require years of changes and will force the russian military to rethink its training organizational structure culture and planning to improve readiness and military performance still the war in ukraine is likely to be protracted for the kremlin the status quo is likely to be unacceptable not only has the russian military failed to achieve most of its objectives but ukraine continues to move closer militarily economically and politically to the west even worse for moscow nato is likely to expand to finland and sweden russia has a recent history of attempting to grind out military victories following russia s failures during the first chechen war 1994 1996 for example putin paused to revamp russian strategy operations and tactics 60 in 1999 russia restarted offensive operations and was much more successful in defeating insurgents during the second chechen war 1999 2009 61 the status quo is also unlikely to be acceptable for ukrainian leaders including president volodymyr zelensky who indicated they are unwilling to allow more of their territory to be annexed 62 since 2014 russia has illegally annexed salami slices of ukrainian territory first in crimea then in eastern ukraine and finally in larger areas of southern and eastern ukraine in a may 2022 opinion poll 82 percent of ukrainians responded that ukraine should not hand over any of its territory to russia as part of a peace deal 63 but winning back territory will be difficult for ukraine as figures 3a 3b and 3c highlight at kherson air base near crimea russian forces have become entrenched in ukraine with main battle tanks self propelled artillery electronic warfare systems multiple rocket launchers armored fighting vehicles sophisticated air defense systems and other systems russia has also constructed defensive fighting positions to make it difficult for ukraine to counterattack figure 3a main battle tanks and self propelled artillery kherson air base ukraine figure 3b multiple rocket launchers kherson air base ukraine figure 3c defensive fighting positions kherson air base ukraine without a peace deal between ukraine and russia a major u s and western military objective should be to provide sufficient military assistance to help ukraine retake territory in the east and south if the united states and the west want to shift the balance of power in ukraine s favor they will need to provide ukraine with more weapons and platforms that allow the ukrainian military to conduct offensive operations and more effective counterattacks against dug in russian forces over a sustained period examples include uavs with a longer range and higher payload than the bayraktar tb2 or aerovironment switchblade loitering munition such as the mq 1c gray eagle main battle tanks such as the leopard 2 heavy battle tank medium and long range missile systems such as the himars multiple launch rocket system and fighter aircraft such as su 25s most of these systems will require additional training and a steady supply of munitions and spare parts which should be feasible with a protracted war more advanced weapons and platforms will be critical to overrun entrenched russian forces in addition ukraine needs to conduct a sustained guerilla campaign behind russian lines that involves ambushes raids sabotage and subversion against russian forces and political leaders hand picked by moscow to replace local ukrainian officials the worst outcome for ukraine would be allowing russia to de facto annex more ukrainian territory as winston churchill remarked on the eve of world war ii appeasement only increases a dictator s appetite and do not suppose that this is the end this is only the beginning of the reckoning this is only the first sip the first foretaste of a bitter cup which will be proffered to us year by year unless by a supreme recovery of moral health and martial vigour we arise again and take our stand for freedom as in the olden time 64 over the past eight years moscow has seized larger portions of ukrainian territory and tried to overthrow the government there is little probability that vladimir putin will stop now seth g

the proposed spending plan which covers two fiscal years and would take effect july 1 passed with broad bipartisan support and relatively subdued debate richmond va virginia s divided general assembly passed a compromise state budget wednesday that would offer nearly 4 billion in tax relief increase pay for teachers and other public employees boost k 12 education spending and fund a wide range of projects from roadwork to school construction budget negotiators crafted the measure at a time when virginia s tax revenues have been soaring far beyond projections that allowed for making long term investments in core government services while also boosting the state s reserves and enacting tax cuts that are expected to save a family of four an estimated 1 108 a year republican house appropriations chairman barry knight said it s been a long haul but i believe the result is a fiscally sound bipartisan budget we can all be proud of he said the proposed spending plan which covers two fiscal years and would take effect july 1 passed with broad bipartisan support and relatively subdued debate lawmakers also passed a bill making adjustments to the current budget the legislation now goes to gop gov glenn youngkin who can sign it or seek changes he said in a statement earlier this week that the compromise offered a good framework and that he would be reviewing it closely in the days to come lawmakers had to return to the capitol in a special session to finish the budget because they deadlocked over the spending plan as their regular calendar drew to a close in march they opted then to extend the talks which have been happening privately among a handful of negotiators some lawmakers criticized the opacity of the process on wednesday youngkin who campaigned on a promise to enact a broad slate of tax cuts had been calling on lawmakers for weeks to act with urgency a deal was announced thursday the two year budget includes many but not all of the tax cuts the governor pushed for it directs about 1 billion in tax relief toward one time rebates of 250 for individuals and 500 for families which would be distributed later this year about 1 6 billion would go toward increasing the standard deduction but not quite doubling it as youngkin sought about 372 million in tax relief would eliminate the state portion of sales tax on groceries and essential personal hygiene products 301 million would provide phased in income tax relief for military retirees 55 or older and 315 million would make the virginia earned income tax credit partially refundable the plan does not include a gas tax holiday another priority of the governor s the budget would boost pay for teachers state employees and state supported local employees it would allocate 100 million for a youngkin backed initiative to partner colleges with k 12 systems to create lab schools and would direct hundreds of millions toward school construction and modernization according to appropriations committee documents it marks the largest ever k 12 education budget spending 19 2b over the biennium a 20 increase from the previous budget cycle the spending plan would also allocate hundreds of millions to support the widening of interstate 64 between hampton roads and richmond and create a new intermediate misdemeanor penalty for possession of more than 4 ounces but not more than 1 pound of marijuana the general assembly did not take up one of the year s most controversial issues wednesday a bill that would offer lucrative tax incentives to the nfl s washington commanders in an effort to lure the team to virginia senate majority leader dick saslaw one of the measure s sponsors said tuesday that a compromise version had not been finalized yet lawmakers can return to the issue later the team is in the midst of a long running search for a new stadium site and maryland virginia and the district of columbia have all been under consideration the stadium bill initially passed with broad bipartisan support but some members have since raised concerns about the size of the incentives and the various controversies swirling around the commanders virginia s attorney general announced in april that his office had launched an inquiry into the team following allegations of financial improprieties raised by a congressional committee the team has denied any wrongdoing lawmakers elected two judicial candidates for general district court positions wednesday but they still have not scheduled a vote on two state supreme court vacancies or an opening on the powerful state corporation commission house republicans and senate democrats remain at odds over how much sway each should have in the picks and any subsequent vacancy that might be created in a lower court if a judge were promoted also wednesday house democrats elected a new caucus leader selecting attorney and two term member don scott from portsmouth the decision came after the 48 member group ousted minority leader eileen filler corn in april over simmering dissent about an unsuccessful election cycle that saw the party lose full control of the state government

maggie rogers want want the latest single from maggie rogers new album surrender is want want which she says started in maine during the pandemic in a small studio assembled over my parents garage i wrote and produced it with my old bandmate del water gap it was really just about the fun of it all some bubblegum world to escape to in the middle of the isolation and darkness the song found its final form over the next year and a half editing and re editing with kid harpoon until we found the perfect knock your teeth out drums the right growl of the guitar tone that roaring synth it s just a prophet stock sound but it always reminded me a little bit of the intro to iron man by black sabbath the right amount of bite that still invites you in the video is about sensuality about embodiment

based on experiences i had on tour with chandra and the band in california reich says chandra s pre teen daughter issa vic and myself would warm up by practicing ecstatic dance a liberating form of expression through movement where you abandon yourself and any judgment the layers of identity that we form in adulthood that prevent us from being who we are issa being younger was able to truly act how she wanted and it set an example of how honest and free you can be we found ourselves exploring a world of creativity coming up with an entire concept for a play with different characters and a great storyline called shnails issa brought us to that dimension of creativity where you don t care how you look it was liberating and bonding to act so foolishly with these people as silly as it was my experience was profound as i realized my identity is a layered wall built on constructs of normalcy i truly questioned who i was inherently maybe i have no idea maybe i have no identity at all

a name i was working on the song when new york was empty things felt especially sci fi and in that long horizontal stretch of time i just went deeper into that state of mind riding my bike around the empty city moving through the grid among buildings commerce clubs some imposing some offering refuge or the memory of that so much metal glass concrete very few signs of life just these towering relics of the 20th century everywhere i was missing shared social spaces missing friends and the novelty of strangers and thinking about discotheques that look like factories and and factories that look like discotheques and so tried make something that felt cinematic evocative of mystery and desire spencer murphy of onyx collective nailed the tone and the snakyness of the bass line eniko is i
