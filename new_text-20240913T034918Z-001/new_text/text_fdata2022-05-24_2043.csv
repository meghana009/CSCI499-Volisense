attributable to heico to ebitda at the end of this press release consolidated results laurans a mendelson heico s chairman and ceo commented on the company s second quarter results stating we are very pleased to report record quarterly consolidated operating income driven mainly by record quarterly operating income at the flight support group these results principally reflect 9 consolidated organic growth in our net sales principally arising from a continued rebound in demand for our commercial aerospace products and services our total debt to shareholders equity ratio was 11 0 as of april 30 2022 as compared to 10 3 as of october 31 2021 our net debt total debt less cash and cash equivalents of 148 6 million as of april 30 2022 to shareholders equity ratio was 6 1 as of april 30 2022 as compared to 5 6 as of october 31 2021 our net debt to ebitda ratio was 28x and 26x as of april 30 2022 and october 31 2021 respectively we have no significant debt maturities until fiscal 2025 and plan to utilize our financial strength and flexibility to aggressively pursue high quality acquisitions of various sizes to accelerate growth and maximize shareholder returns as we look ahead to the remainder of fiscal 2022 we expect global commercial air travel to continue growing despite the potential for additional covid 19 global pandemic the pandemic variants we remain cautiously optimistic that the ongoing worldwide rollout of pandemic vaccines including boosters will continue to positively influence global commercial air travel and benefit the markets we serve but it still remains very difficult to predict the pandemic s path and effect including factors like new variants and vaccination rates potential supply chain disruptions and inflation which can impact our key markets therefore we feel it would not be responsible to provide fiscal 2022 net sales and earnings guidance at this time however we believe our ongoing conservative policies strong balance sheet and high degree of liquidity enable us to continuously invest in new research and development take advantage of periodic strategic inventory purchasing opportunities and execute on our successful acquisition program which collectively position heico for market share gains flight support group eric a mendelson heico s co president and president of heico s flight support group commented on the flight support group s second quarter results stating continuing our growth trend we achieved quarterly increases of 87 and 33 in operating income and net sales respectively as compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2021 these results principally reflect robust quarterly organic net sales growth of 31 for our commercial aerospace parts and services the flight support group has now achieved seven consecutive quarters of growth in operating income and net sales the flight support group s net sales increased 33 to 306 3 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2022 up from 230 3 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2021 the flight support group s net sales increased 35 to 579 0 million in the first six months of fiscal 2022 up from 429 6 million in the first six months of fiscal 2021 the net sales increase in the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2022 reflects strong organic growth of 23 and 26 respectively as well as the impact from our profitable fiscal 2021 and 2022 acquisitions the organic growth mainly reflects increased demand for the majority of our commercial aerospace products and services resulting from continued recovery in global commercial air travel as compared to the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2021 the flight support group s operating income increased 87 to a record 66 2 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2022 up from 35 5 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2021 the flight support group s operating income increased 93 to a record 118 6 million in the first six months of fiscal 2022 up from 61 3 million in the first six months of fiscal 2021 the operating income increase in the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2022 principally reflects an improved gross profit margin mainly from the previously mentioned higher net sales across all product lines and efficiencies realized from the higher net sales volume the flight support group s operating margin improved to 21 6 in the second quarter of fiscal 2022 up from 15 4 in the second quarter of fiscal 2021 the flight support group s operating margin improved to 20 5 in the first six months of fiscal 2022 up from 14 3 in the first six months

in sg a expenses as a percentage of net sales mainly reflecting the previously mentioned efficiencies electronic technologies group victor h mendelson heico s co president and president of heico s electronic technologies group commented on the electronic technologies group s second quarter results stating improved demand and strong organic net sales growth for our space medical and other

net sales were 459 7 million in the first six months of fiscal 2022 as compared to 466 6 million in the first six months of fiscal 2021 the net sales decrease in both periods is mainly attributable to decreased demand for our defense products partially offset by increased demand for our space medical other electronics and telecommunications products as well as the impact from our profitable fiscal 2021 and 2022 acquisitions the electronic technologies group s operating income was 66 0 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2022 as compared to 71 3 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2021

decrease in the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2022 principally reflects a lower level of efficiencies resulting from the previously mentioned defense sales decrease and a lower gross profit margin mainly from the previously mentioned decrease in net sales of defense products and an increase in new product research and development expenses as a percentage of net sales to support ongoing new product research and development activities the electronic technologies group s operating margin was 27 8 in the second quarter of fiscal 2022 as compared to 29 3 in the second quarter of fiscal 2021 the electronic technologies group s operating margin was 26 4 in the first six months of fiscal 2022 as compared to 28 2 in the first six months of fiscal 2021 the lower operating margin

nasal opioid abuse being explored for pf614 data from trial expected in september 2022 san diego ca accesswire may 23 2022 ensysce biosciences inc ensysce or the company nasdaq ensc otc pink enscw a clinical stage biotech company applying transformative chemistry to improve prescription drug safety and performance focused on reducing abuse and overdose today announced the initiation of pf614 103 a randomized double blind placebo and active controlled crossover study to evaluate the intranasal abuse potential of pf614 compared with immediate release oxycodone and placebo in non dependent recreational opioid users is being conducted by dr glen apseloff from ohio clinical trials this trial is designed to test and confirm that manipulating and snorting pf614 will not allow the drug abuser to achieve that desired state of euphoria dr nily osman chief medical officer of ensysce commented our progression of pf614 though clinical development is rapidly advancing with the initiation of this human abuse potential hap study this is an important step in establishing that unlike the current opioid analgesics on the market which can be manipulated and abused through nasal inhalation pf614 does not carry this risk pf614 is developed utilizing ensysce s proprietary drug delivery technology that works with endogenous human trypsin in the small intestine and as such substantially reduces the risk of misuse abuse and diversion through inhaled and iv routes by those who use recreational drugs we remain dedicated to bringing to market a responsible analgesia solution that will alleviate suffering for those who experience severe pain dr lynn kirkpatrick ceo of ensysce offered we believe the features of pf614 will make it unattractive to those who wish to enjoy opioids for recreation we have already demonstrated that pf614 requires exposure to trypsin to become activated to release oxycodone and we have designed this process to match the release of oxycodone from the marketed product oxycontin cr since the trypsin enzyme is found only in the small intestine and not in nasal passages we believe most drug abusers will not experience the same effect as they do with snorting other opioid products we are looking forward to reporting the data from this trial and expect to do so in september of this year pf614 103 study will examine the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic e g maximum drug liking and take drug again of pf614 versus crushed oxycodone and placebo in recreational drug users eligible subjects will receive each of the following 3 treatments 1 per treatment period in a randomized double blind crossover manner following a fasting period of at least 8 hours pf614 100 mg crushed oxycodone hcl ir 40 mg placebo powder the primary outcome measures will be the maximum effect emax for drug liking about ensysce biosciences ensysce biosciences based in san diego ca is a clinical stage biotech company using its two novel proprietary

by adam beam associated press sacramento calif ap despite announcing a record smashing budget surplus of nearly 100 billion on friday california gov gavin newsom s plan to spend that money would likely push the state toward a fiscal cliff next year that could require billions of dollars in budget cuts a state analyst said monday newsom s latest budget proposal known as the may revision would leave the state 3 4 billion over a constitutional limit on spending this year and more than 20 billion over the limit next year according to an analysis by the nonpartisan legislative analyst s office the governor s may revision does not have a plan to address this roughly 25 billion requirement the legislative analyst s office wrote in a report released monday as a result the state would very likely face a significant budget problem next year which could require reductions to programs newsom boasted during a news conference on friday that his spending plan would leave the state with 37 1 billion in reserves but the lao notes nearly 10 billion of that money is in a special public education account that can t be used to help solve budget problems the state s primary savings account would have about 23 5 billion in it or less than the 25 billion requirement projected by the lao the lao strongly urged lawmakers to put more money into savings than newsom had suggested they also recommended rejecting some of his budget proposals to keep the state beneath the spending limit this year the newsom administration believes the governor s budget proposal well positions the state to withstand that potential crisis according to h d palmer spokesman for the california department of finance in addition to the billions of dollars in reserve newsom s budget proposal would spend 95 of the state s surplus this year plus another 15 billion in future years on projects that don t require recurring funding that can be dialed back if needed palmer said describing the one time spending as an insurance policy california s potential budget problems are the result of a unique california law that limits how lawmakers can spend money above a certain limit known as the gann limit after conservative political activist paul gann who helped convince voters to approve it in 1979 the limit is re calculated each year based on growth in inflation and population for decades california didn t have trouble staying under the limit but that changed in recent years as the state s population declined slightly while revenues soared at an unprecedented pace the result of a surging stock market making wealthy people even richer in a place that taxes them more than other states there s only a few things lawmakers can do to get back under the limit they can cut taxes spend money on things that don t count toward the limit like roads bridges and other infrastructure projects or they can give the money back to taxpayers the limit this year is 136 billion california has 252 billion in revenue impacted by the limit newsom s budget proposal spends 113 billion on things excluded from the limit including a 5 5 billion tax cut for businesses 39 billion of the state s surplus for transportation and environmental projects and 11 5 billion in rebates to taxpayers who own cars that leaves the state about 3 4 billion over the limit according to the lao the law gives newsom and the legislature two years to figure out how to get under the limit but the legislative analyst office notes the state can t grow its way out of the problem other voter approved constitutional rules require lawmakers to spend a certain amount of money on public education while setting aside enough to pay down debts and replenish the state s reserves that means for every 1 the state goes over the limit it must spend 1 60 to get back under it this means if revenues are higher than the governor s budget anticipates the state will be in an even worse fiscal position the lao wrote democrats in the state senate have proposed a constitutional amendment to harmonize and modernize the gann limit to ensure core programs like health care higher education and public safety can continue to be funded and not artificially constrained by the out of date gann limit voters would have to approve that change a proposal that likely would not make it on the ballot until 2024 senate democrats believe that timeline still gives them enough time to avoid budget problems newsom said friday he supports that amendment calling it long overdue while remarking on the irony of the state having the state having so much money it could require budget cuts it s a remarkably high class problem isn t it he said
jamaicans are being told to brace for impact if the us economy the world s largest is sent into a recession as the federal reserve tries to contain the worst inflation in that country for 40 years 8 3 per cent in april from a year ago by chiefly hiking interest rates and reducing the amount of money it puts into the system each month nine times since 1961 the us central bank has embarked on a series of interest rate increases to rein in inflation eight times a recession followed this is not a sterling track record which gives hope that no recession will follow the latest round of attempts to fix inflation i do believe that the recession risk in the us is rising because of the fed actions so far and what it is proposing to do going forward in terms of increasing interest rates dr adrian stokes a financial economist and chairman of the private sector organisation of jamaica s economic policy committee told the jamaica observer in an interview late last week on the matter contextually the fed has to respond given the nature of inflation which is driven alot by an economy which is overheating apart from runaway inflation the us labour market is very tight adding 428 000 new jobs in april a figure which was between 7 per cent and 9 7 per cent above the estimates the unemployment rate held steady at 3 6 per cent while average hourly wages rose by 0 3 per cent from march and by 5 5 per cent year over year david wan cooling that overheating will not be easy the hope is that the recession does not materialises though all data point to one coming sooner rather than later we do expect that there will be reduced growth starting the first half of next year stokes added john mahfood the president of the jamaica manufacturers and exporters association a lobby group shared the sentiments there is of course a lot of concern in the us business community that any further increases from the federal reserve will have a disastrous effect on the economy and we see that manifested in the stock market which has been declining very seriously this week mahfood pointed out to sunday finance rising recession fears pushed us stocks into a bear market on friday with the s p 500 s decline from its all time high in january now reaching 20 per cent but how will all of this affect jamaica and that is with a big if if the us economy sinks into a recession i do believe we have more than a 50 50 chance of slipping into a recession one because we are starting i believe from a weaker point than the united states the us economy is already above its pre pandemic level and there it has a fair way to go before it slips back or starts to slow stokes observed in response to the question of the impact of a possible recession in the us on jamaica he explained that jamaica is not in the same position as the united states economy for starters while preliminary estimates for the calendar year 2021 showed that the economy grew by 4 6 per cent it is yet to recover to pre pandemic levels the economy declined by 10 2 per cent in 2020 due mainly to the fallout from the novel coronavirus pandemic we are much weaker and we are feeling the tailwind of covid the other factors that are being driven by geopolitical concerns will exacerbate the problem also that the bank of jamaica is in a very aggressive tightening stance will increase that probability of us having a material slowdown and possibly slipping into a recession stokes explained further he added that the options are limited for jamaica in terms of trying to manage us away from going into a recession if the us economy falls into one one there isn t the fiscal space to implement countercyclical policies so i do not expect a lot of support from central government via the fiscal accounts to support any slowdown in economic activity and then given the stance of the bank of jamaica with monetary policy the impact of that monetary policy will exacerbate the slowdown as opposed to countering that economic drag so bottom line i think we are in a tricky situation it s very problematic based on what the fiscal can accommodate and based on where monetary policy is heading for stokes the first thing jamaicans will see is a slowdown in business and consumer spending which will have a knock on effect in terms of consumption and ultimately in jobs so consumption will slow we will start to see expansion plans being curtailed or delayed so therefore job growth will be stalled and then if the situation gets worse in terms of the initial effect of the slow down then if that is material you will see a fall off in employment john mahfood dennis jones an ex economist at the international monetary fund imf said he was less sure what will happen in jamaica when approximately half of the economy is informal and likely not affected by financial policy tools but by other channels what may trigger recession is that consumers were already deep underwater and covid worsened that tending to push people to save more not least due to uncertainty wages haven t moved much and inflation may be eating fast into already limited consumption options simply spending may be shutting down just to survive some may benefit from debt eroded by inflation but not if debt wasn t being serviced jones added mahfood was more concerned about the impact rising interest rates in the us could have on the housing market in that country and the spillover effects on jamaica mortgage rates are already very high in the us reaching 5 per cent and when you go to 5 per cent or 6 per cent it becomes very very expensive to buy homes and take out a mortgage and in particular because the real estate prices have gone up so much and if that happens and there is a downturn in the housing market a downturn in manufacturing which leads to a recession in the us there is an immediate impact on jamaica firstly the jamaicans living in the us are generally on the lowest end of the wage scale and they are usually the first to feel a recession in terms of layoffs and reduced hours and once that happens their ability to send remittances will be greatly reduced mahfood explained he said tourists will also be affected tourism to jamaica will be impacted we are not yet at the level of the 2019 level and that will be affected he also expressed concerns about the impact a recession in the us could have on exports and all foreign exchange earnings and by extension how lower inflows could affect the stability of the jamaican dollar david wan president of the jamaica employers federation also expressed concerns about the looming recession but proposed pivoting to the fiscal side i think the government should seek to stimulate the supply side of the economy he said asked to explain further wan said policies should be put in place to incentivise companies to produce more instead of just focusing on trying to stifle demand wan said he knows it s hard for the government to give up revenues currently but at the same time proposed that machinery and equipment intended for the productive sector should be easier to import to improve production while consumer goods for which there are no local producers should attract a lower duty to help reduce costs to consumers in the hope of helping to contain inflation

various financial services in switzerland europe the middle east africa the americas and asia pacific the company offers private banking and wealth management solutions including advisory investment financial planning succession planning and trust services and financing and lending and multi shore platform solutions credit suisse has a history of business dealings with russian oligarchs or ultra high net worth business leaders possessing significant political influence for example an article published by financial times on february 7 2022 entitled credit suisse securitizes yacht loans to oligarchs and tycoons cited a recent investor presentation for a synthetic securitization deal in which credit suisse sold off 80 million worth of risk related to a 2 billion portfolio of loans backed by assets owned by certain of the bank s ultra high net worth clients the securitization deal which disclosed that in 2017 and 2018 credit suisse experienced 12 defaults on yacht and aircraft loans a third of which were related to u s sanctions against russian oligarchs press reports at the time indicated that russian billionaires oleg deripaska arkady rotenberg and boris rotenberg had to terminate private jet leases with credit suisse in those years beginning in or around october 2021 russia commenced a major military build up near the russo ukrainian border in apparent preparation for an invasion of ukraine although the russian government repeatedly denied it had plans to invade or attack ukraine the u s later released intelligence of russian invasion plans including satellite photographs showing russian troops and equipment near the russo ukrainian border in november 2021 as russia s military buildup on the russo ukrainian border continued the company entered the securitization deal just months later on february 24 2022 russian military forces invaded ukraine in the immediate aftermath of the invasion western governments including among others the u s canada and the european union imposed significant sanctions on russia the sanctions included inter alia measures targeting russia s ultrawealthy oligarchs by denying them access to the global financial system and by in some cases authorizing the seizure of certain of their high value assets located outside of russia barely a week after the commencement of the russian invasion and the retaliatory sanctions imposed by western nations news outlets reported that credit suisse had requested non participating investors who received information about the company s loan portfolio to destroy and permanently erase any confidential information that credit suisse provided to them regarding the securitization deal the complaint alleges that throughout the class period defendants made materially false and misleading statements regarding the company s business operations and compliance policies specifically defendants made false and or misleading statements and or failed to disclose that i credit suisse had deficient disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting ii credit suisse s practice of lending money to russian oligarchs subject to u s and international sanctions created a significant risk of violating rules pertaining to those sanctions and future sanctions iii the foregoing conduct subjected the company to an increased risk of heightened regulatory scrutiny and or enforcement actions iv the securitization deal concerned loans that credit suisse made to russian oligarchs previously sanctioned by the u s v the purpose of the securitization deal was to offload the risks associated with these loans and mitigate the impact on credit suisse of sanctions likely to be implemented by western nations in response to russia s invasion of ukraine vi credit suisse s request that non participating investors destroy documents related to the securitization deal was intended to conceal the company s noncompliance with u s and international sanctions in its lending practices vii the foregoing once revealed was likely to subject the company to enhanced regulatory scrutiny and significant reputational harm and viii as a result the company s public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times on march 28 2022 the u s house of representatives committee on oversight and reform sent credit suisse a letter asking the company to turn over information and documents about a portfolio of loans backed by yachts and private jets owned by clients potentially including sanctioned russian individuals in the letter house oversight chair carolyn maloney and rep stephen lynch chair of the subcommittee on national security questioned credit suisse s request that hedge funds and other non participating investors destroy documents related to yachts and private jets owned by the bank s clients given the timing of this request and its subject matter the house democrats wrote credit suisse s action raises significant concerns that it may be concealing information about whether participants in the deal may be evading sanctions imposed by the west after russia s invasion of ukraine on this news

bnp paribas increasingly wants to be seen in the u s as a bank for companies that do business overseas particularly in europe that s a marked difference from the paris based bank s previous strategy of also serving u s retail customers through its bank of the west unit which it agreed to sell to bank of montreal in december 2021 and through bank of the west s first hawaiian bank arm which it sold off in 2019 the idea behind the shift in strategy said jean yves fillion ceo of bnp paribas usa is to get the u s business closer to the bank s standing at home where it comes in no 1 in europe for corporate and institutional banking in the u s it ranks in the top 10 you have to be present you have to have critical mass you can t be everything to everybody the ceo said today business clients are asking bnp paribas for supply chain management financing to pay for capital investments working capital or m a and hedging of rates equities or currencies the test is serving u s clients internationally fillion said credit has been quite robust he added with high grade issuance close to 2021 levels mergers and acquisitions are also strong especially in tech media and industrials driven largely by private equity funds purchases which are fueling the debt markets as well bnp has a big investment banking unit that s actually doing quite well said claude hanley a partner at the capital performance group consultancy one challenge how does this strategy to serve businesses as they move around the world fare if the russian war in ukraine sparks deglobalization if that s happening already fillion hasn t seen it yet although he said companies are starting to bring production and sourcing back home i see more clients today switching from just in time to just in case which amounts to redomestication he said fillion joined bnp paribas right out of college and moved from paris to chicago for the bank later on he lived in los angeles and then new york where he s now based and has now spent four decades in the u s the world of banking is very different than it used to be he said citing the complex geopolitical situation the economy and the enhanced role of central banks including the increased convergence of the european central bank and the u s federal reserve a more recent trend has been inflation which was not part of the conversation even two years ago he said now everyone is aware of the confusing time we re going through with all the headwinds supply chain disruptions leading to higher prices a hawkish fed and the russian invasion of ukraine triggering a crisis for both energy and refugees especially in europe at the same time the u s economy is doing really well with bnp paribas economists predicting 3 gdp growth in 2022 in spite of inflation and consumer confidence being more volatile households are continuing to spend fillion said this economy is still benefiting from a stimulus dimension that matters he said since some 70 of u s gdp is driven by consumption and although bnp paribas is divesting bank of the west the bank still expects to maintain a large presence in the u s where it has 5 000 employees fillion said it has grown recently through bolt on acquisitions in its markets unit such as deutsche bank s prime brokerage which brought electronic trading execution to bnp paribas the bank also signed an agreement to take over as many of credit suisse s prime brokerage clients who want to move over to bnp after the swiss bank said it would exit that business the equity research firm exane of which bnp paribas recently bought the other half it didn t already own will also be expanding into the u s from its base in europe how competitors are faring bnp paribas is not the only european based bank moving away from serving u s retail customers i think the european banks are all facing profitability pressures hanley said a lot of them are withdrawing and rethinking the u s retail banking market because it s not generating the returns they need the strategy now hanley said is to shift toward the higher end of the income scale in the future i think overseas banks coming into the u s will concentrate on wealthy people he said citing ubs s acquisition of the robo advisor wealthfront and hsbc s strategy of placing branches in places where rich clients have overseas banking needs high net worth consumers continue to spend they tend to buy things that need financing like real estate and they are less susceptible to inflation because they own assets that tend to appreciate in price like stocks all of this makes them uniquely positioned to be good clients right now especially since as visa chief economist wayne best noted the affluent have a spending demand backlog of a quarter of a trillion dollars right now much of which they plan to use for travel and other high ticket items growth rates are higher in asia and the u s than they are in europe hanley said european banks have to go abroad because it s where the growth rates are but they have found they can t compete by trying to be mainstream competitors so they re going niche

president biden source bigstock for half a decade now america s media elite have been obsessed with former president donald trump and the republican party s conversion to trumpism press and tv are daily consumed with his actions and prospects and the future of the party he captured in 2016 perhaps it is time to consider the prospects of president joe biden and the political future of his embattled presidency biden has been america s oldest president since the day he took office what are the odds that biden like bill clinton and barack obama before him will run again in 2024 win reelection serve out a second term and transfer his office to the 47th president on jan 20 2029 my guess the odds of that happening are roughly the same as the odds that last minute entry rich strike would win the kentucky derby as he left the starting gate at churchill downs at 80 1 consider the first hurdle biden faces on the way to renomination in 2024 the midterm elections five months off since the dow jones industrial average and s p 500 reached record highs in january both have seen eight weeks of wipeouts of trillions of dollars in value as we approached bear market territory by the end of last week stock portfolios pensions and retirement benefit plans have been gutted these massive market losses are also a lead indicator pointing to a recession right ahead just as voters pass judgment on a democratic party that controls the white house and both houses of congress but even before we reach recession americans have already been living with a biden inflation of 8 that has lasted for months and affected all the necessities of normal life such as groceries and gasoline and the worst seems yet to come the federal reserve has reversed course from its easy money days and begun to raise interest rates to squeeze the biden inflation out of the economy what lies ahead may remind people who were around then of jimmy carter s stagflation where interest rates hit 21 to kill an inflation that reached 13 as for the crisis on the southern border it is deeper than ever some 234 000 migrants were caught illegally entering the u s in april alone with thousands of others evading any contact with u s authorities this is an invasion rate of some 3 million illegal migrants a year shootings killings carjackings criminal assaults and smash and grab robberies in record numbers are the subject of our nightly news and the latest national polls suggest the country is holding biden responsible the president s approval rating is down to 39 and only 1 in 3 americans think he is doing a good job handling the economy and that the nation is headed in the right direction now the omicron variant of covid 19 is making a comeback infections are again over 100 000 a day biden might find consolation from how his predecessors overcame midterm defeats clinton in 1994 lost 54 house seats and won reelection easily in 1996 obama lost 63 house seats in 2010 to come back and win handily over mitt romney in 2012 why cannot biden ride out the anticipated storm in this year s midterms and come back to win election in 2024 as did clinton and obama age has something to do with it clinton was 50 in his reelection year 1996 obama was 51 in his reelection year 2012 and both were at the peak of their political powers biden on election day 2024 will be two weeks shy of his 82nd birthday should he serve out a second term he would not leave the white house until he had turned 86 biden has been america s oldest president since the day he took office alexander hamilton in the federalist papers wrote of energy in the executive as being an indispensable attribute of good government does biden with his shuffling gait regular gaffes and physical and cognitive decline manifest that attribute of which hamilton wrote the likely scenario for biden his party sustains a crushing defeat in november comparable to what clinton and obama suffered but the party does not immediately rally around biden as present and future leader as it did with clinton and obama critics inside the democratic coalition begin to blame biden for the loss ambitious democrats sensing disaster if biden tops the ticket in 2024 begin to call for him to stand down and give way to a younger candidate a new face in 2024 one or two progressives declare for president and the pressure builds on biden to avoid a personal and political humiliation in the 2024 primaries by standing down as harry truman did in 1952 and lyndon johnson did in 1968 by early 2023 biden will have adopted the line that dealing with the challenge of china and russia and at the same time coping with recession and inflation require his full attention and these preclude a national political campaign for reelection and then president joe biden announces he will not run again

facebook data scandal follow story facebook founder mark zuckerberg was named personally in a washington lawsuit monday alleging he played a direct role in decisions that set the stage for the cambridge analytica privacy scandal the us capital s attorney general argues that zuckerberg was closely involved in conceiving the framework that allowed the britain based consulting firm to harvest over 70 million us facebook users data a whistleblower revealed in 2018 that cambridge analytica went on to use that data for political purposes including trying to rally support for donald trump zuckerberg is not just a figurehead at facebook he is personally involved in nearly every decision the company makes washington attorney general karl racine wrote in the suit afp facebook says that hackers scraped personal data of some half billion users back in 2019 by taking advantage of a feature designed to help people easily find friends using contact lists a trove of information about more than 530 million facebook users was shared over the weekend at a hacker forum prompting the leading social network to explain what happened and call on people to be vigilant about privacy settings it is important to understand that malicious actors obtained this data not through hacking our systems but by scraping it from our platform prior to september 2019 facebook product management director mike clark says in a post afp mark zuckerberg meets privately with members of congress on a political reconnaissance mission to washington where he rejected calls for him to break up the world s biggest social network zuckerberg s visit with policymakers comes as facebook faces a myriad of regulatory and legal questions surrounding issues like competition digital privacy censorship and transparency in political advertising a facebook spokesman says discussions were focusing in part on future internet regulation afp us regulators formalize a record 5 billion fine on facebook for privacy violations in a settlement requiring the world s biggest social network to submit to new restrictions and a modified corporate structure the federal trade commission says the penalty was the largest ever imposed on any company for violating consumers privacy and one of the largest penalties ever assessed by the us government for any violation despite repeated promises to its billions of users worldwide that they could control how their personal information is shared facebook undermined consumers choices ftc chairman joe simons says in a statement after the split decision by the agency with two members saying the penalty was insufficient facebook boss mark zuckerberg says that a lack of action by us authorities on fake political content on the platform after the 2016 us election helped pave the way for a subsequent avalanche of online disinformation the ceo who has himself been widely criticised for a lackluster response to fake news also calls on governments to further regulate private data political advertising and step up efforts to prevent state actors from interfering in us elections as a private company we don t have the tools to make the russian government stop our government is the one that has the tools to apply pressure to russia he says during an on stage interview at the aspen ideas festival in colorado afp the social media giant says facebook ceo mark zuckerberg did not knowingly violate an agreement with the regulator supervising the company s management of users personal data as it addressed an issue that has been under federal investigation for the past year facebook was required to provide the federal trade commission ftc with emails some from 2012 suggesting that zuckerberg was personally aware of but neglected to address the fact that external applications had access to massive amounts of personal data without facebook users knowledge the wall street journal reported the newspaper added that it did not have access to the documents but that anonymous sources had described their contents we have fully cooperated with the ftc s investigation to date and provided tens of thousands of documents emails and files says a facebook spokesperson afp us prosecutors have launched a criminal investigation into facebook s practice of sharing users data with companies without letting the social network s members know the new

been able to keep revenue momentum thanks to its unique advertising model its global user base has risen to more than 2 2 billion although growth has stalled in north america and europe afp facebook co founder and chief mark zuckerberg has renewed his defense of the social network s business arguing that targeting ads based on interests was different from selling people s data if we re committed

data protection goes directly to the public with a pop up kiosk in new york where users could ask questions and find out more about how the social network handles personal information the public

stock market history the loss came a day after facebook revealed that its user base and revenue grew more slowly than expected in the second quarter as it grappled with privacy issues those revelations stunned investors who believed the company had weathered the recent scandal over users privacy and pushed the stock to an all time high wednesday of 217 50 ap the head of the u k parliament s media committee has criticized facebook for what it describes as evasive behavior in answering questions on fake news committee chair damian collins says that facebook s claims they were unable to distinguish between political and non political advertising is difficult to believe he also slammed their refusal to reveal the level of resources devoted to security in questions that followed oral testimony before the committee collins says facebook continues to display a pattern of evasive behavior a pattern which has emerged over the course of our inquiry facebook was not

warns that rules could also hamper the industry s growth the internet is growing in importance around the world in people s lives and i think that it is inevitable that there will need to be some regulation he tells a hearing in congress but i think you have to be careful about putting regulation in place a lot of times regulations put in place rules that a company that is larger that has

when monica tranel was fighting northwestern energy as a staff attorney for the montana consumer counsel she said the monopoly utility essentially did a data dump on me i was the only person against northwestern s bevy of lawyers and support staff tranel said and i read the documents it took me forever but i went through them one by one tranel a lawyer mom and former two time olympian won the case and she said she ll bring that same commitment to the u s house of representatives on the campaign trail she talks about being an olympic rower and in an introductory video on her website she explains her role as being a middle rower part of the engine room the engine room isn t for show ponies no one sees your face you keep your eyes on the boat and work as hard as you can but the engine room is where the real horsepower has to come from and that s where races are won tranel says in the video tranel is campaigning for the democratic nomination in montana s new western district against health care expert cora neumann and former state legislator tom winter the winner of the primary is likely to face republican ryan zinke an opponent who had a series of ethics complaints lodged against him as former secretary of the interior but won a u s house race by 16 points in 2016 prior to working under the trump administration in an interview tranel likens the tenacity she brought to that case against northwestern with the grit required of an olympian the ability to stick with things when they get uncomfortable and hard and tedious in that case she said northwestern wanted replacement power costs when colstrip was down and tranel argued customers shouldn t have to pay saving them 10 million an order from regulators denied the company from recovering the 8 2 million it tried to collect from customers and directed northwestern to pay back additional related costs plus interest what i bring to this is 25 years of delivered experience and results for montana said tranel who grew up on a ranch in central montana and is the sixth of 10 children editor s note three candidates are on the ballot for the democratic nomination for the u s house of representatives in montana s western district the candidates are cora neumann monica tranel and tom winter read tranel s q a with montana public radio here read details on policy positions from the montana free press here read monica tranel s issues page here earlier this month a district court judge sided with tranel s clients including climate action group 350 montana against northwestern in finding a montana law that allowed the company to get pre approval to build projects was unconstitutional because it gave one utility special privileges northwestern told the montana free press it will appeal the energy lawyer has a vision for the future that includes an economy that supports the middle class while addressing climate change tranel for example notes western montana can address the housing crisis while decreasing carbon emissions we can have more supply and as part of that we can have solar on every rooftop she said noting the idea translates into both good labor and help with the energy transition in eastern montana she said workers in colstrip can transition to jobs associated with cleanup for instance and she also said buying out power plant debt with municipal bonds would lower the interest rate and the difference could be used to pay out pensions or retrain workers we re in a time of profound change and transition and we can embrace that and find the opportunities tranel said it ll look different and it will be different but we will have both a strong labor workforce and sustainable future in 2004 and in 2020 tranel ran for the public service commission which regulates monopoly utilities in montana when she ran for the psc in 2004 she did so as a republican she also worked in the early 2000s for former republican sen conrad burns tranel said she was a psc staff attorney when she ran for commissioner and the job is nonpartisan i grew up in a pretty apolitical family honestly so i don t know that i have anything to add in running as a democrat tranel had pointed out that all the members of the psc at the time were republicans tranel who lives in missoula points to endorsements from the likes of former gov brian schweitzer and former state sen diane sands of missoula as evidence of her values however she said her law clients are mostly pretty conservative people including a ranch couple who are trump supporters and she said have told her they would vote for her if they lived in her district although they wish she wasn t a democrat i stay with them i eat their food i share their home and we talk and we mostly share values tranel said in fact when she is knocking doors tranel said she often hears about people s desire to advance common goals and their exhaustion with othering and the demonization she said people also want community for montana to feel like montana again people don t want to look at each other with stink eyes tranel said they don t i think people really have a sense of you re my neighbor and you can also be my friend we don t have to agree on every issue but i can still shovel your sidewalk tranel supporters point to her extensive fundraising from montanans as one indication she is the best candidate to represent montana s interests in washington d c and tranel herself said she s spent her career following the money why do the baby formula makers reject doing the right thing when they know that the bacteria is really a problem people serve the interests of the financial support that they receive she said that s how we work and so ryan zinke is being funded by out of state interests cora neumann has less montana money than any other candidate in this race she s being funded by out of state interests other candidates have raised less money from montanans neumann has countered that 92 percent of her donations are 100 or less and of all her contributions the highest number are from montanans the daily montanan could not independently verify the contribution numbers by press time a super pac called montanans for better congress recently spent 109 000 to run television ads attacking neumann but at a recent candidate event tranel said by its definition the super pac works independently of her campaign since the law prohibits coordination with her the super pac isn t legally limited on the size of contributions it receives it has not yet filed a report disclosing contributors for voters in the primary personality and experience will play a more prominent role than policy in the western district said political analyst lee banville in that regard he said tranel is emphasizing her deep roots in montana but she can also point to being relatively moderate a former republican she can make the case that she has the strongest resume to go up against zinke or another republican and also has a sort of unique appeal to potentially moderate or independent voters said banville a university of montana school of journalism professor he pointed to her upbringing and her experience as an olympian as part of her story in the primary as well she s also carving out that she s a fighter the daily montanan s candidate profiles for republicans and democrats running for montana s two congressional seats will run this week the daily montana has reached out to candidates in this race offering them the opportunity to speak with our reporters the following candidates have either declined the opportunity or not responded al olszewski matt rosendale skylar williams mary todd and ryan zinke editor s note this story was updated to note other u s house candidates have raised less money from montana than neumann

various financial services in switzerland europe the middle east africa the americas and asia pacific the company offers private banking and wealth management solutions including advisory investment financial planning succession planning and trust services and financing and lending and multi shore platform solutions credit suisse has a history of business dealings with russian oligarchs or ultra high net worth business leaders possessing significant political influence for example an article published by financial times on february 7 2022 entitled credit suisse securitizes yacht loans to oligarchs and tycoons cited a recent investor presentation for a synthetic securitization deal in which credit suisse sold off 80 million worth of risk related to a 2 billion portfolio of loans backed by assets owned by certain of the bank s ultra high net worth clients the securitization deal which disclosed that in 2017 and 2018 credit suisse experienced 12 defaults on yacht and aircraft loans a third of which were related to u s sanctions against russian oligarchs press reports at the time indicated that russian billionaires oleg deripaska arkady rotenberg and boris rotenberg had to terminate private jet leases with credit suisse in those years beginning in or around october 2021 russia commenced a major military build up near the russo ukrainian border in apparent preparation for an invasion of ukraine although the russian government repeatedly denied it had plans to invade or attack ukraine the u s later released intelligence of russian invasion plans including satellite photographs showing russian troops and equipment near the russo ukrainian border in november 2021 as russia s military buildup on the russo ukrainian border continued the company entered the securitization deal just months later on february 24 2022 russian military forces invaded ukraine in the immediate aftermath of the invasion western governments including among others the u s canada and the european union imposed significant sanctions on russia the sanctions included inter alia measures targeting russia s ultrawealthy oligarchs by denying them access to the global financial system and by in some cases authorizing the seizure of certain of their high value assets located outside of russia barely a week after the commencement of the russian invasion and the retaliatory sanctions imposed by western nations news outlets reported that credit suisse had requested non participating investors who received information about the company s loan portfolio to destroy and permanently erase any confidential information that credit suisse provided to them regarding the securitization deal the complaint alleges that throughout the class period defendants made materially false and misleading statements regarding the company s business operations and compliance policies specifically defendants made false and or misleading statements and or failed to disclose that i credit suisse had deficient disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting ii credit suisse s practice of lending money to russian oligarchs subject to u s and international sanctions created a significant risk of violating rules pertaining to those sanctions and future sanctions iii the foregoing conduct subjected the company to an increased risk of heightened regulatory scrutiny and or enforcement actions iv the securitization deal concerned loans that credit suisse made to russian oligarchs previously sanctioned by the u s v the purpose of the securitization deal was to offload the risks associated with these loans and mitigate the impact on credit suisse of sanctions likely to be implemented by western nations in response to russia s invasion of ukraine vi credit suisse s request that non participating investors destroy documents related to the securitization deal was intended to conceal the company s noncompliance with u s and international sanctions in its lending practices vii the foregoing once revealed was likely to subject the company to enhanced regulatory scrutiny and significant reputational harm and viii as a result the company s public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times on march 28 2022 the u s house of representatives committee on oversight and reform sent credit suisse a letter asking the company to turn over information and documents about a portfolio of loans backed by yachts and private jets owned by clients potentially including sanctioned russian individuals in the letter house oversight chair carolyn maloney and rep stephen lynch chair of the subcommittee on national security questioned credit suisse s request that hedge funds and other non participating investors destroy documents related to yachts and private jets owned by the bank s clients given the timing of this request and its subject matter the house democrats wrote credit suisse s action raises significant concerns that it may be concealing information about whether participants in the deal may be evading sanctions imposed by the west after russia s invasion of ukraine on this news

storefront leasing is still recovering but the vibes at the world s biggest retail conference reveal a covid blind optimism is in the air the wynn resort poolside parties sunday the unofficial pregame to the icsc conference in las vegas were awash with brokers investors developers and some conference newbies eager to get down to business and debauchery after a three year hiatus from the may event riffing off the devil may care attitude that ruled 2021 s hot girl summer stephanie weber the 30 year old principal and co founder of asheville based institutional advisory group likened icsc 2022 to hot girl real estate it definitely feels like the event the parties are back with a vengeance this year webe said jds development founder michael stern who makes skyline shaping bets for a living laid down footings at the wynn s blackjack tables jack terzi founder of embattled new york retail landlord jtre nursed a coors light and cigar under the main cabana as creditors 2 500 miles away were trying to foreclose on several of his properties there are two sides to every story terzi said though the conference hosted a semi annual resurrection last december many of the attendees circulating the wynn s european pool said they had skipped it the gathering pulled about one fourth of its usual 30 000 attendees to hold out for the real thing this spring ari malul a broker at new york based schuckman realty remembered a sense of apathy about attending december s conference befuddlingly titled and punctuated here we go held on the eve of the omicron variant surge the winter event required proof of vaccination may s gathering by contrast dispensed with covid safety requirements such as negative tests or vaccination cards attendance at least was healthy at 20 000 or two thirds of a normal year s count this time it was like fomo if you didn t go said malul the uptick in cabana rentals was a testament to the event s comeback last year meridian capital group was the only firm to book a covered enclave this year throngs of industry folk dotted the wynn pool s perimeter with retail powerhouses such as winick tristate commercial and northwood investors hosting poolside gatherings marc sitt managing director at kassin sabbagh realty held court steps from the investment firm s corner cabana amid attempts to find a spray on sunscreen he doled out his take on retail s resurgence the market is back perched in a tree overlooking meridian s two cabanas was an african hawk eagle which was initially on display for photos but had evidently escaped from its handler who could only be described as way too blasé to be in charge of an african hawk eagle perhaps the raptor had its eye on the kosher catering and free swag at meridian s party sign up for the undefined newsletter sign up meridian s spread drew the biggest crowd of the real estate cabanas with everyone from a 21 year old part time broker to firm presidents mixing it up over free casamigos cocktails president of retail leasing james famularo was surrounded by a gaggle of young brokers eager to set up a lunch before he could light up his cigar the pandemic turned so many restaurants into cavities that famularo is now seeing an uptick in restaurant leasing leasing in a space already outfitted with deep fryers and cooktops can cut a tenant s costs and move in time at northwood s cabana the talk was about first generation retail stores from online native brands like allbirds which can use their troves of consumer data to pinpoint neighborhoods where customers already live of course myriad obstacles stand between retail and a full recovery in store shopping and e commerce remain locked in a tug of war and inflation coupled with stock market chaos is hitting consumers wallets and lest we forget the fifth covid wave could well dampen brick and mortar visits but just as last year s hot girl summer saw young urbanites cast off covid protocols to steal a slice of normalcy with the pandemic still simmering the attendees of this year s hot girl icsc rarely let chit chat turn to concerns about covid s impact on business or their current risk of contraction preferring instead to revel in the moment marcus millichap s evening escapade at the wynn s gilded xs club embodied that carpe diem energy a couple of hours into the 8 o clock party dealmakers perched on tufted banquettes laughing and gabbing as cater waiters circled offering spring rolls to complement the complimentary drinks others leaned back in booths nestled along the edges of the room to watch women in incandescent butterfly bodysuits dance the real party though was outside a testament perhaps to lingering fears of covid a growing crowd wrapped around the club pool watching a female stilt walker in a technicolor costume fit for the electronic music festival electric daisy carnival also held in vegas this weekend steps from that exuberance the real world of retail could be seen as a sobering testament to how the other half has been living just outside the wynn the manager of a 24 hour denny s smoked a cigarette and pointed up to the newly built resorts world across the street those guys they ve got bags of money to throw at hiring he said i m still having trouble drawing a full staff people don t want to work for what we used to pay up in the wynn as retail s white collars partied in the neon lights covid felt like a bad memory from the distant past but down on the ground floor some of their tenants can t shake the pandemic blues

a district in philadelphia is moving forward with a smart city project to gain real time insights into air quality weather transportation modes and more providing a dynamic understanding of the urban environment smartblockphl part of the larger smartcityphl program is a pilot project and partnership among the city comcast us ignite and juganu it will be deployed in philadelphia s midtown village with the technology installed on 14 streetlights the goal of this project was to test and validate new sensor based technologies against legacy methods of collecting the same information said labonno islam digital engagement and communications manager for the city s office of innovation and technology as the city learns more about the quality of data from this project its teams will develop ways to operationalize it in the future the project is unique in its ability to collect data in real time and then process it in the cloud this project has been a very productive exercise in assessing and establishing how the city works with new technologies using edge computing while addressing concerns around the individual privacy of people using the right of way said islam us ignite will serve as a facilitator for stakeholder engagement while also bringing technology expertise and other resources to the table so that the local government in philadelphia can build its own capacity for further smart city development said sarah archer days a spokesperson for us ignite comcast will provide the technology to equip the streetlights to collect metadata in real time while ensuring the privacy and autonomy of the residents and others moving through the area say officials adding no personal identifiable information will be collected us ignite provided data privacy expertise to help philadelphia craft an approach to data management and trust building within the neighborhood said lee davenport director of community development for us ignite we will also support the city as they uncover insights from the pilot project to determine whether and where smart streetlights can deliver value for philadelphia in the future davenport added it s not entirely clear how the data will be used or what operational changes it may lead to these are some of the issues to be explored the city s smartcityphl team is still working on cleaning up and validating the data and will have more updates in the coming months said islam data privacy is never far from the concerns around any smart city project and the smartcityphl project will explore opportunities to both address these concerns while still moving forward with the improvements to city life that can come from data collection said davenport people are rightly very sensitive to the potential for surveillance and misuse of data davenport added however it is worth spending the time to address privacy concerns and find ways to move forward effectively and transparently because data about our environment is critical to affecting change it s believed the data collected will help the city respond more effectively to emergencies and also better understand the on the ground conditions of the neighborhood with respect to environmental quality and overall safety and movement what is the air quality in a particular neighborhood and does that link to public health concerns if there are public health concerns how does that correlate to local housing stock and potentially to issues of equity in the city are there natural gathering points for pedestrians and could those spaces by improved or could space be better utilized said davenport offering a range of questions and issues the project could shine new light on
god created the garden of eden and blockchain has built the metaverse both of which are the paradise for human beings the difference is that the former comes from the bible while the latter is experiencing savage growth in the long history of the metaverse what is needed is more like the three masted sailing ship hela defi on the nile as a new generation of decentralized financial ecosystem platform hela defi features an ingenious fba new trading model which is seemingly a simple innovation but can be one giant leap for the metaverse and web3 0 besides it can break the deadlock to seek the priority for defi 3 0 development and open up the new economic landscape web3 0 the hercules to clean the augean stable the financial industry has been notorious for age old malpractices from centralization to decentralization the financial industry is still the augean stable to be cleaned even to this day yet it s a complex industry involving macro levels such as economy politics and finance here we re going to start with the concept of web 3 0 which is hot these days in today s globalization black swan events are often consequences of the butterfly effect for example the great american housing bubble triggered the us subprime mortgage crisis which then evolved into the global financial crisis of 2008 however it was also because of this event that satoshi nakamoto published his wildly influential bitcoin whitepaper ushering in a new era of decentralized finance it was assumed that with the development of science and technology the tumors of traditional finance would be removed bit by bit yet these tumors are more like cancer cells if you remove it today it s gonna spread to another place tomorrow or even a relapse causing more serious problems this is true of the financial system under web 2 0 it has changed problems such as insufficient liquidity poor transparency lack of risk control system and insufficient product innovation of web 1 0 financial system however have these problems been solved once and for all no except that the web 2 0 risk management system is an upgrade from web 1 0 e g web 2 0 has established a multi dimensional risk regulation system including risk identification assessment early warning regulation and response and appropriately introduced some external partners so as to minimize risks note that web 2 0 has just minimized these risks while opaque and unfair practices such as information opacity market dominance by financial institutions and heavy reliance on centralized institutions persist and even escalate thus came web 3 0 with decentralization at its core the reason why the concept of web 3 0 is gaining traction lies mainly in the current alignment of technology and needs it is driven by people s recognition of the huge economic and social values created by web 1 0 and web 2 0 therefore people are seeking more efficient information transmission methods and expecting more ecological application scenarios in a macro sense web 3 0 will be the underlying network architecture of the much discussed metaverse its application will break the boundaries of the web2 0 ecosystem to the extent that the complexity and combination of applications will be unrestricted thus promoting the convergence of real world and virtual world with the help of distributed technology blockchain countless new applications dapp have emerged from decentralized peer to peer ledger experiments to decentralized smart contract platforms as a result defi has become the digital equivalent of financial services while nft has accelerated the on chain of assets in this context hela defi a new generation of decentralized financial ecosystem platform was born it is a revolutionary financial product built by defi 3 0 dao nft and web3 0 the core logic of hela defi is to initiate the hela fba innovative trading model through the two way collaboration between amm and order book i e an innovative de aggregation order trading mechanism based on the evolution of defi dao innovative finance hela is characterized by community driven development code based completion of token transaction circulation and award distribution through on chain smart contracts and multiple financial incentives therefore hela features asset transparency sustainability and efficiency without the need of trust codes are automatically executed and secure and tokens have a deflationary model web3 0 market value management can be executed automatically hence it is very competitive in the market hela defi a three masted sailing ship on the nile the nile valley is one of the birthplaces of world civilization egypt is the gift of the nile said herodotus an ancient greek historian the nile the world s longest river has made outstanding contributions in the history of scientific development the advent of the three masted sailing ship changed the history of the west lagging behind the east in shipbuilding technology and also changed the role of the west in world trade so why do i say hela defi is a three masted sailing ship on the nile because in the long history of the metaverse what is needed is more like the three masted sailing ship hela defi on the nile one small step for innovation means one giant leap for the metaverse taking liquidity as an example the modern financial transaction system and even the entire monetary system can be said to be constantly evolving and innovating around improving the liquidity of market transactions and decentralized finance is no exception from defi 1 0 to defi 2 0 the amm mechanism proposed by uniswap was the prelude to defi summer while compound and sushiswap introduced liquidity mining incentives for typical defi projects providing liquidity to the early compound and sushiswap motivated by profit users enter the project however with the continuous release of liquidity mining reward tokens the market circulation is increasing according to the supply and demand the price of tokens cannot be maintained at a relatively high level and there will be gradually less apr to reward users at this point profit seeking users are more likely to leave looking for a higher apr defi 2 0 gained more attention in the second half of 2021 as the development of defi entered a fever pitch in essence defi 2 0 still focuses on token liquidity and aims to improve the efficiency of capital utilization however compared with defi 1 0 defi 2 0 focuses more on the sustainability of incentive models better composability and more encrypted native organization and governance structure olympus the algorithmic stablecoin project is one of the innovators behind defi 2 0 olympus opened up the bond market and users could buy ohm platform governance tokens at a lower discount which could not only continue to provide value support for the treasury of olympus and attract more liquidity but also create a win win situation between users and olympus this way of selling bonds did inject liquidity into the early stages of the project but olympus constantly incentivized its users to buy ohm through bonds or dex and pledge ohm for super high yields this model 3 3 fraught with fomo nature is not sustainable the price of tokens drops the yield is down users and projects may suffer huge losses and liquidity has gone users also had to contend with volatile losses in fact ohm s price has fallen more than 90 since november 2021 good token liquidity means that tokens have richer application scenarios and better transaction depth how to improve token liquidity is a very important core issue for the whole crypto hela defi s ingenious dual system pool operating system i e hela fba innovative trading model adds an order book model to amm thus developing a set of innovative trading methods a seemingly small innovation has addressed the problem of fluidity one of the focal points for defi3 0 development the hela fba trading model allows traders to buy or sell assets at current market prices the trade execution model automatically matches system buyers and user sellers within the rules of token swap liquidity and anchors the exchange rate ratio of two capital pools in the on chain data at the time of initiating the transaction as the price for automatic market trading and users have not to choose prices with hela s twin trading engines working in concert the same hela usdt trading pair adopts both amm model and order book model with two system pools once users trade the price changes in the target pool through the free market regulation mechanism the price of the other pool is gradually moving toward the target pool thus reducing the price difference the two trading models are applicable to different user groups and application scenarios and they are automatically adjusted through smart contracts and market behaviors besides the two trading models are synergistic together with the order trading model and incentive mechanism in hela contract thus forming a good closed loop trading ecosystem as assets flow the stablecoin and hela in the hela protocol will form an exchange rate since both buying and selling reduce the circulation of hela tokens through different mechanisms it can be argued that hela is an infinitely deflationary model which enables the market value of hela to show a steady rise the two operating systems work together to improve the liquidity of hela usdt trading pair the higher the liquidity is the smaller the spread is because the depth of supply and demand at each price level will be good the charm of such a disruptive model is enough to attract numerous kols and large communities to join in and continue the promotion cycle for a long time it is worth mentioning that hela ecological protocol has skillfully integrated nft and defi technology and will issue 1 000 original hela nft in limited quantity in accordance with erc721 before the launch of agreed products to serve as the certificate of dividends and interests hela nft users are identified as nodes or core members of the hela ecosystem and will be rewarded with a series of future ecologically exclusive and perpetual dividend benefits including hela defi protocols the limited release of hela nft will perfect the hela protocol ecosystem in addition hela will build a jackpot system based on defi the decentralized capital pool created by hela allocates funds automatically to the bonus pool based on the smart contract and then triggers allocation after each transaction the fund allocation will be automatically transferred to the bonus pools abcd it should be noted that the bonus pool system adopts the automatic codes of smart contracts on the blockchain to complete the drawing and redemption process the whole lucky jackpot is featured by high transparency and fairness hela defi meets the needs of different users through diverse and interesting gameplay such as transaction mode incentive plan and hela lucky as well as hela financial innovation ecosystem composed of automatic execution of smart contracts in particular it avoids the unfair situation of first come first served both regular and new users follow the fair just and open rules the diverse and interesting gameplay is independently implemented and synergistic multiple deflation and backflow make the value of hela stable and expected to show an upward trend according to market conditions just as neil armstrong s small step on the moon was a giant leap for human civilization innovation sometimes requires only a few changes hela defi adds an order book model to the amm model which is also a giant leap for defi 3 0 metaverse and web 3 0 for more news and latest updates please visit hela twitter and telegram

watch tv for less than an hour a day if you want a healthy heart experts also urge viewers to exercise between episodes and ditch the snacks experts analysed health and tv watching habits from 370k brits in 13 year study people watching tv for less than one hour a day had lower risk of heart disease experts advised brits to break up an episode with some exercise or stretching cutting down on tv could prevent 11 per cent of cases of coronary heart disease coronary heart disease kills some 64 000 britons and 360k americans per year breaking the binge watching habit could prevent thousands of people developing heart disease a study claims university of cambridge scientists now advise cutting daily tv time to less than an hour they found adults who sat watching for longer were up to 16 per cent more likely to be struck down with the killer condition calculations showed one in 10 cases could be prevented by people watching less tv but if people can t break their screen addiction the experts advised them to at least get up and move around between episodes to break up inactive periods they should also ditch snacks like crisps and chocolate according to the academics who worked alongside a team at the university of hong kong cambridge experts say up to 11 per cent of coronary heart disease cases could be prevented if people cut their tv watching time to less than an hour stock image coronary artery disease cad clogs up the blood vessels and can lead to angina strokes or heart attacks coronary artery disease occurs when the major blood vessels that supply the heart with oxygen and nutrients become damaged cad affects more than 1 6million men and one million women in the uk and a total of 15million adults in the us it is usually due to plaque and inflammation when plaque builds up it narrows the arteries which decreases blood flow to the heart over time this can cause angina while a complete blockage can result in a heart attack many people have no symptoms at first but as the plaque builds up they may notice chest pains or shortness of breath when exercising or stressed other causes of cad include smoking diabetes and an inactive lifestyle it can be prevented by quitting smoking controlling conditions like diabetes or high blood pressure staying active eating well and managing stress drugs can help to lower cholesterol while aspirin thins the blood to reduce the risk of clots in severe cases stents can be put into the arteries to open them while coronary bypass surgery creates a graft to bypass the blocked arteries using a vessel from another part of the body source mayo clinic advertisement lead researcher dr youngwon kim said all of these measures could help better manage your risk of developing coronary heart disease the most common symptoms of coronary heart disease are chest pain angina and breathlessness it increases the risk of heart attack and stroke coronary artery disease affects more than 1 6million men and one million women in the uk and a total of 15million adults in the us it kills 64 000 britons and 360 900 americans a year in the study published in the journal bmc medicine researchers calculated how 11 per cent of coronary heart disease cases could be prevented if people watched less than an hour of tv each day the experts used health data from 373 026 britons and also looked at their genetic susceptibility to heart disease volunteers were tracked for 13 years they examined the differences between people watching tv and using a computer for leisure by assessing their answers to questionnaires results showed people who watched tv for less than an hour a day were 16 per cent less likely to get coronary heart disease than those who sat watching shows for four hours or more this reduced rate of heart disease was independent of any genetic risk the experts said for those who watched two three hours of tv a day there was a 6 per cent lower risk of developing the condition compared to people watching more than four hours but the study found that spending leisure time in front of a computer did not appear to influence the risk of disease scientists said a reason for this may be because tv viewing tends to occur in the evening following dinner often the largest meal of the day leading to higher levels of fats and cholesterol in the blood other reasons could be that people may also snack more in front of the tv than when using a computer while tv viewing tends to be prolonged and computer users may be more likely to take breaks they said cambridge s dr katrien wijndaele an expert on exercise and health and another author on the study said incorporating breaks into sitting could help people live longer how much exercise you need to stay health the nhs recommends adults aged 19 to 64 should try to be active daily and should do at least 150 minutes of moderate intensity activity brisk walking or riding a bike or a week or 75 minutes of vigorous intensity running or swimming activity a week do strengthening activities that work all the major muscle groups legs hips back abdomen chest shoulders and arms on at least 2 days a week examples include lifting weights or heavy gardening people who have not exercised for some time or have medical conditions are advised to speak to their gp before starting advertisement coronary heart disease is one of the most prominent causes of premature death so finding ways to help people manage their risk through lifestyle modification is important she said she added while the study cannot prove that sitting watching tv increases your risk of coronary heart disease it supported world health organization who guidelines on inactivity the who recommends reducing the amount of sedentary behaviour and replacing it with physical activity of any intensity as a way of keeping healthier she said according to the british heart foundation coronary heart disease is one of the uk s leading causes of death responsible for around 64 000 deaths each year the charity s senior cardiac nurse chloe macarthur said the study s findings should prompt britons to consider taking an exercise break between episodes most of us watch tv sitting down and we know from decades of research that leading a sedentary lifestyle can lead to health problems later in life including an increased risk of coronary heart disease she said while it can be difficult to weave physical activity into our daily routines it only takes 150 minutes of moderate intensity exercise each week to help reduce your risk of developing heart and circulatory diseases she said advertisement when the temptation hits you to watch one more episode try standing up and stretching or go for an evening stroll instead stopping evening snacks and ensuring you eat a healthy balanced diet can also give your heart health a boost

friday may 13 2022 court holds california state law requiring female representation on boards of publicly held companies unconstitutional judge maureen duffy lewis of the los angeles county superior court granted an injunction against enforcement of the california state law requiring female representation on the boards of directors of publicly held companies headquartered in california the decision in crest v padilla ii case no 19 stcv 27561 l a super ct may 13 2022 follows a ruling in april 2022 in a case brought by the same plaintiffs but before a different judge striking down the california law requiring board seats for underrepresented communities see crest v padilla i case no 20 stcv 37513 l a super ct april 1 2022 these rulings exemplify the difficulty legislation faces to force diversity and inclusion through governmental fiat to increase female and minority representation in the governance of public corporations in california the state passed two statutes forcing those companies to place minorities and women on their board of directors first in 2018 then governor jerry brown signed into law sb 826 that law created california corporations code 301 3 requiring corporations to have a minimum number of female directors based on the size of the board of directors and requiring the secretary of state to publish a report denoting which corporations complied with the new law which companies moved their headquarters in or out of california and the identity of corporations that altered their publicly traded status this law also imposed monetary fines on those companies which failed to comply with the minimum representation requirements california subsequently passed ab 979 in 2020 requiring publicly traded corporations with executive offices in california to appoint a minimum number of directors from underrepresented communities underrepresented communities meant individuals who self identified as black african american hispanic latino asian pacific islander native american native hawaiian or alaska native or who self identified as gay lesbian bisexual or transgender ruling that sb 826 violated the equal protection clause of the california constitution judge duffy lewis held the law treated similarly situated individuals in an unequal manner based solely on their gender first judge duffy lewis rejected the state s contention the lawsuit was not ripe since the state had yet to issue any penalties under the statute second judge duffy lewis rejected the state s purported compelling interest of achieving gender equality or parity as justification for state sanctioned gender preference in hiring holding that there is no compelling governmental interest in remedying generalized non specific allegations of discrimination finally judge duffy lewis noted that the law was not narrowly tailored to the state s reported interest to improve opportunities for women in the workplace and boosting california s economy rather she found california s evidence regarding improved corporate governance with female representation was inconclusive that is significant since that is a factual finding which makes reversal on appeal much more difficult for proponents of directed appointment quotas to corporate boards the court s ruling puts into doubt the diversity efforts of the state legislation the state of california has yet to announce whether it intends to appeal judge duffy lewis ruling as well as to whether it intends to appeal the earlier unrelated ruling in the case involving ab 979 requiring quota appointments of underrepresented communities it is also unknown whether california governor gavin newsom will choose instead to amend the laws in league with a supportive state legislature where democrats maintain a super majority status capable of passing statutes over the objections of all republican state legislators for now publicly held companies in california are free from the requirements and monetary fines both state statutes had sought to impose however companies listed on the nasdaq stock market should be aware of its potential reporting obligations as to gender race and sexual orientation representation on their boards of directors pursuant to nasdaq rule 5606 while rule 5606 does not impose any minimum representation requirements it does require public reports the nasdaq rule is also the subject of legal challenge rule 5606 nonetheless remains in effect however pending oral argument in early august before the u s court of appeals for the fifth circuit new orleans on a petition seeking judicial review of the sec s approval of the nasdaq rule
