los angeles president biden laced into oil corporations and shipping conglomerates on friday accusing them of chasing excessive profits instead of lowering prices for consumers adopting a newly aggressive populist tone after he and his administration found themselves battered by another disheartening inflation report later biden linked arms with a slew of foreign leaders as they vowed to make conditions for migrants throughout the americas more safe and humane while stressing his administration s efforts to crack down on the smuggling of those who are coming to the southern u s border in hopes of entering the country biden s events and rhetoric friday during the summit of the americas a semiregular gathering of western hemisphere nations that the united states is hosting this year shifted his focus from an international spat over democracy to vexing domestic issues that have dogged his presidency and helped drive down his approval ratings advertisement friday s event was staged at the port of los angeles allowing biden to highlight his administration s efforts to unclog supply chains that have delayed shipments and slowed the manufacturing of key consumer goods he took an unusually combative tone against corporations especially against oil and shipping companies in an attempt to paint a portrait of corporate greed that was ultimately harming consumers we re going to make sure that everybody knows exxon s profits biden said noting that the massive oil company made more money than god this year he charged that oil companies are not taking full advantage of the leases they have on federal land they have 9 000 permits to drill they re not drilling why aren t they drilling biden asked because they make more money not producing more oil the price goes up number one and number two the reason they re not drilling is they re buying back their own stock which should be taxed quite frankly buying back their own stock and making no new investments advertisement oil companies have strongly denied that their actions are artificially driving up costs for americans saying prices at the pump are driven by sweeping global forces like the war in ukraine and sanctions against russia in washington this week senior white house aides had sat down with chief executives of exxon and chevron the latest in a regular series of meetings in recent months according to a white house official this week s meetings were first reported by cnbc biden also criticized shipping companies suggesting that a virtual oligopoly in the industry had driven up prices for consumers nine major ocean shipping companies dividing themselves into three consortia have contributed to soaring costs of consumers he said calling on congress to crack down on the foreign owned shipping companies that biden said brought in 190 billion in profits last year advertisement every once in a while something you learn makes you viscerally angry like if you had the person in front of you you d want to pop them biden said no i really mean it biden s tone reflected in part a growing frustration within the white house that the administration has been able to do little to slow the rise in the cost of gas food and other goods a trend that risks eclipsing the president s message and badly hurting his party in the november congressional elections behind the scenes several prominent democrats have been pushing to make attacks on the greed of oil and gas companies a centerpiece of the party s message in the hopes of making democrats the party of fighting inflation by the midterms they argue that the issue of gas prices needs to be reframed as a choice between democratic support for proactive measures like suspending the gas tax or prodding oil companies to drill on existing leases and republican opposition to taking action advertisement sen debbie stabenow d mich who runs the democratic policy and communications committee circulated a white paper to her colleagues in the spring titled big oil price gouging americans at the pump with statistics showing the dramatic increase in company profits between the first quarters of 2019 and 2022 share this article share oil and gas companies are padding their profits and hardworking americans are paying the price the document said senate democrats are committed to stopping oil companies from excessively increasing gas prices senate republicans are committed to blocking legislation that would hold oil and gas companies accountable biden s event friday came as new figures released by the bureau of labor statistics showed that inflation reached 8 6 percent last month compared with a year earlier contributing to the fastest hike in prices in the energy housing and food sectors in four decades advertisement the rapid run up in gas prices has become one of the most visceral ways people feel inflation in their daily lives and is emerging as a dominant policy and political problem for the biden white house as of friday morning the national average for a gallon of gas was 4 99 according to aaa in a written statement earlier friday the president acknowledged that inflation was not coming down as shapely and as quickly as we must see as he has many times before biden named russian president vladimir putin and his invasion of ukraine as the prime trigger of rising prices although inflation had started to dog the white house before the february incursion by russia later biden name checked putin three times during his speech at the port of los angeles as he highlighted his administration s work to streamline supply chains and boasted of the improvements to american ports that is included in the bipartisan infrastructure law enacted last november advertisement i m doing everything in my power to blunt putin s price hike and bring down the cost of gas and food biden said standing on the deck of the uss iowa a battleship that has been transformed into a museum biden has said combating inflation is his chief domestic priority this year but his additional focus on migration on the final day of the ninth summit of the americas also highlighted the biden administration s efforts to reduce the number of migrants arriving at the southern border crucially the administration has grappled with how and when to end a trump era policy that has allowed the united states to turn away numerous would be migrants at the u s mexico border under health restrictions related to the pandemic that policy known as title 42 remained in place after a federal judge in a ruling last month blocked the biden administration from lifting it the administration had planned to rescind the controversial policy on may 23 triggering protests from republicans and some democratic lawmakers that the nation could not handle the increase in asylum seekers that would materialize once title 42 was removed advertisement on friday biden sought a more welcoming tone noting that a joint declaration signed by various nations at the americas summit showed that when migrants arrive on their doorstep they can provide a place to stay make sure migrants can see a doctor they can find a place to work at the same time biden underscored his efforts to go after smugglers if you prey on desperate and vulnerable migrants for profit we are coming for you biden said we are coming after you

that this measure sunk to 50 2 in the preliminary june survey the lowest level recorded since the survey began in the 70s it just reinforces the impact the cpi number had on consumer psyche said peter boockvar of bleakley advisory group as reported by cnbc we can guess this is going to have a negative future impact on consumer spending it s a shocking number but this is what inflation does when it s running as hot as it is 12 05pm high inflation low consumer sentiment hit wall street us stocks continued to fall at noon as high inflation and low consumer sentiment have encouraged a sell off at midday the dow had shed 758 points or 2 4 at 31 514 points the s p 500 had dipped 107 points or 2 7 at 3 911 points and the nasdaq had sunk 391 points or 3 3 at 11 363 points following the news this morning that the us headline inflation rate reached a 41 year high in may the university of michigan s latest consumer sentiment index had revealed that this measure sunk to 50 2 in the preliminary june survey the lowest level recorded since the survey began in the 70s consumer sentiment was down 14 from the 58 4 recorded in may falling well below the market expectation of 58 1 ing chief international economist james knightley said the survey results suggest that households are really fearing stagflation the damage was done in the household finances due to the squeeze on spending power from higher inflation just 30 8 of households think income growth will outpace inflation over the next five years he said he noted there was growing pessimism about people s expectations for how comfortable their retirement would be which was presumably reflecting the poor equity market performance in the year to date interestingly the survey suggests people are not especially worried by higher interest rates it is the higher gasoline price story that is doing the real damage knightley said city index and forex com market analyst fawad razaqzada said with consumer sentiment deteriorating and inflation and interest rates on the rise investors were left with little choice but to sell equities and hold cash against such economic indicators there is a risk we will see a sharp rise in interest rate projections from fed officials next week which could hurt risk assets even further razaqzada said keep your belts tightened as volatility is going to remain very high for a

mandalay resources highlights early success of robinson drilling campaign at costerfield operation 9 35am us stocks open lower wall street was a sea of red at the open on friday following the release of the latest us inflation data which showed the cpi in may reached a 41 year high just after the open the dow jones industrial average had shed 503 points at 31 770 points while the s p 500 was down 65 points at 3 953 points and the nasdaq composite dropped 223 points at 11 531 points pantheon macroeconomics chief economist ian shepherdson said the cpi data report killed any last vestiges of hope that the fed could pivot to a 25 basis points interest rate hike in july but we remain hopeful for september on the grounds that the next two core cpi prints will be lower than may s the three jobs reports will show that wage gains continue to moderate and because by the time of the september meeting the housing meltdown will have everyone s attention and continuing to hike by 50 basis points will look gratuitous shepherdson said ing chief international economist james knightley noted that demand continued to outpace the supply capacity of the us economy with supply factors showing little sign of near term improvement the onus is on the fed to dampen the demand side of the equation with ongoing rate hikes he said 8 45am market reacts to hotter than expected inflation data us stock futures plummeted on friday morning after new data from the bureau of labor statistics revealed that the us consumer price index cpi hit a 41 year high in may futures for the dow s p and nasdaq fell 0 7 0 8 and 1 respectively shortly after the release of the data the us cpi in may accelerated to 8 6 amid surging energy and food prices coming in hotter than the 8 3 increase predicted by economists surveyed by the wall street journal it is the highest cpi jump since december of 1981 avatrade chief market analyst naeem aslam said the inflation engine was running steaming hot and there was still plenty more to come traders and investors are concerned as recession odds are only increasing with every day passing aslam said higher inflation has become an emotional matter now for consumers as it has started to seriously erode their disposable income consumers are constantly being pushed into a corner and higher inflation is making them make difficult choices he noted that in terms of gold price action has become more intriguing on one hand gold acts as an inflation hedge but at the same time the main denominator is the dollar index aslam said higher inflation means more hawkish monetary policy by the fed and this is the focus among precious metal traders 6 30am caution the word us markets were expected to open little changed on friday ahead of a key inflation report which will likely show sustained price pressures during the month of may and influence the outcome of the federal reserve s policy meeting next week analysts are expecting the main consumer price index cpi to stabilize around last month s level of 8 3 and core cpi which excludes food and energy prices at 5 9 rising fuel prices and global supply chain disruptions are likely to have kept the cpi reading elevated they said futures for the dow jones industrial average fell 0 2 in pre market trading while those for the broader s p 500 index lost 0 1 and contracts for the nasdaq 100 were up 0 2 us stocks were battered yesterday with the s p 500 losing up to 2 4 as the us 10 year yield consolidated above the 3 05 mark the us dollar index meanwhile climbed above the 103 level swissquote bank senior analyst ipek ozkardeskaya said the highly anticipated inflation report could provide a negative surprise as the positive pressure on food and energy prices and the unexpected uptick in second hand car prices in may meant inflation is unlikely to have eased for a second consecutive month a stronger than expected inflation figure would revive the federal reserve hawks and eventually push the s p 500 below the 4 000 mark before the weekly closing bell a softer inflation read on the other hand would resuscitate hope that inflation has peaked two months ago and the worst is behind she added ozkardeskaya said energy prices will need to soften in order for inflation to continue stabilizing even as us crude topped 123 per barrel this week oil markets probably have more downside risk in the short term with another wave of china slowdown fears capping the upside said jeffrey halley senior market analyst at asia pacific oanda but he added that losses will be limited given the physical

investors are painfully aware of the plunge in stock and bond markets so far in 2022 are federal and state officials aware of the damage that plunging markets will soon do to public budgets and finances tax revenue from capital gains is about to fall off a cliff the monthly treasury statement for april indicates that capital gains tax revenue reached record levels in 2021 the markets are telling us capital gains will plunge dramatically in 2022 if what the treasury statement and the markets are signaling is correct the reversal of fortune for federal tax revenue could be as much as 250 billion in connecticut the relative impact could be even greater because the state is more reliant on individual income taxes from taxpayers who derive much of their income from investment activity while connecticut doesn t have a separate tax on capital gains the gains are subject to the state income tax looking at federal individual income tax data for 2019 the latest year detailed data are available taxpayers nationally reported capital gains of 865 billion or 7 2 of their adjusted gross income while connecticut taxpayers reported 16 billion of capital gains or 8 9 of their adjusted gross income the last time the markets crashed this severely was during the 2007 09 financial crisis when federal capital gains tax revenue plummeted 75 in two years from about 140 billion in 2007 to 35 billion in 2009 in the absence of detailed income tax data for 2021 there is a rough proxy that can give us a picture of where things stand the treasury statement shows federal fiscal year to date individual income tax receipts split between income tax withheld that is taxes on income earned from salaries and wages and other tax payments including taxes on all forms of investment income the latest statement shows a gusher of 776 billion of other income tax revenue for the first seven months of the current federal fiscal year this includes april which is obviously the biggest month of the year for tax filings that s 325 billion more than the next highest seven month federal fiscal year total of 451 billion in 2019 historically the seven month other income figure has averaged a remarkably stable 70 of its full year total apart from the disruption in 2020 21 when the market plunged and recovered but with gains that were mostly short term typically investors don t sell short term positions they wait and hold their gains for at least a year so that they qualify for advantageous long term capital gains tax treatment when sold if the 776 billion in other income turns out to be 70 of the full year figure then we could be looking at a record 1 1 trillion in other income for federal fiscal year 2022 even if receipts trail off in the last five months as the 2022 market plunge takes effect it will still be a record year other income tax receipts include many types of investment income some of which may hold up despite a stock and bond market debacle real estate for example has been very strong it s possible to isolate the capital gains component from overall other income by looking at internal revenue service data capital gains tax revenue averaged about 30 of other individual income tax payments from 2013 19 a period when the capital gains tax rate was consistently about 25 accordingly capital gains tax revenue for 2021 could be as much as 330 billion in turn the collapse from the 2021 peak could be as bad or worse than the 75 plunge in 2008 09 so far this year investors have booked sufficient losses to offset future capital gains for some time to come only net capital gains are taxed two factors could extend and exacerbate a market swoon and plunging capital gains tax revenue first interest rates on bonds in 2008 were much higher than they are now this allowed for a post crash resumption of the decades long bull market in bonds that continued right up to the pandemic substantial capital gains were available in bonds throughout this period after the super low interest rates that prevailed during the pandemic there is nowhere for interest rates to go but up and for bond prices to fall falling bond prices will leave little potential for capital gains on sales second in 2009 inflation wasn t a concern in 2022 it s at a 40 year high the federal reserve is expected to raise interest rates significantly in 2022 and keep them high until the current inflation is tamed this isn t a promising outlook for capital gains nor for the economy while we won t have definitive tax receipts data for some time federal and connecticut officials be warned if you wait for confirmation that a major source of tax revenue has dried up you may have waited too long to begin to make necessary budget adjustments the original version of this column appeared in the wall street journal

sales of graphic novels especially manga have boomed during the pandemic as have their readership in libraries despite lockdowns and supply chain issues comics remains one of the most popular categories in library lending over the past decade but now comics have become the focal point of increasingly strident battles over what material should be carried in school and even public libraries challenges and attempted and actual book removals at libraries across the united states have surged in 2021 the ala s office of intellectual freedom tracked more than 1 500 individual book challenges or removals the most in the 30 years it has been reporting organizations such as moms for liberty claim that award winning books often push racial agendas or are obscene and demand their removal from shelves and reading lists many librarians counter that these concerns arise from the fact the books creators are black or identify as lgbtq or that the titles touch on queer themes maia kobabe s gender queer a memoir about growing up nonbinary was the most banned book of 2021 and continues to be a flashpoint for controversy even acclaimed graphic novels like art spiegelman s maus which won a pulitzer prize and jerry craft s new kid which won the newbery have become targets for removal the challenges have left librarians anxious and intimidated in texas and florida widespread library challenges have become highly politicized with librarians in one texas district being harassed and called groomers heretics and child pornographers on social media the movement to remove books from libraries and schools has affected school board elections and laws are being passed to change library reporting structures resulting in highly confrontational board meetings it s just demoralizing says tina coleman membership specialist for the ala and liaison for ala s graphic novel and comics round table gncrt i ve talked to librarians who have had to deal with the challenges and even if it s a relatively straightforward easy challenge librarians are getting all of this vitriol and being harassed and we have to work under the assumption that this is going to be going on for an extended period of time indeed the challenges show no signs of letting up moms for liberty just released a fourth list of books it wants removed from libraries including classics like the kite runner the perks of being a wallflower and slaughterhouse five coincidentally adapted into a graphic novel in 2020 it s a frightening and exhausting atmosphere for librarians across the country says matthew noe lead collection and knowledge management librarian of harvard medical school s countway library who is wrapping up his second term as president of the gncrt a lot of this stuff is sheer intimidation and it s mind boggling he adds noe feels that while the challenges were mounting all through last year the phenomenon didn t strike a chord in the mainstream news until maus was removed from a school curriculum in tennessee that seemed to be a wake up call for a lot of people initially challenges mostly took place in school libraries where collection guidelines have always been more heavily scrutinized however the drive is moving to public libraries llano tex has become a particularly intense battleground the republican led local government has changed the entire makeup of the board that administers library policies stacking it with politically conservative members some of whom don t have library cards tactics in some locales have escalated from book removal to criminalization a proposed law in indiana could make it a crime for librarians to buy books that are deemed harmful to children and it doesn t distinguish between school or public libraries noe says he notes that academic libraries could eventually be impacted as well as local governments control purchasing for many large research libraries defending our collections graphic novels are easy targets for challenges because there are panels that are easy to pull out and throw around on social media and take out of context noe says it s much easier to flip a comic open and see something that you might object to than it is in a prose novel where you have to sit down and actually read it says robin brenner teen librarian at the public library of brookline mass and president elect of the gncrt such is the case with gender queer a major symbol of the ongoing battle there are only a handful of panels in the 240 page graphic memoir that depict sexual activity but the entire work has been condemned as obscene and pornographic despite having won an alex award and a stonewall award from the ala controversy can move books off shelves in more ways than one maus sales surged to the top of npd bookscan s sales charts after it was banned and gender queer enjoys healthy sales but for oni press which publishes kobabe s book and other educational graphic novels with queer themes it s no solution tara lehmann oni s director of publicity says that selling more copies doesn t fix the intrinsic problem people are trying to police what others read we are against the banning of books of any kind she adds that oni supports schools libraries and organizations as best it can but our main focus is being supportive of maia and making sure we re doing the most we can to ensure gender queer is available to any and all people who want to read it despite the turmoil the gncrt now in its third year continues to move forward developing reading lists and additional resources for librarians who are looking to grow their graphic novels collections and there are hopeful signs of public support an ala poll revealed that seven in 10 voters oppose efforts to remove books from public libraries teen readers in many communities are forming banned book reading clubs and mounting their own protests to keep books on shelves and while the challenges have been making headlines challenged books often remain in collections after going through established procedures for instance a panel designated by the board of education governing an ohio school library voted to keep gender queer on shelves we re all very committed to defending our collections brenner says the things that go viral tend to be the negative things but i know from reading and talking to local folks that there are just as many if not more people coming out on the side of the library to try to stem the tide of challenges ala has launched uniteagainstbookbans a national campaign aiming to empower readers everywhere to push back against censorship twenty five entities including major book publishers such as penguin random house and lerner the authors guild and the comic book legal defense fund cbldf have signed on more directly the gncrt is designing resources to help libraries with procedures and best practices to weather the storm the need for these guidelines emerged as librarians reached out privately looking for help with challenges it became clear that we needed more resources and more guidance specific to comics brenner says the committee has been gathering data via a survey asking for examples of collection development and challenge policies the goal is to create a toolkit that shows how to address challenges in various stages at public educational and academic libraries the committee hopes to have some of its findings ready before this year s annual ala meeting even when there are established guidelines for libraries however organizations like moms for liberty are changing the rules regarding who can deal with challenges which brenner sees as a particularly troubling move i think the hardest part is the realization that you can have all those procedures but it sometimes doesn t matter she says it s a publicity fight now and that s something that libraries aren t necessarily as used to handling legal recourse invoking the first amendment is another way to combat censorship but it s not clear what role the courts will take in a shifting landscape cbldf acting director jeff trexler says court decisions can be unpredictable for years the standard response to attempts at censorship has been to highlight procedural irregularities in school and library decisions to remove books but now we re seeing the use of procedure to exclude he explains in fact procedures are now being rewritten across the country to provide for the immediate removal of books once there s a challenge trexler says the cbldf has been working with the office of intellectual freedom and other anti censorship organizations to develop new legal strategies for responding to bans and restrictive laws one key argument now being deployed is based on civil rights law when books are being removed from curricula or libraries on the basis of their depictions of lgbtqiaa or racial identities there are grounds for finding that the removals constitute illegal discrimination grassroots advocacy is also ascendant among parents who view liberty as free access llano county parents are suing to keep books on shelves claiming the book removals are a coordinated censorship campaign that violates the first amendment and 14th amendment as national midterm elections rev up coleman at the gncrt expresses concern that increased media attention will lead to even more conflict i would love to be proven wrong she adds but she fears that groups issuing challenges are only going to be strengthened by all of the attention being paid the gncrt marches on with so much energy devoted to addressing censorship it s easy to forget that libraries are still slowly emerging from two years of a pandemic that fundamentally changed librarianship and the rest of society but work went on even with libraries closed and gncrt board members proudly point to their ongoing progress in the ambitious slate of goals the organization launched with three years ago we ve been laying the groundwork noe says because we re still a relatively new round table we ve been setting policies and getting things in place for future work in 2021 the gncrt released a well received first adult graphic novel reading list a much needed tool to help librarians build adult collections earlier this year it debuted its first reading list of graphic novels for kids ages five to 12 current gncrt president moni barrette is particularly enthusiastic about the organization s collaboration with ala s black caucus on several reading lists and indicates she hopes to work more closely with other ala affinity groups such as the apala its asian american and pacific islander interest group another long term goal for the gncrt is setting up awards but that ambition remains on the to do list awards are the logical next step but it s a lot to accomplish brenner points out one thing to be decided whether to give out a single award like the newbery or a whole slate like the stonewall book awards presented by rainbow the ala s queer focused round table a select gncrt exploratory committee working on developing a comics librarianship mentoring program has been formed aiming to team would be comics librarians with veterans to grow the subsection of the field another project may be esoteric to nonlibrary workers but is vital behind the scenes an overhaul of comics and graphic novel metadata which helps make comics easier to locate and order noe reports that the metadata and cataloging committee has been finalizing a draft years in the making which is now out for comment an exciting development for those in the library sciences world supply chain problems hit manga the explosion in manga readership has been one of the biggest industry stories of the pandemic but librarians and patrons have been disappointed by interrupted stock as supply chain issues have left random volumes of popular series such as one piece unavailable making it impossible to collect when anime and manga go viral on booktok certain titles become unexpectedly popular brenner often wonders why does everyone want this book right now she says and inevitably it s because of booktok demand from readers for manga remains sky high says jillian rudes a school librarian at the new york city department of education in queens n y as well as japanese culture and manga cooperative collection development librarian for the new york city doe the supply chain is a new challenge and it s almost impossible for me to meet the needs of readers but more students are reading more manga now than ever in my career rudes says during the pandemic kids were watching a lot of anime and they are consuming this culture like crazy but we can t get the books for them digital lending has jumped up to fill the gap with more than 105 000 digital manga circulated in the new york city doe during the 2021 2022 school year rudes even has a hack for getting print copies of out of print manga going to bookstores which sometimes still have them on shelves it s an approach that can call for unorthodox funding methods i ve been telling librarians to write grants fund raise have a book fair ask for money she says you can go to barnes noble and wipe them clean because for some reason they sometimes have shelves full of the books we re looking for rudes along with gncrt member matthew murray has also been producing an ongoing series of webinars to educate libraries about manga so they can be independent collectors he says we ve had 10 webinars so far and each one comes with a resource list the need for education is paramount manga is a huge field and some popular series such as chainsaw man are not intended for younger readers but that may be difficult for novice librarians to determine knowing what is generally appropriate for a teen or children s library is key it s tricky rudes says librarians want to know what to get because they re afraid of what to buy they want a list of safe appropriate manga but what counts as safe and appropriate where you re from new york is one thing and texas is another live and in person live comics and book events are coming back this year with the ala annual meeting taking place in person for the first time since 2019 as in the past there will be an artist alley and multiple programming tracks teenage mutant ninja turtles series cocreator kevin eastman will be a featured speaker and barrette is putting together the president s program panel to kick off her term as president which spotlights a mix of indie publishers new creators people of color and one of our student liaisons who s currently in library school she says it s not just the old guard of the movement this year s comics focused friday forum will be devoted mostly to challenges coleman says it s not even the elephant in the room anymore it s just the topic of conversation not just for the comics librarians for everyone other returning programs include the announcement of the winners of the 2022 will eisner graphic novel grants for libraries also for the first time the gncrt will have a dedicated booth selling merchandise and sharing resources barrette notes that as comics conventions come back they are also bringing back their library programming san diego comic con will be held in person in july with a day of library programming returning whereas the toronto comic arts festival held in june will have its annual library day in virtual format as it did last year i m very grateful that every major convention company is reaching out to librarians putting us on the main schedule and boosting our messaging barrette says that s something that has really moved forward in the last five years local librarians though are still figuring out how to best proceed with in person events libraries launching their own large scale comics events colloquially known as library cons were booming in the before times but are coming back more slowly coleman says given the realities of covid and the spread of new variants being able to do virtual talks to libraries or schools is still important coleman says librarians have really learned the ins and outs of zoom and some have even learned the ins and outs of twitch and discord even with conferences coming back coleman believes some gncrt members would like to eventually see a more focused standalone event bringing together librarians and comics publishers in dialogue about how to more practically work together she says for all the progress being made as librarians gather in 2022 the main topic will undoubtedly remain censorship and challenges coleman is hopeful that librarians are up to the task of uniting readers and standing up for books and the right to read them knowing the librarians whom i work with the members of the roundtable and the people at the ala i trust them implicitly to work on this she says they are up to this fight
uss iowa port of los angeles los angeles california 10 51 a m pdt the president as we used to say in the united states senate i hope you ll excuse a point of personal privilege but i think that sal must be related closely to my good friend from holy rosary high school in claymont mike dicostanzo ph laughter you think i m kidding laughs i m not i tell you what but anyway thank you sal look everybody before i begin i want to say a few words very briefly about the january 6th hearings that were highlighted last night the insurrection on january 6th is one of the darkest chapters in our nation s history a brutal assault on our democracy a brutal attack on law enforcement some losing their lives and we and we heard about it last night again it s important that the american people understand what truly happened and to understand that the same forces that led january 6th remain at work today it s about our democracy itself we have to protect our democracy i know it sounds corny to say it we were all raised in school that democracy every generation has to protect it i have to admit to you i never thought that it was going to be this straightforward a challenge before the rule of law matters in democracies and we re seeing how the battle for the soul of america has been far from won but i know together and i mean this we can unite and defend this nation democrat and republican and allow no one to place a dagger at the throat of our democracy that s what those hearings are all about you re going to hear a lot more i didn t get to watch them last night because i was doing other business but i tell you what there s a lot a lot going on now look to the reason i m here you know thank you sal and thanks to gene and the port of los angeles as well mario thank you for the port of long beach and thank mayor garcetti of los angeles and the mayor of long beach who i suspect is soon going to be the congressman of long beach the way it looks like applause you guys did a heck of a job when i came out here a couple years ago to try to get things moving everybody did management labor the elected leaders as well as at the time we also had governor newsom pushing hard as well look we have two excellent senators dianne feinstein and alex padilla i tell you what alex applause you don t look any worse for the wear man laughter you re looking awful good you re looking awful good and nanette i i think you ve always looked good particularly compared to these guys you know what i mean laughter and me but seriously thank you nanette for the fire you bring you bring some fire to this i really mean it it s in your heart and alan lowenthal has been working on this for a long time alan and i just had a little meeting together we got to change it alan we ve got we can t we can t give up we got to turn this corner and john i can t thank you you re you re the real deal anybody well i won t get into get you in trouble but thanks for sticking up for me and look and we have a labor secretary that i m his translator he s marty walsh from boston pronounced in boston accent laughter and but if you need any the only thing you got to know he always has your back he always has your back i had an uncle who used to say joey you re labor from belt buckle to shoe sole well he s labor from forehead to the tip of his toes he used to run a labor s outf union look folks today i d like to speak about my top economic priority fighting inflation i understand americans are anxious and they re anxious with good reason i was raised in a household when the price of gasoline rose precipitously it was the discussion at the table it made a difference when food prices went up but we ve never seen anything like putin s tax on both food and gas americans should also understand our economy has unique strengths that we can build on the job market is the strongest it s been since world war two notwithstanding the inflation we added another 390 000 jobs last month 8 700 000 new jobs since i took office an all time record never that many jobs in that period of time applause unemployment rate is near historic lows millions of americans are moving up to better jobs and better pay and since i took office families are carrying less debt on average in america they have more savings than they ve had and we re doing it all while cutting the federal deficit by 1 7 trillion this year and 320 billion last applause if i hear one of my maga friends once again talk about debt and deficits i m going to anyway i m going to be good laughter they increased the deficit by 2 trillion bucks anyway that s another story but look this is the largest decline in american history because of the progress america can tackle inflation from a position of strength unlike any other country in the world because every country in the world is getting a big bite and piece of this inflation worse than we are in the vast majority of countries around the world but make no mistake about it i understand inflation is a real challenge to american families today s inflation report confirmed what americans already know putin s price hike is hitting america hard gas prices at the pump energy and food prices account for half of the monthly price increases since may inflation outside of energy and food what the economists call core inflation moderated the last two months not enough but it moderated it s come down and we need it to come down much more quickly my administration is going to continue to do everything we can to lower the prices for the american people and the congress has to act and they have been of late one of the key ways to fight inflation is by lowering the cost of moving goods through the supply chain when i first started talking about the supply chain when i came here well over a year ago the american people understandably wondered supply chain what i mean that s not a usual part of their jargon every day but they understand it fully now they understand it if you can t get the material needed to build a product you re building whether it s an automobile or whatever it is it makes it difficult to be able to move and that s called the supply chain that s why i ve been focused on ports last fall ports around the world were congested due to disruption caused by the pandemic so we brought together port operators shipping companies and labor and to ease the bottlenecks and as a result over the holidays last 97 percent of all the packages were delivered on time and on shelves when you went christmas shopping remember we weren t going to have anything on those shelves you all did it applause no no not a joke you did it on time with minimal delay delivery times were actually quicker than they were before the pandemic and today there are about 40 percent fewer containers clogging the docks on long pe for long periods of time than there were last november this may was the strongest month in the port of los angeles s history the strongest month in its history applause and we re helping fund improvements because of what my friends in the congress have done we passed the we passed the infrastructure bill and we re funding major new initiatives on the docks on dock rail systems the port of long beach move goods more quickly and port electrification so communications near the ports can be and communities can breathe cleaner air because they re using electric machines that are not generating using gas coal et cetera and we re continuing to expand capacity of our ports thanks to the bipartisan infrastructure law look this is a time we took a different approach also to trucking remember last december we brought together industry and labor to tackle problems facing truck drivers it took the double we had to double the number of commercial driver licenses being issued by the states in order to speed things up we did it we sped the creation and registration of apprenticeships allowing aspiring drivers to earn while they were learning the result we hit a record setting employment in trucking earlier this year and truckers wages went up even after accounting for inflation we re going to keep at it with a new super chain envoy general steve lyons general lyons is a four star general he handled the transportation of a little bit of a thing he had transportation command only tens of millions of billions of tons of things to move from little things like tanks and aircraft and all of that but all kidding aside he s come off the sidelines he s retired he s helped us identify and get ahead of the challenges that raise that that arise at our ports our railroads and on the road this is about reducing costs for families you know i have to admit to you a lot of us elected officials have been in office for a while every once in a while something you learn makes you viscerally angry like if you had the person in front of you you d want to pop them no i really mean it there are nine nine major ocean line shipping companies that ship from asia to the united states nine they form three consortia these companies have raised their prices by as much as 1 000 percent so everything coming from asia they they get 90 some percent of it the stuff coming from asia they ve raised it by 1 000 percent that s why i called on congress to crack down on and they re foreign owned foreign owned shipping companies that raise their prices while raking in just last year 190 billion in profit a seven fold increase in one year seven fold increase 190 billion the senate passed legislation i m hopeful the house is going to act soon to crack down on these companies as i ve asked and lower the cost and i m grateful to two californians speaker pelosi and john garamendi for for leading this effort thanks john i really mean it it s a big deal people at home trying to make it you know paycheck to paycheck are wondering well like what in god s name do nine understandably would nine shipping companies have to do with it well almost everything you re doing everything from what you re eating to what you re having to drive to what you re with what you need in your home is related to supply chains and what s coming from abroad i m doing everything in my power to blunt putin s price hike and bring down the cost of gas and food i led the world to coordinate the largest release of global oil reserves in history 240 million barrels to boost supply to keep prices from rising even more thanks to america s leadership and diplomacy we ve helped europe reduce its reliance on russian oil by tripling our natural gas systems to europe compared to last year and i m working closely with our european partners to get 20 million tons of grain locked in ukraine already in their silos now ukraine and russia the two major suppliers of grain and corn they have 20 million barrels i mean 20 million in in their in their silos right now so we re trying to help them to get that and the russians are blocking the export they re not allowed out through the black sea and we re trying to figure out how to get it out of the country to get he to around the world it will bring down prices but there s more there s more than one way to solve this problem we re continuing working to bring down food prices and gas prices to save families mother money by dealing with other items my dad used to say it s all about the standard of living how much you have left in the paycheck at the end of the month how much is left to do the basic things so if you add up all the things that people need just to do their to do everything from take care of their kids to turn the heat on or the air conditioning on and everything in between there s a lot of ways we can reduce their cost their cost of living other than if we while we re trying to get at at the grain and and gas we laid out a plan for example lower prescription drug costs that would fundamentally affect the wellbeing of every family those of you who know somebody who has type 2 diabetes and has in has an insulin requirement monthly you know it costs an average of 647 a month it can cost as high as 1 000 in some place you know how much it costs to make that one little vial of insulin ten dollars t e n ten dollars no new research has been done since that was was invented and the charging is outrageous so i think we should be able to have the medicare do what they do when they deal with the va the va says we re only going to pay you so much for this if you don t want to and because they medicare negotiates the price for them well if medicare is able to negotiate the price on insulin guess what it comes down a whole hell of a lot outrageous numbers so we could put a cap on insulin at 35 a month and they ll still make a significant profit ten bucks to manufacture thirty five bucks for example we can begin by lowering the cost of high speed internet because of what y all did dealing with the with the infrastructure bill working with the service providers we cut the price and rise raised the speed potentially lowering high speed internet bills on average for an average family 30 a month okay well you made you re paying an extra more than 30 a month for your gas but that still increases the money out of pocket decreases the amount you have to put out the point is we re doing everything in our power to lower costs to families but congressional republicans led by senator rick scott have a different approach and if you didn t write it down you d think i was making it up and i mean it sincerely rick scott tried to change his words yesterday by the way after he introduced this legis he d been campaigning he s the guy that had the recon the re election of the senators for on the republican side he realized that raising taxes on working families is a little unpopular he said everybody no matter what their station if they don t if they re on welfare should have pay a tax everybody should pay a tax well but here s the truth one concrete plan that they laid out was going to raise taxes on working families an average of 1 500 a month while we have 54 corporations out there who didn t pay any tax for the last two years and made 40 billion they don t want to tax them at all they don t want to tax billionaires who are literally paying a lower tax rate than longshoremen are paying literally on a percentage basis so he hasn t walked back from his plans on healthcare he says what we have to do now that we finally got the affordable care act functioning and the price is down an average of 400 bucks for people he wants to eliminate it again we re back at want to eliminate it again so and by the way the one that s the best thing that the republicans are pushing now in the re election is that they think that medicare i m not making this up go online and look medicare social security and medicare medicaid go on the chopping block every five years what that means is at the end of five years they go out of existence unless they re affirmatively voted back into existence every five years medicare social security medicaid and they forget people paid for their social security they paid for it and you know what s going to happen people will say well they ll never eliminate it all but they ll what they ll do they ll be able to pick it apart they ll be able to cut it back that s the whole objective and folks you know it s not right it s simply not right and i disagree and that s what look this is not your father s republican party this is a different deal it really is i ve worked with a lot of honorable republicans very conservative republicans over the years when i was a senator but this is the maga gang this is the maga crowd i really mean it they have a fundamentally different view of the role of government and who should pay what and i m going to work with anyone democrat republican or independent to deliver real solutions for families look because of the strong foundation we built we re better positioned than just about any country in the world to overcome global the global inflation we re seeing and to take the next step towards forming a historic recovery and a new moment and i count recovery as going from where we are today in terms of the economy to stability to make it stable it is strong as can be but for inflation but for gas and food and look we have to keep go we have to keep coming together to find common ground to solve problems like we ve done in ports and in trucking we continue to build the extraordinary progress we ve made so we got to continue building this economy from the bottom up and the middle out and i mean that literally i am so sick and tired of trickle down economics it does not work when the middle class is doing well and they do well because of labor when the middle class is doing well the poor have a way up and the wealthy do very very well they have never been hurt when the middle class is doing well never never so it s about time we start to regather and remember who we are and get a lot of this done but there s no better place to starting it than right here in the port and letting those nine foreign shippers understand the rip off is over thank you applause thanks all right q are you going to go after exxon s profits sir exxon s profits are you going to are you going to go after them the president we re going to make sure that everybody knows exxon s profits why don t you tell them what exxon s profits were this year this quarter exxon made more money than god this year and by the way nothing has changed and they re not by the way one thing i want to say about the oil companies they talk about how we have they have 9 000 permits to drill they re not drilling why aren t they drilling because they make more money not producing more oil the price goes up number one and number two the reason they re not drilling is they re buying back their own stock which should be taxed quite frankly buying back their own stock and making no new investments so i i always thought republicans are for investment exxon start investing start paying your taxes thanks 11 11 a m pdt

in late may as president biden was wrapping up his visit to asia china s foreign minister wang yi launched a 10 day tour of the pacific islands almost immediately news broke that wang had unexpectedly proposed a sweeping multilateral agreement to deepen beijing s security and economic ties with the region then quickly withdrew it due to lack of support from the pacific island countries this followed a controversial solomon islands china security pact signed in april that set off alarm bells in the united states and australia over china s efforts to establish a security presence in the pacific islands region amid a raft of asia centered u s diplomatic initiatives in recent months wang s lengthy visit represents beijing s determination to increase its influence and counter the biden administration s efforts in the indo pacific region wang visited eight countries the solomon islands kiribati samoa fiji tonga vanuatu papua new guinea and timor leste held virtual meetings with three additional nations cook islands niue and the federated states of micronesia and hosted the second round of the china pacific island countries foreign ministers meeting in fiji wang s withdrawal of the proposed agreement and several pacific island countries tepid response to it dominated headlines during wang s trip but the visit illuminated four other key developments that will shape china s future engagement and influence in the region 1 wang s trip did not accomplish all of china s goals but beijing remains committed to expanding its influence in the pacific islands although the initial proposal stalled beijing made clear that it still hopes to reach agreement on the common development vision and five year action plan as the parties build more consensus before wang s trip began china s foreign ministry published a factsheet to highlight ongoing cooperation between china and the pacific island countries and once the proposed plan was withdrawn china quickly issued a position paper on mutual respect and common development with pacific island countries which offers 15 visions and proposals for deepening china s engagement in the region notably this paper focuses largely on political and economic issues with only brief mention of the security issues that had sparked the most controversy wang s trip succeeded in strengthening many of china s direct state to state relationships across the pacific as evidenced by the signing of 52 bilateral agreements at every opportunity wang stressed china s commitment to the pacific islands region and beijing s intent to remain engaged over the long term secretary general of the chinese communist party xi jinping also pledged china s continued support in his written remarks at the china pacific island countries foreign ministers meeting which wang attended in fiji chinese state media reported that xi s address offered assurances that china will always be a good friend brother and partner of pacific island countries sharing common goals and standing together with them despite changes in the international landscape china sees both symbolic and strategic benefits to strengthening its relationships with pacific island countries beijing wants to increase its presence in the region to ensure the united states does not establish unchallenged influence and to frustrate u s military power projection in a potential conflict over taiwan economically beijing seeks access to the region s fisheries and other maritime resources as well as its trade and shipping routes the region also offers china diplomatic leverage stronger relations in the pacific help beijing further isolate taiwan gain votes of support in the united nations advance its belt and road initiative and enhance its image as a reliable partner and viable alternative to other major powers in the region 2 many pacific island countries remain wary of china s intentions especially related to security issues wang s first stop was in the solomon islands which was still reeling from the bilateral security agreement signed on april 1 prime minister sogavare s support for beijing remains controversial and his critics worry that china is now in a position to prop up an unpopular regime and undermine the democratic process in the name of maintaining social order opposition leader matthew wale observed it s clear to me that the vast majority of ordinary solomon islanders do not want a base here or even this deal a majority do not want china here at all in the first place beijing also encountered other stumbling blocks along the way just before wang arrived in fiji fijian president frank bainimarama announced that his country would become a founding member of the u s led indo pacific economic framework which china opposes in kiribati domestic public opinion remains wary of closer ties with beijing following rumors last year that china planned to upgrade a world war ii airstrip in the country which would damage the country s already strained fish stocks there the opposition leader warned our democratic system in fact our very sovereignty is under attack and we need support to ensure our survival as a democratic nation the president of the federated states of micronesia david panuelo offered the most vocal opposition to china s proposed regional plan calling china s plan the single most game changing proposed agreement in the pacific in any of our lifetimes panuelo implored his fellow pacific island leaders to reject the offer he further predicted that the proposal would draw the region very close into beijing s orbit intrinsically tying the whole of our economies and societies to and warned that chinese control over our communications infrastructure our ocean territory and the resources within them and our security space aside from impacts on our sovereignty increases the chances of china getting into conflict with australia japan the united states and new zealand throughout the tour local populations expressed frustration with the lack of transparency around the visits in many places china restricted the number of foreign journalists allowed at the press conferences and prohibited them from directing any questions to wang the media association of the solomon islands went so far as to issue a boycott notice to its members urging them to skip the press event to protest the restrictions china had placed on local reporters 3 china s aggressive moves likely inspired the united states australia and new zealand to expedite and strengthen their outreach to the region and to better coordinate their engagement the united states february 2022 indo pacific strategy emphasizes the importance of the pacific islands to the united states and the biden administration has taken several steps to deepen u s engagement in the region including at the presidential and secretary of state levels with more high level outreach expected in the months ahead the newly elected australian government also took immediate steps to reinforce canberra s commitment to its pacific island neighbors through high level visits and a neighborhood first policy as wang weaved his way through the region australian foreign minister penny wong conducted her own visits to fiji samoa and tonga and on may 31 new zealand prime minister jacinda ardern and president biden issued a joint statement that highlighted their shared commitment to the pacific islands note with concern the security agreement that china and the solomon islands signed on april 1 and warned against the establishment of a persistent military presence in the pacific by a state that does not share our values or security interest the pacific island countries want closer and sustained ties with the united states australia and new zealand but they want those relationships to focus on the needs and priorities of the countries in the region not on countering china all three countries had already taken steps to reenergize their engagement in the region but china s ambitious push has emphasized the need to better coordinate their efforts in the weeks and months ahead 4 although the region refused to be rushed into a multilateral deal pacific island countries are still very open to china s engagement but on their terms the pacific island countries did not embrace china s proposed common development vision and action plan but neither did they definitively reject it rather they said they needed more time to consider it and wanted to discuss it as a group at the pacific islands forum pif in july we have not made a decision as we did not have enough time to look at it samoa s prime minister explained however it is unclear that even after a deeper look the pacific island nations will accept china s proposal the pif prefers making decisions deliberatively and based on consensus which could spell trouble for china s plan australia and new zealand are members of the pif as are the republic of the marshall islands palau tuvalu and nauru all of whom have formal diplomatic ties with taiwan instead of beijing and they may not be supportive of the agreement but pacific island countries remain very open to stronger bilateral ties with china especially in the economic realm china has the immediate appeal of being able to bring much needed investment infrastructure trade and covid related assistance as these countries all contend with headwinds from a weakening global economy and try to recover from the pandemic s many negative impacts with china the united states australia new zealand and others all seeking to increase their engagement the pacific island countries have more options and more negotiating power to press for arrangements that best address their needs in a 2019 speech examining china s increased engagement in the region then secretary general of the pacific islands forum dame meg taylor rejected the notion that states should choose sides between the united states and its allies and partners and china instead she noted that in general forum members view china s increased actions in the region as a positive development one that offers greater options for financing and development opportunities both directly in partnership with china and indirectly through the increased competition in our region ultimately pacific island countries want to know that the powers vying for their attention and offering cooperation understand their concerns and are willing to help them address the issues that are most important for their own populations as fiji s bainimarama put it geopolitical point scoring means less than little to anyone whose community is slipping beneath the rising seas whose job is being lost to the pandemic or whose family is impacted by the rapid rise in the price of commodities and just in case the foreign officials jet setting around the region hadn t heard the message loud and clear he reiterated our greatest concern isn t geopolitics it s climate change
a bill that passed the assembly would create a community campus on prison grounds where inmates cook their own food and secure jobs before their release california usa this story was originally published by calmatters california has a recidivism problem two thirds of people incarcerated in the state will return to prison within three years either through new offenses or parole violations according to california department of corrections and rehabilitation data in norway by contrast recidivism is down from 60 70 in the 1980s to about 20 today the country credits the change to reforms that prioritize rehabilitation over punishment and to its guiding question on prison policy when prisoners are released what kind of neighbor does society want them to be prisons in norway and parts of western europe deemphasize the institutional aspects of incarcerated life prisoners get to wear their own clothes cook their own food and have relative freedom of movement within the prison walls democratic assemblymember carlos villapudua of stockton read about the norwegian model last year and offered up a scaled down version this year for california the bill ab 2730 passed unanimously and now heads to the senate with the support of both prison reform advocates and the union representing prison guards the idea is that prisoners with two years or less left on their sentences would be chosen by the warden and moved into a campus on prison grounds where they would cook their own food do their own laundry and make their own beds and most importantly to villapudua they would get job training in areas that need more workers for villapudua s district that means training truck drivers to combat a shortage of truckers willing to take on long haul routes for some inmates that means getting a class a driver s license to drive big rigs before they are released that way by the time they get out they already have their class a license and they know who their bosses are villapudua said that s how much a desperate need this field has their first week maybe even before they get out they may have a paycheck because trucking companies now have signing bonuses villapudua said he s helped four formerly incarcerated people get class a licenses and connected them with employers for jobs he said pay more than 80 000 but the process he said is backward instead of waiting for people to be released facing their first days outside a prison trying to find employment villapudua said it makes more sense to use their last two years inside for job training the idea of a more communal model for u s prisons has started to take hold in several states part of a long running effort by the california based prison law project to fly legislators to norway where they can see the model firsthand in north dakota about a dozen incarcerated people live in a trailer called the transitional housing unit living in their own rooms with locking doors in connecticut they re able to take a manufacturing course at a local community college in idaho the marshall project reported a prisoner a guard and their families went fishing together can we snap our fingers and turn california prisons into norway no said sharon dolovich director of the ucla prison law and policy program but this is an urgently needed step to transform the experience of incarceration into what it s actually supposed to represent despite norway s success around recidivism the prison system there came to international attention in the last decade for a different reason anders breivik the man who killed 77 people in bomb and gun attacks in 2011 alleged in a 2016 lawsuit that he was being mistreated that s when most people learned about his accommodations three separate cells access to video games and the freedom to cook his own food according to the bbc he built a gingerbread house as part of a prison competition that s not quite what villapudua said he envisions in california people always think reform is a bad word villapudua said the key is to separate folks who know they made a mistake and know they re going to be normal citizens again not being in there faking it if you fake it you go back to general population the bill passed unanimously in the assembly public safety and appropriations committees and again on the assembly floor in may it doesn t come with money attached so if passed and signed by the governor the california prison system would have to pay for it within its own budget which is 14 2 billion in 2022 2023 no specific conviction would disqualify inmates from participation something dolovich said is an important aspect of the bill that allows for a much wider spectrum of inmates to participate villapudua said he deliberately left the program open to everyone not just the non non nons a colloquial phrase indicating inmate with sentences that are non violent non serious and non sexual everybody s so ready to exclude the very people we re trying to help dolovich said who are these elusive non non nons not all the details are hammered out villapudua said and questions remain would inmates leave the prison to work in the outside world can they get jobs as dockworkers at ports which require background checks in a letter of support to the legislature california correctional peace officers association lobbyist matthew easley wrote that the bill would be an improvement over vocational programs offered today in his letter he derided existing programs as often having no correlation to the needs of the communities to which inmates will be released and failing to prepare them for employment and he said the community setting would help prisoners who want rehabilitation by separating them from prisoners who don t even with the appropriate motivations and intentions the pressures found from fellow inmates can be too great to keep to the straight and narrow easley wrote on may 23 prison politics can often be inescapable when programs and housing are delivered in the same environment as those who have no intention of improving themselves calmatters org is a nonprofit nonpartisan media venture explaining california policies and politics
new york wall street s realization that inflation got worse last month not better as hoped sent markets reeling on friday the s p 500 sank 2 9 to lock in its ninth losing week in the last 10 and tumbling bond prices sent treasury yields to their highest levels in years the dow jones industrial average lost 2 7 and the nasdaq composite dropped 3 5 wall street came into friday hoping a highly anticipated report would show the worst inflation in generations slowed a touch last month and passed its peak instead the u s government said inflation accelerated to 8 6 in may from 8 3 a month before the federal reserve has begun raising interest rates and making other moves in order to slow the economy in hopes of forcing down inflation wall street took friday s reading to mean the fed s foot will remain firmly on the brake for the economy dashing hopes that it may ease up later this year inflation is hot hot hot said brian jacobsen senior investment strategist at allspring global investments basically everything was up a person shops in a supermarket as inflation affected consumer prices in manhattan new york city june 10 2022 the growing expectation is for the fed to raise its key short term interest rate by half a percentage point at each of its next three meetings beginning next week that third one in september had been up for debate among investors in recent weeks only once since 2000 has the fed raised rates that much no relief is in sight but a lot can change between now and september jacobsen said nobody knows what the fed will do in a few months including the fed the nation s high inflation plus the expectations for an aggressive fed have sent the two year treasury yield to its highest level since 2008 and the s p 500 down 18 7 from its record set in early january the worst pain has hit high growth technology stocks cryptocurrencies and other particularly big winners of the pandemic s earlier days but the damage is broadening as retailers and others are warning about upcoming profits the s p 500 fell 116 96 points to 3 900 86 combined with its losses from thursday when investors were rushing to lock in final trades before the inflation report it was the worst two day stretch for wall street s benchmark in nearly two years the dow lost 880 00 points to 31 392 79 and the nasdaq tumbled 414 20 to 11 340 02 stock prices rise and fall on two things essentially how much cash a company produces and how much an investor is willing to pay for it the fed s moves on interest rates heavily influence that second part since early in the pandemic record low interest rates engineered by the fed and other central banks helped keep investment prices high now easy mode for investors is abruptly and forcefully being switched off not only that too aggressive rate hikes by the fed could ultimately force the economy into a recession higher interest rates make borrowing more expensive which drags on spending and investments by households and companies gasoline prices are shown at a gas station in salt lake city june 9 2022 one of the fears among investors is that food and fuel costs may keep surging regardless of how aggressively the fed moves the fact is that the fed has very little ability to control food prices rick rieder blackrock s chief investment officer of global fixed income said in a statement he pointed instead to mismatches in supplies and demand higher costs for energy and wages and the crisis in ukraine which is a major breadbasket for the world that raises the threat that central banks will overly tighten the brakes on the economy as they push against a string and essentially fall into a damaging policy mistake rieder said the economy has already shown some mixed signals and a report on friday indicated consumer sentiment is worsening more than economists expected much of the souring in the university of michigan s preliminary reading was because of higher gasoline prices that adds to several recent profit warnings from retailers indicating u s shoppers are slowing or at least changing their spending because of inflation such spending is the heart of the u s economy
washington ap the prices of gas food and most other goods and services jumped in may raising inflation to a new four decade high and giving american households no respite from rising costs consumer prices surged 8 6 last month from a year earlier faster than april s year over year increase of 8 3 the labor department said friday the new inflation figure the highest since 1981 will heighten pressure on the federal reserve to continue raising interest rates aggressively on a month to month basis prices jumped 1 from april to may much faster than the 0 3 increase from march to april contributing to that surge were much higher prices for everything from airline tickets to restaurant meals to new and used cars those price spikes also elevated so called core inflation a measure that excludes volatile food and energy prices in may core prices jumped a sharp 0 6 for a second straight month they re now 6 above where they were a year ago friday s report underscored fears that inflation is spreading well beyond energy and goods whose prices are being driven up by clogged supply chains and russia s invasion of ukraine it also sent stock prices tumbling the increased pressure on the fed to raise rates even faster which means higher cost loans for consumers and businesses will raise the risk of a recession too virtually every sector has higher than normal inflation said ethan harris head of global economic research at bank of america it s made its way into every nook and cranny of the economy that s the thing that makes it concerning because it means it s likely to persist gas prices rose 4 just in may and have soared nearly 50 in one year the national average price at the pump reached 4 99 friday according to aaa edging closer to an inflation adjusted record high of 5 40 the cost of groceries surged nearly 12 last month from a year earlier the biggest such increase since 1979 rising prices for grain and fertilizer after russia s war against ukraine is intensifying that rise restaurant prices jumped 7 4 in the past year the largest 12 month gain since 1981 reflecting higher costs for food and workers employers face immense pressure to raise pay in a job market that remains robust with low unemployment few layoffs and near record job openings but while average wages are rising at their fastest pace in decades they aren t increasing fast enough for most workers to keep pace with inflation many households accumulated savings from government stimulus aid during the pandemic and are now having to draw on those savings to pay bills housing costs are still climbing the government s shelter index which includes rents hotel rates and a measure of what it costs to own a home increased 5 5 in the past year the most since 1991 airline fares are up nearly 38 in the past year the sharpest such rise since 1980 rampant inflation is imposing severe pressures on families lower income and black and hispanic americans in particular are struggling because on average a larger proportion of their income is consumed by necessities in light of friday s inflation reading the fed is all but certain to implement the fastest series of interest rate hikes in three decades by sharply raising borrowing costs the fed hopes to cool spending and growth enough to curb inflation without tipping the economy into a recession it will be a difficult balancing act the fed has signaled that it will raise its key short term rate by a half point double the size of the usual hike next week and again in july some investors had hoped the fed would then slow its rate increases to a quarter point hike when it meets in september or perhaps even pause its credit tightening but with inflation raging hot investors now foresee yet another half point hike in september which would be the fourth since april surveys show that americans see high inflation as the nation s top problem and most disapprove of president joe biden s handling of the economy congressional republicans are hammering democrats on the issue in the run up to midterm elections this fall on friday biden responded to the latest figures in a speech at the port of los angeles which is now moving a record amount of cargo under an agreement the white house has shepherded yet even as the number of ships waiting to unload at the port has dropped sharply inflation has not my administration the president said is going to continue to do everything we can to lower the prices to the american people surging prices have forced rocky harper of tucson arizona to start doing gig work for delivery companies on top of his regular full time job with a package delivery service his main job pays 800 a week he said which used to be really good money and is now just above dirt poor harper 44 said he and his fiancée are delaying marriage because they can t afford it right now they ve cut off netflix and hulu his car s catalytic converter was stolen recently an increasingly common

it together a report from the world bank this week made clear that high inflation is a global problem that threatens to slow economies around the world for the 19 countries that use the euro currency inflation fueled by rising food and fuel prices hit a record 8 1 last month leading the european central bank to announce that it will raise interest rates for the first time in 11 years starting in july and again in september in the coming months prices in the united states may ease somewhat some large retailers including target walmart and macy s are now stuck with too much of the patio furniture electronics and other goods that suddenly are no longer in demand target said it s cutting prices due to mounds of unsold inventory though americans have soured on the economy they have largely kept up their spending they are increasingly turning to credit cards with total card debt rising sharply in april the fed reported though such debt has only barely surpassed pre pandemic levels how long these trends higher wages extra savings and rising card debt enable americans to keep spending will help determine whether a recession can be avoided to cool inflation spending growth must be slowed for lower income americans there are signs it s already slowing sales are weakening at retailers that cater to budget conscious shoppers like dollar stores walmart said customers are shifting down to cheaper items research by the bank of america institute which uses anonymous data from millions of their customers credit and debit card accounts shows gasoline eating up a larger share of budgets for lower income households defined as those with incomes below 50 000 spending on gas reached nearly 10 of all spending on credit and debit cards in the last week of may the institute said that s up from about 7 5 in february a steep increase in such a short period many small businesses are still struggling to keep up with rising costs for supplies and labor a sign that price hikes will continue andrew mcdowell the founder of with love market cafe in los angeles said he s paying more for food supplies workers and reusable bags which used to cost him 23 cents but now cost 45 cents the company s chicken blt now costs 20 more than it did before the pandemic mcdowell said he s grappling with the highest prices for supplies and workers he s ever faced he thinks he may

vol 46 no 23 friday june 10 2022 stocks dive to another losing week as inflation worsens print front page email this story you have entered an invalid email address to required from required message you have entered an invalid email address from email required message required new york ap wall street s shuddering realization that inflation got worse last month not better as hoped sent markets reeling on friday the s p 500 sank 2 9 to lock in its ninth losing week in the last 10 and tumbling bond prices sent treasury yields to their highest levels in years the dow jones industrial average lost 2 7 and the nasdaq composite dropped 3 5 wall street came into friday hoping a highly anticipated report would show the worst inflation in generations slowed a touch last month and passed its peak instead the u s government said inflation accelerated to 8 6 in may from 8 3 a month before the federal reserve has already begun raising interest rates and making other moves in order to slow the economy in hopes of forcing down inflation wall street took friday s reading to mean the fed s foot will remain firmly on the brake for the economy dashing hopes that it may ease up later this year inflation is hot hot hot said brian jacobsen senior investment strategist at allspring global investments basically everything was up the growing expectation is for the fed to raise its key short term interest rate by half a percentage point at each of its next three meetings beginning next week that third one in september had been up for debate among investors in recent weeks only once since 2000 has the fed raised rates by that much last month no relief is in sight but a lot can change between now and september jacobsen said nobody knows what the fed will do in a few months including the fed the nation s high inflation plus the expectations for an aggressive fed have sent the two year treasury yield to its highest level since 2008 and the s p 500 down 18 7 from its record set in early january the worst pain has hit high growth technology stocks cryptocurrencies and other particularly big winners of the pandemic s earlier days but the damage is broadening out as retailers and others are warning about upcoming profits the s p 500 fell 116 96 points to 3 900 86 combined with its losses from thursday when investors were rushing to lock in final trades before the inflation report it was the worst two day stretch for wall street s benchmark in nearly two years the dow lost 880 00 points to 31 392 79 and the nasdaq tumbled 414 20 to 11 340 02 stock prices rise and fall on two things essentially how much cash a company produces and how much an investor is willing to pay for it the fed s moves on interest rates heavily influence that second part since early in the pandemic record low interest rates engineered by the fed and other central banks helped keep investment prices high now easy mode for investors is abruptly and forcefully getting switched off not only that too aggressive rate hikes by the fed could ultimately force the economy into a recession higher interest rates make borrowing more expensive which drags on spending and investments by households and companies one of the fears among investors is that food and fuel costs may keep surging regardless of how aggressively the fed moves the fact is that the fed has very little ability to control food prices rick rieder blackrock s chief investment officer of global fixed income said in a statement he pointed instead to mismatches in supplies and demand higher costs for energy and wages and the crisis in ukraine which is a major breadbasket for the world that raises the threat that central banks will overly tighten the brakes on the economy as they push against a string and essentially fall into a damaging policy mistake rieder said the economy has already shown some mixed signals and a report on friday indicated consumer sentiment is worsening more than economists expected much of the souring in the university of michigan s preliminary reading was due to higher gasoline prices that adds to several recent profit warnings from retailers indicating u s shoppers are slowing or at least changing their spending because of inflation such spending is the heart of the u s economy the two year treasury yield zoomed to 3 05 following the inflation report from 2 83 late thursday a big move for the bond market during the day it touched its highest level since george w bush s presidency according to data from tradeweb the 10 year yield was also up but not quite as dramatically as the two year yield which is more influenced by expectations for fed movements the 10 year yield climbed to 3 15 from 3 04 and touched its highest level since 2018 the narrowing gap between those two yields is a signal that investors in the bond market are more concerned about economic growth usually the gap is wide with 10 year yields higher because they require investors lock away their dollars for longer a two year yield higher than the 10 year yield would be a signal to some investors that a recession may hit in a year or two this market is to some degree in this no man s land where you don t have a really good definite signal that says get constructive and buy the market but you don t have solid information about a recession being more likely in order to get more defensive said jason pride chief investment officer of private wealth at glenmede friday s losses were widespread for the s p 500 with more than 90 of stocks in the index dropping big tech stocks were some of the the heaviest weights amid broad losses for the biggest winners of the prior ultralow rate era microsoft fell 4 5 amazon dropped 5 6 and nvidia sank 6 companies that depend on strong spending from consumers were also particularly weak following the reading on consumer sentiment caesars entertainment fell 9 3 and cruise operator royal caribbean dropped 7 3 stocks fell in europe for a second day after the european central bank said it would raise interest rates for the first time in more than a decade to combat inflation ___ ap business writer elaine kurtenbach contributed

silver is a commodity that has seen massive growth over the years combining this growth with the stability and safety the commodity offers investors you see why there is a huge amount of interest and attention given to it this interest comes with curiosity curiosity is followed by research and misinformation awaits anyone that engages in this research what are the misinformed myths about silver that you are sure to meet along the lines of research this article exposes the popular myths as we provide truthful information around the following aspects the relation between interest rates and silver prices the better long term option between silver bullion and silver stocks and silver market manipulation and depletion among others let s get right in rising interest rates have negative effects on the price of silver to set it straight rising interest rates don t have an inevitable negative effect on the price of silver the price of silver could increase alongside rising interest rates and this played out in the late 1970s however there is a catch to debunking this myth when talking about interest rates and silver prices we take inflation into account the relationship between interest rates and inflation determines whether silver prices increase or decrease this relationship is split into two positive real interest and negative real interest negative real interest is when interest rates stay below inflation rates even when interest rates increase as long as they stay below inflation rates the price of silver is not affected if inflation rates increase while interest rates also increase then the price of silver is also expected to increase the price of silver is only negatively affected when there is positive real interest this means that the price of silver only falls when interest rates are above inflation rates silver stocks give you three times more than silver bullion this myth is either true or false depending on the type of trader or investor you are generally for long term investors looking to deal in silver through etfs or cfd trading you get a lower roi than holding silver bullion why is this the value of silver etfs depends on the demand for silver bullion as it relates to the company you invest in cfd trading comes with certain fees and over the long term even in a favorable market the value of the company you invest in could even deplete due to its poor performance silver bullion then becomes the better option for long term investors that assures you of the full value of silver even when there is a depletion in the value of silver the negatives of silver stocks are more visible than the depleting value of silver bullion for short term investors that implement the best cfd trading strategies silver stocks hold a lot of profit for day traders they possibly hold substantially exponential profit than silver bullion this is where the truth in the myth lies silver bullion holders may have their assets seized by the government this myth dates back to the 1930s when the us government under franklin roosevelt and through executive order 6514 prohibited the hoarding of silver it ordered all silver assets to be submitted to the government for coinage by individuals who held them well in pursuance of this order and in a very small scale the government confiscated some silver assets from certain bank treasuries private individuals were however left to voluntarily submit the silver bullion with them and there was no force used the government definitely didn t have a register of everyone that held silver and individuals continued to hold the commodity in their safes what s more about this is that there is a high unlikelihood that the government would exercise such powers over privately held commodities this is due to both the independence of the us dollar from the gold standard and as you would guess increased recognition of human rights in conclusion your silver bullion is always safe with you numismatics are free from confiscation at the other extreme end of the previously debunked myth are the claims that the government cannot confiscate numismatic coins numismatic coins are detailed coins made from precious metals that are given some sort of value this value could equate them to legal tender meaning that they could replace the official silver coinage of the us for the exchange of other commodities the government definitely frowns against this what this means is that numismatic coins could be subject to confiscation any time the government decides on a crackdown the american silver eagle is the only coinage that is confiscation proof in this regard manipulation in the market makes it unfavorable for small investors we won t doubt that there is manipulation in the silver market manipulation is a very common concept in asset markets and there are sure to be individuals with massive funds that wish to benefit from price changes whether it be an increase or decrease alongside this general conception of manipulation is a claim that the us treasury department and federal reserve wishes to push the prices of both silver and gold down if anything this type of manipulation is good news for small investors they have the chance to buy and trade the commodity at lower prices however the price of physical commodities like silver is majorly determined by their physical demand and supply and there is only an extent to which manipulation can go with this it s either manipulation is a myth or the extent to which it affects the price of silver has been exaggerated silver can be put in an ira an individual retirement account ira is a pension fund for individuals saving for retirement of course these savings go on for a long period and to avoid the effects of financial crises advisors tell you to save in silver however the misconception a lot of people have is that you can put any form of silver into an ira the irs frowns against this and only allows you to save in the american silver eagle which is the official silver coinage of the us do you still believe in these myths throughout the article we have presented you with myths as well as

the biden administration announced starting sunday it would end all covid 19 testing requirements for international travelers inbound to the us the mandate that had been placed into effect on january 26 2021 shortly after biden took office required all international passengers give proof of a negative covid 19 test prior to boarding their flight passengers wait in line at the security checkpoint at ronald reagan washington national airport tuesday april 19 2022 in arlington va a senior administration official said that the centers for disease control and prevention cdc would reevaluate the issue of covid 19 testing for international travelers every 90 days however the statement amounts to nothing more than a rhetorical diversion as the cdc has become an open instrument of big business and the financial markets the cdc s decision essentially ends the last remaining restrictions to contain covid in the us airline stocks climbed briefly in the early hours of trading on the news before turning down again on the broader global economic dismay caused by surging inflation apparently travel remains the one bright spot in the economic news the us travel association reported that though the us economy contracted in the first quarter travel spending in april exceeded 2019 levels for the first time during the pandemic at 100 billion or 3 percent higher however travel from overseas to the us has remained suppressed ceo of us travel association roger dow commended biden in an email stating that rescinding the requirement will welcome back visitors from around the world and accelerate the recovery of the us travel industry us secretary of commerce gina m raimondo released the national travel and tourism strategy for the year on june 6 the initiative focuses the full efforts of the federal government to promote the united states as a premier destination grounded in the breadth and diversity of our communities and to foster a sector that drives economic growth creates good jobs and bolsters conservation and sustainability according to their five year plan the biden administration hopes to attract 90 million visitors who will spend close to 300 billion annually by 2027 per point two of the strategy in order to facilitate travel to and within the united states they intend to reduce barriers to trade in travel services and make it safer and more efficient for visitors to enter the lifting of the current restrictions could bring almost 5 5 million travelers an additional 4 3 million more passengers and garner 9 billion in spending through to the end of the calendar year to place this succinctly public health measures during a continuing pandemic cannot be allowed to place any constraints on the ability to extract profit including limited restrictions on travelers who may very well be carrying the latest variant of sars cov 2 republican senator from mississippi roger wicker who is the ranking member of the senate committee overseeing transportation reveled in the lifting of the testing requirment saying ending this burdensome requirement is long overdue and something i have been urging for months relieved that the biden administration has finally seen reason and removed the requirement democratic senator catherine cortez masto from nevada seconded wicker s endorsement i m glad cdc suspended the burdensome coronavirus testing requirement for international travelers and i ll continue to do all i can to support the strong recovery of our hospitality industry one must ask what is meant by burdensome covid infections have been climbing since april having reached a seven day average of over 116 000 infections per day deaths have turned sharply upwards since june 2 with 448 deaths each day on average according to johns hopkins meanwhile more than 60 percent of the population has been infected at least once and long covid affects 20 to 25 percent of those previously infected on top of the more than 1 million deaths the long term impact of covid on the population s health will be considerable a recent study published in the lancet regional health europe found that people infected with sars cov 2 especially older people had more than three times the risk of dying one year after recovering from their acute infection compared to those that were uninfected another study from veterans affairs found that mortality increased even after breakthrough infection even among those with mild disease the policy of herd immunity continues to dominate the ruling elite s calculations and fortunes covid in permanence will continue to cull the eldest and most vulnerable expunging those the ruling class sees as an unproductive liability charlatan ezekiel emanuel s hope for swift natural death has been combined with thomas friedman s demand that the cure can t be worse than the disease to assure wall street that only those who can work will survive in a report published by the world socialist web site keith begg and virpi flyg wrote johan giesecke a former swedish state epidemiologist and senior adviser to the world health organization who was contracted to work with the fhm during 2020 stated that when the herd immunity strategy was in full swing in sweden the people who are frail and old will die first and when that group of people begins to sort of thin out you will get less deaths as well attempts were quickly made by the likes of biosecurity expert eric toner to downplay the dangers posed by lifting the international travel testing restrictions he said in an interview with bloomberg i have long thought the testing requirement for travel to the us was not evidence based or logical and most other countries have abandoned this approach it s been a hardship for the airlines and a real hardship for travelers as people get back to travel for business and leisure what toner should say if he were being sincere is that almost every government has adopted a live with the virus strategy and there is no enforcement of any measures to stem infections or track and trace where they are spreading therefore the current mandate under such conditions only impedes the free flow of commerce dr vin gupta health adviser to the biden administration s post election transition team made a more callous observation in the wall street journal it s well past time to drop the testing requirement to international travelers to the u s there was the assumption that international travelers were bringing in new variants now we know new variants are cropping up in the us

there s lot of other things i can t do because i have to pay for gas you know what i m saying less food let s play time to go to work right well you got to think about gas now you know you got to decide is it really worth it to go out there and not to spend the extra money if you want to go to the club or go to the bar or something you gotta spend money just to have fun but then on that gas as well so you know you gotta think about that s another factory well i usually put full tank probably like 60 now it s like 100 it depends where i go but yeah we don t want to go too far like we don t wanna use the car too much because it s pointless to be wasting gas right now and so it s just matter of falling supply and rising demand and that s pushed up the national average significantly and it looks like we continue to see supplies decline you know for all the complaints that there are out there about gas prices hitting records few americans seem to be cutting back much advertisement stocks

related video above gas prices hit record highs draining walletsthe s p 500 sank 2 9 to lock in its ninth losing week in the last 10 and tumbling bond prices sent treasury yields to their highest levels in years the dow jones industrial average lost 2 7 and the nasdaq composite dropped 3 5 wall street came into friday hoping a highly anticipated report would show the worst inflation in generations slowed a touch last month and passed its peak instead the u s government said inflation accelerated to 8 6 in may from 8 3 a month before the federal reserve has already begun raising interest rates and making other moves in order to slow the economy in hopes of forcing down inflation wall street took friday s reading to mean the fed s foot will remain firmly on the brake for the economy dashing hopes that it may ease up later this year inflation is hot hot hot said brian jacobsen senior investment strategist at allspring global investments basically everything was up the growing expectation is for the fed to raise its key short term interest rate by half a percentage point at each of its next three meetings beginning next week that third one in september had been up for debate among investors in recent weeks only once since 2000 has the fed raised rates by that much last month no relief is in sight but a lot can change between now and september jacobsen said nobody knows what the fed will do in a few months including the fed the nation s high inflation plus the expectations for an aggressive fed have sent the two year treasury yield to its highest level since 2008 and the s p 500 down 18 7 from its record set in early january the worst pain has hit high growth technology stocks cryptocurrencies and other particularly big winners of the pandemic s earlier days but the damage is broadening out as retailers and others are warning about upcoming profits the s p 500 fell 116 96 points to 3 900 86 combined with its losses from thursday when investors were rushing to lock in final trades before the inflation report it was the worst two day stretch for wall street s benchmark in nearly two years the dow lost 880 00 points to 31 392 79 and the nasdaq tumbled 414 20 to 11 340 02 stock prices rise and fall on two things essentially how much cash a company produces and how much an investor is willing to pay for it the fed s moves on interest rates heavily influence that second part since early in the pandemic record low interest rates engineered by the fed and other central banks helped keep investment prices high now easy mode for investors is abruptly and forcefully getting switched off not only that too aggressive rate hikes by the fed could ultimately force the economy into a recession higher interest rates make borrowing more expensive which drags on spending and investments by households and companies one of the fears among investors is that food and fuel costs may keep surging regardless of how aggressively the fed moves the fact is that the fed has very little ability to control food prices rick rieder blackrock s chief investment officer of global fixed income said in a statement he pointed instead to mismatches in supplies and demand higher costs for energy and wages and the crisis in ukraine which is a major breadbasket for the world that raises the threat that central banks will overly tighten the brakes on the economy as they push against a string and essentially fall into a damaging policy mistake rieder said the economy has already shown some mixed signals and a report on friday indicated consumer sentiment is worsening more than economists expected much of the souring in the university of michigan s preliminary reading was due to higher gasoline prices that adds to several recent profit warnings from retailers indicating u s shoppers are slowing or at least changing their spending because of inflation such spending is the heart of the u s economy the two year treasury yield zoomed to 3 05 following the inflation report from 2 83 late thursday a big move for the bond market during the day it touched its highest level since george w bush s presidency according to data from tradeweb the 10 year yield was also up but not quite as dramatically as the two year yield which is more influenced by expectations for fed movements the 10 year yield climbed to 3 15 from 3 04 and touched its highest level since 2018 the narrowing gap between those two yields is a signal that investors in the bond market are more concerned about economic growth usually the

ailsa chang host inflation is not getting any better in fact it seems to be getting worse prices in may were up 8 6 from a year ago according to data released today by the labor department that s the sharpest increase since 1981 people are having to shell out more for just about everything including necessities like food and rent and the average price of gasoline nationwide is closing in on 5 a gallon it s already above that in many parts of the country including here in la npr s scott horsley joins us now hey scott scott horsley byline hi ailsa chang all right so for a moment it did look like the worst of all this inflation was behind us but these new numbers obviously tell a different story how are people you re talking to coping with these high prices horsley in some cases they are becoming more careful shoppers i spoke today to jackie upshaw she s a retired defense department worker in las vegas she told me there s no more impulse buying at the grocery store for her she makes a list before she goes she compares prices at several different stores upshaw also told me about commiserating with another customer in front of the refrigerator case when they saw what a dozen eggs are selling for these days jackie upshaw the young lady was standing there she was like oh my god she said the last time they was on sale she said i didn t want to have too many but the next time i see them on sale she said i m going to get a whole bunch of them and i was like oh you too sister that s going to be me horsley egg prices are up 32 over the last year that reflects in part the rising cost of chicken feed and the culling of some laying flocks to the bird flu but you know ailsa groceries overall are up more than 10 so this inflation is widespread chang right and meanwhile we re going to hit another painful milestone at the gas pump right horsley that s right the average price of gasoline nationwide is within a couple pennies of that 5 a gallon mark and we re likely to cross that threshold this weekend just a year ago gas was selling for a little over 3 a gallon gasoline prices have soared since russia s invasion of ukraine and it s really taking a toll ilan blanck is a musician based in boulder colo he and his bandmates are planning a tour of the midwest this summer but he says they may have to cancel some of the more remote concerts because it s just too expensive to get there and that s too bad because this was shaping up to be a pretty good summer for live music chang yeah ilan blanck venues are booking and excited to book a lot of festivals are back online and it s just a real shame and a nail biter that all the sudden we have this new obstacle to deal with horsley obviously a lot of people are still traveling this summer but airfares are way up and so is the price of hotel rooms chang scott can you just remind us how did we wind up with such high inflation horsley you know for much of last year policymakers weren t really concerned about inflation they were mostly worried about the economic fallout from the pandemic and getting people back to work they thought if they did that prices would come down on their own but it turns out inflation s been a lot more stubborn and of course the war in ukraine has poured more gasoline on the fire this is really hurting president biden s approval rating in a way that s likely to be costly for democrats in the midterms and unfortunately for the white house there s not a whole lot that biden can do about inflation he has done something important though and that s to promise not to get in the way of the federal reserve as it works to bring prices under control chang so how much longer do you think we re going to have to live with such huge price hikes horsley well it looks as though high inflation could be with us for a while the fed has started raising interest rates pretty aggressively in an effort to tamp down demand but that s a process that takes time and given how high inflation is already the central bank may have to push interest rates higher than it otherwise would have the concern is that in doing so the fed could tip the economy into recession and that concern is definitely weighing on the stock market all the major indexes were sharply down today with the dow tumbling nearly 900 points chang wow that is npr s scott horsley thank you scott horsley you re welcome transcript provided by npr copyright npr

los angeles u s president joe biden said his administration is doing all it can to tackle inflation placing blame for rising prices on oil and shipping companies as new data show consumer prices have reached a four decade high during a speech at the port of los angeles on friday biden said that oil companies are deliberately not increasing production to keep prices high he said oil companies had 9 000 permits to drill they are not drilling why aren t they drilling because they make money not producing more oil the president said asked about exxon s profits biden said exxon made more money than god this year us annual inflation posts largest gain in nearly 41 years as food gasoline prices soar the president also criticized oil companies for spending billions to buy back the stock of their own companies and said the practice should be taxed exxon objected to several of the president s accusations brian deese biden s chief economic adviser met with the chief executives of exxon and chevron this week at the companies request two people familiar with the matter told cnbc those discussions included prices production and market conditions exxon also said it plans a 50 increase in capital expenditures in the petroleum rich permian basin in 2022 compared with 2021 and is boosting refining capacity for u s light crude oil to process about 250 000 barrels more per day cnbc reported labor department data friday showed that consumer prices rose 8 6 in may from the previous year the cost of gas was up nearly 50 in one year and groceries rose nearly 12 in that timeframe the biggest such increase since 1979 us household wealth falls for first time in two years biden said friday that the major asian shipping companies have increased their prices by as much as 1 000 he called on congress to consider taking action against them the president also repeated his view that inflation is being caused in part by russian president vladimir putin s war in ukraine we ve never seen anything like putin s tax on both food and gas he said biden touted his administration s efforts to move cargo in and out of the port of los angeles which faced severe bottlenecks last year however while the number of ships waiting to enter the port for long periods of time has fallen by about 40 according to the white house inflation has not dropped the president is facing criticism from republican lawmakers over his inability to stop prices from rising and is seeing decreasing support from voters two thirds of americans disapprove of biden s handling of the economy according to a may poll from the associated press and norc center for public research the president argued monday that the entire world is facing rising inflation and said america can tackle inflation from a position of strength he noted the country has a strong job market and an unemployment rate near historic lows during his speech friday biden also addressed the january 6 attack on the u s capitol after thursday night s first televised congressional hearing on the attack while biden said he did not watch the hearing he said the attack was one of the darkest chapters in our nation s history and said it is important the american public understands what truly happened the hearings are scheduled to continue next week voa s megan duzor and the associated press contributed to this report

washington ap the prices of gas food and most other goods and services jumped in may raising inflation to a new four decade high and giving american households no respite from rising costs consumer prices surged 8 6 last month from a year earlier faster than april s year over year increase of 8 3 the labor department said friday the new inflation figure the highest since 1981 will heighten pressure on the federal reserve to continue raising interest rates aggressively on a month to month basis prices jumped 1 from april to may much faster than the 0 3 increase from march to april contributing to that surge were much higher prices for everything from airline tickets to restaurant meals to new and used cars those price spikes also elevated so called core inflation a measure that excludes volatile food and energy prices in may core prices jumped a sharp 0 6 for a second straight month they re now 6 above where they were a year ago friday s report underscored fears that inflation is spreading well beyond energy and goods whose prices are being driven up by clogged supply chains and russia s invasion of ukraine it also sent stock prices tumbling the increased pressure on the fed to raises rates even faster which means higher cost loans for consumers and businesses will raise the risk of a recession too virtually every sector has higher than normal inflation said ethan harris head of global economic research at bank of america it s made its way into every nook and cranny of the economy that s the thing that makes it concerning because it means it s likely to persist gas prices rose 4 just in may and have soared nearly 50 in one year the national average price at the pump reached 4 99 friday according to aaa edging closer to an inflation adjusted record high of 5 40 the cost of groceries surged nearly 12 last month from a year earlier the biggest such increase since 1979 rising prices for grain and fertilizer after russia s war against ukraine is intensifying that rise restaurant prices jumped 7 4 in the past year the largest 12 month gain since 1981 reflecting higher costs for food and workers employers face immense pressure to raise pay in a job market that remains robust with low unemployment few layoffs and near record job openings but while average wages are rising at their fastest pace in decades they aren t increasing fast enough for most workers to keep pace with inflation many households accumulated savings from government stimulus aid during the pandemic and are now having to draw on those savings to pay bills housing costs are still climbing the government s shelter index which includes rents hotel rates and a measure of what it costs to own a home increased 5 5 in the past year the most since 1991 airline fares are up nearly 38 in the past year the sharpest such rise since 1980 rampant inflation is imposing severe pressures on families lower income and black and hispanic americans in particular are struggling because on average a larger proportion of their income is consumed by necessities in light of friday s inflation reading the fed is all but certain to implement the fastest series of interest rate hikes in three decades by sharply raising borrowing costs the fed hopes to cool spending and growth enough to curb inflation without tipping the economy into a recession it will be a difficult balancing act the fed has signaled that it will raise its key short term rate by a half point double the size of the usual hike next week and again in july some investors had hoped the fed would then slow its rate increases to a quarter point hike when it meets in september or perhaps even pause its credit tightening but with inflation raging hot investors now foresee yet another half point hike in september which would be the fourth since april surveys show that americans see high inflation as the nation s top problem and most disapprove of president joe biden s handling of the economy congressional republicans are hammering democrats on the issue in the run up to midterm elections this fall on friday biden responded to the latest figures in a speech at the port of los angeles which is now moving a record amount of cargo under an agreement the white house has shepherded yet even as the number of ships waiting to unload at the port has dropped sharply inflation has not my administration the president said is going to continue to do everything we can to lower the prices to the american people surging prices have forced rocky harper of tucson arizona to start doing gig work for delivery companies on top of his regular full time job with a package delivery service his main job pays 800 a week he said which used to be really good money and is now just above dirt poor harper 44 said he and his fiancée are delaying marriage because they can t afford it right now they ve cut off netflix and hulu his car s catalytic converter was stolen recently an increasingly common theft for the rare metals they contain that have shot up in price a repair cost 1 300 with the food gas and rent holy cow he said i m working a massive amount of overtime just to make it just to keep it together a report from the world bank this week made clear that high inflation is a global problem that threatens to slow economies around the world for the 19 countries that use the euro currency inflation fueled by rising food and fuel prices hit a record 8 1 last month leading the european central bank to announce that it will raise interest rates for the first time in 11 years starting in july and again in september in the coming months prices in the united states may ease somewhat some large retailers including target walmart and macy s are now stuck with too much of the patio furniture electronics and other goods that suddenly are no longer in demand target said it s cutting prices due to mounds of unsold inventory though americans have soured on the economy they have largely kept up their spending they are increasingly turning to credit cards with total card debt rising sharply in april the fed reported though such debt has only barely surpassed pre pandemic levels how long these trends higher wages extra savings and rising card debt enable americans to keep spending will help determine whether a recession can be avoided to cool inflation spending growth must be slowed for lower income americans there are signs it s already slowing walmart said customers are shifting down to cheaper items while sales are picking up at retailers that cater to budget conscious shoppers like dollar stores research by the bank of america institute which uses anonymous data from millions of their customers credit and debit card accounts shows gasoline eating up a larger share of budgets for lower income households defined as those with incomes below 50 000 spending on gas reached nearly 10 of all spending on credit and debit cards in the last week of may the institute said that s up from about 7 5 in february a steep increase in such a short period many small businesses are still struggling to keep up with rising costs for supplies and labor a sign that price hikes will continue andrew mcdowell founder of with love market cafe in los angeles said he s paying more for food supplies workers and reusable bags which used to cost him 23 cents but now cost 45 cents the company s chicken blt now costs 20 more than it did before the pandemic mcdowell said he s grappling with the highest prices for supplies and workers he s ever faced he thinks he may have to rise prices again by 10 to 20 every product is impacted every aspect of the business is affected mcdowell said ___ this story has been updated to correct that sales are picking up at retailers that

chronic wasting disease a deadly neurological infectious disease that affects deer elk and moose is spreading across north america most recently detected in north carolina in march 2022 cwd has been confirmed in 30 u s states and four canadian provinces as well as norway finland sweden and south korea dr allan houston a professor of forest and wildlife ecology at the university of tennessee s 18 400 acre ames agresearch and education center in western tennessee explains what is known about cwd and what wildlife scientists are trying to learn how does chronic wasting disease affect animals chronic wasting disease is contagious and relentless there is no cure no way to test living animals and once infections are introduced into wild populations there is no realistic way to stop them from spreading an infected deer typically will survive for 18 months to two years there s a long incubation period in which they don t usually show symptoms but as the disease progresses the animals will begin to appear listless and lose weight in the final six weeks or so they can seem aimless and oblivious to danger become emaciated and drool they often stand with their legs spread like sawhorses as if trying not to topple over these so called zombie deer often get media attention but as the disease progresses in the wild deer become more susceptible to other diseases less able to protect themselves more prone to predation and more apt to be hit by cars they rarely live long enough to become zombies chronic wasting disease has established itself in 30 states and four canadian provinces united states geological survey how long have scientists known about cwd chronic wasting disease was first detected in the mid 1960s when penned deer in colorado began to exhibit symptoms generally described as wasting away researchers attributed it to stress until the late 1970s when wildlife veterinarian beth williams performed necropsies on deer that had died of a similar syndrome she found brain lesions consistent with transmissible spongiform encephalopathies diseases of the nervous system that afflict both animals and humans in 1978 williams and neuropathologist stuart young co wrote the first scientific paper that described chronic wasting disease as a tse but the underlying cause remained a mystery a year later neurologist dr stanley prusiner was studying tse diseases and discovered that a very small protein could become misshapen and resistant to the body s ability to take it apart it entered cells tricking them into replicating it then moved into the lymph and nervous systems eventually it moved to the brain where small clumps aggregated and caused tse prusiner called that nonliving infectious protein a prion does cwd threaten humans prion diseases are always fatal but they don t all affect the same species the cwd prion favors cervids or deerlike animals other prions cause human illnesses such as creutzfeld jakob disease a malady that progresses similarly to accelerated alzheimer s bovine spongiform encephalopathy popularly known as mad cow disease is a prion disease that infects cattle in a small number of cases humans exposed to bse have developed a version of creutzfeld jakob disease no human case of cwd has ever been recorded however several laboratory experiments have shown that the cwd prion could be transferred to other mammals the centers for disease control and prevention warns against eating meat from infected animals some infectious disease experts contend that while the cwd threat to humans is low it is not zero and that risk assessments must include the potential for the emergence of new strains for example while no one knows how or where cwd originated some scholars think a mutated prion jumped the species barrier to deer from sheep infected with another animal prion disease called scrapie animals with chronic wasting disease don t typically show symptoms in the early stages of infection why are prion diseases so hard to combat because of their structure and the fact that they don t contain genetic material prions like the one that causes cwd are nearly indestructible breaking a prion apart or denaturing it would require a very high concentration of chlorine solution or heat exceeding 1 800 degrees f 980 c once they are deposited on the landscape in urine or feces cwd prions can persist for decades years after deer infected with chronic wasting disease were removed from pens other deer placed on the contaminated soil in those same pens also became infected in wild herds the prion is spread as deer which are highly social animals groom and lick one another during the fall mating season bucks search for mates fight and breed they also visit spots known as scrapes where they lick the soil and overhead branches where other deer have left their own calling cards thanks to these behaviors bucks usually have cwd at double the rate of does because the disease does not kill quickly infected animals are able to breed for a season or two so there is no strong genetic selection pressure favoring the development of herdwide immunity and recent research suggests infected does can occasionally transmit the prion to their fawns before birth in some places where cwd occurs the infection rate may only be 1 to 5 and the disease s herdwide impact may not be apparent even to hunters elsewhere the infection rate can reach 50 and maybe even 100 in those cases population impacts will inevitably lead to a smaller and younger herd what do hunters need to know no one wants a disease named after them with infected deer often appearing healthy even at close range post harvest the only way to be sure an animal is disease free is to have it tested usually using lymph nodes as cwd spreads and more people are having deer tested it can take weeks to receive the results that makes meat processing a much more onerous affair it is critical to recognize that once a single deer is infected it acts like tinder to ignite a conflagration moving deer around either alive or dead can introduce and spread the disease for example transferring deer between breeding farms has been associated with its introduction disregarding state wildlife regulations that explain the proper ways to transport and dispose of harvested deer elk or moose can also spread cwd feeding and baiting stations and salt licks can increase infection rates by concentrating deer and creating a point source buildup of prions what do you want to learn about cwd cwd was detected in northern mississippi and western tennessee where i work in 2019 based on what was then a relatively high infection rate it had likely been on the landscape for a number of years and was spreading rapidly currently about 40 of the ames research station s herd is infected research on cwd has been ongoing for decades around the country but it is in the south now at ames in cooperation with other scientists from around the country we are analyzing soil and twig samples for prion concentrations and quantifying deer visits at scrape sites and salt stations we are also investigating ways to destroy salt stations to avoid continued exposure other studies include training dogs to detect metabolites associated with the disease and developing an early warning system before the prion can metastasize across a landscape we are studying how hunters react when cwd is detected locally and comparing hunting success before and after a herd has become infected the perspectives of hunters are important because they love the outdoors and are the first stopgap in cwd s spread hunting is the primary tool for deer management especially control of overabundant deer populations where cwd can run rampant our deer hunters participate in the research at every step and often collect samples from deer they harvest as one hunter said we ve brought in everything except the tracks we hope we can scale up our efforts along with other scientists as we analyze an ailing herd to provide insights into chronic wasting disease for the benefit of animals and humans alike about the author allan houston professor of forest

in this series we bust the jargon and explain a popular investing term or theme here it s quantitative tightening you what it s the reverse of quantitative easing qe the process in which a central bank such as the bank of england or the us federal reserve pumps money into the economy to keep interest rates low and stimulate activity they do this by buying up government and corporate bonds that sends the price of the bonds up which in turn means that the interest rate received by holders of the bonds goes down the lower interest rates on government bonds percolate through the economy into lower interest rates on loans for families and businesses quantitative easing began as a response to the global financial crisis 13 years ago during the dark days of the pandemic central banks flooded the economy with even more cash to bring interest rates down to almost zero now they are starting to sell these bonds that process has been dubbed quantitative tightening or qt switch the aim of quantitative tightening is to suppress surging inflation why are they doing this the aim is to suppress surging inflation which the central banks are also trying to combat by raising interest rates this is a jeopardy ridden exercise on a colossal scale given the sums involved bloomberg economics estimates that the central banks of the g7 countries canada france germany italy japan the us and the uk plus the eu will shrink their balance sheets by about 410billion over the rest of 2022 is the bank of england involved since the bank began its programme of quantitative easing to remedy the woes of the global financial crisis it has added 895billion of bonds including 875bn of government gilt edged stock and 20billion in corporate bonds to its balance sheet it will set out a plan for sales of these gilts in august until then quantitative tightening will be happening in the background the bank will not be replacing bonds that have matured for example wits will say that the bank is doing qt on the qt the bank has also been raising interest rates what about the federal reserve the fed has added 8 9trillion of bonds to its balance sheet it began to taper that is ease off its purchases of these assets in november last month it embarked on tightening planning to sell 60billion in treasuries government bonds and 35billion in mortgage backed securities each month us inflation is running at a 40 year high of 8 3 per cent the federal reserve s hope is to ease such pressures and to create a soft landing for the economy rather than bringing about a recession can the fed pull this off some major figures are sanguine about the programme but others are concerned pointing out that previous attempts to reduce inflation have triggered a recession the sceptics include jamie dimon boss of jpmorgan chase he contends stock markets which were hugely inflated by qe have already fallen sharply and that there could be a further descent as a result of qt dimon said right now it s kind of sunny things are doing fine everyone thinks the fed can handle this that hurricane is right out there down the road coming our way we just don t know if it s a minor one or super storm sandy americans who like the rest of the world are as baffled by qt as they were with qe can only sit and wait
lemonade is set to close its acquisition of metromile any day now and here s what you need to know in an all stock deal the tech insurance company lemonade lmnd 2 56 will soon acquire the pay per mile car insurance company metromile mile ceos of both companies recently reiterated expectations that the deal will close by the end of the second quarter meaning between now and june 30 here s what you need to know about the acquisition and what it means for lemonade s future the details of the acquisition in november 2021 lemonade announced its intention to acquire metromile in an all stock deal valued at approximately 500 million since the announcement both lemonade and metromile shares have dropped about 70 as a result of the decline in metromile s stock price the acquisition is now closer to 115 million or roughly 35 million when accounting for metromile s net cash holders of metromile common stock will receive one share of lemonade for every 19 shares of metromile in all stock acquisitions like this cash will be paid in lieu of any fractional shares meaning lemonade will compensate any leftover shares not divisible by 19 in the form of cash within 10 business days of the transaction metromile has another ticker milew which is for metromile stock warrants the right but not the obligation for investors to buy the underlying stock from the company at a set strike price before the expiration date the strike price an agreed upon price at which a warrant holder may buy a specific security for milew is 11 50 and is set to expire on feb 9 2026 at the time of the merger lemonade will assume the metromile warrants and automatically convert them into a warrant denominated in shares of lemonade common stock on the same terms and conditions meaning the new strike price would be 218 50 the deal still needs to clear one last hurdle the approval from delaware insurance regulators since metromile is incorporated there once that happens all the deal s conditions will be satisfied and the acquisition will close merger arbitrage at the time of this writing lemonade stock traded at 17 88 per share and metromile stock traded at 0 88 per share creating a merger arbitrage the difference between a stock s trading price and buyout price of about 7 that means if you were to buy metromile stock today and the transaction closes as planned you would see immediate gains of 7 assuming lemonade s stock stays at the same price or increases is lemonade stock a buy today it s been an agonizing 12 months for lemonade shareholders with its stock down over 80 during that time with the metromile acquisition lemonade plans to expand its car insurance business lemonade car which currently operates in illinois and tennessee and while metromile operates in just eight states the company has licenses in 49 states allowing lemonade to scale its car insurance nationally whether or not lemonade car will turn things around for the struggling tech insurance company is yet to be determined management believes that with metromile s data lemonade will incur less risk in who the company insures and therefore be more profitable still it will take 18 months management says before lemonade will reap the fruits in the form of a larger more efficient more differentiated and less risky lemonade car business look for the metromile acquisition to close any day now and for lemonade to start rolling out lemonade car nationally over the next 18 months you can monitor lemonade s upcoming earnings reports and press releases to see how its car insurance product will play out and if the stock has a chance to rebound from its lows still any investor interested in lemonade might want alternatively to consider buying metromile stock due to the merger arbitrage and optimism from both ceos that the deal will close soon

well so you know you gotta think about that s another factory well i usually put full tank probably like 60 now it s like 100 it depends where i go but yeah we don t want to go too far like we don t wanna use the car too much because it s pointless to be wasting gas right now and so it s just matter of falling supply and rising demand and that s pushed up the national average significantly and it

dedication to minding the expenses you can control may be the key to surviving record inflation and gas prices example video title will go here for this video example video title will go here for this video buffalo n y there s an old adage when it comes to losing weight eat less and move more the equivalent with your money may be spend less to have more while we can control how much we eat and how much we exercise when it comes to our wallets lately it s harder to spend less when everything is costing more the costs of gas food and other necessities jumped in may raising inflation to a new four decade high and giving american households no respite from rising costs the labor department on friday said that the consumer price index the key inflation indicator increased 8 6 in may from the same month a year ago marking the highest reading since december 1981 at the same time the national average for a gallon of unleaded gasoline is inching toward an unwelcome milestone of 5 per gallon it s discouraging to know when we as individuals can t control some of the prices of these things said robert dunn vice president of counseling at consumer credit counseling service of buffalo a disturbing trend as they seek to meet monthly obligations such as mortgages and rent consumers are seeing the cost of putting food on their tables gas in their tanks and clothes on their backs rising along with cost of just about everything else the dollars they are earning are shrinking in value and then you find yourself struggling to make ends meet and you re not able to save and that starts to concern you dunn said while his non profit agency primarily assists those already struggling under debt they offer tips for those who fear they might be soon if things persist and the trend continues building a buffer step one says dunn is to assess your spending if you don t have a budget right now it s the time create one he said we need to start creating spending plans and we need to not just have them in our heads but actually have a written document once one dedicates themselves to doing this said dunn it is easier to see precisely how they are spending their money and what expenses they may realistically do without you re may not be able to save money right now on groceries and gas but perhaps you can save money on dining out by cutting back on it if inflation is leaving you strapped for cash you may be able to get more at your job without asking for a raise by adjusting your withholding a lot of people get large tax returns perhaps it s a good time to take a look at your tax withholdings to get more cash right now in your paycheck that could cover higher expenses you need to assess if the 5 000 you might receive next april from a tax refund is more beneficial to you right now to cover these expenses increasing cash flow at a time when you are paying more for the cost of living could keep you from falling behind on bills and other monthly obligations it also appears some have not caught on that repayment of federal student loans remains suspended through the rest of the summer some people are still paying them off and it s understandable that some may want to do that if they can but there s no interest accruing on federal student loans so maybe it s a time to halt your payments and use those funds elsewhere if you need to dunn said triple whammy on top of soaring inflation and record gas prices interest rates are also on the rise with the rate on mortgages approaching double what they were from their record low in january 2021 when joe biden was sworn in as president interest rates not only impact mortgage rates but also auto loans and credit card rates so the cost of having credit card balances month to month is going to be significantly more costly dunn said this could be especially troubling for those who might end up carrying additional credit card debt due to inflation indeed a new wallethub study says the average household credit card balance is 12 higher than at this time last year and projects credit card debt among americans will grow by 100 billion dollars by the end of this year and as spending power decreases under current inflation dollars saved particularly in retirement accounts are shrinking amid tumbling stock markets i think that people will perhaps see themselves in financial struggle for the rest of the year and perhaps into next year dunn said we plan to be pretty busy for the foreseeable future but we re ready to help when we can
