too bad it has nothing to do with a better movie business what happened shares of amc entertainment amc 6 79 ended the week 28 1 higher than where they closed last friday according to data from s p global market intelligence after posting four out of five days of gains and continuing a winning streak that began nine days ago since closing at 13 56 on march 14 its lowest point since last may the movie theater operator s stock has rallied 49 higher despite being down 72 from its 52 week high achieved during the meme stock trading frenzy last year it remains 143 above its absolute low point a year ago so what the spark that ignited the rally was amc s somewhat baffling purchase of a stake in hycroft mining hymc an all but defunct gold and silver miner in nevada that shut down production in november because it was strapped for cash amc invested 28 million into the miner in exchange for a 22 ownership position and it was joined by precious metals investor eric sprott who put a like sum into the company the miner wasted no time cashing in on the spike in its own stock price and on friday completed an at the market equity offering that resulted in gross proceeds of 138 6 million coupled with the investments hycroft has raised 195 million in two weeks for many amc s investment is seen as a low risk high reward deal with 1 8 billion in liquidity available to it the money it put into hycroft is negligible but could result in outstanding returns if the miner is successful in resurrecting its business amc s ceo adam aron maintains the cinema operator s business is on cruise control at the moment so using the opportunity to expand beyond the normal confines of the big screen is one to be seized now what amc s stock rally has also breathed new life into the internet chatroom crowd that has supported the theater chain over the past year while there s been a large cohort that has publicly maintained they ve held strong on to their shares in hopes the mother of all short squeezes or moass strikes those who jumped onto the bandwagon late have been demoralized by the steadily declining stock the rally has given hope to everyone that s because amc remains a heavily shorted stock with one fifth of its shares outstanding sold short if the self described apes can keep the momentum going lifting amc s share price even higher it just might initiate the short squeeze they ve been looking for

by oleksandr kozhukhar lviv ukraine reuters ukrainian president volodymyr zelenskiy visibly irritated on saturday demanded western nations provide a fraction of the military hardware in their stock piles and asked whether they were afraid of moscow several countries have promised to send anti armor and anti aircraft missiles as well as small arms but zelenskiy said kyiv needed tanks planes and anti ship systems that is what our partners have that is what is just gathering dust there this is all for not only the freedom of ukraine but for the freedom of europe he said in a late night video address ukraine needed just 1 of nato s aircraft and 1 of its tanks and would not ask for more he said we ve already been waiting 31 days who is in charge of the euro atlantic community is it really still moscow because of intimidation he said zelenskiy has repeatedly insisted that russia will seek to expand further into europe if ukraine falls nato though does not back his request for a no fly zone over ukraine on the grounds this could provoke a wider war earlier in the day zelenskiy talked to polish counterpart andrzej duda and expressed disappointment that russian made fighter aircraft in eastern europe had not yet been transferred to ukraine zelenskiy s office said in a statement the price of procrastination with planes is thousands of lives of ukrainians the office quoted him as saying zelenskiy said poland and the united states had both stated their readiness to make a decision on the planes earlier this month washington rejected a surprise offer by poland to transfer mig 29 fighter jets to a u s base in germany to be used to replenish ukraine s air force reporting by oleksandr kozhukhar and david ljunggren writing by david ljunggren
danielle kurtzleben host in his speech today in warsaw president biden took a moment to reject russian president vladimir putin s narrative that the nato military alliance is a threat to russia s national security let s listen soundbite of archived recording president joe biden the kremlin wants to portray nato enlargement as an imperial project aimed at destabilizing russia nothing is further from the truth nato is a defensive alliance it has never sought the demise of russia kurtzleben nato of course is a military alliance that spans europe and north america it was created in 1949 to counter the threat then posed by a nuclear armed soviet union and it was part of a multilateral system created after the second world war to help preserve the global peace even as a new cold war got underway the united nations was another institution with that aim now vladimir putin s russia is challenging those institutions in new ways and we want to discuss whether they re still up to the task for that we ve invited richard haass back to the program he s the president of the council on foreign relations and a veteran u s diplomat ambassador haass welcome richard haass good to be back kurtzleben so first of all what did you make of president biden s speech in poland today haass it was clearly designed to be well received in poland and throughout eastern europe anyone who is under the direct threat of russia it was a very strong justification of nato in its current role but i would think what s going to make the most news were literally the last few words of the speech where he essentially raised u s aims or objectives for this crisis not simply an end to the war not simply reversing russian aggression against ukraine but calling essentially for a change in power in russia kurtzleben today and throughout his trip this week president biden has claimed that nato has never been more united i want to ask you about that in your view is he right haass yes after the cold war there were lots of debates about what is the raison d etre what s the purpose of nato absent the soviet threat absent the soviet union and for years nato went in search of a mission sometimes it acted in other parts of the world like the middle east what was called out of area some people saw it as a way of anchoring these new democracies countries that came out of the warsaw pact or the former soviet union but with the reemergence of a russian threat that we ve seen including ukraine seven eight years ago nato now no one has to ask what nato s purpose is kurtzleben we ve been talking all about nato here i want to turn to the united nations the u s and other nations often turn to the u n to hold countries that break the rules to account and the u n general assembly did condemn the ukraine invasion earlier this month but russia like the u s has veto power on the u n security council i m wondering how big of a problem is that when russia is the aggressor in ukraine haass what you say highlights what you can either describe as a structural reality or a structural flaw of the united nations when the organization was designed it was never really meant to be used by one great power against another and the five great powers of the moment after world war two the united states the soviet union britain france and china all given a veto in some ways to make sure that could never happen so what you have now is the gridlocking of the security council because russia which inherited the soviet veto after the soviet union dissolved makes it impossible and the security council is the principal organ of the u n meant to promote peace and stability so what you have in these situations is yes you can take things to the general assembly but that s not really an operational forum for the most part so that s why you have in this case say nato is acting you find workarounds around the united nations when the major powers don t agree and we re simply at a point in history where the united states cannot insist or impose that its definition of international order is accepted by others which is a long winded way of saying that s why any measure of global order is going down if this were a stock market you would call it a correction but we re living in an era where the major powers increasingly disagree and there s an absence of any meaningful consensus on what to deal either with regional challenges like in iran or north korea or what to do with global challenges say like cyberspace or climate change kurtzleben we ve been building to a big question here and it s this the united nations and nato have helped avoid a world war for decades i m wondering are they still up to the task and if not what s the alternative haass well the united nations has never really been all that central to the avoidance of world war we ve avoided one for 75 years but that was more because of nuclear deterrence and then the united states and the soviet union were able to engage in direct diplomacy particularly in 1962 at the time of the cuban missile crisis which at least until now was the closest the world ever came to nuclear war question is going forward can these aging institutions still do the trick again i m not optimistic about the united nations the veto and the like is never going to make it a particularly serious institution when the great powers disagree nato is not here to promote a dialogue so much as a defensive alliance it represents 30 countries associated with the west with the united states the question is whether they can deter and if need be turn back aggression in this case by russia but what ukraine is doing for all of us is highlighting that the consensus that is necessary the restraint that is necessary to maintain world order may be fading and that s what s so frightening about this crisis is that russia has acted aggressively has crossed an international border rejecting the fundamental rule of international relations that borders are not to be changed by force there s talk about possibly using weapons of mass destruction and you have an individual leader like vladimir putin who has in many ways hollowed out the institutions of russian government so he has an extraordinarily free hand so i don t think it s any exaggeration to say that we ve either arrived at a point or are getting perilously close to a point where the threat to world order to world peace is greater than it has ever been and you know i don t mean to be alarmist but this again is fast emerging as the most dangerous moment in history since 1962 since the cuban missile crisis kurtzleben that was ambassador richard haass president of the council on foreign relations and author of the world a brief introduction ambassador haass thank you so much for speaking with us today haass thank you for having me soundbite of cecelie s dad s song transcript provided by npr copyright npr

the geologic record of earth s history is 4 6 billion years long it contains the history of life on earth and the formation of the continents and oceans which cover the planet today there are however gaps in this history usually created by erosion these are called unconformities one of the largest of these unconformities is simply called the great unconformity it is called such because as many as 1 2 billion years of earth s history are in this gap about a fifth of our planet s history what could have caused this gap one possibility is erosion related to the breakup of an ancient supercontinent known as rodinia rodinia and the ebb and flow of supercontinents explaining the breakup of rodinia requires a brief review of plate tectonics and the supercontinent cycle because the earth s crust is broken up into tectonic plates that move against each other earth s continents are constantly moving across the surface this happens very slowly so it is too slight to notice on human timescales every few hundred million years all the continents come together to form a supercontinent before once again drifting apart to become individual continents the most recent supercontinent was pangaea which formed about 250 to 300 million years ago and began to break apart about 205 million years ago this breakup formed the beginnings of what is now the atlantic ocean basin the formation of the most recent supercontinent also coincided with an enormous mass extinction demonstrating the consequences of supercontinent formation and breakup for life on earth pangaea of course is not the only supercontinent whose evolution may have influenced the history of life a much earlier supercontinent is rodinia the name which is derived from the russian word for homeland it began forming about 1 2 billion years ago and started to break up around 750 million years ago the continental drift and the evolution of the earth from pangaea to today dimitrios adobe stock the assembly and breakup of supercontinents the mechanism behind the assembly and breakup of supercontinents is the movement of the tectonic plates that make up the crust there are three types of boundaries between tectonic plates convergent boundaries where two tectonic plates are colliding divergent boundaries where they are being pushed apart and transform boundaries where two plates are moving laterally with respect to each other there are two types of convergent boundaries subduction zones and orogenic or mountain building zones subduction zones form when there is a collision between two plate margins of oceanic crust or two plate margins where one margin is made of oceanic crust and the other is made of continental crust these two scenarios will result in volcanic island arcs like the philippines and volcanic coastal mountain ranges like the cascades in north western north america respectively collisions between two plate margins of continental crust will form mountain ranges like the himalayas when continents merge to form supercontinents the zones of contact between the continents will become orogenic zones meaning that their merger will lead to the formation of mountain ranges this is because continental crust is too buoyant to be thrust beneath a tectonic plate oceanic crust on the other hand is denser and can be thrust under a tectonic plate or subducted as a result the continental crust will just get compressed as continental masses are pushed together creating mountain ranges if these mountain ranges get large enough the pressure within them will build up to such a degree that the heat generated within the mountain range will cause the mountain range to lose strength and begin to sag it is this sagging and flattening out of the mountain range which can eventually lead to the breakup of continental masses including supercontinents this process probably began to occur for rodinia about 750 million years ago and may be part of the formation process behind the great unconformity the great unconformity was first noticed by john wesley powell in the grand canyon in 1869 it is a gigantic gap in the geologic timeline brewbooks cc by sa 2 0 rodinia and the great unconformity evidence for the great unconformity is found all over the world one location where it is particularly stark however is in the grand canyon for example the vishnu schist metamorphic rock that used to be sandstones and mudstones in an ancient seabed which is about 1 7 billion years old lies directly beneath the tapeats sandstone a rock unit representing an ancient beach dating to about 550 million years ago about 1 billion years appear to be missing from the geologic record in this section of the grand canyon stratigraphy how could the formation of a supercontinent do this a paper in geology published in 2018 suggests that the reason for this unconformity is massive erosion from rodinian mountain ranges that formed as large masses of granitic rock from the underlying craton were exhumed or uplifted and then eroded about 680 to 850 million years ago these ages are based on the radiometric dating of zircon crystals as these underlying masses of crystalline rock were exhumed sedimentary and volcanic layers overlying them would have been eroded away similar to what is seen in the sierra nevada today the granite or granitoid massifs of the sierra nevada mountains in california were once overlain by sedimentary and volcanic deposits over millions of years however these relatively weak layers have been eroded away to reveal the relatively erosion resistant crystalline rock beneath this is likely what happened in rodinia over 680 million years ago the erosion of these sedimentary and volcanic layers would have created a pause in deposition in these areas and have erased millions of years of geologic history resulting in the great unconformity the appalachian mountains were formed by the merging of all continents into the supercontinent pangea pavlo vakhrushev adobe stock uniqueness of the breakup of rodinia although the case for rodinia being the culprit behind the great unconformity is compelling it does not explain everything uplifting and erosion of the sort that happened with rodinia also happened with other supercontinents but other supercontinents do not have 1 billion year unconformities associated with them what is puzzling is why this did not happen for the other supercontinents for example why is a similarly large unconformity not associated with the breakup of pangaea pangaea formed by a similar mechanism of the continents coming together forming enormous mountain ranges the roots of which survive in the form of the appalachians in the eastern united states for example these highly eroded features once formed the base of a mountain range that rivalled the himalayas in height while there are undoubtedly unconformities related to the increased erosion rates from the formation of this mountain range the effect of these unconformities is not as stark as the great unconformity what is the reason for this difference this is speculation but one reason might be due to the presence of plants the supercontinent of rodinia formed before the evolution of macroscopic life there was life on earth 1 2 billion years ago but it was microscopic the most visible expression of life at the time was in the form of stromatolites a type of reef built by microbial communities that is preserved in the geologic record although earth was covered in a near global ocean at the time the landmasses on earth would probably have resembled the surface of mars desolate desert like and possibly with a reddish appearance due to the presence of iron oxides vegetation plays an important role in limiting erosion it is possible that this lack of plants to act as a control on erosion may have made the erosion of material much more significant on the supercontinent of rodinia the supercontinent of pangaea was very desolate itself but it would have at least had vegetation in some places to slow the erosion rodinia with its possibly mars like landscape would not have had this control and so rivers wind and floods may have had much more erosive power than today another significant factor in the geologic history of the ancient supercontinent is that massive glaciations occurred late in its history it is not entirely understood why but the breakup of rodinia seems to have led to a runaway glaciation that may have created a snowball earth scenario where much of earth s surface was covered in ice sheets glaciers are also known for being very powerful forces of erosion they move slowly but over time they can move significant amounts of sediment and even carve the solid rock of mountain ranges the enormous glaciations that occurred at the time coupled with a complete lack of vegetation to act as a check on erosion could have created an abnormally destructive erosive sequence leading to the great unconformity that we see in the rock record this explanation is speculation of course but it does fit with what is known of the conditions of rodinia as opposed to younger supercontinents such as pangaea significance of rodinia and the great unconformity rodinia in addition to being geologically important may also be important for the history of life on earth it was off the coast of the fracturing supercontinent that the first multicellular life may have had its start as the supercontinent of rodinia began to break up about 750 million years ago this process would have led to the formation of rifts where heat beneath the crust was pulling the supercontinent apart eventually these rifts would become ocean basins a possible modern example of this process is the red sea which may be an incipient ocean basin forming between northeast africa and the arabian peninsula the formation of these ocean basins around rodinia would have led to the formation of passive continental margins or continental shelves similar to those seen on either side of the atlantic ocean today this would have allowed for the existence of large shallow seas it is in these shallow seas that the first multicellular life probably began to evolve about 635 million years ago the first soft bodied multicellular organisms meaning organisms without skeletons or exoskeletons appear in the fossil record these early soft bodied organisms are referred to as the ediacaran biota about 540 million years ago after rodinia had long since broken up the cambrian explosion occurred this led to the rise of the first hard bodied organisms or organisms with skeletons and exoskeletons the cambrian explosion represents the emergence of almost all major phyla of animals living today the cambrian period is most famous of course for being the age of arthropods the phylum containing insects crustaceans etc although these events in the history of life happened long after the breakup of rodinia they probably happened in shallow seas that formed because of the breakup and thus were a legacy of the ancient supercontinent thus rodinia and the great unconformity may both be associated with the emergence of multicellular life reconstruction of the supercontinent rodinia 900 million years ago fama clamosa cc by sa 4 0 the great unconformity the lost great library of life there are many unanswered questions regarding the emergence of the first multicellular life from a geological perspective many forms of life in the cambrian appear to have arisen suddenly without much precedent it appears that much of the record for this early stage in the evolution of multicellular life could be missing if the millions or even billion years of geologic history represented by the great unconformity had not been erased by erosion would the record be more complete i do not believe that this is required to explain the sparse record of multicellular life at the beginning of the phanerozoic but the loss of a record of more than 1 billion years of earth s history may still significantly impact our understanding of the history of life on earth it is possible that the great unconformity could represent a geological equivalent to the loss of the great library of alexandria just as the loss of that ancient library left unknown the level of knowledge attained in the ancient world the loss of geological and paleontological information due to the great conformity may leave unknown important details about the history of life on earth the great unconformity and the legacy of rodinia if you were to be transported in time and space back to the ancient supercontinent of rodinia it would be a very unearthly place there would be no plants or animals and the air would not have sufficient oxygen for you to breath rodinia represents a very different earth from the one with which we are familiar despite this that utterly alien landmass played a very significant role in the geologic history of our planet the continents and maybe even life in its death throws it created the great unconformity and may have spurred the emergence of multicellular life through the formation of large continental shelves and shallow seas where this life could flourish in some ways rodinia may be responsible for the modern geological and biological world as we understand it top image reconstruction of how the supercontinent rodinia would have looked source manuel mata adobe stock by caleb strom

amman amid the ongoing russian war on ukraine the us will continue to be positively engaged in the middle east and work with allies and partners to realise the two state solution for the palestinian issue regional spokesperson for the us state department samuel warberg said saturday the us is fully aware of the importance of realising the two state solution and the right of the palestinians and the israelis to live in peace dignity security and prosperity he said therefore and amidst the chaos because of the russian war and the russian aggression against ukraine the us is continuing communication and involvement with all sides and secretary of state antony blinken will meet with palestinian president mahmoud abbas in ramallah he said at an online press meeting on saturday we want to reach to the two state solution we cannot have a positive role if we only have a unilateral relation with the israelis we have to listen to all the palestinians and the israelis about how the us can play a positive role to push all the sides to the table all the issues to realise the two state solution he said blinken is scheduled to visit israel sunday and is also set to visit the west bank morocco and algeria in a trip that will also focus on iran and regional security matters the israeli palestinian relations the two state solution to the israeli palestinian conflict among other topics warberg said the us does not expect any change or impact on the ties with countries in the region because of their position on the russian war on ukraine the us has deep solid historical and strategic relations with almost all countries in the region and washington does not expect that to change due to a country s position towards this war he noted we expect all countries to raise their voice against the barbaric war especially the countries of the region as it suffered from wars destruction and terrorism and the peoples of the region know more than others the negative consequences of any war he said almost all the countries of the region expressed their condemnation of the russian war he said adding that the us appreciates jordan s firm stance in this regard as it stressed on respecting international law the un charter the sovereignty and regional integrity of states touching on public opinion in the region that there is a disparity in the us sympathy when it comes to the ukrainian crisis and the palestinian cause he stressed the difficulty to compare the israeli palestinian situation with the russian war on ukraine warberg said as a diplomat i say that the difference between the previous us administration and the current one should be evident the former administration has completely severed relations with the palestinians and cut humanitarian assistance to the palestinians in the palestinian territories and refugee regions in various countries while the current administration has taken the decision to resume relations with the palestinians and humanitarian and economic assistance to the palestinians and the palestinian authority he said on challenges related to food security due the russian war he said they are not restricted to the region adding that the issue was discussed by us president joe biden and european leaders on thursday these talks were part of the g7 meetings as well as the nato meeting aimed to discuss means to work closely together to ensure adequate food worldwide he said ukraine and russia are the world s two largest wheat producers and any problem related to food security is linked to president putin s war he said he also highlighted the capabilities of the us the third largest wheat producer alongside canada to build initiatives in cooperation with allies and wheat dependent countries notably the 5 billion feed the future initiative to address the food security problem stressing the importance of such initiatives amid the potential food security related implications of russia s war on ukraine warberg added that the us is currently cooperating with its allies and partners to provide the necessary assistance to the government and people of ukraine to counter the russian aggression adding that his country has so far provided some 293 million in humanitarian assistance since the beginning of the russian invasion of ukraine last month regarding the sanctions imposed on russia warberg said they have caused a devastating blow to russia predicting that their impact on the russian economy will continue over time the sanctions have shown that the reserves of the central bank of russia are useless he said these reserves finance putin s war he said adding that the value of the russian ruble has fallen making less than one us cent the russian stock market has been closed since nearly three weeks in addition to large inflation and the withdrawal of more than 300 mega private companies from the russian market it s just the beginning and we in cooperation with all our partners will impose further high costs on russia in the event it continues this aggression warberg said adding that analysts expect a greater collapse of the russian economy concerning the impact of the crisis warberg said that it is not restricted to europe but it involves the whole world noting that the prices of fuel and food in the middle east and jordan in particular is rising because of this crisis on the limits of the us role in the russian ukrainian crisis warberg highlighted his country s support for all efforts towards reaching a solution between the ukrainians and the russians he pointed out that it should be pursued in accordance with the principles defended by the us highlighting that no state has the right to change a country s geographical borders or dictate its will on another country
forget the wizard of oz tornadoes are causing far more deaths and destruction east and south of kansas these days and they re often doing it in the dark of night tuesday night s deadly tornado that struck the new orleans area is the ideal example of what experts say is the 21st century problem with twisters killer tornadoes have shifted a bit out of the vast emptiness of the great plains more into the southeast where there are more people to hit poorer populations and more trees to obscure twisters from view and if that s not enough these southeast twisters are more likely to strike at night when they are more dangerous here s a closer look at what s behind the shift why are tornadoes killing more people outside the great plains since 2000 nearly 89 of the 1 653 americans killed by tornadoes not counting this week s victims lived east of the dakotas nebraska kansas oklahoma and texas according to an associated press analysis of national oceanic and atmospheric administration data last year 100 people were killed by tornadoes in kentucky alabama illinois tennessee north carolina arkansas missouri louisiana mississippi and pennsylvania one person was killed in texas it s not so much a meteorology problem but a people one tornado experts said it s a function of the human built environment said victor gensini a professor of meteorology at northern illinois university who specializes in severe storms the mid south does get a lot of tornadoes but in the mid south we have more things to hit we have more bull s eyes on the dartboard we have more cities we have more weak frame housing stock tornadoes happen more often there at night which is exactly what we saw last night harold brooks a senior scientist at noaa s national severe storms laboratory said traditional 20th century tornadoes the type that make oklahoma and kansas famous are less deadly because they go for miles without anything in the way in 1991 he and his wife chased for 66 miles a tornado in oklahoma that had winds hit 286 mph it hit two barns no one but a few cows were hurt put that storm near new orleans at night and dozens of people would be killed probably many more in the southeast all it takes is a weather event to occur and you ll have people in the way brooks said does climate change have a role in 2018 brooks and gensini published a scientific study showing deadly tornadoes were happening less frequently in the tornado alley of oklahoma kansas and texas and more frequently in tornado fatality alley which is the mid south gensini said what s likely happening is that the west is getting drier because of human caused climate change which makes it harder for the air to become moist and unstable which is crucial for tornado formation they said the southeast is getting warmer air which holds more water vapor which creates that important instability gensini said climate models predict this type shift 50 years in the future or so yet it appears to be happening now gensini said but gensini brooks and university of ohio meteorology professor jana houser emphasized that they don t see a climate change signal in tuesday s deadly louisiana tornado there s a la nina a natural periodic cooling of parts of the pacific that shifts global weather patterns and that usually means more tornadoes in the southeast because of changes in the jet stream and moisture they said what s different about night tornadoes tuesday s nighttime tornado illustrated a problem because when twisters hit at night people can t see them coming as easily and often don t react as well the tornado experts said about three quarters of the tornadoes that hit oklahoma and other great plains states occur between 5 and 9 p m so people know when to expect them and its more daylight brooks said but in the southeast they can hit any time which means more often at night than in oklahoma making them more dangerous another reason they happen more at night in the southeast is because they happen more in the springtime and there are just fewer daylight hours gensini said spring storms are juicier and stronger than summer ones so they don t need the sun s daytime heat to add that extra kick of energy to spur tornadoes he said what about the landscape the southeast is also hurt by having more trees hills and buildings that block people s views of incoming storms when there s a tornado warning in the southeast often people are out to their front porch and they don t really see anything and it just kind of looks like you know a dark sky houser said they may be less likely to actually heed those warnings than if they are walking out their door and they see a tornado on the horizon even if it s far away so there s a little bit of geography that plays a role there any good news or the region the one advantage tornadoes in the southeast have is that they are easier for meteorologists to forecast the conditions ripe for bad outbreaks much earlier tuesday s severe storm was warned about eight days in advance by noaa s storm prediction center which is unusual brooks said cody scott searches the attic for belongings after a tornado tore the roof off of his father in law s home in arabi la tuesday march 22 2022 a tornado tore through parts of new orleans and its suburbs tuesday night ripping down power lines and scattering debris in a part of the city that had

photo auto source group llc photo auto source group llc when it came out in 1994 the third generation 7 series was one of the most luxurious and technologically advanced sedans money could buy the first production car to offer curtain airbags and the first european model with satellite navigation it was a huge improvement over the previous iteration finally giving the s class a worthy rival the e38 was available with a wide range of engine options including a v8 and a v12 that helped blend the luxury feel of the massive sedan with the sportscar like performance and maneuverability that made bmw famous this beautiful feat of german engineering appealed to many people including a pennsylvania resident that goes by the name of simeon in the fall of 1999 he was on his way to place a deposit for a new ford expedition but a 740il crossed his path and 15 minutes later he was test driving one the expedition soon became a distant memory and less than two weeks after the test drive he was the prowd owner of a bmw flagship a year later a friend suggested that he attend a race driving course and thus simeon ended up taking his 740il to the pocono raceway also known as the tricky triangle in long pond pennsylvania instantly and irremediably hooked on track driving the bmw owner soon found out that his car was not built for such endeavors but instead of buying a track toy he decided to upgrade the luxury sedan he took it to dinan cars where it was fitted with a stage 1 suspension bigger brakes a cold air intake a new mass air meter a cat back exhaust as well as upgraded engine transmission software although these mods improved the e38 s track manners it was still too slow simeon thought about a thorough upgrade from the likes of ac schnitzer hamman or hartge but the packages offered by these european tuners were limited to just 390 hp moreover he would still be stuck with the car s original five speed automatic which took all the fun out of the equation for the next few months he researched the possibility of swapping the auto with a bmw six speed manual which lead him to philly based vac motorsports not only was the crew open to swapping the transmission but they also offered to implement other performance enhancing hardware that would transform simeon s baby into a veritable track monster and one of the fastest e38 in the states apart from the new manual sourced from an e39 m5 that required a strengthened drive shaft and a bespoke aluminum flywheel the 740il got a modified m5 limited slip differential brembo 355mm gt f1 brakes and a set of bilstein performance shocks to top it all off the crew managed to squeeze in an ess supercharger that required a lot of custom fabrication to fit this was an amazing feat at the time since supercharger kits for the m62 v8 were not that common at the time with a blower snuggly fit and beefed up rods valves or pistons the sedan was now capable of well over 400 hp on the exterior it looked exactly like any other stock 740il save for a set of aftermarket wheels the same can be said about the interior which gained only a european 7 series pedal assembly a gauge cluster from the e39 m5 and five point seat belts years later the factory navigation system was replaced with a modern idrive unit borrowed from an i8 over the years simeon took his beloved baby to many events both on and off the track such as the one lap of america challenge or the cannonball run where it became a legend among bmw enthusiasts it was even flown to germany where it successfully tackled the infamous nordschleife today this awesome sleeper that boasts almost 200 000 worth of performance upgrades and an unparalleled reputation is available for purchase through asg miami with over 137 500 miles 221 285 km on the odometer it can be yours for just 28 500 about what you would pay for a 2022 toyota camry
the global auto industry just can t catch a break automobile wire harnesses made on picnic tables because of a war in ukraine semiconductor plants halting production from an earthquake in japan and backed up ports in china amid rising covid 19 cases are straining vehicle supply chains again forecasters expect millions of vehicles will be cut from production schedules this year and next as these events keep pushing automaker procurement departments more than two years on to work overtime navigating the bottlenecks and that may be forcing automakers to rethink the just in time delivery model they ve relied on to keep costs low we re looking for ways to move bearings stampings some wire harnesses said mark wakefield global co leader of the automotive and industrial practice at alixpartners llp consulting firm so it s not massive components that are being held up but it is a problem the unfortunate reality is it s not the first supply crisis we ve had in the past two years s p global inc s mobility team last week downgraded its 2022 and 2023 global light vehicle production forecast by 2 6 million vehicles for both years to 81 6 million and 88 5 million respectively worst case could be a hit of as many as 4 million vehicles said mark fulthorpe the team s executive director for global production forecasting a big portion of that comes from halted vehicle production in russia and ukraine and increased risks for work stoppages because of semiconductor constraints fulthorpe said also factoring into the drop is decreasing demand as customers face inflation including increasing costs from gas and energy prices many people if they ve managed to remain in employment since the covid crisis broke typically they ve saved quite a bit of money on travel leisure spend that was seen as potentially a great enabler for pent up demand to be released as we go forward fulthorpe said now we re thinking that that is a much more moderate effect that some of the future demand will have been destroyed some buyers who don t need to be in the market may wait others may look to electric or hybrid vehicles though their capacity remains limited as automakers ramp up offerings shoppers may look to more fuel efficient vehicles if a customer buys the f 150 because they need the payload said dave andrea a principal and automotive strategist at plante moran but they can get 80 of the towing that they need with a smaller engine the customer may buy a more fuel efficient trim level european production wire harnesses were among the first components to feel the impact of the conflict in eastern europe half of ukrainian auto suppliers who have invested in the country since the late 90s produce wire harnesses and it s the no 10 producer for them in the world with 3 4 of global sales according to alixpartners plants owned by bmw ag and volkswagen ag have faced downtime due to parts shortages leading bmw to cut its margin forecast and vw ceo herbert diess to warn the disruptions could risk the company s annual outlook in its annual report daimler ag s mercedes benz warned strong pricing will not fully offset rising raw material prices downtime at a vw plant in poland also has halted temporarily ford motor co s tourneo connect compact van built there in a partnership and the automaker is monitoring the situation john gardiner spokesman for ford of europe said in a statement elsewhere ford has halted production at its plants in saarlouis and cologne in germany a ford supplier also has said it cannot supply the parts for a 13 2 inch sync4 infotainment screen for the updated focus in europe production of the vehicle with the eight inch screen continues supply of these parts are being moved to a new location in europe but until this is up and running the 13 2 inch screen with sync4 will not be available to customers gardiner said we apologize to customers for the inconvenience that this will cause but trust they will understand the exceptional circumstances wire harnesses in particular are a challenge because they require a high labor content and often months of training fulthorpe said some automakers are looking elsewhere for the part such as other eastern european countries or mexico some have gotten more creative for now wakefield said some are insourcing wakefield said they are going to germany or italy in rare cases it s a temporary thing they ll have picnic tables with a testing device and a bunch of people twisting wires and testing the electrical connections on them for the short term some automakers like stellantis nv have found they ve been better protected ceo carlos tavares has said the automaker sources more of its components like wire harnesses from northern africa rather than eastern europe like its german rivals in a note last tuesday analysts with morgan stanley suggested automakers may have to rework supply chains designed for global just in time delivery we believe the russia ukraine conflict has the potential to accelerate a number of structural changes in the global auto industry that would increase insurance costs and wrap up automakers capital in stockpiling certain parts rather than investing it in their products creating a new order of globalization andrea said all of that has to be looked at in terms of how long these supply chains are he said you have to start looking at risk and reward whether the risk of lengthening that supply chain is too much if it s not to the benefit of putting that close by semiconductors most pressingly a 7 3 magnitude earthquake last wednesday in japan halted production at a number of semiconductor fabrication plants the part is needed in vehicles from automated driving functions and infotainment to heated seats and emissions controls renesas electronics corp a key maker that experienced a fire at one of its plants last year that affected semiconductor access initially idled production at three plants in response to the earthquake but started resuming lines last week all three were expected to return to pre earthquake operations by wednesday an outcome of russian steel production ukraine is the largest exporter of neon half of whose global consumption goes to helium neon lasers according to alixpartners they re used to etch circuit patterns onto wafers of silicon in semiconductor production a process called lithography that means semiconductors could be facing another capacity challenge in the future especially if the conflict in ukraine is prolonged for now chip fabricators don t expect disruptions in the near term a conflict between ukraine and crimea in 2014 taught them to rely less on neon diversify sourcing and build safety stocks of up to six months if the risk was to emerge it will probably be in the second half of this year and then possibly into the first half of 2023 fulthorpe said at the moment it s not an enormous risk but it s certainly something that we should not ignore palladium also is used in the production of semiconductors and nearly a quarter of it comes from russia nickel for evs russia is the third largest producer of nickel behind indonesia and the philippines russia represents 10 of global nickel production but it s the largest for mining production battery grade nickel globally and no 2 for its refined production after china according to alixpartners nickel is an important element for electric vehicle batteries although some automakers are moving away from using the expensive mineral it continues to remain critical for the ramp up of ev production a short squeeze pushed the price of nickel to more than 100 000 per ton earlier this month it s now around 43 000 per ton higher than historical averages right now it s a price issue wakefield said if supply curtails from russia it s a huge issue nickel is already a tight metal the best case scenario he said would be if china starts buying more nickel from russia while western nations have sanctions in place opening more supply for them from places like australia canada and indonesia but increasing costs of raw materials and logistics already have gotten to some ev makers tesla inc recently raised prices in the u s and china and rivian automotive inc increased the price on reservations for its electric vehicles only to reverse the decision following an uproar from customers lucid group inc ceo pater rawlinson told reuters last week that it was an inevitability the california based startup would have to look at price hikes ten to 15 of the cost for an ev battery was in the nickel wakefield said now it s another 1 000 to 2 000 for a battery that s a real impact as general motors co on monday launched production of the cadillac lyriq ev the automaker said for now it s maintaining its 2022 financial outlook which includes 13 billion to 15 billion in operating profit following a record 14 3 billion for 2021 the best case scenario he said would be if china starts buying more nickel from russia while western nations have sanctions in place opening more supply for them from places like australia canada and indonesia but increasing costs of raw materials and logistics already have gotten to

is grappling with the country s largest outbreak since the pandemic began in wuhan more than two years ago because of a new version of the quickly spreading but less severe omicron variant the country recently reimposed lockdowns in a number of cities efforts to prevent the spread led to downtime for two days last week at tesla s shanghai plant and experts have warned of shipping delays from backed up ports it looks worse than last year when they shut down the power and had that magnesium problem wakefield said adding to the potential stressors is the biden administration threatening to respond if beijing decides to give material aid to russia to support its war in ukraine gm s reuss emphasized the advantages of a global redundant supply chain it s not just people that only supply in china he said but the global suppliers that are in china north america and other places and so we leverage that global footprint we never have just one answer on those things detroit news staff writers

dubai united arab emirates russia s war in ukraine could mean changes for ed kessel s farm along a quiet stretch of western north dakota worldwide farmers like kessel are weighing whether to change their planting patterns and grow more wheat this spring as the war has choked off or thrown into question grain supplies from a region known as the breadbasket of the world ukraine and russia account for a third of global wheat and barley exports which countries in the middle east asia and africa rely on to feed millions of people who subsist on subsidized bread and bargain noodles they are also top exporters of other grains and sunflower seed oil used for cooking and food processing kessel said he may plant some more wheat and ride the tide of high prices that have spiked by a third since the invasion helping offset losses from drought and the increasing cost of fuel but not a lot more honestly it probably will help us plant a few more wheat acres we ll put a few more acres into wheat and a few more into sunflowers said kessel also first vice president of the north dakota grain growers association major grain producers like the united states canada france australia and argentina are being closely watched to see if they can quickly ramp up production to fill in the gaps from lost ukrainian and russian supplies but farmers are facing the prospect of another year of drought climbing fuel and fertilizer costs and supply chain disruptions from the covid 19 pandemic major producers also are hamstrung by factors like legal limits on exports and farming patterns that means uncertainty for countries like egypt lebanon pakistan iran ethiopia and others that cannot grow enough wheat barley corn or other grains to meet their needs the war has raised the specter of food shortages and political instability in countries that rely on affordable grain imports any extra grain exports from anywhere in the world will likely only partially offset lower black sea shipments over the remainder of the current season the international grains council said in its march report about half of the grain the world food program buys to feed 125 million people worldwide comes from ukraine the double blow of rising food prices and depressed wheat exports from the war is a recipe for catastrophe not just in ukraine but potentially globally the head of the u n food assistance agency warned it will impact millions and millions of people particularly in the poorest countries of the world wfp executive director david beasley told the associated press in the western ukrainian city of lviv last week as he visited a refugee center where food aid was distributed there are unanswered questions about how western sanctions on russia the world s top wheat exporter could affect its grain exports and distribution networks russia is also the biggest exporter of fertilizer while ukraine ships huge amounts of corn rye oats and millet the black sea region is a top producer of the grains used to feed livestock worldwide australia and india have responded with increased grain exports but there s little room for others to immediately do the same that s mainly due to recurrent drought said arnaud petit executive director of the international grains council the u s produced around 44 million tons of wheat for the 2021 2022 season just two to three years ago it was over 50 million tons petit pointed to drought and farmers switching to more profitable crops canada argentina and australia could try to ramp up wheat production for the coming season that ends in mid 2023 but it s too early to tell if farmers are changing their planting patterns to focus more on grains like wheat doug martin said it s too late for his family farm in manitoba canada to make significant changes to what s being planted now plus growing a range of crops spreads out risks most producers have a set idea of what they are seeding and will probably stick to that martin said although higher wheat prices will reap earnings for farmers that isn t enough incentive to expand production because prices are also climbing for crops like oats canola and barely there are other crops that are going to get good returns martin added any increased production is running up against surging costs for supplies the price of fuel has skyrocketed and the cost of fertilizer was already high because of a crunch in natural gas acutely felt in europe with cheaper fertilizers it could have been possible to grow our way out of a global food security problem possibly but nutrients are anything but affordable or even accessible right now said sylvain charlebois a professor in food distribution and policy at dalhousie university in canada philippe dutertre grows wheat in chemiré le gaudin in the sarthe agricultural region about 130 miles southwest of paris he hasn t decided whether to expand his wheat patch given soaring energy and electricity costs we might be able to act a little bit on the crop rotation but today france produces wheat corn rapeseed for oils and other cereals he said we don t have the certainty anymore to say that we will be able to guarantee the food security of france and europe tomorrow australian farmers experienced a bountiful wheat season still the agriculture department says australia will not be able to respond to lower ukrainian supplies right away because it s already sold its exports through september the situation is similar in argentina another major grain exporter a whopping 95 of its current wheat crop has already been sold jorge josifovich owns farmland in pergamino one of the richest agricultural areas in argentina where he grows wheat corn and soybeans despite higher wheat prices he said argentine farmers might not be motivated to plant more because of high fertilizer and fuel costs coupled with a rigorous price control imposed by the government that is unfavorable to producers who sell their production to exporters the calculus leaves the world s biggest wheat importers vulnerable including indonesia egypt pakistan and bangladesh as well as war torn yemen and cash strapped lebanon they are countries with huge populations in poverty relying on affordable wheat for their diets drought in the middle east is at its highest level in at least 20 years according to the gro drought index hindering any efforts to ramp up domestic wheat production there is potential for unrest if prices continue to rise particularly in nations without sufficient stocks of wheat they may be forced to wait to purchase it from the market switch to rice or draw from their wheat reserves in egypt the world s biggest wheat importer the government recently announced price caps for unsubsidized bread and fines for violators in response to soaring prices the world has 278 million tons of wheat stock to help buffer shortfalls from ukraine said petit of the international grains council half of that stock however is in china which holds more than a year s worth of supply to ensure food security for its 1 4 billion people meanwhile farmers a world away are making their own hard decisions tom bernhardt who operates a fifth generation crop and cattle ranch near linton in north dakota said no till farmers like himself won t deviate too much from their normal rotation and plant more wheat because it can lead to problems with soil health and weeds plus there s no guarantee wheat prices will remain high i have never planted additional acres just to chase a price the the 61 year old american farmer said karnowski reported from st paul

mark pomerantz and carey dunne the well respected prosecutors who led the manhattan district attorney s office investigation into former president donald trump s business dealings have left the building and the leak of pomerantz s resignation letter excoriating district attorney alvin bragg s decision to drop what the prosecutors believed was a meritorious case means they ve gone out with a bang under these unusual circumstances bragg should stop saying that his office continues to conduct the investigation into trump unless it s really ongoing that doesn t seem to be the case in light of the noisy resignation of the veteran prosecutors the shuttering of the grand jury next month and the reported return of evidence to witnesses if the investigation is really closed the better practice would be within constraints prosecutors are obligated to observe like grand jury secrecy to offer the public an explanation of what happened and why pomerantz s resignation letter makes clear that bragg made the decision to end a long standing investigation over the objections of line prosecutors pomerantz is a prosecutor with formidable expertise in complicated cases like the one the office was reportedly building against trump and the veteran litigator is not known for hyperbole or grandstanding the letter stated his belief that we have evidence sufficient to establish mr trump s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt although we do not have access to all the evidence prosecutors reviewed both exculpatory and inculpatory the public record betrays a strong case for bringing an indictment two of us explained why in a lengthy report last year concluding that trump faced liability for offenses including falsifying business records but let s be clear that the disagreement is on the merits we reject any insinuation that trump somehow got to bragg part of the reason to hold trump accountable is the principle that our public life deserves better than conspiracy theories that corrode our civic institutions the people who rightly seek accountability for trump shouldn t contribute to the degradation of our public life by making evidence free insinuations about bragg advertisement still the case appears now to be closed or on life support at best if that s the situation bragg could do the public a service by leveling with us about his decision making and the status of his investigation all of us have served as government prosecutors or investigators so we know well that officials don t usually comment on ongoing investigations or explain decisions not to prosecute law enforcement methods can be sensitive and public discussions of uncharged conduct risk tarring innocent people but the public discussion has long been smoldering here and now pomerantz s letter has set it ablaze if the investigation really is ongoing bragg should clearly and plainly explain what the stock phrase that the investigation is continuing means here the letter should not have been leaked but now that it has been if bragg disagrees with pomerantz he should say so prosecutors sometimes do discuss in high profile cases why they declined to prosecute because it is in the public interest that they do so bragg is a public servant who owes that to the public advertisement there is precedent to support the public benefit when prosecutors take this path a few years ago then gov andrew m cuomo abruptly shut down new york state s moreland commission investigation into public corruption apparently because the commission s inquiries got too close to cuomo himself one of us was the commission s lead investigator the then u s attorney for the southern district of new york preet bharara seized the commission s records and continued its critically important work over months of diligent inquiry share this article share but when the federal investigation into the commission s closure did not reveal provable misconduct by cuomo even though it did result in the prosecutions and convictions of the two heads of the state legislature bharara took the unusual step of publicly explaining his decision not to prosecute he didn t avoid moral judgment lamenting the commission s premature closure but he was also straightforward about what happened absent any additional proof that may develop he explained there is insufficient evidence to prove a federal crime the decision was disappointing to some but explaining it publicly was the right thing to do because it enhanced public confidence in our system of justice and our rule of law the same is true here bragg himself also has set a strong precedent for transparency and disclosure some of us publicly supported bragg s day 1 memo which articulated clear policies about prosecution and pretrial detention we did so not just because it was good evidence driven public safety and civil rights policy but because it is good democratic practice to tell the public what prosecutors are doing and why that visibility into prosecutorial policies is unusual but important advertisement virtually unchecked prosecutorial discretion is the hallmark of our criminal legal system which as one influential scholar observed operates in the shadow of prosecutors preferences data coming out of the justice system is notoriously erratic too the key touchpoint of citizen involvement in the investigation and charging process the grand jury is secret and even once charges become public we see almost nothing of what happens in the legal system where public trials are vanishingly rare so we don t get to see what prosecutors do or how they think pomerantz s memo offered rare insight although he himself lacked the authority to make the ultimate decision about whether to prosecute that authority rests with bragg and as a result he should follow the approach the u s attorney s office took in the moreland case and make his views public opacity contributes to the increasingly prevalent belief that trump is teflon coated when it comes to criminal charges nothing sticks americans can t say with confidence any longer that no one is above the law since that is exactly where one man apparently has resided for so long

this recession indicator is flashing a warning sign file pedestrians walk past the new york stock exchange on thursday feb 24 2022 stocks are posting modest gains in early trading on wall street monday march 21 2022 led by energy companies as crude oil prices take another turn higher ap photo seth wenig file cnn the bond market is flashing a warning sign that has correctly predicted almost every recession over the past 60 years a potential inversion of the us treasury note yield curve an inverted yield curve is often seen as a signal that investors are more nervous about the immediate future than the longer term spurring interest rates on short term bonds to move higher than those paid on long term bonds while the curve isn t inverted yet it s getting close that shouldn t be particularly surprising given how russia s invasion of ukraine and its economic ramifications continue to weigh heavily on the global economy treasury notes are essentially a loan to the us government and are generally seen as a safe bet for investors since there is little risk the loan won t be paid back these government bonds have seen a flood of interest in recent weeks amid geopolitical uncertainty and tightening financial conditions the federal reserve said last week it is considering as many as six more rate hikes in 2022 alone that s making investors lose their appetite for stocks and other more volatile assets and turn to dependable investments like treasuries but as more people rush to buy bonds that causes the yield to fall which ends up making them a less attractive investment some investors are even starting to seek out assets like bitcoin and cash which traditionally offer less stability than bonds a 10 year treasury note typically delivers a higher rate of return than shorter term notes since an investor s money is committed for longer shorter duration treasury notes such as a 2 year or a 3 year bond generally offer lower yields because risks are more predictable than over a longer time horizon but when the return on a 10 year note is lower than the 2 year that indicates a pessimistic outlook on the part of investors and a reluctance to commit their money and yields are heading in that direction the spread between the 10 year treasury note and the 2 year note currently sits at around 0 2 compared to around 1 5 a year ago a yield curve inversion has preceded every single recession since 1955 according to research from the federal reserve bank of san francisco an inversion doesn t mean stocks are about to go into meltdown while an inversion generally indicates a recession is coming within the following 12 months it can sometimes take years the curve inverted in 2005 but the great recession didn t start until 2007 the most recent inversion in 2019 prompted fears of a recession which materialized in 2020 but that was due to covid 19 regardless some market participants are sounding the alarm bell i think there very well could be a recession or even worse activist investor carl icahn said tuesday in an interview with cnbc we have a strong hedge on against the long positions short term i don t even predict there is at least a one in three chance the us economy will have a recession over the next 12 months moody s analytics chief economist mark zandi told cnn on thursday the harder the fed steps on the brakes the higher the probability the car seizes up and the economy goes into recession zandi said

i figured i d better write this column while doing so is still legal at least i think it is but i don t recommend reading it aloud in a third grade classroom there s a piece of legislation sitting in the house veterans affairs committee h r 5905 that cuts a swath 75 years deep into american history and attempts to undo the sort of wrong we re no longer supposed to talk about in the classroom introduced in november by reps james clyburn and seth moulton the bill called the sgt isaac woodard jr and sgt joseph h maddox gi bill restoration act of 2021 would give black veterans of world war ii or uh their descendants the benefits of the famous gi bill signed by fdr in 1944 that they were denied at the time belated thank you for your service in essence the bill would finally allow african american vets from the great war or their direct descendants access to loan assistance to buy a house and or attend college clyburn puts it this way on his website in 1944 president franklin d roosevelt signed the gi bill into law in theory the gi bill represented a promise from the country to the people who fought on its behalf that their sacrifice would be rewarded with the opportunity to attend college and build generational wealth in practice generations of black veterans of world war ii and their descendants were robbed of this promise because of jim crow and the wide racial disparity in the bill s implementation while the gi bill was race neutral the lay of the land was such in those days prior to the civil rights movement that there was no way the country would suddenly allow its pretend values all men are created equal yeah sure to actually start shaping the nation s social structure we were fierce about holding our enemies hitler stalin et al accountable to such values but here at home jim crow ruled the veterans administration adopted the federal housing administration s well documented racially exclusive housing programs when it began to insure mortgages for returning veterans clyburn s website notes big developments like levittown and daly city built after world war ii were financed in part by the veterans administration with the same racial restrictions the fha had black veterans also lacked full access to the gi bill s education assistance programs nineteen percent of white world war ii veterans earned a college degree as a result of the gi bill compared to only six percent of black veterans the bill is named in honor of two african american vets of world war ii who unintentionally found their way into the historical record because of what was done to them one of them sgt joseph maddox had been accepted into a master s program at harvard but sorry man the va denied him financial assistance to avoid setting a precedent the other vet honored in the bill s name sgt isaac woodard experienced jim crow america slightly differently as a billy club in the eye in february 1946 he had just been discharged after three and a half years of service to his country and was taking the bus home to a small town in south carolina he was still in uniform apparently he thought he had earned sufficient respect as a soldier to ask the bus driver if he could please pull into a rest stop so he could use the bathroom the driver refused they had an argument and at the next stop he ordered woodard off the bus then hell broke loose police officers at the bus stop took woodard into custody one of the officers demanded to know if woodard was discharged when he acknowledged that he was the officer began hitting him with a billy club woodard fought back was knocked unconscious for a moment then as he said in a sworn affidavit when i started to get up he started punching me in the eyes with the end of his billy woodard was blinded for life and oh yeah the officer who clubbed him went to trial six months later he was acquitted by an all white jury after 30 minutes of deliberation there were other consequences as well including national outrage and financial support for woodard and his family and president truman shocked by what had happened created a presidential commission on civil rights and in 1948 at the commission s recommendation signed an executive order to desegregate the u s military but ultimately it was pretty much forgotten jim crow mostly kept getting what he wanted at least for a few more decades to what extent have things changed today h r 5905 sits in committee perhaps it will come up for a vote in the near future perhaps it will even pass my sense is that most of the country despite the anti critical race theory pseudo evangelism that is sweeping republican controlled state legislatures is willing to face its history with honesty and perhaps a shrug change minimal or otherwise is impossible without a willingness to look directly at the way things were the political opposition to looking honestly at american history in the classroom and who knows what might be targeted next maybe congress is saturated with irony the claim is that what they call crt an academic term stolen and redefined by the political right teaches white kids to be ashamed of themselves and maintains that all white people are racist it s a preposterous lie but ironic in that a racist worldview does indeed make such simplistic claims about the inferior races unable to see beyond such thinking the anti crt crowd is feeling their own racism turned back on them and they re doing it to themselves meanwhile small change trickles in earlier this month for instance the u s senate declared lynching to be a federal hate crime as the guardian pointed out such efforts had failed for more than a century but globally racism flourishes along with war non white ukrainian refugees for instance have been getting denied entry into other european countries illustrating as peniel joseph put it at cnn a global crisis of racism inequity and anti immigrant xenophobia he adds that this is not a concern secondary to the violence but inextricably a part of it war can t be waged without first dehumanizing the chosen enemy how is this different from racism robert koehler syndicated by peacevoice is a chicago award winning journalist and editor he is the author of courage grows strong at the wound

better dwelling housing analyst stephen punwasi addressed the canadian house of commons standing committee on finance this week his comments elucidate why the number of canadians expecting to buy a home has fallen by a third in 2022 and why the solution to unaffordable housing is less credit not more supply read better dwellings opening statement before the senate standing committee on finance here s a taste a few months ago the bank of canada set out to prove low rates lowered the cost of housing and whoops not what happens they found consumers adjust their budget to incorporate the excess credit available thus inflating the price of homes for everyone buyers didn t see lower carrying costs but they paid a larger principal for the past 30 years central banks thought they were making housing more affordable with lower rates it turns out no one did the math until recently why are these points important in october canadian inflation was at 4 7 points more than double the target rate remember the qe program mentioned earlier the one with the single purpose of creating more inflation it was still running at this point as canada s banks literally wrote to clients to say the central bank was recklessly ignoring its own research it s like the bank of canada is stepping on the gas and saying the car won t slow down due to external factors there is a supply shortage failing to meet demand is the narrative let s talk about that demand quickly this isn t regular demand but demand stimulated by low interest rates bmo estimates a third of existing home sales are excess due to low rate stimulus sales are just off the record high not an economically repressed level that needs stimulus low rates don t stimulate selling though it only creates more competition to inflate prices

by martin armstrong our models have confirmed that biden s sanctions against all russians have undeniably destroyed the global economy unfortunately precisely on time from its birth in 1950 our capital flow models have confirmed that there has been an unprecedented cash outflow from china following biden s sanctions not only are we witnessing a withdrawal of western capital from china realizing that the us has no interest in peace and china will be next but we are also looking at collapsing confidence in globalization continuing from here on out our models have confirmed a highly unusual change in direction of the global capital flows which is even showing up in the emerging markets china saw investors pull out from its share markets over concerns that we are clearly headed into world war iii historically the capital flows to the dollar during world war under the assumption that tanks will not be landing on the beaches of virginia or california this will tend to support the dollar but not long term biden s sanctions attacking individual russians have turned into a nightmare besides the czech republic seizing all assets of any russian based upon their ethnicity as they were doing to the japanese during world war ii in the united states now even switzerland is doing the same thing these sanctions are not going to cause regime change and the overthrow of putin with russians running into the arms of the west this is outright hatred of russians as a people and they will have no choice but bond with china in an all out war against this outrageous tyranny i seriously doubt that biden even understands what he is doing at the directions of these neocons who have infiltrated the white house these neocons are bringing the entire world to destruction which some argue is all part of their plan to enable the world to build back better which necessitates the destruction of the current energy system and reduction of population to make bill gates sleep easy at night so the next season of build back better may be the climax we are primarily funded by readers please subscribe and donate to support us our model has always picked up the shifts in capital flows that precede war this time we are witnessing outflows not just from china but also from all emerging markets on a scale that is simply unprecedented the timing of outflows is clearly linked to biden s unprecedented sanctions against the russian people not just russia itself as a political state this has never taken place in history before with the single exception of the us sanctions imposed on japan and the freezing of all their assets in the united states which preceded pearl harbor it pains me to have to even write this today but clearly those who understand where this is going is to world war iii and make no mistake about it this is intentional even the official data has revealed that foreign investors have sold a net 5 5 billion of chinese government bonds in the last few weeks biden stupidly threatened china that if they support russia they will suffer the same sanctions this is just insane and it is deliberately trying to destroy the entire world economy even from nato secretary general jens stoltenberg said at a press conference on march 24 china must not provide economic or military support for the russian invasion the previous day he accused beijing of spreading blatant lies and misinformation what they are calling misinformation is anything that challenges the west s own propaganda they want war for the demands of putin are reasonable ukraine remains neutral surrender donbas and crimea which are all ethnic russians when zelensky passed the language law that russian is no longer to be an official language in ukraine that is the same as telling all spanish if you do not speak english get out all we can do is write to every political leader and demand accountability for the biden administration is out to build back better but that requires total destruction first
by john mauldin back in the good old days recessions were simply the unpleasant part of the business cycle consumer choices exuberant businesses and monetary policy would periodically generate growth contractions we debated the timing but recessions didn t come out of the blue then in 2020 a recession did come out of the blue or nearly so when covid unexpectedly changed behavior working from home avoiding travel etc caused a sudden drop in services demand and thus recession this wasn t part of the business cycle now it s 2022 and another strange recession looms that s right i m calling it recession is here or will be soon and unfortunately it will be a global recession like the covid recession this one has little to do with the business cycle it s a recession of choice not your choice or mine but vladimir putin s he clearly miscalculated how hard capturing ukraine would be and how the west would react most recessions are preceded by an inverted yield curve when long bond rates drop below short bond rates further the inversion had to go relatively deep and last for some time to really be reliable as a recession predictor when i called a recession in 2001 and in 2007 those conditions existed like a fever indicates something is wrong in your body an inverted yield curve tells us there is something wrong in our economic body in this case the economy was already slowing down and at stall speed we ll look at some data to demonstrate that but this war will make it worse and the longer it goes the worse it will get i don t see the sanctions ending as long as putin stays in power further i think western countries will change who they rely upon for energy in any event we always get through recessions and there will be a recovery it s not the end of the world just a readjustment but regardless we re here and i think we ll be here for quite some time that seventies show this recession is strange for another reason too most recessions are deflationary negative growth and rising prices don t normally occur together unemployed people have little choice but to reduce spending so most businesses lack pricing power however a recession can be inflationary when accompanied by a supply shock in essential goods then you get falling growth and rising prices at the same time an especially miserable combination we call this stagflation stagnation inflation and it last occurred in the 1970s and for similar reasons higher energy prices in that case they came from the arab oil embargo this time it s a buyer s embargo as western countries stop trade with russia since most of that trade is energy related energy prices are rising but it won t be just energy prices benchmarks like the consumer price index report something called core inflation this is the full index minus the food and energy categories we laugh at it because actual consumers don t have the option of omitting food and energy spending but this figure actually has a point food and energy are the starting point for almost everything else food is a kind of energy it just powers humans instead of machines louis gave likes to say all economic activity is simply energy transformed we pull coal oil etc out of the ground process them and after several steps we have cars computers and all other goods without energy it never gets that far we expect volatility in food and energy prices at some point it seeps into the price of other goods and services that is a sign of more serious inflation which is why the fed watches core pce we have a problem beyond just normal volatility if it s rising functionally higher energy prices are similar to a tax increase yes we can do things to reduce the burden but it s hard to escape we have to keep the lights and heat on have fuel to drive to work and so on on a percentage basis a 1 cent rise in gasoline costs the us economy 1 4 billion that means we have the equivalent of a 200 billion tax increase hitting the economy this year that s not including the food costs and other energy increases that work their way through the market by the way the 4 19 gas price this chart shows is a national average my eight kids in texas oklahoma colorado and florida tell me they see much higher source ycharts the macro effects of all this take time at first people just grumble but eventually they start changing their behavior they stop taking the boat out on weekends don t drive to the beach as often look for jobs closer to home maybe they try to sell the giant suv and find it s not worth as much as they thought this affects their confidence so they reduce other spending and because inflation is higher than their wage increases they feel even more pressure businesses experience similar changes those in fuel intensive segments airlines delivery construction see their costs rise quickly at some point they have to raise prices which makes their customers look for alternatives or stop buying all this continues until something ends the supply demand imbalance that caused the initial energy shock that could be new supply reduced demand or a combination of both one thing that makes commodities different from other goods is their fungibility oil is oil wheat is wheat regardless of origin yes i know there are different grades and varieties they matter but we re talking macro here so if as happened this week the us and uk ban imported russian oil the global oil supply may not change much russia will sell that oil to someone else while the us and uk find other sellers everyone typically is still buying and selling the same amounts they were before just from different counterparties but it s not clear this will go that way the economic sanctions disrupt the financial mechanisms that permit russian trade and even if they didn t it may not be possible to deliver the oil to other buyers pipeline and shipping capacity have limits china buys a lot of russian oil now but they get it from eastern russia the oil produced further north and west there are no pipelines to get it to china cheaply it will take years to build the infrastructure to redirect not just russian oil but grain and everything else another open question is how long russia can sustain oil and gas production at the current amounts much of it is was operated by western companies that have now left using equipment and technology that sooner or later will need maintenance and spare parts balancing that is the possibility of increased production from elsewhere opec has unused capacity it could bring online fairly soon us officials are reportedly talking to iran and venezuela some us shale companies might be able to produce more all those would help but we don t know how much or for how long fully replacing russian energy exports seems unlikely which means energy prices will stay elevated for some time long story short energy spikes preceded almost every recession for the last 80 years we now have another one source pictet asset management toxic brew the other aspect of this not yet getting as much attention as it should is the very real possibility of global food shortages russia and ukraine are both major grain exporters spring planting season will be difficult for farmers in the battle zones meanwhile the same economic sanctions that hinder russian energy exports will have a similar effect on agricultural goods that s why wheat futures prices have been hitting their daily limit this next chart shows you the importance of ukraine and russia to important grains and oils source geopolitical futures last week we sent over my shoulder members a fascinating and somewhat terrifying report about egypt s food crisis the staple diet in that nation of 105 million people relies on large imports of wheat and sunflower oil some 85 of the wheat comes from russia and ukraine and 73 of the sunflower oil no surprise egypt s government is not aboard the sanctions train it has no choice food is first particularly in a country where food inflation has brought down more than one regime the opposite is more normal cairo heavily subsidizes food prices to maintain order how is that going to work now with dramatically higher import prices and a worldwide recession to boot if egypt continues subsidizing food which is likely it will cost the country multiple billions of dollars that it really doesn t have now multiply this challenge by dozens of other developing countries on top of the human suffering and possible starvation the economic effects could be giant governments that have to subsidize food prices may have to skimp on servicing foreign debts lenders could receive rude surprises which leads nowhere good when financial markets are already overleveraged and overvalued look at how important ukraine and russia are to these mediterranean countries source geopolitical futures it gets worse the money governments redirect to basic needs is money that won t be spent on infrastructure education and other productivity enhancing projects this will further reduce growth now imagine you are a us tech giant that does business in all these markets and has been counting on growth there to justify your stock valuation how will that go you can see the toxic brew before us and there s yet more normal recessions end when consumers and businesses make adjustments sufficient to restore growth that hope is slim this time at least in the short term as i noted last week this is change squared the entire world order is experiencing a shock adjustment economically geopolitically and otherwise we are not going back to january 2022 that world is gone even if putin and zelensky reach some kind of cease fire agreement soon we are primarily funded by readers please subscribe and donate to support us my friend vitaliy katsenelsen whose coming to america story i sent you in december has been following russian media and talking to friends who still live there he is not optimistic about putin losing power more the opposite in a chilling tweet he said they are preparing to turn russia into north korea that parallel if accurate is economically problematic north korea has been cut off from most of the world economy for decades yet the regime survives the sanctions we have placed on russia while necessary and certainly preferable to a wider war could last a long long time i think we can adjust to a world split between two blocs with limited interaction i don t see how we complete the adjustment this year though shifting supply chains takes time and creating new production facilities takes even more time and money misery index all this is happening as the economy and markets are already on thin ice in my annual forecast letter i called 2022 a path dependent year with jerome powell s path being the one that would matter most as of last week he was still saying the fed will likely raise rates this month that is unfortunately the right move i say unfortunately because he might not now face the prospect of tightening as we enter recession if the fed had started this process a year ago as i and other observers called for but here we are we learned this week the consumer price index rose 7 9 in february this data is pre war and doesn t reflect the latest food and energy spikes they will certainly drive it far higher that means unless the fed shocks us with a far bigger hike than anyone expects real interest rates will get even more negative than they are now one way to bring this kind of inflation under control is to sharply reduce aggregate demand higher interest rates are the fed s only tool for doing that will two or three percentage points spread over a few years suffice that is a long time to suffer very negative real rates the other way is to increase supply but the geopolitical circumstances plus the significant headwinds from government permitting in key industries make it difficult in the short term moving on we may see something i m not sure has ever happened usually an inverted yield curve signals impending recession as of now it s getting closer but not yet fully inverted that s not surprising if as noted this recession is not due to the usual business cycle the fed may have to intentionally create an inverted yield curve to keep inflation manageable would powell actually do that i think the answer is yes because he does not want to go down as former fed chair arthur burns who allowed inflation to get out of hand in the 70s that doesn t mean he is paul volcker though i think he will likely proceed too cautiously but there is a real possibility for him to surprise on the upside in terms of interest rates i don t expect to see an easy monetary policy until inflation is under control long term rates are still relatively low despite the fed tapering down its bond purchases but that s been under the assumption this inflation would recede in the next year or so we are now in a significantly different environment if bond investors come to believe inflation is shifting permanently higher long term rates will rise as will mortgage rates which won t be good for housing and all the jobs and economic activity that sector represents finally let s note the economy can cause a lot of pain even if not formally in recession i ve written several times about gdp s flaws as a growth indicator the covid era s wild swings further prove the point i can imagine plenty of scenarios where gdp growth stays slightly positive but we are still in a world of hurt velocity banks and the dollar the velocity of money is now back at great depression levels this is due in part to an overwhelming debt burden we run massive deficits increasing our debt and somehow think we won t turn japanese source david bahnsen contributing to this is the inability of banks to find creditworthy borrowers even though they re awash with capital banks shouldn t lend without reasonable certainty of being repaid and in today s environment that s difficult this chart from hoisington investment management illustrates the issue note how far the loan to deposit ratio has dropped in the last two years previous drops of this magnitude were all in periods of uncertainty source hoisington investment management the dollar has risen over 10 in less than a year the federal reserve is going to raise rates which should further strengthen the dollar this actually helps us inflation but it makes dollar denominated debt troublesome in other countries especially emerging market economies source tradingview com when russia defaulted on its debt in 1998 there was a flight to quality and the dollar strengthened but that put pressure on asian countries that had borrowed heavily in dollar denominated loans they couldn t repay which created a crisis that ended up sinking long term capital management while china is not necessarily an emerging market it does have a lot of dollar denominated debt which is under great pressure this chart from david rosenberg source rosenberg research that same phenomenon is playing out all over the world similar to 1998 many companies and countries are simply not going to be able to pay their dollar denominated debts not while they re trying to feed themselves and pay for their energy this is not going to be just a us recession its will be a global recession which is going to make it worse for many countries it will be a depression the us may have had a recession in any event because we are coming off a stimulus high but it would probably have been a milder one now it will likely be longer and deeper but nobody knows the world will have to adjust to supply chain and sanction problems that will take time people are trying to deal with 8 inflation the impact will vary but it will be difficult for many it is time to get realistic about what we as a nation can and can t do what we can and can t afford we need an operation warp speed for energy and supply chains and all manner of projects none of us asked for this we re getting it anyway the administration and congress need to start acting like this is a wartime economy because unless we work together it will be incomplete homework and speech recognition this week s letter feels like incomplete homework there is so much more i want to say and i know i m going to get questions about the ramifications of a recession etc i imagine we ll be talking about those questions and ramifications for the next few weeks having made this call i am sure people will once again refer to me as a permabear that is not so i ve been bullish more than i have been bearish and i ve now made three recession calls in 22 years hardly permabear status if you have questions for me you can use the comment thread on our website or reply to this letter i will get to them over the next few weeks or you can go to twitter and reply to one of my notes and yes you should be following me on twitter with that i will hit the send button and wish you a great week your knowing this recession will end not just when analyst john mauldin

when one sits down to make a deal with the devil it is the devil who usually wins that s because he is crafty as the book of genesis describes him the united states and iran appear on the cusp of a deal that president biden and his diplomats claim will prevent iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon in the short term in exchange for a deal that won t be worth the paper it is written on the u s appears ready to release huge amounts of cash to the ayatollah khamenei who still wants america and israel eliminated and remove iran s revolutionary guard from its list of international terrorists this is self delusion at its worst that russia remains a primary negotiator in light of war crimes it is committing against ukraine makes this potential deal even more incredible just one among many quotes from the ayatollah ought to be taken seriously today america poses a threat to peace and security in the world therefore the slogan death to america is no longer used only by our people today you see throughout the world people setting fire to the effigy of the american president and chanting the slogan death to america this is because of the american regime s exaggerated demands its arrogance its vanity and its desire to control and because it is a pawn in the hands of the zionists how can someone who has called america the great satan be trusted to honor any deal iran has consistently denied it is developing a bomb and claims its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes is there anyone who believes that former president donald trump didn t believe it and imposed severe sanctions on iran advertisement when we sit down with leaders of a nation who do not share american values and wish to destroy those values we will get up from the negotiating table with a deal that guarantees a further step down the road to instability at best and at worst our and israel s destruction former jerusalem post columnist caroline glick presents clear thinking in this post on her website the deal that biden is concluding with iran is itself a stunning testament to the radicalism of the biden team and its refusal to let reality interfere with its policies it will provide iran with 90 billion from sanctions relief that astronomical sum guarantees massive cash infusions into the coffers of iran s in house global terrorist organization the islamic revolutionary guards corps which biden is set to remove from the state department s list of foreign terrorist organizations and to iran s terror armies in lebanon yemen iraq syria and the gaza strip iran will have the funds to expand its missile and drone capabilities and thanks to the lax restrictions it will face on its nuclear operations it will become a nuclear threshold state by 2025 at the latest even some democrats oppose the deal the new york times reported on a speech by senate foreign relations committee chairman robert menendez d nj on feb 1 i ask why we would try to simply go back to the j c p o a a deal that was not sufficient in the first place and still doesn t address some of the most serious national security concerns we have it s a good question and deserves an answer any deal should come before the senate for ratification but if the administration doesn t call it a treaty the senate will likely be bypassed which would be a big mistake on several levels the biden administration seems desperate for any victory in view of its disastrous withdrawal from afghanistan inflation that is the highest in 40 years a fluctuating stock market hurting retirees high gas and food prices and a continuing decline in the president s favorability ratings making a deal with the iranian devil will not reverse the public s view of the administration s failures it will only make them worse cal thomas is a syndicated columnist and author readers may email him at tcaeditors tribpub com send questions comments to the editors previous next

you can now subscribe to our you can now subscribe to our economic times whatsapp channel on the second day of the war tanya quit her job as a tax accountant in massachusetts and told her husband that she had to go home to ukraine her sister and her sister s two teenage sons were holed up in the bathroom of their home in mariupol a seaside city that was getting shelled tanya got a text from her we re so scared by the sixth day of the war her sister s water had been cut they couldn t even flush the toilet we ll use the cat litter box her sister wrote go to a bomb shelter tanya urged then suddenly the text messages stopped tanya sobbed imagining them dead but her father who lives in the pro russian city of donetsk in eastern ukraine didn t believe that russian troops would hurt them he called it fake news dismissing the images of destruction he sent her video of russian soldiers saying don t be afraid we just came here to free you tanya cursed him out and blocked him on her messaging app the next day she caught a flight to poland i met tanya in boston s airport on march 2 as we waited for a flight to warsaw i saw her ukrainian passport and her eyes puffy from crying and asked her to tell me her story i ended up traveling with her to the ukrainian border and have kept in touch with her ever since tanya is a nickname she didn t want to use her real name to protect her parents who she feared might face retaliation in donetsk for her choices the war in ukraine is often portrayed as a battle between autocracy and democracy the east against the west tanya s story reveals that for many families it can also feel like a civil war pitting the old against the young tanya s parents support russia even now we are russian her father told her old people in donetsk like tanya s parents are nostalgic about the soviet union she told me they are the welcoming committee that vladimir putin told russians to expect when he ordered this invasion but tanya like so many russian speakers of her generation sided with ukraine people my age or younger she said they don t want to go back every ukrainian i interviewed who grew up speaking russian at home had a story like tanya s russian speakers who make up roughly one quarter of ukraine s population were favored during the soviet era but tanya s generation came of age as communism crumbled they became ukrainian in a way their parents never did volodymyr zelenskyy a russian speaker young enough to be putin s son is a prime example of this he was elected ukraine s president with a wide majority and many of his supporters wanted him to stop russia from meddling in ukraine s affairs he did so more boldly than any previous ukrainian president had dared tanya was born in volnovakha a town outside donetsk in 1978 she turned 11 the year the berlin wall fell and was 13 when ukrainians voted overwhelmingly to break away from the soviet union she says she was the first in her class to resign from the pioneers a communist version of the girl scouts she d always hated the propaganda about grandpa lenin and the expectation that she should never let her brightness show back then panties came in one color beige if you wanted it black you had to dye it she told me the dye stained her mother s midriff somehow tanya knew that better underwear was out there even if she d never seen it she learned the ukrainian language in college when she was 20 she d always been told that it was the tongue of country bumpkins educated people spoke russian nonetheless tanya fell in love with it but she didn t actually feel ukrainian until 2013 at age 35 when protests in kyiv swept president viktor yanukovych from power after he backed out of a trade deal with the european union tanya agreed with the protesters but her parents were outraged that yanukovych a president they d voted for had been chased away by an unruly mob they dismissed it as a coup that had been financed by the united states they joined a protest in the city square putin come and help us they chanted in 2014 her parents voted to break away from ukraine and form the self proclaimed donetsk people s republic and the war in that region began i call it the donetsk retired people s republic tanya told me rolling her eyes pro russian separatists had been battling the ukrainian army over the city for months when tanya packed her car and moved to free ukraine like nearly every other young person she knew she eventually settled in mariupol a charming city by the sea that was home to some 400 000 people tanya fell in love with an american she d met online and moved to the united states in 2020 her sister took over her rented apartment then tanya helped her buy a cozy house in the center of mariupol a block from city hall tanya kept in close touch with her parents too although she avoided talking to them about politics during the pandemic her parents sent her videos from donetsk of their rooster and the apple trees at the house where windows had once been shattered by a mine explosion during the years of conflict the war over donetsk seemed endless tanya s parents blamed ukraine complaining that it was trying to kill them to avoid paying for their retirement nobody tanya knew in mariupol expected russia to invade they all thought the russian troops amassing on the borders were a bluff tanya urged her sister to stock up on food just in case she watched the mayor of mariupol encourage city residents to stand strong as the russians attacked she heard from friends in kyiv who were signing up to fight she decided that she had to do something so she collected supplies for ukraine a group called sunflower of peace gave her medicine she bought more with her own money she filled three huge suitcases with drone parts insulin painkillers tourniquets and a brand of coagulant called bleedstop we landed in warsaw on the eighth day of the war a polish man tanya knew had agreed to drive her to the ukrainian border where she planned to hand off the supplies to a friend of a friend who would take them deeper into ukraine i wanted to go to the border too so i caught a ride during the five hour drive tanya sat in the back seat lost in thought she d gotten a text from her sister who had finally made it to a bomb shelter but the shelter had no electricity and almost no food or water tanya s sister and her sons had tried to leave to look for food but a mine exploded right in front of them forcing them to run back inside one of the sons had hurt his leg a few days later russian airstrikes destroyed a hospital maternity ward and the following week a theater where hundreds had taken shelter a bomb left a giant crater near tanya s sister s house mariupol was becoming a death trap tanya s sister s phone fell silent again but tanya s parents still refused to blame russia instead they echoed russian propaganda and said ukrainian nazis were killing their own people to whip up hatred against russia during the drive to the border tanya s polish friend told me that putin was like a cornered rat a dangerous thing he conceded that ukrainians had made some mistakes they probably shouldn t have passed a divisive law that reinforced ukrainian as the sole state language that had inflamed russian speakers like tanya s parents and for too long ukrainian nationalism had rested on the likes of stepan bandera a nationalist leader who tried to get ukraine out from the grip of the soviet union by collaborating with nazi germany a statue of bandera had been erected in lviv fueling russian propaganda that casts ukraine s government as nazis it didn t help either that the azov battalion a regiment with far right fighters and origins is among the defenders of mariupol but now ukrainians are more focused on their survival before the war tanya told me about half of her friends could have lived happily under either russia or ukraine now she said none of them want russia ukraine is solidifying as a country even as it is being destroyed we arrived at the polish border town of korczowa and searched for oksana the wife of a border guard who made daily trips ferrying supplies from poland into ukraine we waited for her at a shopping mall that had been turned into a welcome center for refugees it was a surreal scene mannequins in fashionable clothes presided over rows of cots crowded with women who had fled with nothing but backpacks children and pets tanya walked through the mall and burst into tears thinking about her sister oksana arrived she hugged tanya and lit a cigarette with manicured nails everything is ok she told tanya smiling they are fighting kyiv was holding strong oksana thanked tanya for the supplies then she listed other items that ukrainians needed flak jackets walkie talkies thermal vision goggles generators that night tanya and i parted ways i went to another border checkpoint she returned to warsaw to find more supplies she made three more trips to the border then she crossed over into ukraine i kept in touch with her and asked about her sister day after day she had no word the last she had heard was that her sister had joined a humanitarian convoy but it had been turned back because of shooting tanya spoke with bitterness about city officials of mariupol who posted sad faced messages on facebook from safe havens outside the country i wondered how long the city could hold on to end this war are there any compromises you would be willing to make i asked her in a text should zelenskyy give up mariupol nope she replied if we compromise we lose our sovereignty the war would only be postponed this has got to be our final battle she wrote back on the 20th day of the war tanya finally got through on the phone to a man in mariupol who was staying with her sister s neighbor she d heard there would be a pause in the fighting to allow a humanitarian convoy out of the city today is a good chance to escape tanya told him she asked him to tell her sister to leave right away save their lives she pleaded tanya s sister crammed her sons her cat and another family from the bomb shelter into her kia ceed five days later they arrived in western ukraine at a place that tanya had arranged tanya hadn t spoken to her parents in weeks but on their mother s birthday she called home this is your birthday gift tanya told her mother your daughter and your grandsons survived

washington dc february 25 2022 the executive board of the international monetary fund imf concluded the article iv consultation1 with sri lanka sri lanka has been hit hard by covid 19 on the eve of the pandemic the country was highly vulnerable to external shocks owing to inadequate external buffers and high risks to public debt sustainability exacerbated by the easter sunday terrorist attacks in 2019 and major policy changes including large tax cuts at late 2019 real gdp contracted by 3 6 percent in 2020 due to a loss of tourism receipts and necessary lockdown measures sri lanka lost access to international sovereign bond market at the onset of the pandemic the authorities deployed a prompt and broad based set of relief measures to cope with the impact of the pandemic including macroeconomic policy stimulus an increase in social safety net spending and loan repayment moratoria for affected businesses these measures were complemented by a strong vaccination drive gdp growth is projected to have recovered to 3 6 percent in 2021 with mobility indicators largely back to their pre pandemic levels and tourist arrivals starting to recover in late 2021 nonetheless annual fiscal deficits exceeded 10 percent of gdp in 2020 and 2021 due to the pre pandemic tax cuts weak revenue performance in the wake of the pandemic and expenditure measures to combat the pandemic limited availability of external financing for the government has resulted in a large amount of central bank direct financing of the budget public debt is projected to have risen from 94 percent of gdp in 2019 to 119 percent of gdp in 2021 large foreign exchange fx debt service payments by the government and a wider current account deficit have led to a significant fx shortage in the economy the official exchange rate has been effectively pegged to the u s dollar since april 2021 the economic outlook is constrained by sri lanka s debt overhang as well as persistently large fiscal and balance of payments financing needs gdp growth is projected to be negatively affected by the impact of the fx shortage and macroeconomic imbalances on economic activities and business confidence inflation recently accelerated to 14 percent y y in january 2022 and is projected to remain double digit in the coming quarters exceeding the target band of 4 6 percent as strong inflationary pressures have built up from both supply and demand sides since mid 2021 under current policies and the authorities commitment to preserve the tax cuts fiscal deficit is projected to remain large over 2022 26 raising public debt further over the medium term due to persistent external debt service burden international reserves would remain inadequate despite the authorities ongoing efforts to secure fx financing from external sources the outlook is subject to large uncertainties with risks tilted to the downside unless the fiscal and balance of payments financing needs are met the country could experience significant contractions in imports and private credit growth or monetary instability in case of further central bank financing of fiscal deficits additional downside risks include a covid 19 resurgence rising commodity prices worse than expected agricultural production a potential deterioration in banks asset quality and extreme weather events upside risks include a faster than

the bidweek price landscape was able to continue the improvements seen in april bidweek and all but a handful of points recorded gains for may neither month appeared to be living up to its billing as a fall off shoulder month thengi national bidweek average for may rose a healthy 14 cents from april to 1 82 with rocky mountain and california points well into double digit gains of actively traded points el paso non bondad recorded the largest gain at 28 cents to 1 80 while only five points scattered across the u s and canada were in the red with the largest drop coming at northwest sumas in the rockies down 8 cents to average 1 34 while the 1 82 national average represented an increase over april it still fell 47 cents shy of the may 2015 average of 2 29 all regions of the country found themselves in positive territory with california in front with a 23 cent gain to 1 94 and south louisiana at the other end with just an 8 cent advance to 1 93 sellers into the midwest enjoyed a 9 cent rise to 2 01 and both south texas and east texas saw improvements of 10 cents to 1 94 and 1 92 respectively buyers in the northeast had to endure a 12 cent advance to 1 58 and the midcontinent rose 16 cents to 1 82 rocky mountain quotes added 21 cents to 1 73 may futures settled at 1 995 9 2 cents higher than the april settlement but observers view the wide disparity between cash quotes and futures as bearish longer term bidweek buyers in the great lakes found themselves reducing purchases but for the most part they were in good shape we didn t get as much of our baseload so it was a cutting back said a michigan marketer with the 1 995 settlement of the may futures contract traders were looking to do basis deals at prices just above 2 the prices are good and on consumers we got a 10 cent basis and on michcon it was 6 cents we are looking good he said as bidweek drew to a close friday a lack of weather developments gave traders little incentive to commit to three day deals cash market values on friday for gas to be delivered sunday and monday slid that was excluding many northeast prices which rebounded from a couple of consecutive down days possibly on news that part of a texas eastern tetco mainline in pennsylvania exploded last friday morning the bump in northeast pricing and perhaps in futures as well could be attributed to the force majeure on friday on tetco which spectra energy corp issued following a massive explosion and fire on its penn jersey line near the delmont compressor station in westmoreland county pa about 30 miles east of pittsburgh flows through the delmont compressor shut off immediately after the explosion had averaged 1 07 bcf d in the five days prior to the incident with 9 096 miles of pipeline tetco which can transport up to 10 46 bcf d is a vital piece of infrastructure that connects the gulf coast with high demand markets in the northeast tetco m 3 delivery was the single largest index gainer on the day adding 13 cents to average 1 40 it s unclear what caused the explosion and the fire was extinguished by friday afternoon the explosion occurred in an area where four lines run parallel to one another the rupture occurred on the 36 inch line while the other two 30 inch lines and a 24 inch line were shut off to assess damage checking in on the futures market natural gas bulls might have reason for optimism june futures traded in a wide 2 042 2 195 range during friday s regular session before closing out at a three month prompt month high of 2 178 up a dime from thursday one school of thought had the advance as part of longer term systematic advance but others attributed the rise to profit taking the june surge of 10 cents was the highest settle for a front month contract since jan 29 some market watchers believe this could be part of a meaningful albeit moderate rebound we remain in a relatively shallow and thus sustainable rate of advance in price which has been going on since the end of february powerhouse llc vice president david thompson told ngi sometimes when you have near vertical price moves either up or down they don t last thompson also pointed to the recent pushback and delays of pipeline projects in the east as reason for some of the recent price rebound if some of these pipeline issues delay or restrict marcellus gas getting down to the gulf coast and the pricing points that may be slightly bullish in addition with the possibility of increased exports via lng out of the gulf coast that also will help prices the broker whose firm is based in washington dc said it is important to remember that the natural gas market has been in bear mode a lot longer than the oil market has been so a lot of that economic rationalization has had the time to work its way through he added that markets often create symmetry back in april of 2012 we hit a significant low on the weekly chart around the 1 90ish range then we had a solid 97 week rally up north of 6 in march 2014 which sparked another sell off it looks like a very symmetrical mountain with roughly 97 weeks on either side he said i would suggest we ve been in this basing phase since the end of 2015 and that the market has rationalized demand and supply given the new shale economics i think we re moving up in a moderately bullish pattern due to the impacts of supply from constrained marcellus shale supplies as well as the normal seasonal push higher as we come into summer others aren t convinced the futures will be able to sustain any significant uptrend although friday s unexpectedly large price up spike failed to alter our bearish opinion it did underscore the market s sensitivity to supportive production news as well as even minor shifts in the short term temperature forecasts said jim ritterbusch of ritterbusch and associates in a weekly report to clients we also feel that some of the friday advance related to month end positioning that took the form of some speculative profit taking in any event we still feel that the spot market will have difficulty following the futures higher on occasional price rallies and that this weak cash basis will eventually drive some sub 2 pricing given some adjustments to the short term temperature views that are favoring a return to mild temps into mid month we anticipate additional selling as this week proceeds even though deviations from normal don t appear sufficient to significantly impact the balances we will be looking for negligible change in the supply surplus against 5 year average levels on thursday that is apt to be followed by more sizable injections going forward directionally ritterbusch is looking for the june contract to follow in may s footsteps although production has been slipping as the plunge in rig counts is becoming impactful we feel that this decline will be a much slower mover than seen in the liquids and that additional decreases in output will be required if a test of storage capacity is to be precluded next fall on the temperature front some shifts toward milder than previously expected patterns into mid month is contributing to selling although we are not seeing enough temperature deviation from normal to significantly impact the gas balances we still attach a high probability to a price decline to about the 1 95 area the pre expiration lows in the may contract and approximately the area where the physical market finished last week but at the same time it is apparent that the large non commercial entities have begun to shy away from the short side of this market and will be looking for even minor reasons to cover shorts as was vividly displayed on friday last thursday the energy information administration eia reported an inventory build of 73 bcf slightly above expectations and prices eased prior to the 10 30 a m edt report june futures were already at a discount to the contract s 2 153 wednesday close in the minutes before the report the contract was hovering at 2 095 and immediately after the release june sunk to a session low of 2 075 after some back and forth the prompt month contract was trading at 2 088 at 11 a m which was down 6 5 cents from the contract s regular session close on wednesday before the report many were expecting an inventory build to fall between last year s 84 bcf addition for the week and the five year average of a 52 bcf injection citi futures perspective analyst tim evans was on the record with an 81 bcf injection expectation while a reuters survey of 22 industry experts produced a 62 bcf to 84 bcf build range with a consensus estimate of a 70 bcf injection as of april 22 working gas in storage stood at 2 557 bcf according to eia estimates stocks are now 870 bcf higher than last year at this time and 832 bcf above the five year average of 1 725 bcf for the week the south central region injected 25 bcf the east region injected 23 bcf while the midwest deposited 16 bcf the pacific and mountain regions each chipped in 6 bcf and 3 bcf respectively analysts at tudor pickering holt co tph called the 73 bcf build for the week ending april 22 a bearish tilt and well high of historic norms the significant build also brought into question whether the fundamentals are currently in place to erase the current storage surplus a combo of very mild weather and a miss versus expectations indicates a market no better than balanced on a weather adjusted basis tph analysts said friday it s not good enough when we need to see both normal weather and a 3 bcf d undersupply to erase excess storage levels they added that weather for the week was warmer than normal with just 48 heating degree days hdd versus the 79 hdd five year average declining production and decent weather adjusted demand have the market increasingly confident that a much higher gas price will be needed this coming winter to balance the market tph analysts said however in the meantime the market needs to be tighter than it has been recently to work down excess storage so in the near term price needs to adjust accordingly in the heart of 1q2016 earnings reporting season low oil and gas commodity prices are a constant and familiar gripe but some industry executives see signs of hope during a 1q2016 conference call last week enterprise products partners lp s jim teague ceo of the general partner told analysts his outlook on prices is probably worth what you re paying for it and then he made his case for optimism almost all the experts have been saying that we ve seen the bottom for oil prices and that prices in general should be on an upward move we believe the fundamentals point in that direction from now until 2020 new u s lng export capacity will be steadily entering service he said meanwhile demand for gas among power generators continues to increase and industrial load continues to grow all in the face of gas rig counts that are less than 90 in the u s considerably past any historic lows for liquids ngl prices are influenced by oil and with ample export capacity ample shipping and a wave of new ethylene plants coming online we don t see that changing said simply if you re bullish oil you have to be at least as bullish on natural gas liquids thus the fundamentals for oil natural gas and all the ngl products look constructive hydrocarbon demand continues to grow production continues to fall which points to improved pricing

white house to propose new minimum tax on billionaires media washington march 27 2022 bss afp us president joe biden s administration will include more taxes on the wealthiest americans in its 2023 budget proposal due to be released on monday us media reported saturday the billionaire minimum income tax would require the 700 or so american households worth more than 100 million to pay at least 20 percent on their full income the washington post and other us media reported citing a white house document this minimum tax would make sure that the wealthiest americans no longer pay a tax rate lower than teachers and firefighters said the document cited by the post a study by the biden administration this autumn found that 400 billionaire households paid an average of only 8 2 percent in taxes on their income between 2010 and 2018 a rate often well below that of many american households the tax would also target unrealized gains in the value of liquid assets such as stocks which are not taxed until they are sold the new measure which requires congressional approval to be enacted could raise up to 360 billion in new revenue over ten years the document cited by the post said a longstanding goal of the political left the plan could dramatically change the tax paid by us billionaires tech titan elon musk would for example have to pay an additional 50 billion in taxes and amazon founder jeff bezos some 35 billion more according to calculations by university of california berkeley economist gabriel zucman cited by the post

bringing forces to the ukrainian border on rotation and could make new attempts to advance in its invasion of ukraine western intelligence officials say russian forces now rely on indiscriminate bombardments rather than risking large scale ground operations a tactic that could limit russian military casualties but would harm more civilians whilst russian troops appear to be advancing on the

said of putin describing the russian president as having a craving for absolute power and control a wrecked tank is seen near a damaged building in mariupol on saturday as civilians are being evacuated along humanitarian corridors from the ukrainian city under the control of russian military and pro russian separatists the unscripted remark which the white house scrambled to walk back as the kremlin expressed fury came at the end of an otherwise resolute and fiery speech in poland rallying the free world to unite in opposition to autocracy and support of ukraine meanwhile in the encircled southern port of mariupol mayor vadym boichenko said the situation remained critical with street fighting in the centre russia said last week it had evacuated several hundred thousand people from the war zone but ukraine says thousands of its residents including from mariupol have been illegally deported ukraine and russia have since agreed on two humanitarian corridors to evacuate civilians from frontline areas on sunday including allowing people to leave by private car from the southern city of mariupol deputy prime minister iryna vereshchuk said but there are fears over whether russia will adhere to allowing ukrainian citizens to leave via the humanitarian corridors after previous russian attacks have killed civilians fleeing via those routes meanwhile russian forces

removed from power richard haass the council on foreign relations president tweeted his concerns that biden had just expanded us war aims calling for regime change however desirable it may be it is not within our power to accomplish plus runs risk it will increase putin s inclination to see this as a fight to the finish raising odds he will reject compromise escalate or both wrote haass our interests are to end the war on terms ukraine can accept to discourage russian escalation today s call for regime change is inconsistent with these ends he added haass went on to tell politico that a senior biden official possibly even secretary of state antony blinken needs to reach out to their russian counterpart immediately and explain that biden s comment doesn t reflect us policy the fact that it was so off script in some ways makes it worse because it could be read as biden s genuine belief as opposed to his scripted words haas said biden s remark could also diminish putin s interest in compromise and increase his temptation to escalate in ukraine because if he believes he has everything to lose then he ll believe he has nothing to lose haass said before biden could even board air force one to begin the flight back to washington his aides were rushing to claim that he hadn t been calling for an immediate change in government in moscow the president s point was that putin cannot be allowed to exercise power over his neighbors or the region he was not discussing putin s power in russia or regime change a white house official said kremlin spokesman dmitry peskov quickly denounced biden saying it s not up to the president of the u s and not up to the americans to decide who will remain in power in russia biden s alarming off the cuff remark comes just 24 hours after the white house rushed to clarify other awkward remarks from the president suggesting that us troops would deploy and had already deployed to ukraine in a speech to us paratroopers in poland on friday biden said you re going to see when you re there some of you have been there you re going to see women young people standing in the middle in front of a damn tank saying i m not leaving biden s mention of when you re there seem to suggest that the troops would be deployed across the border to ukraine but the administration insisted there has been no change in his stance that the us will not enter the conflict the white house was forced to clarify on friday that american troops would not be going into ukraine after president biden appeared to make a slip in his speech to paratroopers in poland the president has been clear we are not sending u s troops to ukraine and there is no change in that position a white house spokesperson clarified to fox news on friday biden has persistently said that troops would not be sent into ukraine under any circumstances during putin s invasion fearing it would turn into world war three and end up becoming a lengthy combat mission like in afghanistan in his fiery speech on saturday biden drew a stark line between democracy and oppression repeatedly going after putin and accusing the russian president of dishonesty speaking outdoors in the cobbled courtyard of the royal castle in warsaw which was lit with the colors of poland and ukraine biden accused putin of using brute force and disinformation to rule it s nothing less than a direct challenges to the rules based system of international order biden said president joe biden accused vladimir putin of duplicity in the run up to russia s invasion of ukraine biden also took a cue from arnold schwarzenegger who released a video message to russians that went viral and spoke directly to the russian people i m telling you the truth this war is not worthy of you the russian people he said putin can and must end this war the american people will stand with you and the brave citizens of ukraine that want peace and he warned putin s aggression could bring decades of war to europe it s nothing less than a direct challenge for the order established since the world war ii and it threatens to return to decades of war that ravage europe before the international rule based order was put in place we cannot go back to that biden said biden also moved to calm worried eastern european nations he made it clear the nato alliance would hold together and he warned russia not to think about expanding his invasion outside of ukraine poland and the old eastern bloc nations like lativa and estonia are worried putin s ambitions might lead to their borders but biden made it clear nato would protect its member nations and honor article five which states if one is striked all respond don t even think about moving on one single inch of nato territory we have sacred obligations biden said biden mentioned his own conversations with putin before russia s invasion late last month he said putin repeatedly he asserted he had no interest in war guaranteed he would not move there is simply no justification or provocation for russia s choice of war president biden walks out on stage to give his remarks at the royal castle in warsaw president joe biden boards air force one heading back to washington d c polish president andrzej duda listens as president joe biden delivers a speech about the russian invasion of ukraine at the royal castle but putin and russia met each of the proposals with disinterest russia was bent on violence from the start he said after days of diplomacy and quiet meetings with powerbrokers in warsaw and brussels the white house lined up a speech where biden could speak in broad strokes about what was at stake as the u s and allies rush to arm ukraine biden said the war has been a strategic failure for russia already alluding to its battlefield losses he putin thought ukrainians would roll over and not fight not much of a student of history instead russian forces have met their match he said in a speech with references to pope john paul ii the siege of stalingrad and lech walesa despite putin s aims the west is not stronger and more united than it has ever been biden said pointing to the international response biden said the democracies of the world are revitalized said biden people listen as president joe biden delivers a speech about the russian invasion of ukraine in contrast he said russia was suffering a remarkable brain drain with more than 200 000 leaving the country in a month we must commit now to be in this fight for the long haul he said speaking in a country that has been pushing to arm ukraine while housing more than 2 million refugees punctuating his words he told a cheering crowd never to be discouraged be not afraid he said ukraine will never be a victory for russia he vowed for god s sake this man cannot remain in power he said on a day when russia lobbed new missiles at lviv in western ukraine biden began and ended his remarks with a quote from the first polish pope pope john paul ii telling people be not afraid biden has personally attacked putin before calling him a war criminal and said he doesn t have a soul earlier saturday he called putin a butcher after holding emotional conversations with ukrainian refugees including a pair who fled the horror of the siege at mariupol he s a butcher biden said when asked what he thought of putin after what he has done to the people he was meeting on march 19 video captured biden tripping up the stairs as he boarded air force one at joint base andrews in the clip biden stumbles as he walks up the airstairs he grabs the hand railing to catch his balance but then loses his footing two additional times during the third stumble he falls to his knees however after brushing off his leg he reaches the top of the plane and gives a salute before disappearing inside white house deputy press secretary karine jean pierre later told reporters that biden was 100 percent fine and preparing for his trip in atlanta it s pretty windy outside it s very windy i almost fell coming up the steps myself she said just one day earlier during a press conference on march 18 pictured he referred to vice president kamala harris as president harris just one day earlier biden accidentally referred to vice president kamala harris as president harris the gaffe occurred during a press conference on march 18 during which he lauded his administration for being close to meeting their goal of 100 million covid 19 vaccine doses in his first 100 days in office now when president harris and i took a virtual tour of a vaccination center in arizona not long ago one of the nurses on that on that tour injecting people giving vaccinations said that each shot was like administering a dose of hope biden said harris was standing behind biden as the president carried on with his speech but did not correct himself later that day when the white house released the transcript of his speech harris s proper title was inserted with brackets on march 9 while making a speech biden seemed to forget the name of secretary of defense lloyd austin above in a speech on march 9 biden seemed to fumble with his words and forget the name of his secretary of defense lloyd austin i want to thank sec the former general i keep calling him general biden said my the guy who runs that outfit over there i want to make sure we thank the secretary for all he s done to try to implement what we ve just talked about and for recommending these two women for promotion the slip occurred despite the fact that just a few minutes earlier he had mentioned austin s name in the speech without an issue on election day in november biden introduced a crowd to his granddaughter but referred to her as his son during an election day speech in philadelphia biden stumbled over his words and confused his granddaughter with his late son beau biden biden told the crowd i want to introduce you to two of my granddaughters this is my son beau biden who a lot of you helped elect to the senate in delaware the commander in chief had meant to introduce the crowed to natalie beau s daughter but hadn t just mixed up the name but the person he

graham to stand up for the crowd at a rally before realizing he was in a wheelchair not all of biden s gaffes occurred in the 2020s or even the 2010s in fact some happened in the early aughts in september 2008 after biden had been named former president barack obama s running mate he attended a campaign rally in missouri it was there that he called on then missouri state senator chuck graham who passed away last year to stand up for the crowd i m told chuck graham state senator is here stand up chuck let em see you biden said it was at that moment he realized graham was in a wheelchair due to muscular dystrophy oh god love you what am i talking about i ll tell you what you re making everybody else stand up though pal according to the columbia tribune graham said he was never

us president joe biden s administration will include more taxes on the wealthiest americans in its 2023 budget proposal due to be released on monday us media reported saturday the billionaire minimum income tax would require the 700 or so american households worth more than 100 million to pay at least 20 percent on their full income the washington post and other us media reported citing a white house document this minimum tax would make sure that the wealthiest americans no longer pay a tax rate lower than teachers and firefighters said the document cited by the post a study by the biden administration this autumn found that 400 billionaire households paid an average of only 8 2 percent in taxes on their income between 2010 and 2018 a rate often well below that of many american households the tax would also target unrealized gains in the value of liquid assets such as stocks which are not taxed until they are sold the new measure which requires congressional approval to be enacted could raise up to 360 billion in new revenue over ten years the document cited by the post said a longstanding goal of the political left the plan could dramatically change the tax paid by us billionaires tech titan elon musk would for example have to pay an additional 50 billion in taxes and amazon founder jeff bezos some 35 billion more according to calculations by university of california berkeley economist gabriel zucman cited by the post

in february fda inspectors found a rodent infestation at one of family dollar s warehouses because of this family dollar and its sister chain dollar tree have come under scrutiny workers at these chains say that pest issues have been going on for years new look sign up to get the inside scoop on today s biggest stories in markets tech and business delivered daily read preview thanks for signing up access your favorite topics in a personalized feed while you re on the go download the app email address sign up by clicking sign up you accept our terms of service and privacy policy you can opt out at any time advertisement it s been six months since jayson started his job as a cashier at a family dollar store in maine and he s already preparing to quit he s tired of working in a store that s understaffed unclean and unsafe because it s so stacked up with boxes of inventory he tells insider jayson who did not wish to share his full name through fear of retribution but whose identity is known to insider is one of 12 former and current family dollar and dollar tree workers who shared similar experiences in recent conversations the family dollar chain is owned by dollar tree these workers described the conditions in the chains stores as unhygienic and disgusting where rodents roam in backrooms that are piled high with boxes and around stores that are rarely cleaned advertisement their comments which come in the wake of an fda investigation that unearthed a rodent infestation at one of family dollar s distribution centers in arkansas and led to it temporarily closing 404 stores suggest that the rodent issues are far more widespread than at just one warehouse in a statement to insider kayleigh campbell a spokesperson for both dollar tree and family dollar said that the company is committed to providing safe and quality products for customers and complying with all applicable federal state and local occupational health and safety laws to call it chaotic is an understatement while jayson hasn t seen a live rodent in the shopping area of his store he has disposed of dead rats caught in traps in the stock room and come across rodent faeces my location is constantly dirty floors not maintained dirt and dust everywhere and completely infested with spiders he said advertisement there is so much stuff in the back room that you can t move it all to clean even if we had the time or were asked to he added jayson said that the company knowingly understaffs its stores to keep costs down which means there aren t enough workers to empty these backrooms but even if there were the company s chaotic inventory system means that his store is still completely overstocked all the time he said they don t have enough room in the distribution centers so they ll just send us all of their junk so that it can sit in our backroom instead of theirs he said a spokesperson for family dollar did not respond to insider s request for comment on how its restocking process works advertisement scott mushkin ceo of consultancy firm r5 capital witnessed these inventory pile ups first hand during store visits to more than 60 dollar tree stores between the fall of 2021 and february of this year in a recent conversation with insider he said that in his 20 plus year career as a consultant to the retail industry he s never seen anything like what he encountered in these backrooms to call it chaotic is really an understatement their inventory system is completely out of control from our perspective he told insider rodents are a symptom of the disease not the disease he said clarifying that the mountains of boxes in these backrooms were providing cover for rodents it paints a similar picture to what insider found during store visits to two of dollar tree s brooklyn locations in 2022 and 2018 where boxes were stacked up in the middle of the store or left to be unloaded on abandoned crates advertisement mushkin told insider that these inventory pile ups could be caused by supply chain challenges and stock arriving at the wrong time or staffing issues because of the labor crunch however conversations with former dollar tree and family dollar store workers who worked at these chains as far back as 2005 indicated that both piled up stockrooms and rodent infestations have been an issue at some locations for years richard kirschke who worked for a third party logistics company delivering stock to family dollar stores across the us between october 2020 and january 2021 described their backrooms as a nightmare where you could clearly smell rodent activity it s some of the worst retail real estate he told insider they just didn t care about anything related to stores the upkeep and maintenance some communities are now threatening to boycott these discount chains and saying that they re putting shoppers at risk dollar store chains are growing at a rapid rate in the us and are often criticized for driving out competitors in local communities by undercutting competitors on price which means that in some areas they are the only places to shop advertisement one former family dollar store worker who quit her job at a store in freeport new york in february and who wished to remain anonymous but whose identity is known to insider said that this is the most distressing part of the mismanagement of these stores i live and shop in this community she said only after i began working at this location did i become aware of the conditions when you think of the filth that my family members and neighbors not to mention myself have possibly consumed it makes me sick to my stomach she said
washington march 27 the bond market is flashing a warning sign that has correctly predicted almost every recession over the past 60 years a potential inversion of the us treasury note yield curve cnn reported an inverted yield curve is often seen as a signal that investors are more nervous about the immediate future than the longer term spurring interest rates on short term bonds to move higher than those paid on long term bonds while the curve isn t inverted yet it s getting close that shouldn t be particularly surprising given how russia s invasion of ukraine and its economic ramifications continue to weigh heavily on the global economy cnn reported these government bonds have seen a flood of interest in recent weeks amid geopolitical uncertainty and tightening financial conditions the federal reserve said last week it is considering as many as six more rate hikes in 2022 alone that s making investors lose their appetite for stocks and other more volatile assets and turn to dependable investments like treasuries some market participants are sounding the alarm bell i think there very well could be a recession or even worse activist investor carl icahn said tuesday in an interview with cnbc we have a strong hedge against the long positions short term i don t even predict there is at least a one in three chance the us economy will have a recession over the next 12 months moody s analytics chief economist mark zandi told cnn the harder the fed steps on the brakes the higher the probability the car seizes up and the economy goes into recession zandi said

the rise in the this week from 2 15 as of friday march 18 to 2 49 on friday march 25 was very surprising that s a 34 bp increase on the week for the 10 year yield stocks didn t seem to flinch if someone has already offered up the analogy my apologies but 2022 is looking a little like 2018 at least from the equity side of the equation in 2018 january 18 saw a sharp run up in the stock market which in many ways resembled the late 1990 s frenzied action and then on or about january 31 18 the peaked and didn t really bottom until early april there was a tremendous spike in the resulting in the collapse of one alts fund here in chicago and it definitely put some fear and anxiety back in the stock market the sharp equity drop was 5 quarters into the fed and janet yellen raising the fed funds rate with the april 18 bottom the s p 500 didn t peak again until the last week of september 18 when that brutal 4th quarter correction started ultimately accounting for an approximate 20 peak to trough correction in the s p 500 the point is that the feb march 18 correction was the first warning sign or tremor that culminated in the q4 18 correction are we seeing some of this again in 2022 the s p 500 peak was the first week of january 22 and then we saw the 4 114 s p 500 tradeable low in late february 22 and since early march we are now seeing a nice bounce in the indices re visiting the s p 500 peak in late september 19 the s p 500 started to roll over from a sequential rate of change perspective which means that after yellen s almost 2 years of tightening or raising fed funds investors saw a typical earnings slowdown correction one of the reasons this spreadsheet was created post 2018 was to track that rate of change data and here s what the data shows as of 3 25 22 there is no yellow flashing light yet just three weeks out of the 11 so far in q1 22 saw a sequential decline in the forward earnings data q1 22 earnings will be enlightening for sure s p 500 eps revisions number of up revisions trending lower this table data from ibes data by refinitiv is another home grown spreadsheet and shows the last three quarters of s p 500 and the number of up revisions versus the number of down revisions readers can see the q4 21 earnings results while still showing positive revisions are less robust than q2 21 and q3 21 earnings season start at the bottom of the up revisions column and work your way higher this is one reason we pay attention to both the absolute dollar eps and the revisions are analysts getting more tentative or is there a problem with forward earnings year over year growth rates will be lower in 2022 which has been known for a while but with less upside in stocks i also think analysts are probably hesitant to be aggressive with positive revisions to forward numbers remember analysts are people too s p 500 data the forward 4 quarter estimate fell this week to 227 28 from last week s 227 41 the pe ratio on the forward estimate is 20x the s p 500 earnings yield fell sharply to 5 from 5 10 last week and 5 39 two weeks ago for comparison in december 18 the s p 500 hit 7 near the bottom for that q4 18 correction with just one week left in q4 21 earnings neither q3 21 nor q4 21 s bottom up s p 500 eps estimate will exceed 55 which i thought it would both quarters will come in around 53 and change the ibes data is still expecting 8 8 s p 500 eps growth for calendar 2022 we ll know within the next few weeks as q1 22 earnings start in 10 15 days summary conclusion the jump in the 10 year treasury yield got my attention this week while the steady decline in positive revisions for the s p 500 in the last 6 months was surprising as well with revision data the last month of the quarter is typically slower since analyst models are set from the first two months of the quarter but it does appear the street as we call the sell side brethren is turning more cautious my own opinion is that we have a sharper correction ahead for the s p 500 but whether that s this week or the next quarter or by year end is unknown the stat that keeps coming back to me is that a 1 3rd retrace of the pandemic lows in march 20 to the early 22 high for the s p 500 is 3 800 on the s p 500 or roughly 700 points lower the financial media made a big deal of the two year anniversary of the pandemic low this week noting that the s p 500 is up 100 since take any opinions as just that an opinion and know that capital markets can change quickly
according to bank of america strategists the third great bond bear market is now under way with the return on government bonds on track for its worst year since 1949 the previous bond bear markets stretched from 1899 to 1920 and from 1946 to 1981 big picture in an investor note michael hartnett chief investment strategist at bank of america said the big picture is one of deflation to inflation globalisation to isolationism monetary to fiscal excess capitalism to populism inequality to inclusion us dollar debasement hartnett expects that long term us bond yields will surpass 4 per cent by 2024 this marks a steep increase from august 2020 in the depths of the coronavirus pandemic when the yield on us 10 year bonds fell as low as 0 5 per cent but the sell off in bonds has accelerated this month amid growing inflation anxiety and as the us federal reserve has belatedly reversed its ultra easy monetary policy advertisement the bloomberg aggregate bond index the benchmark for the investment grade us bond market has fallen by 6 2 per cent this year putting it on track for its worst quarterly performance since 1980 meanwhile the bloomberg global aggregate bond index a comparable measure of global bonds is down 6 6 per cent so far this year the index has shown a total negative return of about 11 per cent from its high in january 2021 which equates to a drop in market value of about us2 6 trillion the bond sell off also picked up after russia s invasion of ukraine which has boosted inflationary pressures by pushing prices of food energy and other important commodities sharply higher even before the war it was clear the us economy was rebounding strongly from the pandemic with consumer prices rising at a four decade high while the country s unemployment rate has dropped to 3 8 per cent investors are increasingly convinced that russia s invasion of ukraine will hasten the retreat from globalisation which will lead to a permanent lift in inflation and force central banks to tighten monetary policy more aggressively advertisement end of globalisation larry fink the head of blackrock the world s largest asset manager warned that the magnitude of russia s actions will play out for decades to come and mark a turning point in the world order of geopolitics macro economic trends and capital markets in his latest letter to shareholders fink warned that russia s aggression and its subsequent decoupling from the global economy is going to prompt companies worldwide to re evaluate their dependencies and re analyse their manufacturing and assembly footprints something that covid had already spurred many to start doing fink argued that some companies could decide to onshore or nearshore more of their operations and that will likely drive costs higher and put profit margins under pressure a large scale reorientation of supply chains will inherently be inflationary he noted howard marks the co head of oaktree capital management picked a similar theme in his latest investment memo advertisement globalisation he argued had allowed companies to reduce costs by shifting large parts of their production offshore to take advantage of cheap labour as marks noted offshoring undoubtedly contributed substantially to the low level of inflation experienced in the us over the last 40 years but he said it wasn t an unmitigated bonanza maintaining positive relations offshoring also led to the elimination of millions of us jobs the hollowing out of the manufacturing regions and middle class of our country and most likely the weakening of private sector labour unions and it left countries and companies heavily dependent on maintaining positive relations with foreign nations and on having an efficient transportation system advertisement the recognition of these negative aspects of globalisation has now caused the pendulum to swing back toward local sourcing marks wrote rather than the cheapest easiest and greenest sources there ll probably be more of a premium put on the safest and surest some analysts go further arguing that we re now witnessing a splintering of the global economy into two competing trading blocs with the united states and western nations in one camp and russia and china in the other they argue that the frictions between the two blocs were evident as far back as 2018 as the world s two largest economies the us and china were embroiled in a bitter trade war at the centre of the dispute was beijing s made in china 2025 program which aimed to make china a global leader in strategically important emerging industries such as 5g artificial intelligence and electric vehicles and biopharma and they point out that the tensions were exacerbated by the massive supply chain snarls resulting from the pandemic confronted with soaring freight rates lengthy delays at ports and the difficulty of sourcing key components or finished products in a timely way many us and european companies decided to locate their factories closer to their consumers advertisement the war in ukraine which has highlighted europe s dangerous dependence on russian energy has accentuated the fault lines between the two opposing camps europe is attempting to reduce its reliance on russian gas oil and coal as quickly as possible to reduce moscow s leverage and cut a key financial lifeline for its economy the us last week committed to ramp up its shipments of liquefied natural gas to europe however the shift away from globalisation will come at a cost globalisation spurred world wide growth while helping to mute inflationary pressures allowing central banks to keep interest rates low earlier this month the us federal reserve raised interest rates for the first time since 2018 and signalled that official rates would likely increase to around 2 75 per cent by the end of 2023 the highest level since 2008 but many analysts believe the fed will be forced to push official interest rates much higher to subdue stubborn inflationary pressures which will only become more intractable as the era of globalisation draws to a close
on the wall of rob rash s office in west memphis are framed photos of presidents of the st francis levee district dating back to 1893 that was the year the district which became one of the most powerful economic and political entities in the state was established rash an engineer who serves as the district s chief executive officer is keenly aware of the organization s colorful history and strong influence on east arkansas districts such as this one were created as the forests of the delta were cleared in the late 1800s the districts were empowered to raise funds needed to build and maintain levees thus allowing row crop farming where there once had been vast stands of bottomland hardwood trees the state created the st francis levee district to cover craighead crittenden cross lee mississippi phillips poinsett and st francis counties railroad construction following the civil war made it easier for timber companies capitalized by northern investors to come into the region to clear trees land was then drained and levees were built cotton was king and this was the most prosperous area of the state there was a levee breach during the great flood of 1927 thanks to the hard work of district employees during the next decade there wasn t a breach during the great flood of 1937 water however still backed into the area following congressional passage of the flood control act of 1928 the u s army corps of engineers and the mississippi river commission took this district s levees and built on top of them rash says people don t realize that we re the largest levee district in the country in terms of levee miles we re responsible for 411 miles of levees rash oversees three maintenance crews that serve eight counties the original levees in this area were built by local people rash says the corps can sometimes forget our local people one of my jobs is to remind them who we re here to serve a lot of other levee districts across the state quit collecting taxes from landowners and doing maintenance long ago but we never did joining us on this morning is steve higginbothom of marianna a former state senator who has farmed in lee county for decades he is the district s president prior to moving to marianna in january 1978 he lived at helena where he graduated from high school before attending the university of arkansas like rash he understands the district s rich history and its importance to the delta your district is only as strong as its weakest link higginbothom says our job is to ensure there are no weak links district levees protect almost two million acres there are 19 elected board members one for every 100 000 acres believe it or not about 95 percent of our turf battles these days are centered around hunting rights higginbothom says the district has 21 employees rash who has a degree in civil engineering from the university of memphis is widely regarded up and down the mississippi river as being among the best in the business at what he does from an engineering standpoint it works he says it s not perfect but it works we have more than 100 years of outstanding maintenance awards here i like to think we re the gold standard throughout the country i can promise you that our board doesn t allow us to operate inefficiently rash higginbothom and i get in a truck and travel atop the main levee south of west memphis the district s maintenance area extends to eight miles north of helena at one point a tower rises in the distance it s the gold strike casino near tunica on the mississippi side of the river interns open and close gates for us as we proceed south and discuss a region where floods are the major markers of history the 1930s were difficult for almost all americans but for arkansas farmers the great depression started with the 1927 flood a disastrous event along the mississippi river and its tributaries the late historian c fred williams wrote in his history of arkansas agriculture by june water covered more than 6 000 square miles and all but destroyed the row crops that year also saw a precipitous drop in housing construction and a downturn in the forest industry just as rural arkansans were adjusting to their losses from the flood another natural disaster struck the drought of 1930 31 became almost as legendary as the flood rainfall had typically been an ally for farmers but from april 1930 to january 1931 measurable precipitation was far below average in august 1930 the official reporting station in little rock recorded its 71st consecutive rainless day while not as severe as the dust bowl conditions of the mid 1930s for arkansas the drought s effects were still devastating thousands of arkansans gave up on farming and headed to the upper midwest for factory jobs public assistance proved too limited and restricted and families were forced to seek their own remedies williams wrote for some this meant moving from their cherished farmstead some moved out of state others gave up farming and relocated to the larger towns in the region still others migrated from upland counties to delta counties and initially hired out as day laborers on the area s cotton plantations at six cents a pound standard wages for first picking in 1930 a hard worker could make 6 to 18 a day as small farmers gave up delta plantations grew that meant plantation owners and the levee boards on which they served increased in power some effort had been made at ditching and draining the delta s wet spots before world war ii but inadequate equipment limited those efforts williams wrote before the war cotton s low tolerance for heavy wet soil presented farmers a challenge in maneuvering their fields amid the forest and finding elevation high enough to avoid overflow by world war ii most of the acceptable cotton land was in cultivation cotton acreage continued to increase until 1955 but growth was much smaller compared with that of rice and soybeans and farmers focused on those crops the crops were aided in part by new technology which made it possible to drain and dredge swampland wartime technologies produced giant self propelled rubber tired scrapers that could transport 14 cubic yards of dirt and they were highly mobile this equipment made it possible to bring land into cultivation in 1954 congress passed the watershed protection and flood prevention act it was designed to improve land already cleared for either crops or pasture by concentrating on streams that were prone to flood there were 12 watershed districts formed in arkansas during the next 15 years all but one were in the delta the 11 flood control projects resulted in more than 400 miles of stream channelization and brought 4 7 million acres into drainage districts williams wrote after 1970 federal officials modified the program and took steps to limit the acreage being developed for agriculture but by that time the delta s 4 4 million acres of forestland had been reduced to 1 8 million acres and half of the original 7 7 million acres of swampland were in drainage districts by the early 1970s the transformation of the delta from a forested region to a row crop region was complete with farming dominating the economy levee and drainage districts remained important the st francis levee district s influence had been felt as early as 1913 when it played a key role in george washington hays election as governor a special election was called that year to fill the vacancy created when gov joe t robinson was elected to the u s senate hays relied on the support of remnants of former gov jeff davis faction of the democratic party richard niswonger wrote in the book arkansas biography a collection of notable lives his opponent stephen brundidge drew his strength from the towns and cities hays allied himself with the politically powerful eugene williams treasurer of the st francis levee district board a group that was a major influence in delta politics brundidge accused hays of backroom dealings with the levee board when the spring primary election seemed to be extremely close phillips county a delta county influenced by the levee board held back its votes until the outcome in the rest of the state became evident then phillips county registered a large vote for hays despite charges of vote manipulation in east arkansas hays easily won in the fall general election hays left office in january 1917 he later practiced law in little rock and his hometown of camden he died in september 1927 in little rock and is buried at camden the levee district s statewide political influence later waned though it s still a force to be reckoned with in northeast arkansas many early districts found it physically and politically difficult to construct adequate levees to halt the overflow of the mississippi river donna brewer jackson writes for the central arkansas library system s encyclopedia of arkansas some people believed that building levees interfered with natural development of the land hunters in particular resented being told to vacate land they had hunted and fished for years those who lived or ran stock on islands in the mississippi river feared that levees would raise the level of the river and flood them out there were attempts in some areas to cut levees and sabotage plans but the majority of people benefited from levee building districts for example prior to adequate levees in mississippi county about five percent of the alluvial land was in cultivation and another five percent was capable of cultivation almost 90 percent of the county was regarded as a hopeless mosquito and malaria infested swamp once land was drained instances of malaria fell rapidly jackson says doctors treated as many cases in a year as they once had treated in a week it took many years for levee systems and drainage canals to be successful in keeping the water out she says opposition by many landowners and northern owned lumber companies who were averse to paying drainage taxes hindered levee building for a time in addition many of the early levees were poorly constructed and were susceptible to collapse when pounded by violent floods through perseverance and sheer luck in many cases districts became successful and enabled arkansas to become one of the most productive farming states in the nation the great flood of 1927 caused the system to be revamped on both sides of the mississippi river herbert hoover the u s secretary of commerce at the time of the 1927 flood said devastation was worse than it should have been due to the tinkering of humans despite unusually heavy rains it was the levee system itself that resulted in floodwaters being poured into the mississippi river valley all at one time since tributaries had no room to expand due to the levees jackson writes in the modern era there has been a great deal of rethinking on the issue of levees and drainage districts the fertility of the soil surrounding the mississippi river and its tributaries has for millennia depended upon cyclical flooding of rivers in the st francis levee district and elsewhere in the delta the age old battle of man versus the mighty mississippi and its tributaries continues to play out
officials cheered their first carbon credit check for protecting land around the alcove reservoir in 2019 but some are questioning the carbon credit concept will waldron albany times union coeymans when a clutch of local officials and dignitaries gathered in late 2019 to celebrate the first check they received for protecting the woodlands around the alcove reservoir they hailed the deal as a win for the environment locally and globally the albany water board had agreed to protect the approximately 6 400 acres of forest around the reservoir in exchange for annual payments from the sale of carbon credits it was one of the first local examples of an emerging market in carbon credits or offsets designed to protect forests which absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and combat global warming the carbon capture represented by preserving the forest was sold on the american carbon registry a leading market for such credits advertisement article continues below this ad carbon credit buyers be they factories in tennessee power plants in ohio texas based airlines or other such enterprises can claim that the pollution they are generating is offset by their payment to preserve a patch of forest in this case the woods around the alcove reservoir in southern albany county the trouble is the alcove s forest was never slated to be clear cut or developed anyway that s one of the criticisms of the deal leveled by a leading ecologist who is among a growing group of environmentalists who are questioning the use of carbon credits as they are currently configured and marketed it seemed too good to be true said charles canham an emeritus forest ecologist with the cary institute of ecosystem studies in millbrook dutchess county he started investigating the deal more than a year ago advertisement article continues below this ad his conclusion the alcove carbon credit deal is an example of what s wrong with the carbon credit market in general i really don t mean to pick on the nature conservancy or the albany water board but this is a project that s close to home and one that i ve been to enough times that i can try to explain exactly what the problems are canham said in a recent webcast about the issue the nature conservancy helped broker the deal in which the albany water board agreed not to clear cut or heavily log the land around the reservoir in perpetuity in return the board will get close to 1 million over the next decade advertisement article continues below this ad but with no existing plans to cut down the forest it s unclear what additional environmental benefit comes from the sale of carbon credits the albany water board actually says quite clearly in their documentation that they haven t heavily logged in the past and that they have no intention of logging in the future said canham so in effect deals like this allow some distant polluters to buy the right to say they are battling carbon based climate change without really cutting their own emissions other than buying the credits for something that was going to happen anyway alcove forest preservation they can claim they have contributed to carbon reduction advertisement article continues below this ad canham told the times union he believes deals like this are an example of how entrepreneurial zeal is ahead of the science canham stressed that he wasn t blaming the albany water board for selling carbon credits they are entirely blameless he said actually they would be remiss to pass up a significant cash infusion for essentially making no real changes to their management it s like free money which they are putting toward other improvements and conservation efforts we take that money and it goes to help us manage the watershed explained albany water commissioner joe coffey advertisement article continues below this ad the money will help pay to protect the streams that flow into the reservoir to ensure the water remains clean and make sure the surrounding forest remains healthy they are also planning easements so people can access parts of the forest we see that as kind of a home run said coffey but canham sees a number of problems he questions the accounting and underlying assumptions that went into this and other carbon offset arrangements for example in calculating the amount of carbon being sequestered or stored in the forest rather than lingering in the atmosphere carbon brokers use a baseline prediction of how much cash the forest owner could get if he or she were free to do anything they wanted with the land to maximize their profit advertisement article continues below this ad based on that the forest owner would simply clear cut the entire 6 400 acres and put the money in the stock market or some other financial vehicle but since that wasn t going to happen anyway this approach to valuing the carbon credits is spurious at best the method almost leaves me speechless said canham he also points out that carbon offset brokers are using increasingly exotic algorithms to calculate the value of forest land their owners are paid to leave untouched artificial intelligence is being used to help determine forest land value and carbon sequestration but these reports aren t peer reviewed by actual foresters or biologists like a scientific paper would be advertisement article continues below this ad in that sense part of the carbon offset industry is mimicking the various opaque financial derivatives that wall street relies upon even after the 2008 financial crash canham is not alone in his critique making climate policy work a 2020 book by danny cullenward and david victor professors at stanford and the university of california san diego look at carbon credits and conclude that government regulators need to target specific industries such as power generation and prompt them to reduce emissions simply allowing brokers to trade in carbon credits is like waving a magic wand toward climate change without getting results they argue advertisement article continues below this ad no one here is saying that forests don t need protection mass deforestation in places like brazil and other tropical lands has raised legitimate concern about the loss of large global carbon sinks but the eastern u s particularly the northeast is different the east coast canham notes is one of the most heavily forested places in the nation and is estimated to provide 85 percent of the u s forest carbon sink much of that especially in the northeast is from the regrowth of forests that were cleared for farms or timbering in the 18th and 19th centuries but which have reverted to woodlands as people and industry have shifted to the sun belt advertisement article continues below this ad that is unlikely to change meaning there s little hard justification for paying people not to clear cut forests that weren t going to be clear cut anyway the concept of carbon offsets is coming under question by several environmental groups but some activists are hesitant to criticize it especially if it s close to home when asked their opinions on the alcove reservoir deal several never called back or didn t want to comment since it involves a major environmental group they often are allied with the nature conservancy the nature conservancy didn t return calls for comment by press time in an earlier interview the group s ceo jennifer morris said carbon pricing is helping to clean up the environment carbon projects have played a tremendous role in financing innovative projects for communities on the front lines of the climate crisis she told ecosystem marketplace an organization that tracks the carbon offset industry which is becoming a 1 billion a year market advertisement article continues below this ad new york state appears to recognize that carbon offsets have their limits or at least require some regulatory guardrails the 2019 climate leadership and community protection act which sets out ambitious carbon reduction goals in coming years addresses some of the criticisms in future years once rules are finalized carbon offsets will not be allowed for waste to energy plants for instance and sellers of credits will have to be within 25 miles of the emission source being offset for now though carbon credit sales like the alcove reservoir will persist since businesses are anxious to say they have reduced their carbon footprint even if it s by buying credits rather than actually cutting emissions advertisement article continues below this ad there is enormous interest in this because all of these corporate boards have decreed that they want to become carbon neutral said canham instead of actually going out and reducing emissions they are going out and buying offset credits at a very cheap price
dubai united arab emirates russia s war in ukraine could mean changes for ed kessel s farm along a quiet stretch of western north dakota worldwide farmers like kessel are weighing whether to change their planting patterns and grow more wheat this spring as the war has choked off or thrown into question grain supplies from a region known as the breadbasket of the world ukraine and russia account for a third of global wheat and barley exports which countries in the middle east asia and africa rely on to feed millions of people who subsist on subsidized bread and bargain noodles they are also top exporters of other grains and sunflower seed oil used for cooking and food processing kessel said he may plant some more wheat and ride the tide of high prices that have spiked by a third since the invasion helping offset losses from drought and the increasing cost of fuel but not a lot more honestly it probably will help us plant a few more wheat acres we ll put a few more acres into wheat and a few more into sunflowers said kessel also first vice president of the north dakota grain growers association major grain producers like the united states canada france australia and argentina are being closely watched to see if they can quickly ramp up production to fill in the gaps from lost ukrainian and russian supplies but farmers are facing the prospect of another year of drought climbing fuel and fertilizer costs and supply chain disruptions from the covid 19 pandemic major producers also are hamstrung by factors like legal limits on exports and farming patterns that means uncertainty for countries like egypt lebanon pakistan iran ethiopia and others that cannot grow enough wheat barley corn or other grains to meet their needs the war has raised the specter of food shortages and political instability in countries that rely on affordable grain imports any extra grain exports from anywhere in the world will likely only partially offset lower black sea shipments over the remainder of the current season the international grains council said in its march report humanitarian crisis about half of the grain the world food program buys to feed 125 million people worldwide comes from ukraine the double blow of rising food prices and depressed wheat exports from the war is a recipe for catastrophe not just in ukraine but potentially globally the head of the u n food assistance agency warned it will impact millions and millions of people particularly in the poorest countries of the world wfp executive director david beasley told the associated press in the western ukrainian city of lviv earlier this month as he visited a refugee center where food aid was distributed there are unanswered questions about how western sanctions on russia the world s top wheat exporter could affect its grain exports and distribution networks russia is also the biggest exporter of fertilizer while ukraine ships huge amounts of corn rye oats and millet the black sea region is a top producer of the grains used to feed livestock worldwide australia and india have responded with increased grain exports but there s little room for others to immediately do the same that s mainly due to recurrent drought said arnaud petit executive director of the international grains council the u s produced about 44 million tons of wheat for the 2021 2022 season just two to three years ago it was over 50 million tons petit pointed to drought and farmers switching to more profitable crops canada argentina and australia could try to ramp up wheat production for the coming season that ends in mid 2023 but it s too early to tell if farmers are changing their planting patterns to focus more on grains like wheat doug martin said it s too late for his family farm in manitoba canada to make significant changes to what s being planted now plus growing a range of crops spreads out risks most producers have a set idea of what they are seeding and will probably stick to that martin said although higher wheat prices will reap earnings for farmers that isn t enough incentive to expand production because prices are also climbing for crops like oats canola and barely there are other crops that are going to get good returns martin added costs soar any increased production is running up against surging costs for supplies the price of fuel has skyrocketed and the cost of fertilizer was already high because of a crunch in natural gas acutely felt in europe with cheaper fertilizers it could have been possible to grow our way out of a global food security problem possibly but nutrients are anything but affordable or even accessible right now said sylvain charlebois a professor in food distribution and policy at dalhousie university in canada philippe dutertre grows wheat in chemire le gaudin in the sarthe agricultural region about 130 miles southwest of paris he hasn t decided whether to expand his wheat patch given soaring energy and electricity costs we might be able to act a little bit on the crop rotation but today france produces wheat corn rapeseed for oils and other cereals he said we don t have the certainty anymore to say that we will be able to guarantee the food security of france and europe tomorrow australian farmers experienced a bountiful wheat season still the agriculture department says australia will not be able to respond to lower ukrainian supplies right away because it s already sold its exports through september the situation is similar in argentina another major grain exporter a whopping 95 of its current wheat crop has already been sold jorge josifovich owns farmland in pergamino one of the richest agricultural areas in argentina where he grows wheat corn and soybeans despite higher wheat prices he said argentine farmers might not be motivated to plant more because of high fertilizer and fuel costs coupled with a rigorous price control imposed by the government that is unfavorable to producers who sell their production to exporters the calculus leaves the world s biggest wheat importers vulnerable including indonesia egypt pakistan and bangladesh as well as war torn yemen and cash strapped lebanon they are countries with huge populations in poverty relying on affordable wheat for their diets drought in the middle east is at its highest level in at least 20 years according to the gro drought index hindering any efforts to ramp up domestic wheat production there is potential for unrest if prices continue to rise particularly in nations without sufficient stocks of wheat they may be forced to wait to purchase it from the market switch to rice or draw from their wheat reserves in egypt the world s biggest wheat importer the government recently announced price caps for unsubsidized bread and fines for violators in response to soaring prices the world has 278 million tons of wheat stock to help buffer shortfalls from ukraine said petit of the international grains council half of that stock however is in china which holds more than a year s worth of supply to ensure food security for its 1 4 billion people meanwhile farmers a world away are making their own hard decisions tom bernhardt who operates a fifth generation crop and cattle ranch near linton in north dakota said no till farmers like himself won t deviate too much from their normal rotation and plant more wheat because it can lead to problems with soil health and weeds plus there s no guarantee wheat prices will remain high i have never planted additional acres just to chase a price the the 61 year old american farmer said information for this article was contributed by susie blann oleg cetinic almudena calatrava and rod mcguirk of the associated press

if you thought the stock market s sell off to start the year was ugly get ready wall street s most elite investors are bracing for an even deeper market shock as the war in ukraine drags on in my conversations with some of the top minds in finance many of whom talked to me on the condition of anonymity to speak candidly about where the market is headed a consensus emerged russia s invasion of ukraine has kicked their predictions for a stock market washout into hyperdrive the murky global economic picture clouded by supply driven inflation pressures is now even more complex and uncertain and the shifts that turned some of the market s high flying winners into losers are only becoming more pronounced russia s invasion of ukraine accelerated the slowdown and it accelerated inflation one billionaire value investor told me beyond the massive volatility that the invasion will continue to inflict on markets the war is also forcing wall street to undergo a frenzied gut check it s not just the us government that wants nothing to do with russia it s wall street s client base as well so the challenge for wall street s biggest investors is threefold build a portfolio that survives the washout make sure you re not holding russian assets and for the love of god return any russian clients money before old uncle sam lowers the boom market mess and a bone crushing recession vladimir putin s decision to invade ukraine added another shock on top of a year already defined by a massive economic sea change the federal reserve and other policymakers in the us have been trying to walk a fine line increasing interest rates just enough to tamp down historically high inflation without pushing the economy into a recession this much has not changed inflation so far shows no sign of slowing and the fed s plans to raise interest rates to fight it mean debt is already becoming more costly and loans are harder to access in turn investors are becoming more risk averse and punishing the stocks of companies that relied on cheap debt to fuel speculative growth many of which were the darlings of our seemingly unstoppable stock market of the past two years all of that adds up to a nasty stock market decline putin s war has not changed the shape of this market shift but it is making the swerve even more aggressive other than a re rating of defense contractors the value investor told me the stock market hasn t changed fundamentally it has only become more treacherous the thunderbolt of ukraine s destruction and of russia being shoved out of the global economy has created additional scarcity in a world already struggling with a shortage of critical goods as well as the inflation these shortages have caused the war is endangering the world s supply of oil steel wheat fertilizer and other commodities together russia and ukraine export more than 25 of the world s wheat supply russia is also a major exporter of fertilizer the un is warning that this conflict could lead to global food shortages the food that remains will become more expensive exacerbating inflation and then of course there is energy russia was supplying the world with just under 10 million barrels of oil a day before putin attacked ukraine since then the us has cut off imports and the eu is working to quickly wean itself off russia s energy supply russia s oil and gas exports are being cut off from the rest of the world which will lead to higher prices pain for consumers in the us and europe especially low income households castenoid getty images eventually without technology from american and european companies like baker hughes halliburton and schlumberger russia will also have trouble extracting oil from its territory the geopolitical analyst peter zeihan said oil prices have been all over the place since the invasion began mostly rising in reaction to the carnage with occasional dips as the market tries to figure out how much oil we ve really lost earlier this week the international energy agency projected that russian oil exports would drop by 3 million barrels a day by next month but one person i spoke to a singapore based hedge fund manager who focuses on commodities believes sanctions evasion will temper losses as russia shepherds its gas through countries like china i think oil prices could go a little bit higher as these issues work out but i d be surprised if prices were higher in june than they were right after russia attacked they said i think some of this will be manageable as the chinese figure out how to smuggle commodities out of russia and they will in the meantime low income populations could face what the fund manager described as a bone crushing recession in the us low income americans spend an average of 8 of their household income on energy expenses from filling their gas tanks to keeping their lights on in the eu the figure can reach above 12 in countries like romania even before putin s attack researchers estimated that 80 million households across europe struggled to stay warm so when prices go up it hurts the issue europe has right now is figuring out how to reduce absolute gas consumption quickly while also figuring out how to help the most vulnerable people they said if the eu does not solve these massive problems it risks forcing low income citizens to choose between heating their homes and filling their stomachs it risks the elimination of shifts at manufacturing plants hitting workers wallets even harder it risks political unrest right now the west s top priority in supporting ukraine is to maintain a unified front against russian aggression but none of this is good for economic and social stability what all of this amounts to is a temporary but indeterminate period of chaos prices for necessities will rage upward central banks will fight inflation by raising rates and money will become harder to find while there might be money to be made as the turmoil sorts itself out the fundamental shift underway in the market an ugly painful transition from growth stocks toward value has not changed the swings will just get wilder as anyone who is trying to survive mid march s sucker punch of a bear market rally can probably tell you without warning the tech heavy nasdaq which had been languishing ripped over 8 in one week in a market like this one it could just as easily crash back down even harder the next a shunning on wall street while the economic and market fallout from the war in ukraine will take months to unfold wall street s scramble to rid itself of toxic russian assets began quietly but swiftly after putin invaded before goldman sachs started the big bank exodus from russia before citigroup and deutsche bank cut their losses and followed suit before hedge funds started cutting off their russian oligarch clients emails and phone calls were flying around wall street demanding that russia be shunned we cannot tell our clients that we put their money in russian assets said josh brown ceo of the wealth management firm ritholtz wealth management which oversees 1 billion in assets so we re calling our asset managers and saying you need to take our exposure to zero calls like this set off a chain reaction that russia cannot stop wealth managers like brown call their asset managers companies like vanguard for example and tell them to divest any russian holdings in their clients portfolios these massive asset managers then call the companies that make indexes like msci state street which makes the spy index or the london stock exchange which makes the ftse russell and demand that russia be booted from the indexes erasing russian investments from virtually every american retirement account and millions of investment portfolios because asset managers like vanguard run trillions of dollars the index making companies comply russian assets were thrown out of the ftse russell for example on march 4 russian financial assets from stocks to debt to gold have been cut out of the global system because of sanctions this excision from financial markets will be difficult to undo maxim shemetov getty images this excision from financial markets will be difficult to undo partly because clients are unlikely to embrace russia anytime soon but also because russian assets have entered a sort of limbo they ve become part of a fire sale in which customers can only window shop basically whatever assets they have on hand have to go to zero and then become a write off brown said no one is buying these assets maybe you can sell it back to a russian in three years but for now there s no liquid market this goes not only for securities but also physical assets that once made their owners very rich when bp announced in late february that it was offloading its 20 stake in russian oil giant rosneft one veteran hedge fund manager who had just been expressing his guilt over profiting in a wartime stock market told me simply that doesn t mean anything in his decades of running money you cannot sell something no one will buy you cannot just leave billions in investments and walk away no one in their right mind would simply renounce

the democratic socialists of america group dissolved its bds working group which represents a major failure for the anti israel movement by pesach benson united with israel the democratic socialists of america faces an organizational rift after it dissolved its anti israel boycott divestment and sanctions working group according to the new york post the move reflects the dsa s inability to address internal protests after rep jamaal bowman d ny visited israel and met with prime minister naftali bennett in november the visit was organized by j street other lawmakers who joined the trip were rep rosa delauro d conn rep marc pocan d wisc rep barbara lee d cal rep melania stansbury d nm and sen chris coons d del bowman is a member of the squad a group of democratic lawmakers sharply critical of israel its most well known members include rep rashida tlaib d mich rep ilhan omar d minn and rep alexandria ocasio cortez d ny bowman has accused israel of withholding covid medication from the palestinians which israel did not do and spoke at the dsa s annual convention which honored former british labour leader jeremy corbyn he also opposed the abraham accords which represented a major milestone in israel arab peace however bowman broke with the squad and voted for 1 billion in supplemental funding to help israel replenish its stock of iron dome interceptor missiles the freshman lawmaker also refuses to endorse bds after the j street visit there was widespread speculation that bowman would be expelled from the dsa and face some kind of backlash from the squad instead the dsa suspended the bds working group s twitter account which had criticized bowman and then afterwards dissolved the bds working group explaining the working group s twitter suspension the dsa said in a march 18 statement on february 18 the asked the bds and palestine solidarity working group to take down a thread on twitter the reason for asking the thread to be taken down was that it contained misinformation about what bowman s office told dsa in an an off the record meeting the statement added it is not appropriate especially for an official dsa body to violate agreements to respect the confidentiality of sensitive information misrepresent those facts and make accusations the socialist alternative caucus denounced the dsa for shutting down the bds working group the organization s leadership the caucus claimed chose a bureaucratic maneuver in an attempt to shut down debate a member of the dsa s national political committee was quoted by the post as saying the issue is causing a significant rupture this level of vitriol in our organization especially targeted against people largely on our side is what has caused members of the squad to indicate to us that they have felt alienated from dsa and have felt pressured to distance themselves from us or worse npc member gustavo gordillo said bowman represents new york s 16th congressional district where 740 000 jews live

the king of e commerce in latin america is a screaming buy at its current price the stock market often doesn t make much sense in the short term emotions like fear and greed make it so unpredictable fortunately a company s fundamentals can act like a compass helping the market arrive at its senses over the long term rewarding the companies that continue executing and growing while punishing the less deserving e commerce company mercadolibre meli 1 96 has been punished by the market down more than 15 over the past year but rather than throw in the towel i see reasons for optimism here are three reasons why i think the market will eventually come around to mercadolibre and reward patient investors 1 strong business execution mercadolibre is an e commerce company at its core and has been working at it since being founded back in 1999 the turn of the millennium and rise of the dot com era it s not an overnight sensation but rather a steady grinder that s been investing in building the logistics distribution and market presence to be the force in latin america that it is today mercadolibre had 82 million unique active users at the end of 2021 an impressive feat in a region that features fragmented populations and an emerging economy compared to the united states things like banking and the internet are not as much as a given like they are in america according to estimates by emarketer mercadolibre is the clear e commerce leader in the region it put mercadolibre s sales at almost the same as its six competitors added together this dominance in e commerce has opened up opportunities for mercadolibre to expand into other businesses like financial services mercadolibre s execution shows up in its revenue growth accelerating despite growing larger every year the company has grown revenue at an average of 37 annually over the past decade but that average growth rate is 53 over the most recent five years and 70 over the past three 2 tailwinds for future growth there are many ways that mercadolibre could keep growing over the coming years latin america has roughly 664 million people which means that mercadolibre has a long runway ahead in penetrating its home market as the latin american economy matures it should be easier for mercadolibre to reach many of these people estimates from ebanx point to latin america as being among the world s fastest growing regions for e commerce e commerce in latin america could be worth more than 200 billion and many of the countries in the region grew e commerce sales 40 to 60 year over year in 2021 but the critical ingredient that could tie all of this together is mercadolibre s fintech segment it s the company s fastest growing business in 2021 unique active fintech users grew 23 year over year to 34 5 million digital wallets grew 36 to 19 million and investment accounts grew 49 to 22 million people touch their money frequently often daily so mercadolibre s fintech business could be vital to staying involved in its customers lives 3 bargain valuation investors have mostly run away from growth stocks in recent months catching mercadolibre in the carnage the stock ran as high as almost 2 000 per share before taking a roughly 50 haircut the stock has rebounded trading at just under 1 200 today but remains well below its highs to some degree the sell off has been justifiable market euphoria that seemed to peak in november 2021 pushed mercadolibre well above its normal valuation surpassing a price to sales ratio of 24 when the stock spent much of the decade trading below a p s of 12 in hindsight there was arguably a bubble in growth stocks and the market made an unpleasant but healthy correction but the pendulum can swing too far in both directions and it looks like the hate on mercadolibre may be a bit overdone the stock has retreated to a p s ratio of just over 8 near its lowest valuation over the past decade however the company is arguably doing better than ever before growth has accelerated in recent years and the company s fintech business is rapidly picking up users investors are poised to see investment returns that reflect mercadolibre s growth moving forward at the very least and could even see an eventual rise in the stock s valuation nothing is guaranteed and mercadolibre must continue to execute but it s hard not to like the risk versus reward opportunity available today
i was sitting in the cafeteria during my first semester of university talking to my new friend milton as usual we stayed until closing time but this time was different as we were walking out i peered inside the kitchen and witnessed something shocking they were throwing out hundreds of fresh meals on the chilly walk home with that image burned into my mind i met john a man who would change the course of my life he appeared from around a downtown corner his jeans ripped and his oversized hoodie concealing a young yet careworn face he said to us i don t want money i just want food it is a refrain we are hearing more and more during the pandemic according to a recent report food banks in toronto reported a 45 per cent increase in visits from 2020 and 1 5 times more than in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis new food bank clients increased 61 per cent compared to the year prior food is essential and should be available to every human being especially when we as a nation have an abundance of it as a result of my experiences that night i committed to the process of creating a new organization called mealcare we quickly discovered that canada wastes 49 5 billion worth of food each year yet one in seven families struggles to put food on the table the objective of the mealcare program is simple divert surplus edible food from grocery stores cafeterias and catering companies and donate it instead to homeless shelters and soup kitchens mealcare ultimately matches the supply and demand between businesses and community organizations while addressing the root cause of food waste in canada our operations are coordinated by student led chapters at universities and colleges across the country our delivery steps are sort and record data mealcare volunteers go to the partner food businesses e g university cafeterias bakeries grocery stores and restaurants daily weekly or bi weekly as decided by the business the volunteers sort weigh and record data on food and give it to delivery volunteers deliver the delivery volunteers drive or walk the surplus food to soup kitchens and or homeless shelters received and served food is checked by chefs and served to local beneficiaries if given to homeless shelters if the food is given to a food bank then it is stored and given to food insecure members of the community data is shared food waste data is given back to each partner consistently the tracked data serves as an inventory waste management system for the business we aim to provide data related to their weekly monthly and yearly excess and basic trends and insights that will empower them to optimize their future stock purchases reduce monetary costs and increase operational efficiency as a nationwide organization mealcare has delivered more than 40 000 meals and saved our partner shelters over 200 000 these impacts are particularly important considering food insecurity is a major social determinant of health food insecurity is associated with obesity hypertension diabetes and various other diseases and can lead to cycles of poverty at mealcare we work with our community organizations providing them with healthy food allows them to use their budgets toward affordable housing medical treatments and educational resources i peered inside the kitchen and witnessed something shocking they were throwing out hundreds of fresh meals food delivery organizations often divert surplus food from large grocery stores to a warehouse and then distribute it to their community partners but that system creates its own waste the organizations rely on monetary donations to continue operating they are geographically constrained due to the costs of trucks warehouses and employees they simply transport excess food and are not addressing the root cause of food waste for the grocery retail and food service outlets our solution is grounded on the gaps in the current approach we eliminate the need for a warehouse and construct optimized delivery routes that allow our volunteers to pick up food from multiple partners before heading to the homeless shelter additionally mealcare is built on a low cost model that leverages community partnerships one of mealcare s competitive advantages is its scalability we have eager individuals in many cities across canada ready to start a mealcare chapter we also connect b2b and therefore eliminate many of the costs and geographical constraints one of mealcare s key innovations is our food waste analytics software that is geared towards long term reduction this data type of food amount expiry date etc is provided back to the businesses as weekly and monthly reports that provide basic insights and trends on their food waste our system s goal is to serve as an inventory management system that matches supply demand based on previous waste metrics mealcare has proven to be a scalable organization we operate in many different universities across canada montreal ottawa guelph toronto london sherbrooke kingston furthermore we have had an interest in opening additional chapters in canada and the united states in the past we have expanded by creating chapters around communities and universities teaching young leaders entrepreneurship and management meaning all of mealcare s impact has been accomplished entirely through the hard work of passionate students mealcare has meant putting my thoughts into words words into collective action and action into sustainable improvement we are very proud to have created this project that has improved the health of

the global economy still depends on energy and infrastructure investment according to data by johns hopkins new covid 19 cases in china reached a record high of 447 104 between feb 28 and march 6 the numbers have come down since then but the seven day average for daily new covid 19 cases in china remains higher than at any point in 2020 in the u s fears of a covid 19 omicron ba 2 subvariant are rising although a surge remains unlikely for now investors who are looking for companies that can be long term winners even if covid 19 cases rise have come to the right place here s what makes the ishares global infrastructure etf igf 1 14 american water works awk 0 51 and kinder morgan kmi 0 88 three great dividend investments worth considering now there s no let up in demand for investment in infrastructure lee samaha ishares global infrastructure etf while the pandemic and geopolitical events may delay investment in many industries in the near term there s no denying the megatrend toward global investment in infrastructure in the developed world there s an urgent need to replace and modernize existing infrastructure a fact emphasized by the infrastructure bill in the u s meanwhile the developing world needs investment in infrastructure to support economic growth whether it s airports ports transportation infrastructure utilities energy infrastructure water and wastewater treatment or even parks and schools it s a sure thing that global spending on infrastructure will go up for many years to come that s where the ishares global infrastructure etf exchange traded fund comes into play i particularly like this etf is because it appears to do what it says it will do in other words focus on genuine infrastructure companies like energy pipeline companies airport operators and toll road providers as such the managers of the etf have avoided the temptation to pick winners in the infrastructure sector or invest in companies that aren t core infrastructural businesses the ishares global infrastructure etf offers you a chance to invest in global infrastructure while enjoying a 2 7 yield while you wait if you re going to play the theme this etf is the best way to get direct exposure bathe your portfolio with a boring and basic source of passive income scott levine american water works feeling unsettled at learning that china is instituting lockdowns in various cities to stem the spread of the new covid 19 variant you re not alone for millions of people daily activities are resuming the feel they had prior to the pandemic s onset however the threat of a new covid 19 variant can change that in a flash and with it market volatility would surely ensue for those concerned about the prospect of wild market swings fortifying their portfolios with a conservative dividend stock like american water works is a strong move to make providing water and wastewater services to more than 14 million people in 24 states american water works primarily operates in regulated markets in each of the past three years for example the company has generated 86 of its operating revenue from its businesses in regulated markets operating in this way affords the company clear insight into future cash flows allowing it to plan accordingly for acquisitions of smaller municipal run water utilities as well as the replacement and upgrading of aging infrastructure granted the eyes of high yield dividend seekers may not be lighting up when they see the 1 54 forward dividend yield that american water works stock offers but management s commitment to rewarding shareholders makes the stock worth wading into from 2016 to 2021 management has raised the dividend at a 10 compound annual growth rate looking ahead investors will find that management is expecting to grow the payout at a similar pace projecting to increase the dividend at a 7 to 10 compound annual growth rate from 2022 to 2026 think these dividend raises are going to land the company in hot water think again on american water works q3 2021 conference call ceo and cfo susan hardwick stated that management is narrowing our long term payout target range to 55 to 60 which will allow us to fund our significant regulated investment plan fund our dividend growth strategy and maintain a healthy balance sheet a stable business with a high yield daniel foelber kinder morgan like buying shares of an etf or investing in american water works pipeline giant kinder morgan is about as boring of a company as you can find however investing isn t a beauty contest rather it s about finding quality businesses that are undervalued or have growth potential and while kinder morgan may not have a lot of growth there s reason to believe its business is undervalued even after the stock s 20 year to date run up kinder morgan is one of the largest energy infrastructure companies in north america its business is tied to stable long term take or pay and fixed fee contracts that protect it from volatile swings in oil and natural gas prices but also limit the upside potential in case oil and gas prices skyrocket this dynamic makes kinder morgan a relatively safe energy stock that performed much better in 2020 when oil and gas prices were crashing compared to other oil and gas companies but it also means kinder morgan is probably going to underperform the oil and gas industry when prices are surging like in 2022 despite its short to mid term stability kinder morgan depends on the long term relevance of natural gas and to a lesser extent oil so that it gets favorable terms when it comes time to renew contracts therefore kinder morgan benefits from higher demand for domestic consumption as well as export potential given the geopolitical risks that are unfolding it is safe to say that much of the world is now more interested than ever in importing liquefied natural gas lng from the u s in order to lower dependence on neighboring land based pipelines the need for higher lng export is a boon for kinder morgan s business so there s certainly some upside there in the meantime kinder morgan has proven that it can generate stable cash flows in good times and bad which supports a growing dividend with a yield of 5 9 kinder morgan is too good of a value to pass up

the king of e commerce in latin america is a screaming buy at its current price the stock market often doesn t make much sense in the short term emotions like fear and greed make it so unpredictable fortunately a company s fundamentals can act like a compass helping the market arrive at its senses over the long term rewarding the companies that continue executing and growing while punishing the less deserving e commerce company mercadolibre meli 1 96 has been punished by the market down more than 15 over the past year but rather than throw in the towel i see reasons for optimism here are three reasons why i think the market will eventually come around to mercadolibre and reward patient investors 1 strong business execution mercadolibre is an e commerce company at its core and has been working at it since being founded back in 1999 the turn of the millennium and rise of the dot com era it s not an overnight sensation but rather a steady grinder that s been investing in building the logistics distribution and market presence to be the force in latin america that it is today mercadolibre had 82 million unique active users at the end of 2021 an impressive feat in a region that features fragmented populations and an emerging economy compared to the united states things like banking and the internet are not as much as a given like they are in america according to estimates by emarketer mercadolibre is the clear e commerce leader in the region it put mercadolibre s sales at almost the same as its six competitors added together this dominance in e commerce has opened up opportunities for mercadolibre to expand into other businesses like financial services mercadolibre s execution shows up in its revenue growth accelerating despite growing larger every year the company has grown revenue at an average of 37 annually over the past decade but that average growth rate is 53 over the most recent five years and 70 over the past three 2 tailwinds for future growth there are many ways that mercadolibre could keep growing over the coming years latin america has roughly 664 million people which means that mercadolibre has a long runway ahead in penetrating its home market as the latin american economy matures it should be easier for mercadolibre to reach many of these people estimates from ebanx point to latin america as being among the world s fastest growing regions for e commerce e commerce in latin america could be worth more than 200 billion and many of the countries in the region grew e commerce sales 40 to 60 year over year in 2021 but the critical ingredient that could tie all of this together is mercadolibre s fintech segment it s the company s fastest growing business in 2021 unique active fintech users grew 23 year over year to 34 5 million digital wallets grew 36 to 19 million and investment accounts grew 49 to 22 million people touch their money frequently often daily so mercadolibre s fintech business could be vital to staying involved in its customers lives 3 bargain valuation investors have mostly run away from growth stocks in recent months catching mercadolibre in the carnage the stock ran as high as almost 2 000 per share before taking a roughly 50 haircut the stock has rebounded trading at just under 1 200 today but remains well below its highs to some degree the sell off has been justifiable market euphoria that seemed to peak in november 2021 pushed mercadolibre well above its normal valuation surpassing a price to sales ratio of 24 when the stock spent much of the decade trading below a p s of 12 in hindsight there was arguably a bubble in growth stocks and the market made an unpleasant but healthy correction but the pendulum can swing too far in both directions and it looks like the hate on mercadolibre may be a bit overdone the stock has retreated to a p s ratio of just over 8 near its lowest valuation over the past decade however the company is arguably doing better than ever before growth has accelerated in recent years and the company s fintech business is rapidly picking up users investors are poised to see investment returns that reflect mercadolibre s growth moving forward at the very least and could even see an eventual rise in the stock s valuation nothing is guaranteed and mercadolibre must continue to execute but it s hard not to like the risk versus reward opportunity available today
