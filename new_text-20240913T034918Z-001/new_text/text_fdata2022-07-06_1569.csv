menafn somtribune are sanctions against russia useful yes they are already hitting vladimir putin and his accomplices hard and their effects on the russian economy will increase over time since russia deliberately violated international law by invading ukraine the eu has adopted six packages of sanctions against moscow our measures now target nearly 1 200 individuals and 98 entities in russia as well as a significant number of sectors of the russian economy these sanctions were adopted in coordination with the g7 members their effectiveness is enhanced by the fact that over forty other countries including traditionally neutral countries have adopted them or taken similar measures by the end of 2022 we will have reduced our russian oil imports by 90 and we are rapidly reducing our gas imports these decisions are gradually freeing us from a dependence that has long inhibited our political choices in the face of vladimir putin s aggressiveness he probably believed that europe would not dare to engage in sanctions because of its energy dependence this is not the most insignificant of the russian regime s many miscalculations during this conflict of course weaning ourselves off russian energy so rapidly also creates serious difficulties for many eu countries and for several economic sectors but this is the price we have to pay for defending our democracies and international law and we are taking the necessary steps to deal with these problems in full solidarity some may ask do these sanctions really have an impact on the russian economy the simple answer is yes although russia exports a lot of raw materials it also has no choice but to import many high value added products that it does not manufacture for all advanced technologies it is 45 dependent on europe and 21 on the united states compared with only 11 on china in the military field which is crucial in the context of the war in ukraine the sanctions limit russia s capacity to produce precision missiles such as the iskander or the kh 101 almost all foreign car manufacturers have also decided to withdraw from russia and the few cars produced by russian manufacturers will be sold without airbags or automatic transmission the oil industry is suffering not only from the departure of foreign operators but also from the difficulty of accessing advanced technologies such as horizontal drilling the ability of russian industry to bring new wells on stream is likely to be limited finally in order to maintain air traffic russia will have to withdraw a majority of its aircraft from circulation in order to recover the spare parts needed to allow the others to fly added to this there is also the loss of access to financial markets being disconnected from major global research networks and a massive brain drain as for the alternative offered by china for the russian economy in reality it remains limited especially for high tech products to date the chinese government which is very dependent on its exports to developed countries has not assisted russia in circumventing western sanctions chinese exports to russia have fallen in line with those of western countries will these significant and growing impacts lead vladimir putin to modify his strategic calculations probably not in the immediate future his actions are not guided primarily by economic logic however by forcing him to choose either butter or guns the sanctions lock him in a vice that is gradually tightening regarding the impact of these sanctions on third countries particularly african countries which depend on russian and ukrainian wheat and fertilisers where responsibility lies in terms of the food crisis is clear our sanctions do not in any shape or form target russian wheat or fertiliser exports while ukraine is prevented from exporting its wheat by the black sea blockade and destruction caused by russian aggression if such issues linked to our sanctions were to arise we are ready to put in place the appropriate mechanisms to address these i have informed my african counterparts of this and asked them not to be fooled by the russian authorities untruths regarding our sanctions the real answer to the difficulties on the world energy and food markets is an end to the war this cannot be achieved by accepting the russian diktat it can only be achieved by russia s withdrawal from ukraine respect for the territorial integrity of states and the non use of force are not western or european principles they are the basis of all international law russia is blithely trampling on them to accept such a violation would open the door to the law of the jungle on a global scale contrary to what we thought rather naively just a few years ago economic interdependence does not automatically imply a pacification of international relations this is why the transition to a europe as a power which i have been calling for since the beginning of my mandate is imperative faced with the invasion of ukraine we have begun to move from intention to action by showing that when provoked europe can respond since we do not want to go to war with russia economic sanctions are now at the core of this response they are already beginning to have an effect and will do so even more in the coming months josep borrell fontelles high representative of the union for foreign affairs and security policy press and information team of the delegation to senegal

a cursory investigation of the nigerian economy reveals diverging fortunes for the finance sector led by banks and the real sector led by manufacturing with the decline in manufacturing now at 9 of gross domestic product from a height of 20 in the early 1980s pundits would expect banks fortunes to decline with the belief that the real sector manufacturing et al sustains banks at least for developing economies such logic has been turned on its head in regions of the country while manufacturing has disappeared bank branches have increased meanwhile the central bank of nigeria has assumed the role of retail banks by directly funding all types of sectors from farming to power generation and aviation these banks had ignored government sponsored funds like sme fund and agricfund sequestered for intervening in these sectors these funds had been set aside from profits of banks to encourage them to finance the real sectors this they refused to do leaving the apex bank to fill the gap and is being done in an inefficient manner historically banks were not mere payment intermediaries but catalysts of economic development and transformation banks evolved by warehousing savings of citizenry and lending to investors thus financing trade and later the industrial revolution japanese banks paid the cost of making japan the second largest world economy to the detriment of japanese banks balance sheets america did not have a central bank for its first 140 years yet it transformed through decentralised banking and cross border financing from the old world beginning of banks in nigeria is attributed to sir alfred jones of elder dempster his company bank of british west africa has since morphed into first bank nigeria no doubt the first 100 years or more of banking in nigeria was attached to colonial apron strings activist banking in nigeria beyond changing currency started during the tenure of the present governor of anambra state as cbn governor prof charles soludo identified a core weakness in nigerian banking under capitalisation he set out to correct it through the banking consolidation policy while the survivor banks were better capitalised the dna of nigerian banks didn t change in reality it got worse because with the easy monies raised from the public they proceeded on self aggrandisement rather than developing the economy the local version of the global financial meltdown almost brought down the nigerian economy as well but a new governor of the cbn lamido sanusi stemmed the tide he had earlier saved first bank from the jamboree of marginal loans that undercut the new generation banks that arose under soludo s consolidation policy those new generation banks helped to pump up the nigerian stock index to unprecedented heights of 60 000 index points before the global financial meltdown struck these banks had applied double standards of action on the population in the drive to achieve consolidation targets and later play the stock market they highlighted market appreciation of shares as a selling point to buyers of bank stocks on the other hand they discounted the same shares when used to secure loans at the height of the financial crisis banks stopped accepting bank shares as collateral these banks are also reaping from fields they did not cultivate their complicity in not providing finance for manufacturing and the real sector had led to the exodus of nigerians abroad the first wave in the 80s to 90s and a new wave today the andrew and japa syndromes respectively banks reap from these forced emigrations through commissions on emigrants remittances and their relationship with western union moneygram etc finally banks discouraged and killed off most manufacturing with high interest rates padded with other charges the question is how is it banks flourish while the real economy remains in the doldrums the answer lies in the fact that for long nigerian banks have not been hooked to the material economy they have remained in the nigerian economic space like parasitic leeches on exposed parts of human body simply sucking on blood as rent takers you gather this from their annual reports which revealed over 50 of banks profits is from the commission on transactions not from loans to businesses when you factor in that a large chunk of their non commission profits is also from financing short term trading including imports of finished items then we recognise how pernicious they are in a bid to change the above narrative the penultimate governor of the cbn sanusi introduced some changes he started a phased withdrawal of commission on turnover he reduced cheque clearing time from five days to three days with this removal the phased removal of cot was stopped and renamed administrative charges and account maintenance charges thus the rent taking by banks has continued at the individual customer relationship level these banks behave as though they are masters at the top of the pyramid customer service and relationships are appalling it starts at bank entrances where the guards could be downright uncouth in the banking hall you can perceive profiling going on when guards approach customers and ask why they are in there there is the wilfulness to harness financial resources not theirs entrepreneurs lucky to get loans and have been repaying diligently are suddenly told they still have liabilities how come simple reconciling of loan accounts ends up in courts often also banks have stopped sending hard copies of bank statements to customers limiting this information to emails in addition issuance and use of cheque books that can inform of account ownership are becoming anachronistic the import of this is that beneficiaries of a deceased person can be wittingly denied access to their benefactor s bank assets as they have no access to parents emails and no hard copy might be found linking the deceased to his accounts bankers know the implications of this rather than put a stop to it they have surreptitiously anchored it to the system thus inheriting accounts of deceased persons how about loss of funds in accounts to banks when digitisation was introduced i have personal experience with this my brother and my dad s accounts in nigerian banks were lost due to movement from analogue to digitisation this is in apposition to my experience of uk banking where after a 27 year hiatus the account that was opened in the analogue year of 1977 was restored without fuss in 2004 this highlights the dna problem of nigerian banks the time has come to reshape nigerian banking and reset its dna to achieve national objectives 85 of the n500 trillion price tag on the medium term national development plan 2021 2025 is to be financed by nigerian banks this remains a tall order if our banks remain the way they are reinforcing the need to re engineer their dna to deliver on national aspirations what to do break the rent taking culture by removing avenues for commissions on transactions that go through banks this is a continuation of what sanusi started by moving to phase out cot make them seek their own forex independent of cbn and crude oil receipts implementing this will make cbn s non oil export initiative rt 200 achievable increasing competition in the finance sector by encouraging entrance of new investment banking to energise the sector the phenomenon of too big to fail should not be allowed at this stage of national development appointing bankers as governors of cbn should be reconsidered three of the last four cbn governors have been from banks and this has missed results having bankers as governors indeed is an unusual practice that has underlying conflict of interests to which a banker governor is exposed it has contributed to the current situation where we have the tail wagging the dog dr jaiyesimi writes from sagamu

farming ramps up while flies are often seen as pests a new study may make you think twice before killing them researchers from queen mary university of london claim that insects feel pain most likely because they have central nervous control of nociception the detection of painful stimuli just like humans fruit flies feel chronic pain like humans chronic pain is defined as pain that continues after an original injury has healed university of sydney researchers said like humans fruit flies feel a particular kind of this called neuropathic pain which occurs after damage to the nervous system humans may feel this kind of pain after suffering from sciatica spinal cord injuries or a pinched nerve when a fruit fly had a nerve in one of its legs damaged its other legs responded by becoming hypersensitive to dangerous stimuli the fly receives pain messages that travel through sensory neurons to its ventral nerve cord after that its pain threshold is permanently changed and they become hypervigilant as they try to detect potentially harmful stimuli advertisement nociception is the detection of painful stimuli and is usually accompanied by the feeling of pain modulation of nociception allows animals to adapt their behaviour in different contexts in mammals this is executed by neurons from the brain and is referred to as the descending control of nociception for example if an animal is injured during a fight the dampening of their nociceptive processing may increase the animal s fighting performance by ensuring they do not waste time or energy on responding to the injury the researchers explained likewise when the animal has returned to safety the descending controls can facilitate nociceptive processing encouraging the animal to protect the injured location so that its healing is promoted until now few studies have looked at whether insects have such control in the new study researchers analysed previous behavioural molecular and anatomical neuroscience evidence on pain in insects their analysis indicates that like mammals insects likely have descending controls for nociception behaviourally changes to the insect brain can change their nocifensive behaviour whether this change is physical manipulation or the processing of motivational stimuli the researchers wrote at a molecular level insects have molecular pathways that can inhibit nocifensive behaviour peripherally and centrally anatomically insects have descending neuronal projections from the brain to the ventral nerve cord where nocifensive behaviour is executed based on the findings the researchers are calling for further research into pain and insects to clarify whether we should be affording ethical protection to insects in potentially harm inducing settings such as farming and

feel pain and emotions some 350 000 tonnes of octopus are caught each year more than 10 times the number in 1950 with the animal particularly popular as a delicacy across asia and the mediterranean demand is so high that companies worldwide have spent decades trying to uncover the secret of how to breed the octopus in captivity because its larvae only eat live food and need a carefully controlled environment spanish multinational company nueva pescanova announced that it will start marketing farmed octopus next summer to sell in 2023 however nueva pescanova has refused to reveal what conditions the octopuses will be kept in including the size of the tanks the food they will eat and how they will be killed many scientists have reacted with dismay at the news saying octopuses should never be commercially reared for food advertisement in a study by the london school of economics and political science experts said they were convinced that high welfare octopus farming was impossible and the government could consider a ban on imported farmed octopus in future

luxembourg accesswire july 5 2022 nexa resources s a nexa resources or nexa or the company nyse nexa is pleased to inform that ramp up activities at the aripuanÃ£ world class polymetallic mine have safely started and the demobilization of construction teams is underway aripuanÃ£ is located in the state of mato grosso brazil and is one of the industry s most sustainable mining projects with nearly 100 of water recirculation and the use of dry stacking and cemented paste backfill for the waste material ignacio rosado president and chief executive officer ceo said we are very proud to announce that aripuanÃ£ has reached the ramp up phase as expected it is a remarkable accomplishment and we would like to congratulate the entire team for their commitment to delivering the project aripuanÃ£ is currently nexa s largest investment in brazil which contributes to the social and economic development of the region it is also one of the few zinc projects in the world and we are confident that it will be a low cost and long life mine operation this is the third flagship mine in our asset portfolio strengthening our unique position to meet the growing demand for zinc concluded mr rosado ramp up activities are currently focused on steadily increasing the plant throughput rate with over 650kt of ore available in stockpiles which is enough to cover six months of the estimated ramp up curve the milling capacity utilization rate is expected to reach an average of 30 40 in 3q22 and 70 80 by december 2022 full production is expected in 2q23 following the commissioning performance stability plan process knowledge ore recovery and asset reliability commercial production should be achieved by 4q22 furthermore the mine is already fully operational and underground activities are focused on developing and preparing areas for mining operations and increasing mineral reserves with drilling in new areas seeking operational stability during the entire operation mine development has also achieved the expected monthly output of 1 000 meters 100 of capacity 2022 production guidance remains unchanged and it is estimated at 14 to 23kt of zinc 1 6 2 3kt of copper 5 0 7 7kt of lead and 0 3 0 5mmoz of silver subject to risks around the ramp up of a new mine among other factors aripuanÃ£ consists of three main mineralized zones arex link and ambrex with an estimated average annual production of 70kt of zinc 24kt of lead 4kt of copper 1 8moz of silver and 14 5koz of gold over a life of mine of 11 years considering only the mineral reserves estimated under regulation s k 1300 zinc is one of the world s most essential materials and due to its growing role in energy storage and its superior ability to protect metals against corrosion zinc remains crucial for the future as the world transitions to a low carbon economy nexa and zinc will continue to play a key role in supporting clean energy technologies and infrastructure development exploration program the aripuanÃ£ exploration strategy focuses on increasing mineral resources at the ambrex orebody and babaÃ§u exploration target which lies to the southeast of the ambrex deposit the

high grade zone with 26 19 zn 9 14 pb 0 25g t au and 82ppm ag along 56 6 meters the exploratory drilling campaign has been focused on the northwest extension of babaÃ§u where new drilling continues to confirm high grade mineralization and infill drilling at the ambrex orebody for resource classification upgrade and to investigate the ambrex babaÃ§u transition zone at depth between january and june 2022 959 9 meters of exploratory drilling were executed at babaÃ§u with 02 rigs exploratory drillhole brapd000099 intercepted a thick stratabound folded massive sulfide intersection in this deep northwestern extension outside the known inferred resources limits babaÃ§u continues to confirm thick intersections of massive sulfides at depth with the potential to extend the life of aripuanÃ£ mine par indicates mineralized intersection with minimum of four meters width with pending assay results the length of intercepts may not represent the true width of mineralization furthermore 24 076 meters of infill drilling were completed in 1h22 at ambrex with eight rigs the drillholes indicate that mineralization has been confirmed supporting the conversion of inferred to indicated mineral

this article previously appeared in the jewish currents email newsletter subscribe here last week consumer goods conglomerate unilever announced it had sold off its ben jerry s business interests in israel to american quality products the israeli company that had long distributed ben jerry s ice cream in the region including to israeli settlements built on land taken from palestinians but ben jerry s a us based ice cream company famous for its social justice bent that was founded in 1978 and acquired by unilever in 2000 is now attempting to stop unilever s israel sale earlier today the company filed suit against its parent company arguing that unilever breached its acquisition agreement with ben jerry s which promises the ice cream brand autonomy on matters relating to its social mission ben jerry s is asking a judge to block the unilever sale as well as for damages the escalating battle over the future of ben jerry s ice cream in israel comes nearly a year after ben jerry s announced a boycott of israeli settlements because the company explained it was inconsistent with our values for its ice cream to be present within an internationally recognised illegal occupation omar shakir the israel and palestine director for human rights watch told jewish currents that ben jerry s made that decision to avoid complicity in serious human rights abuses and to avoid providing a veneer of normalcy to a situation of structural violence and apartheid however unilever s june 29th announcement that ben jerry s will be sold under its hebrew and arabic names throughout israel and the west bank under the full ownership of its current licensee has undermined the ben jerry s settlement boycott now israeli settlers will be able to enjoy ice cream that tastes like ben jerry s even if the us company is no longer making the product although it s unclear whether this ice cream will use the same recipe as the us brand the unilever announcement was taken as an immediate victory for israel and its advocates yair lapid israel s foreign minister and orna barbivay israel s economy minister welcomed the move as an important victory of values against discrimination and antisemitism that is at the heart of the campaign to boycott israel the palestinian boycott divestment and sanctions bds national committee which spearheads the global movement to boycott israel over its human rights abuses targeting palestinians and five other us based palestinian rights groups condemned unilever for its effort to appease israel and attempt to subvert the principled stand by ben jerry s board unilever s decision put an end to a lawsuit unilever faced from american quality products owner avi zinger who had sued unilever in us federal court in march accusing ben jerry s of unlawfully breaching its licensing agreement the unilever sale to zinger was the successful culmination of a year long effort to lobby the parent company to reverse its subsidiary s decision that campaign included zinger s lawsuit accusations that ben jerry s was antisemitic for boycotting west bank settlements letters to the securities and exchange commission accusing unilever of violating financial disclosure rules and pledges from seven states arizona new jersey new york texas illinois colorado and florida to disinvest hundreds of millions of dollars from unilever stock in accordance with laws preventing state funds from going to companies that participate in the bds movement in response to unilever s sale arizona texas new york and new jersey have pledged to review the inclusion of unilever on their investment blacklists while florida and colorado said they would not reverse their prohibitions on investing in unilever for israel advocates unilever s statement demonstrated the power of their campaign which was meant to send a message to other corporations about what would happen to them if they heeded the palestinian call to boycott israel over its human rights abuses i expect in the future multinationals will think twice before they decide to ostracize israel for bds reasons said michael ashner an investor who started the coalition to hold unilever accountable which campaigned against ben jerry s boycott of settlements this has been a very costly and difficult period for and i am glad that they ve come around to a different view still close observers of the unilever announcement said the reality of what the company did was more complicated than the tenor of israeli press coverage which portrayed the move as a full reversal of the ben jerry s decision made it seem ben jerry s is now out of the business of selling ice cream in israel and as the company pointed out in its own response to the unilever announcement our company will no longer profit from ben jerry s in israel in its place will be zinger s version of ben jerry s marketed only in hebrew and arabic if the idea of the anti bds campaign is to compel international companies to operate in settlements this is the opposite of that said lara friedman president of the foundation for middle east peace and a jewish currents contributing writer this international company is now not operating in israel or the west bank

bloomberg hong kong is likely to see more dual traded companies shift toward primary listings in the financial hub as they seek inclusion in trading links with mainland china according to the city s exchange chief in a wide ranging interview that also covered topics including hong kong s quarantine policy and china s support for the city s global role hong kong exchanges and clearing ltd chief executive officer nicolas aguzin said more companies with secondary shares in hong kong are considering primary listings while others may be forced to do so by market rules as more of their trading volume migrates to the city the most prominent dual listed company currently excluded from the stock connect with china is e commerce giant alibaba group holding ltd what we ve seen for example in alibaba and in a few others is that over time a lot of the trading is coming to our part of the world aguzin said when it s over 55 trading in our market at that point they don t have an option but they can decide to do it anytime aguzin didn t indicate whether alibaba has held talks with hkex about a potential primary listing alibaba didn t immediately respond to a request seeking comment the prospect of stock connect inclusion for companies like alibaba has been subject of intense speculation among traders in hong kong which currently excludes companies with both secondary listings and weighted voting rights from its mainland trading links while some market participants had hoped the exchange would relax the rules that bar such companies a primary listing is emerging as an alternative path bilibili inc last week won shareholder approval to convert its secondary hong kong listing status to dual primary while zai lab ltd completed the procedure in june unlike companies with a primary listing in hong kong firms with a secondary listing in the city are exempted from certain listing rules and don t have to disclose things such as financial guarantees provided to affiliates and stock pledges made by the controlling shareholder under current rules a company will be required to convert its listing status to primary if 55 or more of the trading volume takes place on the hong kong bourse over the past fiscal year still most secondary listed firms including alibaba are far from reaching that threshold according to data compiled by bloomberg i am seeing quite a clear trend that homecoming issuers are gravitating towards a dual primary listing as opposed to a secondary said hkex head of listing bonnie chan during the interview companies seeking to convert can also discuss with hkex on continuing exemption for some time to help with smooth transition she said aguzin also expressed confidence that more connectivity with the mainland will boost trading volume and lift the exchange s prospects hkex shares have lost 18 since he took over in may 2021 here are some of the other topics aguzin discussed his comments have been lightly edited and condensed hong kong s role from the overall china point of view having the possibility of having a place that can be international and competitive it s very important and a great advantage that s why my view is that is this going to be another city of mainland why who benefit from that the logical conclusion is that there is a lot of value in being the most international city of china the most chinese city outside of the mainland there s not a change in terms of making sure that this is an international financial center that s very high on the agenda i feel very encouraged by being able to operate this as an international exchange i don t feel any constraints from any side quarantine policy my expectation is as we start coming out of this situation the amount of quarantine will probably be condensed hopefully very soon we will have no quarantine i look forward to the day that we can travel back and forth i used to travel for one day just to new york and come back now it s unthinkable learning from crypto whenever you do a transaction it takes 48 hours to settle and it s touched by on average 10 to 12 people there are so many people getting a little cut of everything you look at some of the crypto exchanges i don t want to be a crypto exchange right now but there are things to learn from everyone the ease of use how you can trade 24 hours a day peer to peer without intermediary automatic settlement at anytime a really efficient way of operating 2022 bloomberg l p

expected to open lower on tuesday as trading starts in earnest after the independence day holiday with expectations that the us will soon start rolling back tariffs on imports from china bringing only some short lived cheer to the market prevailing concerns about the rising trajectory for inflation and interest rates are proving hard to displace however and stock futures were back under pressure

5 naeem aslan chief market analyst at avatrade com said higher inflation has created a significant threat to the us economy and there are higher chances of the us economy falling into a recession investors believe that if president biden rolls back some of the trump administration tariffs on china it will positively impact inflation meaning we could see inflation numbers falling but not significantly some investors are holding out hope that the second half of the year may prove a little better for equity markets the first half of the year was particularly rough for stocks with the s p 500 index recording its worst performance since 1970 but any move to adjust tariffs on chinese imports is only likely to ease inflation slightly and broader price pressures look like they are here to stay there are also key data coming out this week that will help decide market direction two important economic events are taking place this week and traders are highly likely to focus on them first we will get the fed minutes which will give us more clarity about the fed s think behind their current hawkish monetary policy said aslam the federal reserve policy meeting minutes are due at 2

a lawsuit filed tuesday alleges bill hwang used his religion to create a toxic culture at the family office archegos misappropriated employees deferred compensation plan and lied to his investing team about the firm s strategy brendan sullivan a technology and media analyst who joined the firm in 2014 and left shortly after it crashed in 2021 is the plaintiff in the lawsuit he says he lost 50 million from the firm s 500 million deferred compensation plan which evaporated when archegos blew up this story is available exclusively to business insider subscribers become an insider and start reading now archegos imploded in march 2021 when hwang was forced to unwind several highly leveraged bets in april this year hwang and archegos chief financial officer patrick halligan were arrested at their homes on fraud and racketeering charges brought by federal prosecutors they have since pleaded not guilty at the time hwang was also slapped with market manipulation charges by the securities and exchange commission it is one thing to push a position with your own money past the point of no return but a fiduciary managing others money can t do that michael bowe of brown rudnick sullivan s lawyer told insider hwang used these employees deferred compensation to fund his own scheme and he and his executives lied and concealed the facts over and over to do so hwang s lawyer lawrence lustberg did not respond to a request for comment insider rounded up the seven most interesting claims about the previously under the radar firm made in the 99 page lawsuit filed tuesday in a new york federal court 1 how the suit says hwang interviewed and monitored employees during the interview process hwang rolled out an investigation into a candidate s religious upbringing the lawsuit alleges if this employee got hired their religious views would be monitored throughout their career at archegos the suit claims during annual performance reviews the suit says hwang would request employees spend more time focusing on their faith and ask them and their families to join scripture readings hosted by his foundation grace and mercy foundation which is a defendant in the lawsuit on off site retreats employees had to say what they were thankful for the lawsuit says those who declared they were grateful for god hwang and archegos received high praise and manufactured applause the complaint says employees who outwardly displayed similar devotion in the office received praise and advancement the trustworthiness of employees who did not show the same level of devotion was scrutinized sullivan s suit claims 2 hwang often made promises to employees that he didn t keep suit claims sullivan s suit says that during firmwide zoom meetings in november 2020 hwang repeatedly told employees that he was getting ready to take down positions through large block trades which he actually kept from january to march 2021 in january 2021 hwang told an analyst that he was done adding to positions but continued to purchase positions in stocks the complaint alleges hwang continued to make these misrepresentations until the crash for example during a one on one conversation in early march 2021 hwang told sullivan that he was in the process of de risking the portfolio the lawsuit says all these representations were lies hwang never intended to engage in block sales and was merely seeking to deflect and stall employee concerns and departures and permit him to continue adding to these positions recklessly and inexplicably 3 hwang misled analysts about career prospects suit alleges the lawsuit says hwang also led many new analysts to believe they would one day manage their own funds after joining the company for example a new analyst who was hired in 2018 said that a key career goal of his was to independently manage funds when he was offered a job archegos copresidents brian jones and diana pae said the analyst was going to help launch a fund of one with jones the lawsuit says as time went on employees started to express concerns about the fund of one opportunity it adds in september 2020 jones told the analyst that they would be given 25 million to begin managing the fund with the hopes that the fund would begin on october 1 2020 the lawsuit claims related story october 1 came and went and no fund was created the suit says 4 suit says hwang used his foundation as a safe haven the suit alleges hwang often moved money from archegos accounts into his foundation which distributes grants to other christian nonprofits and his family s own private accounts it claims hwang along with co ceo andy mills and pae and jones considered the foundation a safe haven for themselves in case archegos was ever hit these descriptions became more frequent and explicit in 2020 2021 as hwang and the executive defendants dangled potential positions at the foundation before employees as one of the several means of deflecting employee concerns pressuring them to remain and for some inducing them to lie or remain silent about the fraudulent scheme that eventually imploded archegos the lawsuit says hwang is accused of stalling employee departures to prevent employees from pursuing civil claims and criminal complaints the lawsuit claims that as the firm was in its meltdown hwang told sullivan and other employees on march 26 2021 that he was either going to move employees over to the foundation to run their asset management division help seed spin off firms or form archegos 2 0 and a smaller family office using the foundation s capital each of these plans had one consistent thread misappropriation of foundation capital the lawsuit says as archegos fell apart 15 to 30 employees were offered positions at the foundation 5 hwang drastically changed archegos trading strategy the lawsuit says many of hwang s employees had questioned the direction of the firm s trading and investment strategies after the fallout from a market frenzy of march 2020 hwang was emotionally incapable of accepting that his fantastic run of oversized returns might need to pause it says instead hwang adopted a far riskier strategy of buying huge leverage fueled positions in much smaller market cap stocks with limited trading liquidity some of these stocks were viacomcbs discovery communications and a variety of chinese internet stocks including baidu iqiyi vipshop holdings tencent music and gsx the suit says sullivan kept asking hwang and other archegos executives why they were increasing positions in illiquid stocks hwang mills jones and pae told employees that the firm hadn t fundamentally changed its trading strategies but was instead simply focusing on different investments with greater potential upside the lawsuit says 6 the cult of hwang the complaint claims that if an employee raised questions about hwang s investment strategy or suggested an alternative hwang would often copy the firm in a reply that disparaged and demeaned the employee and the employee s thoughts the suit says the firm valued employees who were good followers and that hwang took singular credit for all of the firm s successes during the years archegos performed well hwang regularly asked employees why he was paying them and would state you should be paying me and i m the reason for this result you are lucky to work for me the lawsuit says employees who did not fall in line especially with religious beliefs were also targeted the lawsuit adds for example mills once told an employee they could stand to skip a few meals the suit says during another dinner meeting hwang told an employee that they needed to lose weight 7 employee compensation plan switch in december 2020 employees asked pae about the positions archegos was making in the employee deferred compensation plan the suit says she said that the plan had lots of unrealized gains it adds that same month on an investment team zoom meeting hwang mills pae halligan and jones made clear to sullivan and the other employees that archegos had plenty of cash on hand and hedges to protect their positions avoid catastrophic margin calls and preserve employee plan contributions and returns the lawsuit says instead the deferred compensation plan which was invested in archegos fund lost 500 million sullivan alleges
mexico leader to end daylight saving keep god s clock mexico city mexico s president submitted a bill tuesday to end daylight saving time putting an end to the practice of changing clocks twice a year health secretary jorge alcocer said mexico should return to god s clock or standard time arguing that setting clocks back or forward damages people s health that would mean darkness falling an hour earlier on summer afternoons the recommendable thing is to return to standard time which is when the solar clock coincides with the people s clock the clock of god alcocer argued mexicans set their clocks ahead this year on april 3 and are scheduled to set them back on oct 30 the changes if approved would presumably apply to next year the change would mean central mexican time which covers most of the country potentially could be permanently two hours behind the east coast of the united states it is now one hour behind for most of the year the u s senate in march passed a bill to make daylight savings permanent though the measure has not passed the house of representatives economists argue that while the energy savings are minimal going back to standard time might cause trouble for financial markets in mexico by putting u s east coast markets so far ahead president andrÃ©s manuel lÃ³pez obrador has said he is considering keeping daylight savings time for some northern border states and businesses like restaurants that have become accustomed to staying open later may have to close earlier as many crime wary mexicans often try to be off the streets after dark nearly a dozen states across the u s have already standardized daylight saving time

organizers behind five citizen initiated referendum questions in portland including one that would raise the minimum wage to 18 per hour by 2025 have gathered enough signatures to get their proposals on the november ballot four of the referendums are being brought forward by the maine chapter of the democratic socialists of america s livable portland campaign in addition to raising the minimum wage the group is seeking to strengthen protections for tenants reduce the number of short term rentals and put restrictions on cruise ships coming into the city the industry and culture that are causing so many to flock to portland depends on the labor of the city s vibrant working and renting class wes pelletier the campaign chair said in a statement tuesday our communities are being threatened by landlords making record profits off of an affordable housing crisis wages being outpaced by inflation and climate change and congestion pulverizing our waterfront portland is on track to become unlivable but we re organizing to correct that course a fifth referendum brought forward by organizer scott ferris aims to regulate short term rentals by prohibiting corporate owners and non local operators from registering short term rentals in the city prohibiting evictions for the purpose of immediate conversion to short term rentals and increasing penalties for violations of existing short term rental regulations organizers gathered at least 1 500 valid signatures from registered city voters for each proposal to make the nov 8 ballot the city council will now vote to approve putting each measure on the ballot vote to adopt the measure itself or vote to add competing measures to the ballot maine dsa s campaign comes two years after the group led a successful push to pass an earlier slate of citizen initiatives in 2020 that included rent control the green new deal building code and an increase of the minimum wage to 15 per hour by 2024 advertisement the current minimum wage in the city is 13 per hour and the state minimum wage is 12 75 per hour wages cruise ships tenants the new minimum wage proposal seeks to increase the minimum wage to 18 by 2025 with incremental increases over the next three years it also would do away with the sub minimum wage for tipped workers and would create a city department of fair labor practices to enforce laws ordinances and policies related to labor practices pelletier said in an interview that an 18 minimum wage seemed like a good wage to make sure we re not putting an undue burden on employers while also making sure employees can live in portland he also said that eliminating the sub minimum wage for tipped workers will help alleviate uncertainty for service industry workers many of whom have struggled to pay rent during the pandemic tips will be preserved pelletier said we believe people will still tip and that tips should go on top of the minimum wage another proposal from the group seeks to strengthen tenant protections that include restricting deposits to one month s rent prohibiting application fees and further limiting the standard amount of annual rent increases landlords are allowed to impose to 70 percent of the change in the consumer price index that proposal also would set a 25 000 fee for condominium conversions advertisement and a third proposal would put new restrictions on cruise ships coming into the city requiring ships to obtain a city issued permit in order to disembark passengers and limiting the number of passengers who can disembark to 1 000 per day the pandemic suppressed cruise ship visits to the city there weren t any in 2020 and in 2021 only small ships of about 100 passengers came though more than 75 ships are scheduled to arrive in the city this year including several with upward of 3 000 passengers on board the proposal says the large number of guests who have arrived in the city on cruise ships over the years has at times resulted in excessive congestion traffic and pollution on the waterfront and made it more difficult for the city to deliver health and safety services this section is therefore enacted for the purpose of reasonably regulating the disembarking of passengers and crew from cruise ships visiting the city of portland preserving good order and peace in the city providing for the public health safety and welfare and regulating the use of public facilities in the furtherance of private commercial activities it says two proposals for short term rentals dsa s short term rental proposal seeks to restrict short term rentals such as those advertised on sites like airbnb to only those that are owner occupied tenant occupied or located in two unit buildings occupied by the owner it also would change the annual fee for owner occupied short term rentals to 250 per unit and 750 per non owner occupied unit owner occupied short term rentals are currently charged between 100 and 1 000 depending on number of units while non owner occupied rentals pay between 200 and 4 000 advertisement and it would require notification to residents within 500 feet of a registered short term rental increase penalties for ordinance violations require the logging of complaints against short term rentals and allow the city to revoke short term rental registrations a different proposal from ferris and a group of homeowners many of whom operate short term rentals in the city seeks to make other changes to the city s short term rental regulations their proposal would prohibit corporate owners and non local operators from registering short term rentals in the city prohibit evictions for the purpose of immediate conversion to short term rentals and increase the penalty for violation of the ordinance from 1 000 to 1 500 ferris who operates a short term rental unit with his wife on the third floor of their parkside home said the group of homeowners are seeking to make small improvements to the city s existing regulations as a group we have a lot of experience with this and we want to make it better ferris said we saw that the city s existing regulations go a long way we like what s there we just saw an opportunity with our referendum to enhance that a little bit and fine tune it he said the referendum aims to preserve the positive impacts of the short term rental economy while keeping ownership with local residents we want to make sure that going forward that short term rentals can be a part of our diverse economy here ferris said of course we want to have a positive image and have responsible ownership and management which is key to any sort of rental and we want to help make sure that s in place opposition and support advertisement the portland regional chamber of commerce has raised concerns about the dsa s four proposals saying in an email to members in june that the minimum wage proposal would raise business costs during a time of inflation and harm the ability of hospitality workers to earn tips and that the proposed tenant protection measures would discourage investments in the city s housing stock quincy hentzel the chamber s president and ceo said in an email tuesday that the chamber remains concerned about the four proposals and that governing by referendum has proven to be catastrophic and is not the way we should be creating or changing policy in portland she cited the green new deal referendum passed in 2020 which some developers have said is hindering new projects and which the city recently said would add to the cost and time needed for renovations to open a new temporary homeless shelter hentzel also said that having two short term rental proposals on the ballot will confuse voters if there is an issue or a challenge to be addressed in our city it should go to the city council where we can have a proper discussion and deliberation of the facts with all interested parties and stakeholders she said we stand ready to participate in city council policy discussions that produce policies that will better the lives of all portlanders dsa released statements from several community members and officials in support of their initiatives in its statement advertisement all workers deserve to be paid a fair livable and reliable wage by employers in addition to our hard earned tips rather than having to rely on inconsistent income as a significant portion of our base wages said katherine knowles a server at flatbread company speaking in favor of the minimum wage proposal not knowing how much i will earn from week to week makes it incredibly difficult to plan for my future especially in the covid era jess falero a portland resident and co founder of the maine people s housing coalition which works to end homelessness and guarantee safe affordable housing for all voiced support for both the dsa s short term rental proposal and the protections for tenants str s have squeezed too many long term residents out of the market said falero who was formerly homeless i personally know too many in the community who were evicted just so a landlord could raise the rent these two initiatives will reverse those trends and i encourage everyone who cares about keeping our city livable to join me in voting yes this fall send questions comments to the editors previous next filed under

consider your home bathroom you probably have a lot of toiletries in there such as soap deodorant and perfume in today s age these items are associated with cleanliness and health but were they always believe it or not humanity has had a love hate relationship with body odor for millennia whether sweet pungent or simply not there at all different cultures have unique outlooks on body aroma shaped by fascinating histories so what s led us to our modern day efforts of deodorant and soap what did ancient humans do before these items were created as they are today read on to find out body odor isn t from sweat it s from sweat bacteria before we dive into the history of perfumes let s first cover why we need these toiletries in the first place most of us think of sweat as the main culprit when it comes to body odor however sweat itself doesn t actually smell like much of anything instead it s what the sweat causes that leads to body odor see there are lots of bacteria both in and on our bodies one of these bacteria is called staphylococcus hominis and it takes great advantage of our body s natural functions these bacteria consume certain compounds in your sweat and then release chemicals that cause the dreaded smell of b o or body odor so in areas where you sweat more you smell more because the bacteria are eating more ancient people of course didn t know about the specific cause of body odor but they did know it was a significant issue they identified the parts of the body where odor occurred the most and blamed it on sweat trying to combat it first with perfumes and later with deodorants the history of humans combating their body s odors starts all the way back with the ancient egyptians the early egyptians and the greeks and romans all made use of incense to cover up body odor smells in crowded places olegd adobe stock masking body odor from pastes to posies ancient egyptians were the first humans in recorded history to have attempted masking body odor some of the methods egyptians used were to produce special concoctions out of ingredients such as tortoiseshell ostrich eggs and gallnuts that they would apply to their bodies like a paste they would then incorporate different natural oils into the pastes often applying them on their head neck and wrists to keep them smelling fresh eventually they started using plants such as cinnamon lemongrass myrrh lily and rose in their pastes some pastes were so thick they were like a wax and would be applied to the top of the head in the morning so it would melt down the body as the day progressed egyptians also enjoyed their fair share of incense and would burn it frequently to keep areas with lots of sweaty humans smelling fresh eventually they continued working with their pastes and waxes until they began creating scented beads which they used to make fragrant jewelry to adorn themselves with ancient hieroglyphics suggest that ancient egyptians also used to wear perfumed cones on their head made of waxy material similar to the beads after the ancient egyptians ancient greeks and romans started creating their own strong smelling spices and perfumes often these were seen as luxury goods and were quite difficult to get your hands on if you couldn t find them on your local trade route in fact the earliest known perfumery can be traced back to the roman empire where daily bathing and masking scents were normal aspects of roman life romans would soak in a bath adorned with sweet smelling flowers before anointing themselves with scented oils and salves mostly made of essential oils early oils and salves to mask body odor were produced from flowers like violet chamomile rose lavender and jasmine couleur cc0 at this point many of these oils and salves were produced from flowers like violet chamomile rose lavender and jasmine they may also have incorporated fragrant spices like cinnamon cloves and camphor in addition to animal byproducts such as civet musk and ambergris these fragrances were often carried in small bottles tied to their wrists so they could be reapplied throughout the day while powdered fragrances for clothing were carried in fabric sachets perfumes salves and incense were an everyday part of early european culture and they eventually became a significant part of many religious rituals as well around the 5th century judaism and christianity began to incorporate essential oils and incense into their rituals mainly because priests needed to cover up the scent of their stinky followers with so many people congregating in one area spaces became crowded and smells became pungent leading to incense burning becoming a regular part of religious ceremonies at the same time many priests condemned the use of personal perfumes on the body claiming they were a form of vanity to avoid such a sin christians stopped regularly bathing and using perfumes for several centuries identifying christians became obvious as they were amongst those that were the dirtiest and smelliest in society islamic communities on the other hand did not have these same teachings on vanity and therefore kept bathing alive and well eventually bathing slowed down and perfumes became the primary weapon against stench due to the bubonic plague because it was believed it was spread through the air and because humans didn t discover germs yet bathhouses were closed leaving people no choice but to return to aromatics in some regions large bonfires would be held to burn large amounts of oil to spread the aroma throughout the town at this time small flower bouquets called posies were designed to be carried as accessories so you could put them against your nose as needed as time without baths passed other misinformation began to be spread because there was still little to no understanding about how illness came about some early physicians in the 15th and 16th centuries spread the concept that bathing may actually be harmful these scientists claimed that water softened the skin which weakened the skin over time and could cause illness while some avoided baths to keep their skin strong those that chose to continue to bathe took extreme precautions to slather themselves in oils before entering the water and removing themselves quickly so as not to become too soft the french in the 17th and 18th centuries tried to develop new methods of perfuming people and places they would often infuse strong essential oils into everyday objects such as fountains and clothing to help mask odors these items all became extremely popular with consumers quickly turning france into the leader of the international perfume industry at that time the french also took posies to a new level creating a smelling box accessory that held fabric soaked in liquid fragrances they advertised these boxes as having medicinal qualities as well as being a stronger accessory for odor masking than posies clean running water was the next step in the evolution of basic hygiene levels in crowded cities and this meant modern sewers and industrial water cleaning methods kristina blokhin adobe stock clean running water at home changed everything in the 19th century europe took the initiative to improve sanitation throughout several countries within just a few decades they had greatly expanded community access to fresh water developed new sewer systems and created an organized trash disposal system with bathing and basic hygiene becoming normalized again extremely strong perfumes were no longer as necessary as they were before it was around this time that perfumes became less pharmaceutical and more cosmetic once they became cosmetic they became more associated with femininity just like other cosmetics to smell good was to be a clean good woman around this time the us started getting wind of new hygiene practices from europe though they previously rejected european hygiene and rarely bathed the late 19th century brought about new advancements in cleanliness for americans americans began installing sewers and expanding access to water as europe did and by the 20th century they started using showers toilets and toothbrushes in 1888 the world s first commercial deodorant marketed as mum was developed in philadelphia mum was a waxy creamy concoction designed to be applied on your sweatiest smelliest parts soon after in 1903 the world s first antiperspirant was introduced which contained aluminum chloride aluminum chloride is an aluminum salt that s able to block sweat and is still used in many deodorants today the only issue with these early antiperspirants was that they were highly acidic so they often left stains on clothing and even caused a burning sensation on the wearer for some this was a small price to pay for reduced sweat and odor eventually companies making antiperspirants began targeting women to boost their sales making claims that women who didn t use their products were unappealing to men these ads also claimed that nobody would be willing to tell these women about their hygiene issues so it was best for them to take care of it before anyone noticed through the early 1900s deodorant was primarily marketed to and purchased by women it wasn t until 1935 that the first men s deodorant was produced sold in sleek black packaging to entice men to buy it for its manliness instead of advertising that men would be unattractive to women without deodorant ads frequently posed that men would be judged by their bosses and coworkers for their body odor these advertisements created concern in working men for their job stability so they too started buying and using deodorant regularly for a few decades we have used super modern deodorants and daily showers and lots more to ensure that we have no body odor at all or almost but that s not true for everyone everywhere drobot dean adobe stock stink no more modern science creates miracles over time deodorants shifted from creamy pastes into roll on sticks then aerosols then normal sticks deodorant is now considered a regular part of our hygiene routine regardless of the type of antiperspirant you purchase nowadays we have a plethora of hygiene products including deodorants soaps shampoos and perfumes with so many options body odor has taken a backseat as long as you use them as society advances new hygiene products are being developed and sold constantly natural deodorants and paraben free shampoos are becoming more common as many wish to return to a time before preservatives and extra chemicals which can cause irritation with frequent use in the future we will likely see many other types of methods to block body odor whether in the form of perfumes soaps or antiperspirants fingers crossed that

seeking to boost his standing with frustrated blue collar voters president joe biden on wednesday will use the backdrop of a union training center in cleveland to tell workers his policies will shore up troubled pension funding for millions now on the job or retired washington ap seeking to boost his standing with frustrated blue collar voters president joe biden on wednesday will use the backdrop of a union training center in cleveland to tell workers his policies will shore up troubled pension funding for millions now on the job or retired hurt politically by inflation at a 40 year high and damages wrought by the pandemic the president is anchoring his message to workers in the former election bellwether of ohio the buckeye state has been trending strongly republican with donald trump easily carrying it twice and this is biden s sixth visit as president as he labors to personally reverse that electoral tide biden s speech at the iron workers local 17 training center is timed to the announcement of a final administrative rule that is tied to his 1 9 trillion coronavirus relief package from last year the rule allows troubled multi company pensions to be made financially whole ensuring full benefits for 2 million to 3 million workers and retirees details about biden s remarks were shared by two administration officials who insisted on anonymity to preview his speech the roughly 200 pension plans receiving assistance faced possible insolvency without government aid without the full benefits workers and retirees could struggle to pay for housing food and other essentials the financial support should help keep the pension funds solvent for roughly 30 years until 2051 that s important several retirees said bill devito 73 was an iron worker for almost 50 years before retiring a decade ago when his pension was cut 40 in 2017 he said it was devastating the thing of it is we had a lot of politicians over the years saying hey we ll try to help you we ll do everything we can and nobody s ever done anything for us until joe biden come along he said he said that other ohio democrats in washington kept pushing too jeffrey carlson 67 of the cleveland suburb of north ridgeville said that a year before he retired in 2017 he learned his pension would be cut too i m grateful for anything that we could get back he said i know i earned it i worked hard carlson a long time democrat said he knows public opinion has turned against biden but he still supports the president i think he s doing what he has to do and trying to make the best of it and i think he s looking out for as a whole looking out for our side of it for the working man multiemployer plans are created through agreements between companies and a union and are insured by the federal pension benefit guaranty corporation pbgc in 2014 congress passed the multiemployer pension reform act that allowed plans for the first time to cut workers and retirees benefits in order to ensure that pensions projected to run out of money remained solvent the american rescue plan passed in march 2021 included a special finance assistance program that allows struggling multiemployer pension plans to apply to the pbgc for assistance the final rule being unveiled by the biden administration is designed to make it easier for the pensions investments to receive a higher rate of return the effort to highlight a program to bolster union workers comes as democrats hope to pick up a u s senate seat in ohio where a strong showing with working class voters could play pivotal role republican rob portman is leaving the senate after two terms vying to replace him are democratic rep tim ryan and republican j d vance the author of the memoir hillbilly elegy who secured an endorsement during the primary from trump ohio voters backed trump in 2016 and 2020 with his margin of victory each time at roughly eight percentage points while biden boasts of steady job growth unemployment sits at 3 6 americans have largely been discontented with the democratic president s handling of the economy as inflation continues to rise interest rates increase and the stock market wobbles just 28 percent approve of biden s stewardship of the economy down from 51 a year ago according to an ap norc center for public affairs research poll published last week biden has made extensive commitments to boost ohio s economy but his efforts suffered a recent setback as intel postponed the july 22 groundbreaking for a computer chip plant near the state capital of columbus the decision came after a planned investment of more than 50 billion in the semiconductor industry stalled in congress senate republican leader mitch mcconnell said on twitter last week that he would block the computer chip bill if congressional democrats pursue passage of their budget and domestic agenda as planned in the face of republican opposition biden has highlighted the planned computer chip plant as a commitment to u s manufacturing part of the message he hopes to stress by aiding pensions for plant workers his efforts to fund the distressed pensions would extend the solvency of the government s pbgc multiemployer insurance program from 2026 to 2055 full benefits would be restored to 80 000 workers and retirees who have had their benefits cut biden has often emphasized his administration s efforts supporting trade union members who are a major part of his political identity the president likes to proclaim that the middle class built america and that unions built the middle class in an april speech to union workers in washington he offered support for amazon employees in staten island new york who had voted to form a union by declaring by the way amazon here we come watch in may during an international brotherhood of electrical workers conference biden derided trump as the great maga king poking fun at the former president s make america great campaign slogan that has resonated with many blue collar voters in the industrial midwest he is hitting repeatedly on an economic theme against republicans heading into november s midterm elections saying that the gop for all its criticism of him has few tangible solutions to major policy problems facing the country including spiking inflation ___ ap writer julie carr smyth contributed from columbus ohio this story was first published

li shigong u s president donald trump had expected to host the group of seven g7 summit in his florida resort in late june he tried but gave up due to disappointing response from the leaders of other member countries in may despite the novel coronavirus disease covid 19 pandemic trump proposed a face to face leaders meeting instead of the previously planned online event also he attempted to expand g7 to g11 by including australia the republic of korea rok india and russia however trump s proposal failed to gain support german chancellor angela merkel declined his invitation citing the overall covid 19 situation french president emmanuel macron was open to travel to the u s only if the sanitary conditions allow a possible invitation for russia met with resistance from canada britain and the eu on may 30 trump announced that he decided to postpone the summit to september or later publicity stunt trump s attempt to exploit the g7 summit by including more members or even achieving a thaw in u s russian ties aimed at scoring political points or creating a diplomatic legacy of his first term he hoped it would give him an edge in the upcoming presidential election winning a second term has been the top priority of trump and all his agendas are designed to serve this purpose however the u s domestic situation is becoming increasingly unfavorable for him the covid 19 epidemic continues to rage in the u s and seems unlikely to wane in near future the trump administration s weak response and his prioritizing the election and the economy over people s health and lives have been heavily criticized by the public and the democratic party as for the economy stock market meltdowns and the high unemployment rate might undo trump s economic achievements which he loves to brag about moreover the killing of george floyd an african american by a white minneapolis police officer has once again exposed racism and social segregation in the u s nationwide protests have erupted seriously impacting trump s approval ratings trump also intended to revive the g7 the bloc comprising britain canada france germany italy japan and the u s was established to coordinate economic policies of major western industrial powers to maintain their international economic dominance in the 1970s as it represents only some developed economies interests its influence has continued to decline as the international landscape evolved from western dominance to west east balance the financial crisis of 2008 demonstrated that developed countries were unable to shoulder the responsibility of global economic governance and the group of 20 g20 which includes emerging market economies has since played an increasingly important role worse still the g7 summits after trump took office have seen frequent disputes due to divergences between the u s and other members also as the u s is intensifying its strategic containment of china it attempted to make the g7 and the proposed g11 a platform for its efforts by readmitting russia into the group trump hoped to bring it on the u s side the invitation for australia is a bonus for its stance against china the proposed participation of india is an attempt to further exploit the geopolitical rift between china and india and to draw india into playing a key role in the so called indo pacific strategy and wooing the rok means stirring up trouble in the korean peninsula whose stability is essential to china s development wrong calculation but trump s wishful thinking proved to be a mirage due to health concerns over covid 19 it is hard for european leaders to go to the u s to back trump for the presidential election although european countries have mostly lifted coronavirus lockdowns they are still cautious about reopening international travel especially across continents meetings of leaders of major eu countries like germany and france have been held online so have the eu leaders summit and ministerial meetings as the u s epidemic situation remains grave leaders travel to the u s will not only be highly risky but also set a bad example to the public making prevention and control efforts more difficult domestically moreover the divergences between european countries and the u s make european leaders uninterested in a non essential meeting as they think no tangible results would be achieved in recent years they have sparred on multiple issues such as trade the iranian nuclear deal climate change and arms control the g7 summit in canada in 2018 and in france in 2019 all ended in discord and the coordination role of this platform has weakened significantly like trump leaders of major european countries also hope to revive the g7 but they hope more to give play to its role as a platform to shape global governance and international systems based on rules however broad multilateral cooperation has been rejected by the trump administration especially during the pandemic the u s slandered attacked and eventually withdrew from the world health organization a decision that disappointed european countries the most china containment trump s efforts to turn the g7 into a u s tool to contain china may also end in vain first most g7 countries are unwilling to be dragged into the u s campaign for example european countries and the u s have different interests and agendas in their relationships with china the u s develops its china policy from the point of maintaining its hegemony while the focus of the eu is maintaining cooperation based on existing mechanisms and rules therefore although the eu and the u s both think deeply about the impact of china s rapid development and how to respond to it they are far from reaching a consensus on strategic cooperation to contain china second australia india and the rok have their own plans and are unlikely to be pawns of the u s although they are part of the indo pacific strategy which is an important part of trump s overall strategy to maintain the u s global dominance the indo pacific strategy was initiated to serve u s interests this has been clearly recognized by regional countries and they are interested only in gaining some benefits from this strategy for example india plans to synergize the indo pacific strategy with its act east policy a policy to increase economic and military ties with several countries in east asia southeast asia and the asia pacific but it is almost impossible that new delhi will act in accordance with washington s orders and sacrifice its strategic independence the rok is also fully aware that siding with the u s will put its ties with china at risk lastly russia s readmission is highly controversial among g7 members the trump administration has striven to improve bilateral ties with russia

suppressed by western countries according to maria zakharova russian foreign ministry spokesperson it is obvious that it is hardly possible to implement serious global initiatives without china dong
