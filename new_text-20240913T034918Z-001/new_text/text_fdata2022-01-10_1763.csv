colombo sri lanka s president gotabaya rajapaksa asked china to help restructure debt repayments as part of efforts to help the south asian country weather a worsening financial crisis his office said in a statement on sunday rajapaksa made the request during a meeting with chinese foreign minister wang yi in colombo on sunday sri lanka has benefited from billions of dollars in soft loans from china but the island nation is currently in the midst of a foreign exchange crisis placing it on the verge of default according to analysts the president pointed out that it would be a great relief to the country if attention could be paid on restructuring the debt repayments as a solution to the economic crisis that has arisen in the face of the covid 19 pandemic rajapaksa s office said in the statement china is sri lanka s fourth biggest lender behind international financial markets the asian development bank adb and japan over the last decade china has lent sri lanka over 5 billion for highways ports an airport and a coal power plant but critics charge the funds were used for white elephant projects with low returns which china has denied rajapaksa also requested china to provide concessional terms for its exports to sri lanka which amounted to about 3 5 billion in 2020 the statement said but did not give more details rajapaksa also proposed allowing chinese tourists to return to sri lanka provided they adhere to strict covid restrictions including only staying at pre approved hotels and visiting only certain tourist attractions before the pandemic china was sri lanka s main source of tourists and the island imports more goods from china than from any other country sri lanka is a key part of china s belt and road initiative bri a long term plan to fund and build infrastructure linking china to the rest of the world but which others including the united states have labelled a debt trap for smaller nations sri lanka has to repay about 4 5 billion in debt this year starting with a 500 million international sovereign bond isb maturing on jan 18 a 1 5 billion yuan swap from china helped the island boost its reserves to 3 1 billion at the end of december debt repayment to china in 2022 is likely to be smaller than its isb commitments of 1 54 billion at about 400 million 500 million a sri lankan finance ministry source told reuters sri lanka s central bank has repeatedly assured all debt repayments will be met and said funds for the january isb has already been allocated
the omicron variant may be less fatal than the earlier versions but it is disrupting economies the surge in the delta variant well into q4 in the us and europe was already slowing the recoveries investors will likely take the high frequency real sector data with the proverbial pinch of salt until january data available beginning later this month while the tribalist approach exemplified by team transition and team permanent debates about inflation the recovery is precarious last week s data confirmed that the aggregate composite pmi in the eurozone fell in december for the fourth time in five months at 53 3 it finished the year at its lowest level since march the average in q4 22 was 54 3 down from 58 5 in q3 and 56 8 in q2 the us composite pmi peaked in may at 68 7 it has been trending lower since and in the last seven months of 2021 it rose once october it finished the year at 57 0 it averaged 57 3 in q4 up slightly from 56 8 in q3 though down from the q2 average of 65 3 the us economy lost some momentum as the quarter progressed and the risk may be on the downside in retail sales and industrial production reports due on january 14 although subject to statistically significant revisions q4 non farm payroll growth slowed to 365k almost half 43 of the q3 average retail sales may have stagnated or worse in december after averaging 1 gains over the previous four months we learned last week that december auto sales disappointed they were expected to have increased by nearly 2 seasonally adjusted annual rate but instead fell by nearly 3 5 to end the year with back to back monthly declines the components of retail sales that are used in many gdp models exclude the sales of autos gas stations building materials and food services it fell by 0 1 in november after rising an average of 1 6 in the previous three months despite the santa claus rally in us stocks in the days before christmas maybe scrooge stole xmas after all industrial production may have also downshifted recall that output fell by almost 1 2 in august and september before bouncing back by nearly 1 7 in october it rose by 0 5 in november helped by a 0 7 rise in manufacturing output the rig count increased by 48 in oct nov after increasing by 36k in the previous two months the anecdotal easing of some supply chain disruptions may have hit fresh ones china s zero covid strategy has led to dramatic lockdowns which may adversely impact supply chains and new price pressures of note the number of people on the non farm payrolls is still more than three million fewer than at the end of 2019 at the current pace it will take the first half to reach it on the other hand the industrial capacity utilization rate has surpassed the 76 6 average of q4 2019 in november the median forecast bloomberg survey is for the utilization rate to rise above 77 also note that the manufacturing inventory rebuilding is well underway and is likely to no longer be the significant tail wind it has been the six month average through october was the strongest in a decade of the slate of us economic reports the december cpi is the most impactful for market psychology and business sentiment it has peaked yet economists bloomberg survey look for a 0 4 rise in the headline and a 0 5 rise in the core measure given the base effect the year over year pace may increase from 6 8 to 7 0 in december 2020 the core rate was unchanged and the zero drops out of the 12 month comparison it may accelerate to 5 4 from 4 9 separately the producer price inflation also likely accelerated closer to 10 9 6 in november the new inflation prints will need to be understood in the context of two considerations first the market has already nearly priced in 75 bp in hikes this year which matches the median view of fed officials voting and non voting members there are several moving pieces here the apparent hawkishness of the december fomc minutes encouraged the market to boost the changes of a march hike it has risen from about a 66 chance at the end of last year to over 80 expectations can shift in favor of a fourth hike this year one a quarter at the end of 2022 the market following the fed s dot plot priced in nearly three hikes this year however after the fomc minutes the market priced in better than a 1 in 3 chance of a fourth hike shifting views on the timing of the roll off when the fed allows the balance sheet to shrink by slowing the recycling of maturing issues are more difficult to quantify but there is talk that it may begin around midyear the second consideration is that the amplitude of inflation says very little about its duration economists expect price pressures to gradually ease this year the blomberg survey found a median expectation for cpi to moderate over the next five quarters finishing this year at 2 8 and 2 5 at the end of q1 23 the projection for the pce deflator which the fed targets follows a similar pattern falling to 2 5 at the end of the year and 2 4 at the end of q1 23 this is very much in line with the fed s summary of economic projections which the median pce deflator forecast is 2 6 at the end of this year and 2 3 at the end of 2023 for the record imf is less sanguine it sees us cpi at 3 5 at the end of 2022 and at 2 7 at the end of next year the oecd forecasts the pce deflator at 4 4 at the end of this year and 2 5 at the end 2023 the fed s beige book headline at midweek may draw some attention few appear to really read the largely anecdotal survey but in light of the uncertainty surrounding the economic impact of the omicron variant it may attract more interest yet powell and brainard s confirmation hearings scrutinized for insight into how the fed is thinking about its balance sheet the bank of england indicated that it would stop recycling maturing proceeds when the base rate reaches 50 bp which could be as early as february the federal reserve has been more or less transparent on the topic but it is moving higher on the talking points in the market some economists see the fed allowing the run off to begin in the second half or after two rate hikes have been delivered china reports its december cpi and ppi early on january 12 in beijing even though the us cpi is driven primarily by energy housing medical care and recently used cars some observers have tried linking american inflation to china often via the ppi china s ppi appears to have peaked in october and is expected to have eased for the second consecutive month in december china s cpi jumped in october 0 7 and november 0 4 this lifted the headline rate to 2 3 year over year in november the highest since august 2020 however the base effect the soft demand spurred by the rolling lockdowns may see china s cpi soften in december and into early readings this year in december 2020 china s monthly cpi rose by 0 7 after falling in previous two months it rose 1 in january 2021 and 0 6 in february before falling again in the march through june period last year after cutting required reserve ratios and shaving the one year loan prime rate to 3 8 from 3 85 the pboc is understood to have an easing bias and the moderating price pressures this is also consistent with other signals from chinese officials of supportive policy the first move this year could take place before the end of the month ahead of the week long lunar new year celebration year of the tiger which starts january 31 another 50 bp cut in required reserve ratio seems like the most likely step but the pboc may also cut the one year medium lending facility rate which has stood at 2 95 since april 2020 lastly we turn to geopolitics there are a series of meetings set to ostensibly diffuse the situation in eastern europe unfortunately we are not particularly optimistic and suspect these meetings are important formalities this is to say that russia s demands cannot be met putin seeks to be given back the sphere of influence that the soviet union had it is difficult to imagine nato freezing its membership on command it has made gestures to ukraine and georgia but has not been anxious to follow through but there are also scenarios under which sweden and finland would join moreover putin s demand that the us have nuclear weapon bases abroad cut to the heart of the us commitment to nato the us and european response will likely be trying to asphyxiate russia financially but they are unlikely to raise the cost of an invasion to prohibitive levels any suffering will be blamed on the west the moves could range from banning trading and investing in russian government bonds ejecting it from swift to sanctioning the large state owned banks restricting imports of russian goods commodities and finally canceling the all ready build nord stream 2 pipeline in the fog of war the euro would likely come under pressure and we suspect the swiss franc which is already trading near its best levels against the euro since 2015 would appreciate further the post crash when snb removed the floor of the cross low made a was near chf1 0235 and a break of it would threat parity it could elicit a response by the swiss national bank similarly the euro hovering at its lowest level against sterling since march 2020 confirming the break of gbp0 8400 the next important chart area is around gbp0 8275 that said in the futures market speculators are more short sterling than the swiss franc and they have a larger short franc than euro position energy prices would likely spike europe still gets around two thirds of natural gas from russia the ukraine pipeline would likely be an early casualty us and some asian cargoes were diverted to europe late last month several more us ships are reportedly headed toward europe now but asian demand has picked up recently risk may come off more broadly until russia s intentions are clear some strategists suspect putin will be content with the eastern part of the country while intimidating the western part a

suphachai chearavanont chief executive of charoen pokphand group cp the agribusiness giant recently mentioned dire economic prospects including the ominous word hyperinflation hyperinflation worries stem from a combination of factors including us china tensions the global food and energy crises a potential cryptocurrency bubble and massive ongoing capital injections into the world economy to keep it afloat during the pandemic he said the skyrocketing prices of pork in thailand and an uptick in headline inflation for four consecutive months underline mr suphachai s concerns pressing issues include how hyperinflation is defined whether could it happen in thailand and how it affects overall consumers domestic interest rates and the recovering economy hyperinflation is a term economists use to describe a period of extremely high inflation which measures the rate of rising prices for goods and services typically an economy must record an inflation rate greater than 50 for at least a month before economists label it hyperinflation slim chance ronnarong phoolpipat director general of the trade policy and strategy office tpso said despite a continual increase in the prices of certain goods and services the possibility of hyperinflation in thailand is slim because the economy remains stable and is growing gradually as reflected in the first nine months of 2021 when it expanded by 1 3 the economy should see continued growth in 2022 he said the inflation rate is the percentage increase or decrease in prices during a specified period usually a month or a year the percentage indicates how quickly prices rose or fell during the period there are generally two causes of inflation the most common is demand pull inflation this is when demand outpaces supply of goods or services meaning buyers want the product so much they re willing to pay higher prices for it cost push inflation is the second cause cost push inflation occurs when overall prices increase because of rises in the cost of wages and raw materials cost push inflation can occur when higher costs of production decrease the aggregate supply the amount of total production in the economy some people count built in inflation as a third cause this factors in people s expectations of future inflation when prices rise labour expects an increase in wages to keep up but higher wages raise the cost of production which raises prices of goods and services again when this cause and effect cycle continues it becomes a wage price spiral according to the planning unit of the commerce ministry there are four main types of inflation categorised by their speed mild moderate galloping and hyperinflation mild inflation is when prices rise 3 a year or less while moderate inflation is between 3 10 a year a rate considered harmful to the economy because it heats up economic growth too fast galloping inflation is when prices rise 10 or more wreaking havoc on the economy hyperinflation is when prices skyrocket more than 50 a month the rate considered the most severe reflecting a dramatic lack of confidence in the public sector while the currency nosedives and prices of goods increase by leaps and bounds often when people anticipate the prices of goods rising they will stock up most hyperinflation occurs in countries where governments have printed a lot of banknotes to pay for their expenses because of insufficient income according to the planning unit mr ronnarong gave as an example a country in south america where the main income is from oil exports when global crude oil prices dropped and income was insufficient to cover rising expenses the government continued to implement populist policies by printing a large number of banknotes without cutting expenditure lacking fiscal discipline this led to hyperinflation he said stable status according to mr ronnarong thailand s monetary and fiscal status remain stable reflected in the public debt to gdp ratio in october 2021 being 58 8 below the ceiling of 70 under the fiscal sustainability framework more importantly thailand s international reserves remain relatively high at us 243 billion as of november 2021 while the country s international trade continues to expand he said exports for the past 11 months grew 16 4 with imports growing by 29 4 resulting in a trade surplus of 3 92 billion mr ronnarong said the country s inflation rate was at a stable level in 2021 increasing by 1 23 in line with the bank of thailand s inflation target range of 1 3 which it considers an appropriate rate and conducive to economic expansion in addition thailand s inflation for the past 44 years 1977 2021 expanded by less than 50 the highest average inflation growth was 19 7 in 1980 followed in 1981 by 12 7 the next highest rate was 9 9 in 1979 the high inflation rate during these three years was mainly attributed to rising energy prices affecting most economic activities he said thailand will definitely not have hyperinflation because the thai economy remains stable and the finance ministry commerce ministry and other agencies have policies and regulatory measures aimed at providing a stable and sustainable economy mr ronnarong said hyperinflation unlikely pipat luengnaruemitchai chief economist at kkp research under kiatnakin phatra securities said hyperinflation would not occur in thailand because the inflation rate in the country has yet to rise sharply the recovery of both the economy and employment have been fragile meaning they are unlikely to push the inflation rate rapidly thailand s higher inflation is mainly the result of rising food and oil prices he said however food and energy prices represent only 20 30 of the country s inflation basket higher oil prices are mostly dependent on the global market even though the global oil price has been rising and is higher than last year the increase has not been continuous the research house predicts thailand s inflation surge is going to be short lived however mr pipat said the higher inflation rate would have an outsized impact on low income earners and some business operators for low income earners food and energy prices represent around 50 of their daily expenses restaurants food vendors cooking gas shops taxi drivers and transport businesses will also feel the pinch from rising inflation because of higher costs he said it is difficult to pass these higher costs on to consumers during an economic downturn said mr pipat somprawin manprasert chief economist at bank of ayudhya predicted hyperinflation would not occur globally nor domestically despite rising inflation worldwide hyperinflation happens in a few countries because of their internal economic problems he said for the thai economy rising inflation is expected to be temporary said mr somprawin he suggested the government concentrate on promoting stimulus measures to revive the economy rather than focus on inflation curbs higher inflation will mainly affect low income earners improving the economy will lead to more economic activities which will support consumer income and address their higher living costs said mr somprawin still within target according to the minutes of the bank of thailand s monetary policy committee mpc meeting last month released on jan 5 the committee projected headline inflation would remain within its target forecast at 1 2 1 7 and 1 4 in 2021 2022 and 2023 respectively inflation would increase temporarily because of supply side factors particularly energy prices and global production and freight constraints which are expected to subside in the second half of 2022 according to the minutes a survey conducted in november 2021 found 55 of businesses would not raise prices within the next three months citing intense competition while purchasing power remained weak given elevated household debt and fragile labour market conditions headline inflation was expected to rise in line with a domestic demand recovery while inflation expectations remained anchored within the target said the mpc thailand s inflation remains subject to upside risks including higher global inflation and cost pass throughs said the minutes moderate rate the chance of hyperinflation in thailand is low as it is a food producing country that does not need to import agricultural products said kriengkrai thiennukul vice chairman of the federation of thai industries unlike the us which saw inflation surge by 6 8 late last year thailand s inflation tends to be lower than 2 because living costs notably most food prices are not high he said mr kriengkrai said the agricultural sector plays a key role in supplying a wide variety of food helping the country avoid importing expensive food items he acknowledged the local pork price skyrocketed to 240 baht a kilogramme but he believes the government can use a mix of appropriate measures to control its price pork prices were 210 230 baht per kg last tuesday up from about 150 baht per kg prompting prime minister prayut chan o cha to instruct authorities to quickly solve the issue in mr kriengkrai s view a key factor determining inflation is the rise in interest rates as a result of the us federal reserve s decision to reduce purchases of financial assets under its quantitative easing qe programme in response to rising inflation in the us this is an important factor causing fresh worries over higher inflation rates around the world he said the change in qe will affect capital markets around the world and may cause the bank of thailand to consider increasing its policy rate from 0 5 which will eventually increase costs of production said mr kriengkrai however the joint standing committee on commerce industry and banking jsccib expects inflation rates to range from 1 2 2 this year in fact a moderate increase in inflation may be good for the economy as very low inflation reflects sluggish economic activities said mr kriengkrai the inflation rate predicted by jsccib is suitable for economic conditions he said q3 rate hike thanavath phonvichai president of the university of the thai chamber of commerce agrees that hyperinflation prospects are unlikely in thailand although food prices have been rising and global supply lines and container shortages are stressing producers he predicted the world s supply shortage would improve soon as china starts resuming production after it relaxed tighter carbon emissions measures recently enforced by beijing mr thanavath forecast thailand s inflation rate at 1 5 2 in 2022 with inflationary pressure not yet severe although rates in certain months may reach 3 the global and thai economies have yet to fully recover if the economy continues to recover the bank of thailand may raise its policy rate by 25 basis points in the late third quarter or the fourth quarter he said the government needs to speed up issuing more measures to stimulate purchasing power and provide affordable products through state initiated blue flag low priced campaigns according to mr thanavath it remains a buyer s market in thailand as manufacturers have yet to raise prices too much because consumer purchasing power remains relatively weak in order to curb an excessive rise in prices the government can facilitate and support business operators obtaining more soft loans to increase their liquidity he said oil prices cool energy analysts also played down worries over hyperinflation caused by the global oil price surge as the price is believed to have already peaked fuels especially oil and gas used in the industrial and transport sectors are an essential factor determining operation costs and the prices of goods and services but the increase in energy prices will not escalate and plunge thailand into a period of extremely high inflation said chaiwat kovavisarach president and chief executive of bangchak corporation plc in the third quarter last year global oil prices soared rapidly after the easing of lockdown measures and the reopening of many countries in europe to jump start their economies these moves led to higher energy demand though oil producers did not largely increase their supply said mr chaiwat the bottleneck of oil supply looks set to calm down this year he said

author danny bradlow menafn the conversation the international monetary fund imf will inject 650 billion in special drawing rights into the global economy it will allocate them among its member states which can then decide for themselves how they want to use their special drawing rights this injection which will take place on 23 august 2021 is more than double the total number of special drawing rights the imf has ever issued and is equal to about 5 of total global reserves the imf will allocate the special drawing rights among its member states based on their quotas which are determined by the size of a country s economy and its role in the global economy therefore about 60 of these funds will go to rich countries that do not need them african countries will receive 33 6 billion with the lion s share going to the five largest economies on the continent south africa nigeria algeria morocco and egypt the imf and many countries recognise that this division of the new resource is both inequitable and inefficient they are talking of creating a mechanism for reallocating some of the funds an amount of 100 billion is mentioned to developing countries if done effectively the reallocation could help african countries deal with covid 19 climate change and their many other economic and social challenges it is also an opportunity for african countries to begin reforming their relationship with the imf but this will require them taking the initiative to ensure that the reallocation mechanism is fully responsive to african needs and is accountable to africans to understand what africa needs to do it s helpful to review the history of special drawing rights a short history in 1969 the imf member states authorised the organisation to issue special drawing rights at the time the leading member states were becoming concerned that countries might not be able to obtain enough dollars to meet their trade and financial needs which would adversely affect the global economy they thought special drawing rights could help overcome this shortage to encourage states to hold special drawing rights they decided that there would be no policy conditions attached to their use however in order to ensure that countries would not use special drawing rights imprudently they decreed that their use would carry an interest charge the membership also decided that the special drawing rights would be allocated to the members according to their quotas in the imf this meant that the majority would always go to the richest and most powerful imf member states which were unlikely to actually use them their use was also restricted to transactions with the imf other imf member states and any other organisations that the imf explicitly authorised to hold special drawing rights today there are 15 such organisations special drawing rights have not played a major role in global finance over the past 50 years one reason is that the imf had the financial resources and bargaining power to convince states to adopt policies that made it unnecessary to issue new special drawing rights this is now changing comparing the imf s role in the 1982 sovereign debt crisis and its role in the current covid pandemic helps illustrate the changes then and now in 1982 many latin american sovereign borrowers were in danger of defaulting on their debts this had serious implications for their largest creditors the big us banks this situation threatened the us banking system as well as the stability of the international financial system and the global economy both debtors and creditors turned to the imf for help it responded by providing financing to the debtor states on condition that they adopted tough policy reforms that their creditor banks provided new financing and that they renegotiated their debts for example the imf provided mexico with us 3 4 billion to meet its debt obligations in exchange for the country substantially cutting its budget deficit and implementing structural reforms and the commercial banks extending 1 5 billion in new funds and rescheduling 23 billion of mexico s total debt forty years later a very different scenario unfolded in the early days of the pandemic the fortunes of most countries were more influenced by the actions of the world s key central banks and by private investors than by the imf unlike in 1982 the imf no longer had the resources or bargaining power to drive the global response to a financial crisis in march 2020 investors panicked by the onset of the covid 19 pandemic withdrew from domestic and international financial markets thereby reducing the financing available to sovereigns corporations and households the major central banks responded swiftly by injecting over us 10 trillion in dollars and other convertible currencies into financial markets and taking actions to support other central banks these actions provided support to commercial banks and other financial institutions which in turn decided how to allocate the trillions among their many sovereign corporate and household clients the imf response was much weaker and slower from the advent of the pandemic until 30 june 2021 it has provided about 115 billion to 85 countries and 726 75 million in debt relief to 29 low income member countries opportunity to gain lost ground this month s issuance of special drawing rights is an opportunity for the imf to regain some of its lost influence in global economic governance it is working with its membership to create a mechanism through which rich countries can reallocate a substantial portion of their special drawing rights to help poorer countries so far these discussions have focused on an existing but controversial imf trust fund the poverty reduction and growth trust the imf has historically used the fund to provide concessional financing to low income countries in return for them adopting harsh policies including raising taxes and cutting social spending there is therefore also talk of creating a new mechanism the resilience and sustainability trust but this would take time and would depend on the outcome of complex and unpredictable negotiations among the imf member states time however is of the essence neither the imf nor developing countries can afford to wait too long for the reallocated special drawing rights to begin flowing and being used effectively to help those most in need this creates an opportunity for africa to work with the imf to ensure that the reallocation mechanism meets africa s needs as closely as possible what should africa do africa should call for reforms that will make the poverty reduction and growth trust more responsive to african needs and more accountable to africans in particular the imf should take the following three actions all can be implemented by the imf management and board on their own initiative create a third african chair on its board of executive directors currently sub saharan africa only has two seats on the 24 member board each representing over 20 african countries a third chair would help ensure that africa had a louder and more effective voice on matters relating to the use of the trust and other imf policy matters the imf should follow the example set by all other international financial institutions and draft and publish operational policies applicable to the use of all imf resources including special drawing rights this is becoming more necessary as the imf begins to add new important but complex topics such as climate inequality and gender based budgeting to its areas of interest and operation the imf should establish an independent ombudsman that can receive and investigate complaints from stakeholders who claim that the imf has not acted in full compliance with its own policies and procedures and that they have been harmed as a result

cis mr olatunde amolegbe said two years of positive returns show that the market is reflecting its function as the barometer for the economy we also expect the positive movement for the first half of 2022 on the back of good corporate performance implementation of some part of the petroleum industry act pia and intense focus on infrastructural development and resultant increased capital raising by government and corporate entities amolegbe said according to him the implementation of the pia has potential to raise government revenue which may elicit a positive response from the market while infrastructural development would likely boost market activity these however depend on stable macroeconomic policy increased security and stable polity amolegbe who doubles as managing director of arthur steven asset management limited said managing director apt securities and funds mallam kasimu garba kurfi also said the market would remain positive in the year although the second half would be determined by the politics of succession by the largest political parties we expect the bullish rally to continue in first and second quarters but the continuity to the third and fourth quarters depends on the outcome of the primary election of the apc and pdp if they are able to succeed in electing the right candidates for the presidency acceptability will lead to bullish rally throughout the year otherwise the market may suffer a reversal kurfi said group head research gti capital group mr emmanuel onoja said there was strong possibility of the market running through a third positive year it s most likely we see a third year of positive return given the potential liquidity buildup next year as a result of increased borrowing election spending and falling yields onoja said
on friday the centers for disease control and prevention held a telebriefing director rochelle walensky presided along with two career scientists the substance was notable updated covid 19 guidance for k 12 schools but even more notable was the fact that the briefing was happening at all it was the first such briefing in months despite the ongoing pandemic crisis that lack of regular communication has spurred criticism of the agency in recent days public health experts have called out cdc for confusing isolation and quarantine guidance and asked the agency to communicate more often and more clearly an unmet promise in fact the biden administration has repeatedly promised to put career scientists front and center in its covid communications but such experts have generally not appeared outside of white house covid 19 response team briefings usually held several times each week but typically only featuring political appointees walensky among them that s not the same as a briefing by subject matter experts sharing what they know with the press and the public the fact is there are dedicated scientists at cdc who are the world s experts in a lot of these issues and they need to be speaking directly to the public along with dr walensky says dr tom frieden cdc director during the obama administration who now runs resolve to save lives an initiative to help governments and outside groups prevent epidemics cdc is responding to these charges of inadequate communication the agency decided to hold friday s briefing walensky told reporters on the call because we had heard clearly over the last week that there was interest in hearing from us independently this is hard and i am committed to continue to improve she said i anticipate that this will be the first of many briefings and i very much look forward to them frieden is on board i hope this will be an inflection point in rebuilding confidence in cdc he says the more cdc can speak directly to the public following its own principles of communication in a health emergency the better off we ll all be for cdc covid 19 briefings have been unusually sparse the idea of speaking out during a public health crisis is hardly new cdc literally wrote the book on how to communicate in a health emergency says frieden it has clear principles to uphold he says be first be right be credible be empathetic and give people practical proven things to do to protect themselves their families and their communities glen nowak who used to run media relations for the agency says press briefings are an important part of its mission typically if there is some health development where it makes sense to notify the american public and give them recommendations and guidance as to what they should do about it then press briefings are really helpful he says when the h1n1 outbreak began in 2009 we did a press conference every single day for eight weeks including weekends nowak says we did press conferences as long as we had something that was new something that was different there was a need to do it the idea wasn t just to inform the public at media briefings says frieden oftentimes smart journalists ask tough questions and we d realize oh we didn t say that as clearly as we intended or we didn t think of that we d better address that issue when sars cov 2 was identified in china cdc seemed to follow that playbook in mid january 2020 dr nancy messonnier then director of cdc s national center for immunization and respiratory diseases led the first cdc telebriefing on the subject she was joined by another career scientist dr marty cetron director of cdc s division of global migration and quarantine since the outbreaks of mers and sars we have made improvements in our capacity in the united states and around the world messonnier told reporters we re now better poised to respond to this new threat quickly and collaboratively these briefings continued every few days until one of them jolted america to attention on feb 25 2020 messonnier warned this could be bad i had a conversation with my family over breakfast this morning and i told my children that while i didn t think that they were at risk right now we as a family need to be preparing for significant disruption of our lives she said after her comments financial markets crashed president donald trump whose message was that the pandemic was of little concern and under control was so angry at messonnier that he reportedly wanted her fired the next day he put vice president mike pence in charge of the white house coronavirus task force televised covid 19 briefings became a white house affair the cdc director was not usually present the cdc telebriefings did continue for a while although only occasionally under biden cdc still seems sidelined president biden came into office promising to beat the pandemic by restoring public trust scientists and public health experts will speak directly to you that s why you re going to be hearing a lot more from dr fauci again not from the president but from the real genuine experts and scientists biden pledged the day after his inauguration certainly americans have heard a lot from dr anthony fauci of nih the president s chief medical adviser and cdc s walensky both are frequent guests on tv news shows and in white house covid 19 response briefings which are usually held several times a week but under biden cdc and its career scientists seem to still be sidelined cdc has actually done fewer telebriefings on the pandemic under biden in 2020 under trump there were around two dozen cdc telebriefings in 2021 under biden there were two dr celine gounder an infectious disease specialist and epidemiologist at nyu who considers dr walensky a mentor says she has been hoping to hear more from cdc s career scientists in the new administration i would love to hear more from them just about what is the science that they re doing how do they go about it what is their process she says i think there is something to be said for also just putting a human face on some of this she adds which the public does not get when guidance changes happen via the cdc website she calls walensky s promise to bring back regular briefings good news politics and a pandemic aren t necessarily good bedfellows the administration seems to be treating the pandemic as a political problem that has to be managed in a political way says gregg gonsalves an epidemiologist at yale there needs to be a lot more openness and transparency from the white house and they need to let their scientists off the leash he says one overriding issue may be a clash between politics and public health political messages need to be simple but that doesn t work for infectious disease messaging says nowak the situation is much more dynamic viruses change a lot and can change in ways that render your recommendations not so effective he says with infectious disease communications you really have to acknowledge uncertainty yet over the 14 years he worked at cdc across democratic and republican administrations he says the trend seemed to be for the white house to exert more and more strict control over messaging you have to be willing to trust that the scientists and the experts who are doing those briefings are going to do what needs to be done he says and this administration is not unique not by any stretch of imagination in terms of their willingness to trust career scientists which is to say they don t seem to trust them very much he adds walensky s pledge to hold more briefings is a helpful development he says the question is going to be the frequency that they commit to holding regular press briefings what the topics are what the messages are cdc didn t respond to npr s question about how often the agency plans to hold agency led briefings frieden hopes that cdc will live up to its promise and speak directly to the public more often it s better for everyone he says it s better for cdc because they can explain themselves it s better for the administration because you re better off if you have a cdc that people trust and it s better for the public because you can understand the guidance copyright 2022 npr to see more visit

doing now the country would not be reduced into a vast lazar house an irish peasant family discovering the blight of their store during the great potato famine daniel macdonald public domain jamaica a governor that went against the status quo on his appointment as governor general of jamaica and the cayman islands in 1834 sligo s liberal and improving endeavors were transferred across the atlantic to take on the brutal system of slavery while the importation of slaves from africa was abolished in 1807 slavery the cornerstone of sugar production and profit in the british west indies continued missionaries conveyed the horrors of the slavery system to the british public and in 1833 the government finally passed an emancipation act the act however did not give immediate freedom to the slaves who merely became apprenticed to their masters for a further 4 years described as slavery under another name by abolitionists the controversial apprenticeship system which sligo was appointed to implement was misunderstood by the slaves and resisted both by the jamaican plantocracy and by powerful commercial vested interests in britain the 2 nd marquess of sligo went against the status quo when it came to slavery in jamaica pictured a depiction of slavery in what could be jamaica david livingstone public domain as owner of two plantations on the island which he inherited from his grandmother elizabeth kelly heiress of denis kelly from county galway former chief justice of jamaica the planters expected sligo to be on their side his objective however as he informed them on his arrival to establish a social system absolved forever from the reproach of slavery set them on a bitter collision course sligo found the savagery of slavery personally abhorrent from the flogging of field workers with cart whips branding with hot iron to whipping of female slaves the mantra a strip on the shoulder makes a furrow in the land governed every aspect of the slave s life the cruelties are past all idea sligo told the jamaican assembly i call on you to put an end to conduct so repugnant to humanity to counteract the worst excesses he maintained personal contact and control over the 60 special magistrates appointed to oversee the implementation of the new apprenticeship system in 900 plantations throughout the island much to the derision and indignation of their masters and unprecedented in the colonies sligo gave a patient hearing to the poorest negro which might carry his grievance to government house and advocated the building of schools for the black population that they might extract maximum benefit from their future freedom two of which he built at his own cost on his property he was the first plantation owner to initiate a wage system for black workers on his estates and later after emancipation to divide his lands into numerous farms to lease to the former slaves the white river in modern day st ann jamaica lbsimms photography adobe stock reform of the legal system and removal from office as he had done in ireland sligo set out to reform the jamaican legal system in truth he wrote there is no justice in the general local institutions of jamaica because there is no public opinion to which an appeal can be made slavery has divided society into two classes to the one it has given power but to the other it has not extended protection one of the classes is above opinion and the other is below it neither are therefore under its influence his efforts on behalf of the black population were bitterly opposed by the planter dominated assembly who accused him of interpreting the laws in favor of the negro and who as sligo noted set out to make jamaica too hot to hold me they withdrew his salary and commenced a campaign of vilification against him in the jamaican and british press which resulted in his eventual removal from office in september 1836 to the negro population in jamaica however sligo was their champion and protector in an unprecedented gesture they presented him with a magnificent silver candelabrum inscribed in grateful remembrance they entertain of his unremitting efforts to relieve their suffering and to redress their wrongs during his just and enlightened administration of the government of jamaica an honored emancipator of slaves on his return sligo became a determined and outspoken campaigner for full and immediate emancipation it is treason in jamaica to talk of a negro as a freeman the black and colored population are viewed by the white inhabitants as little more than semi human for the most part a kind of intermediate race possessing indeed the form of man but none of his finer attributes one of his anti slavery pamphlets jamaica under the apprenticeship system was debated in the british parliament and influenced the great debate on emancipation in february 1838 on 22 march 1838 being as he noted well aware that it would put an end to the system sligo publicly announced in the house of lords that regardless of the outcome of the british government s deliberations he would free all apprentices on his own estates in jamaica on 1 august 1838 i am confident that no person who is acquainted with the state of the west indian colonies and at the same time uninfected with colonial prejudices will deny that the time is now come when it is important to effect a final arrangement of this question his public pronouncement left the british government with no alternative but to implement full emancipation for all on the same date lord sligo earned an honored place in the history of

on friday the centers for disease control and prevention held a telebriefing director rochelle walensky presided along with two career scientists the substance was notable updated covid 19 guidance for k 12 schools but even more notable was the fact that the briefing was happening at all it was the first such briefing in months despite the ongoing pandemic crisis that lack of regular communication has spurred criticism of the agency in recent days public health experts have called out cdc for confusing isolation and quarantine guidance and asked the agency to communicate more often and more clearly an unmet promise in fact the biden administration has repeatedly promised to put career scientists front and center in its covid communications but such experts have generally not appeared outside of white house covid 19 response team briefings usually held several times each week but typically only featuring political appointees walensky among them that s not the same as a briefing by subject matter experts sharing what they know with the press and the public the fact is there are dedicated scientists at cdc who are the world s experts in a lot of these issues and they need to be speaking directly to the public along with dr walensky says dr tom frieden cdc director during the obama administration who now runs resolve to save lives an initiative to help governments and outside groups prevent epidemics cdc is responding to these charges of inadequate communication the agency decided to hold friday s briefing walensky told reporters on the call because we had heard clearly over the last week that there was interest in hearing from us independently this is hard and i am committed to continue to improve she said i anticipate that this will be the first of many briefings and i very much look forward to them frieden is on board i hope this will be an inflection point in rebuilding confidence in cdc he says the more cdc can speak directly to the public following its own principles of communication in a health emergency the better off we ll all be for cdc covid 19 briefings have been unusually sparse the idea of speaking out during a public health crisis is hardly new cdc literally wrote the book on how to communicate in a health emergency says frieden it has clear principles to uphold he says be first be right be credible be empathetic and give people practical proven things to do to protect themselves their families and their communities glen nowak who used to run media relations for the agency says press briefings are an important part of its mission typically if there is some health development where it makes sense to notify the american public and give them recommendations and guidance as to what they should do about it then press briefings are really helpful he says when the h1n1 outbreak began in 2009 we did a press conference every single day for eight weeks including weekends nowak says we did press conferences as long as we had something that was new something that was different there was a need to do it the idea wasn t just to inform the public at media briefings says frieden oftentimes smart journalists ask tough questions and we d realize oh we didn t say that as clearly as we intended or we didn t think of that we d better address that issue when sars cov 2 was identified in china cdc seemed to follow that playbook in mid january 2020 dr nancy messonnier then director of cdc s national center for immunization and respiratory diseases led the first cdc telebriefing on the subject she was joined by another career scientist dr marty cetron director of cdc s division of global migration and quarantine since the outbreaks of mers and sars we have made improvements in our capacity in the united states and around the world messonnier told reporters we re now better poised to respond to this new threat quickly and collaboratively these briefings continued every few days until one of them jolted america to attention on feb 25 2020 messonnier warned this could be bad i had a conversation with my family over breakfast this morning and i told my children that while i didn t think that they were at risk right now we as a family need to be preparing for significant disruption of our lives she said after her comments financial markets crashed president donald trump whose message was that the pandemic was of little concern and under control was so angry at messonnier that he reportedly wanted her fired the next day he put vice president mike pence in charge of the white house coronavirus task force televised covid 19 briefings became a white house affair the cdc director was not usually present the cdc telebriefings did continue for a while although only occasionally under biden cdc still seems sidelined president biden came into office promising to beat the pandemic by restoring public trust scientists and public health experts will speak directly to you that s why you re going to be hearing a lot more from dr fauci again not from the president but from the real genuine experts and scientists biden pledged the day after his inauguration certainly americans have heard a lot from dr anthony fauci of nih the president s chief medical adviser and cdc s walensky both are frequent guests on tv news shows and in white house covid 19 response briefings which are usually held several times a week but under biden cdc and its career scientists seem to still be sidelined cdc has actually done fewer telebriefings on the pandemic under biden in 2020 under trump there were around two dozen cdc telebriefings in 2021 under biden there were two dr celine gounder an infectious disease specialist and epidemiologist at nyu who considers dr walensky a mentor says she has been hoping to hear more from cdc s career scientists in the new administration i would love to hear more from them just about what is the science that they re doing how do they go about it what is their process she says i think there is something to be said for also just putting a human face on some of this she adds which the public does not get when guidance changes happen via the cdc website she calls walensky s promise to bring back regular briefings good news politics and a pandemic aren t necessarily good bedfellows the administration seems to be treating the pandemic as a political problem that has to be managed in a political way says gregg gonsalves an epidemiologist at yale there needs to be a lot more openness and transparency from the white house and they need to let their scientists off the leash he says one overriding issue may be a clash between politics and public health political messages need to be simple but that doesn t work for infectious disease messaging says nowak the situation is much more dynamic viruses change a lot and can change in ways that render your recommendations not so effective he says with infectious disease communications you really have to acknowledge uncertainty yet over the 14 years he worked at cdc across democratic and republican administrations he says the trend seemed to be for the white house to exert more and more strict control over messaging you have to be willing to trust that the scientists and the experts who are doing those briefings are going to do what needs to be done he says and this administration is not unique not by any stretch of imagination in terms of their willingness to trust career scientists which is to say they don t seem to trust them very much he adds walensky s pledge to hold more briefings is a helpful development he says the question is going to be the frequency that they commit to holding regular press briefings what the topics are what the messages are cdc didn t respond to npr s question about how often the agency plans to hold agency led briefings frieden hopes that cdc will live up to its promise and speak directly to the public more often it s better for everyone he says it s better for cdc because they can explain themselves it s better for the administration because you re better off if you have a cdc that people trust and it s better for the public because you can understand the guidance copyright 2022 npr to see more visit
example video title will go here for this video example video title will go here for this video the city of toledo has already made plans to replace lead service lines on homeowner s property using covid 19 relief money ohio usa editor s note the above video is from october 2021 in 2022 ohio and michigan will get nearly half a billion dollars combined to help shore up and improve the states water infrastructure the money comes from the infrastructure investment and jobs act recently signed into law by president biden the funding is primarily earmarked to help improve water quality in communities through projects and programs that reduce and eliminate lead and chemicals from drinking water nearly 242 million is being set aside for ohio communities and 213 million will go to michigan the money is part of over 50 billion set aside by the bill for water infrastructure projects nationwide at this time it s unclear how much will be allocated to individual communities in october toledo mayor wade kapszukiewicz laid out a plan to spend 10 million of the 181 million allocated to the city by the federal covid 19 relief funding to replace about 3 000 private lead service lines in the city council signed off on the mayor s plan in late december wtol 11 reached out to the mayor s office about how the new federal dollars might play into their existing plans to remove lead water lines this was their response we believe the price tag to eliminate lead in our water system is much larger than the dollars allocated in the build back better plan we will take full advantage of what is available through that funding but we believe utilizing the toledo recovery plan dollars to eliminate lead lines on homeowners private property at no cost to property owners is still the best option the build back better plan could assist in accelerating the elimination of lead in the public lines which could potentially reduce the amount needed for the lead program in the toledo recovery plan however the majority of that budget is allocated to private lines

article 3 months old international jan 10 2022 part 1 of a deep dive in today s consequences from a decade and more of exceptionally low interest rates by ahead of the herd s rick mills richard rick mills ahead of the herd as a general rule the most successful man in life is the man who has the best information the us federal reserve is severely constrained in how much it can raise interest rates to quell rising inflation due to ballooning debt the united states is much more highly indebted than it was in 2010 following the great recession which restricts its borrowing capacity the federal government is facing a 3 trillion deficit this year the second in a row and the interest it must pay on the debt amounts to nearly half a trillion dollars according to usdebtclock org the current national debt sits at 28 6 trillion and it is increasing with each tick of the clock source usdebtclock org there are three kinds of debt government corporate and household sixteen months into the covid 19 battle and no end in sight as countries are being hit with the highly contagious delta variant and forced to re instate restrictions the world has never been more in the red the institute of international finance found that governments companies and households raised 24 trillion last year to offset the pandemic s economic toll bringing total global debt to an all time high at the end of 2020 of 281 trillion government debt even with vaccine rollouts low interest rates worldwide are keeping debt above pre pandemic levels the federal reserve continues to purchase 120 billion per month in government bonds and mortgage backed securities as part of its quantitative easing policy the bank of canada s qe program was scaled back in july but is still being maintained at 2 billion per week despite over 80 of the country fully vaccinated against the coronavirus the iif estimated in february that governments with large budget deficits are expected to add another 10 trillion in 2021 pushing their global debt accumulation past 92 trillion by 2021 s end last year south africa and india had the biggest increases in government debt ratios with china seeing the biggest jump in emerging markets followed by turkey korea and the united arab emirates among mature economies france and spain had the sharpest increases in non financial industry debt to gdp ratios iif data showed another set of figures via the world economic forum wef found that falling revenues combined with costly pandemic relief measures increased global debt by 20 trillion between the third quarter of 2019 and the end of 2020 excluding the financial sector canada s debt to gdp ratio climbed by nearly 80 last year the highest of any developed country not only did the country s gdp plunge 38 in the second quarter the worst three month performance on record government borrowing surged with the canada emergency response benefit cerb ringing up a bill of 60 billion over seven months according to the wef in a december 2020 report rbc wealth management contributed more illuminating statistics that paint a grim picture of a growing global debt burden powered by pandemic related borrowing the canadian bank quoted the imf in stating that the public debt of advanced economies has climbed nearly 27 since january 2020 and now sits beyond the greater than 120 of gdp reached after world war ii the united states and japan are the two most indebted economies accounting for half of total global government debt see the pie chart below global debt is a tamer 102 of gdp because many of the largest emerging economies have lower debt burdens however it s still a record noted rbc the bank says these official figures underestimate the situation giving the example of the united states where public debt does not include obligations such as future social security and medicare promises when that 129 trillion worth of bills is added the truth about ud debt is that it s closer to 133 trillion source truth in accounting debt is a major limitation on a growing economy according to the world bank if the debt to gdp ratio exceeds 77 for an extended period of time every percentage point of debt above this level costs a country 0 017 percentage points in economic growth the current us debt to gdp ratio is 125 6 so that is 48 6 basis points multiplied by 0 017 0 82 nearly a full percentage point of economic growth however at the moment the us government and other governments are less concerned about high debt levels squelching growth because their debt servicing costs are small due to ultra low interest rates s p market intelligence notes that despite us public debt more than doubling between 2010 and 2020 interest costs only grew 26 from 414b to 523b with net interest just 1 6 in 2020 compared to 3 in 1985 the cost of the national debt is half what it was 10 years ago but it s still roughly 400 billion almost half of the 1 trillion deficit the us government typically runs according to the rbc report federal debt costs actually declined this year despite outstanding debt surging higher because there are existing government bond issues carrying higher coupons that are being re financed at today s near 0 interest rates according to congressional budget office estimates these debt costs are set to move even lower through 2023 and remain so for much of this decade this in our opinion is a significant disincentive for the government to curtail out of control spending however beyond this decade for the 2030s as public debt loads swell rbc global asset management estimates that u s debt servicing as a share of gdp will rise to something greater than the average of the last several decades limiting the government s ability to cut taxes or spend on desirable government programs the united states is the obvious poster child of excessive debt accumulation struggling to contain the economic fallout from the pandemic the federal reserve and other central banks understand that keeping interest rates low and maintaining monthly asset purchases ie quantitative easing have not given the desired economic boost now they are counting on fiscal policy ie government spending and taxes to do the trick however the us government does not have the money so they borrow print it at current rock bottom interest rates thus we have monetary easing happening at the same time as fiscal spending carte blanche remember biden believes strongly in the power of the state to tax and spend a long wish list has been and is waiting to be filled with little to no concern regarding the already out of control 28 trillion national debt courtesy of modern monetary theory or mmt the result of these two forces acting together is bound to create inflation which climbed to 5 4 in june it also explains why inflation is running much hotter than during the financial crisis when the monetary stimulus stayed within the banks it did not get out into the greater economy this time government stimulus checks went directly to consumers who squirreled away savings during the pandemic and are back spending en masse driving up demand beyond available supply in a number of industries especially food groceries meanwhile the fed actually the treasury keeps printing away adding numbers on a computer screen to the tune of 120b per month remember too during the great recession the us government bailed out the banks but it otherwise restricted spending relying on the fed s qe to stimulate the economy now we have the opposite occurring with the fed growing a fiscal conscience and stating it wants to reduce its 120b per month asset purchases while the federal government spends like a drunken sailor on a saturday night shore leave in prince rupert alongside trillions in covid 19 relief already spent the next round of spending involves us president joe biden s 1 trillion infrastructure bill just passed by the senate but not yet approved by the house and a 3 5 trillion anti poverty and climate plan senate democrats hope to get passed this fall the current national debt of 28 6 trillion and the current debt to gdp ratio of 125 6 doesn t include the 1 trillion infrastructure bill heading to the house nor the 3 5t anti poverty and climate plan we also have to add the federal budget numbers president biden s budget for full year fy 2022 totals 6 011 trillion more than any other previous budget the us government estimates that for fy 2022 revenues will again fall short of expenditures leaving a 1 8 trillion deficit better than the projected 3 trillion deficit for 2021 almost the same as last year s 3t but it still means nearly 2 trillion will be added to the national debt cnbc notes the budgetary shortfall this year is equivalent to 13 4 of gdp the second largest level since 1945 and exceeded only by 2020 spending adding it all up you get 28 4t national debt 1 trillion infrastructure bill 3 5t anti poverty and climate plan 6t fy 2022 budget spending 3t 2021 deficit 1 8t 2022 deficit 43 9t so there you have it by 2022 the national debt presuming all of the spending commitments use borrowed or printed money will be approaching 44 trillion despite this exorbitant unsustainable and frankly terrifying debt pile there is a disturbing lack of political will to address the situation rbc in its report states that within advanced democracies we think it will be difficult for elected and appointed officials as well as voters to resist the temptation of further debt accumulation the path of least resistance seems to be pointing toward increasing fiscal spending not restraint policymakers lack the incentive to address the issue given borrowing costs in the market have remained low despite debt levels spiking in all likelihood debt loads will be forced ever higher as further stimulus measures for the covid 19 crisis are implemented and other crises inevitably hit the u s may find it easy to turn a blind eye to its growing debt because the u s dollar s status as the world s reserve currency means there is underlying demand from institutional investors and governments globally for the debt america issues given this ease to finance itself and to print money the u s may be even less inclined to reduce debt levels or meaningfully lower its rate of debt accumulation persistent debt accumulation will likely be one more factor that will keep central banks suppressing interest rates over the medium and longer term further burdening savers and fixed income investors according to rbc global asset management interest rates will need to be permanently lower than before given that public debt loads will likely permanently remain higher and given there is no obvious relatively painless way to pay those debts down interest rates should rise over time but they will probably be lower than would otherwise have been the case despite low interest rates the debt levels may well cap economic growth japan is a case in point the country has accumulated high levels of debt over the years reaching 238 percent of gdp in 2018 according to japan s ministry of finance it has hovered above 200 percent for 10 years there seems to be greater acceptance of high debt loads in the financial community and among government officials in the wake of the pandemic crisis from a pure balance sheet perspective we believe higher debt loads are manageable in the near and intermediate term however at a minimum high debt levels while sustainable for the time being in most advanced economies will eventually restrict governments budgetary flexibility and are likely to result in higher tax rates in our view high debt loads will likely also be a powerful incentive for policymakers to further suppress interest rates this is a key reason we recommend that investors consider strategies for a low interest rate environment that may linger for much longer than one might think is reasonable corporate debt the idea behind quantitative easing is to get businesses and individuals to take out loans corporations have been taking full advantage of loose monetary policies particularly low interest rates according to the iif global debt in the financial sector hit 86 of gdp in 2020 the largest increase since 2007 and the first annual rise since 2016 the debt of non financial corporations has also grown significantly nearly doubling from 46 6 trillion in the second quarter of 2009 to 81t in the third quarter of 2020 says statista chinese corporations had the most debt in 2019 at 21 2t exceeding us corporate debt of 16t the same year in the third quarter of 2020 the coronavirus pandemic pushed the debt of nonfinancial corporations worldwide to 101 of global gdp total debt of non financial corporations in major developed and emerging economies 2006 19 source statista statista shows us based telecom firm at t carrying the largest long term debt in 2020 at more than 147 billion followed by ford motor company whose debt exceeded 114b in the united states companies in need of cash issue bonds in the corporate bond market buyers of these bonds are essentially lending companies money and picking up a coupon interest as long as they continue to hold that company s debt according to the federal reserve and the securities industry and financial markets association sifa us companies now face the highest debt levels on record at more than 10 5 trillion in 40 years the amount of corporate bonds outstanding has grown by over 2 000 from 16 of us gdp in 1980 to 50 of gdp in 2020 forbes notes the level of corporate debt is actually much higher because the above mentioned figures only include fixed income debt not loans and lines of credit these debt levels were massive even before the coronavirus about 9 trillion with rock bottom interest rates left over from the financial crisis making it very easy for corporations to borrow money according to accounting firm deloitte the corporate debt surge in 2020 was likely due to at least one of three factors 1 some businesses were forced to borrow to keep operations running as large swaths of the economy shut down 2 some had to invest in technology to support remote work and 3 not all businesses were worse off due to covid 19 consequently some of them needed to borrow to grow their enterprises whatever the reason for rising leverage deloitte found that non financial business debt at the end of 2020 was 82 of gdp higher than the pre pandemic third quarter 2019 ratio of 75 there has been talk of a corporate bond bubble triggering the next financial crisis after the fed took extraordinary measures at the beginning of the pandemic to buy corporate bonds part of a 250 billion program funded by the cares act questions emerged about why the fed was purchasing the bonds of companies that really didn t need their help including such economic stalwarts as microsoft visa and home depot moreover several of them had junk bond as opposed to investment grade status such as heinz ford and macy s the corporate bond market is hanging on right now by a very precarious string how long can we continue to live on red ink asks a march 12 cnbc video on the subject most of the 10 6t in us corporate debt is made up of bonds the other part is loans which as mentioned are divided into investment grade and high yield junk bonds independent ratings agencies decide on the classification based on a company s ability to make their debt payments to bondholders the danger is if the bond market crashes which could happen if enough companies are unable to pay their debts ie redeem bonds upon maturity plus interest the bond market is several times larger than the stock market amplifying the risk of a crash when the bond market blows a gasket the damage is much worse for the economy states the cnbc video right now the corporate bond picture looks good because interest rates are so low again it s very easy for companies to issue bonds and to get investors to purchase them they much prefer to do this rather than dip into their own cash piles or issue stock which dilutes the share float but problems occur when companies get reckless with their debt resulting in a status downgrade currently there are a number of companies teetering on the edge of investment grade status when they are downgraded to junk bond status a lot of bond investors sell these fallen angels in 2020 50 companies worth 200 billion in debt were downgraded including macy s ford and occidental compared to 40 50b in a normal year companies unable to find enough investors to buy their corporate bonds may go bankrupt equally bad if a company is unable to pay back the principal plus interest on bonds when they reach maturity the firm could default on its loans the number of bankruptcies during all of last year and the first quarter of 2021 were above average according to forbes in march 2021 there were 61 corporate bankruptcies double the amount in february with consumer discretionary companies and industrials comprising the largest number of business failures as the cbnc video notes defaults last year would have been higher if not for the fed buying corporate debt for the first time the amount of bonds that the fed actually purchased was very small versus what they could just the fed announcing it setting it up doing a little bit was more validating to the market than the actual need desire to buy everything the huge amount of corporate debt is benign for now but what happens if the fed hikes interest rates to deal with rising inflation this is a very real possibility if inflation stays above the fed s 2 target for much longer even a 100 150 basis point interest rate could spell doom for a company that s living on the edge says the cbnc video referring to so called zombie companies that are drowning in debt to the point where they could default on their loans these companies are only making interest payments they re not investing in their businesses or employees meaning they ultimately are dragging down national economic growth yet poorly managed companies are still qualifying for loans and issuing debt an analysis earlier this year by s p global market intelligence found that a record high 67 4 billion was issued in the first quarter from borrowers with a b corporate rating on at least one side that represents 40 of total issuance during the quarter note that for any full year the share of comparable b issuance has never been above 36 if ability to repay debt is the main concern the above mentioned deloitte report makes some interesting observations first analysis of the data by cohorts reveals that the top 50 companies by market value are leading the debt surge with only 5 of 1 000 companies accounting for 30 7 of the group s total long term debt second ability to repay debt has deteriorated for all companies except the largest ones for example during the pandemic the ratio of net debt to earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization ebitda fell by 18 2 for the 501 1 000 and by 16 7 for the 101 500 cohort the top 10 cohort was better placed than others in its net debt to ebitda ratio third the pandemic affected most companies ability to pay interest on their debt again with the exception of the top 10 cohort the interest coverage ratio a ratio of earnings before interest and taxes ebit fell for all cohorts except the top 10 in 2020 with ebit dropping by 40 3 for the 501 1 000 cohort and by 28 5 for the 101 500 one deloitte s analysis suggests there is inequality with respect to corporate debt and companies ability to pay it off only 5 of 1 000 companies account for 30 7 of this group s debt and these companies are least likely to default on their debts or fail to pay the interest on their debts this means 95 of the other 1 000 companies in deloitte s study group hold 70 of the rest of the debt with the pandemic impacting most s ability to repay how many of these 950 companies are zombies on the edge of bankruptcy or are close to being downgraded to junk bond status the 10 6 trillion in corporate debt is certainly something we as investors need to be aware of and keep tracking so as to stay ahead of a potential meltdown if many companies begin defaulting on their loans household debt in the united states consumer spending makes up nearly 70 of gdp meaning the ability of households to spend and to handle debt burdens is of utmost importance globally the figure is similar household debt is defined by stats canada as mortgage debt on all residences and real estate and consumer debt including debt outstanding on credit cards personal and home equity lines of credit secured and unsecured loans from banks and other institutions and unpaid bills in its recent report rbc notes that in some countries household debt is of greater concern than government debt in other countries the reverse is true for example in the decade following the financial crisis canada s household debt rose from 93 of gdp to 106 compared to federal debt falling from 47 to 40 whereas in the us government debt has surpassed household debt and continues to swell in the oecd bar graph below countries are ranked according to their total household debt as a percentage of net income denmark leads the pack with household debt greater than 250 of income followed by five other european countries then korea canada is ninth at 175 with the us 19th at 105 household debt as a percentage of net income source oecd getting more granular cnbc reports that us consumer debt rose to nearly 14 6 trillion at the end of 2020 driven by a record breaking increase in mortgages which in february totaled over 10 trillion as home buyers took advantage of low mortgage rates mortgage debt in q4 2020 increased 1 4 or 206 billion making it the fastest fourth quarter rise since 2006 student loan debt last year increased marginally to 1 37 trillion as a result of low interest rates and student loan forgiveness this week the biden administration announced it will cancel another 5 8b of student loan debt by the end of this year while credit card debt fell by 108b to 820b many americans holed up at home either unemployed or working remotely elected to save money during the pandemic or pay down loans with help from direct stimulus checks the serious delinquency rate or 90 days past due for all debt fell from 2 36 to 1 25 during the fourth quarter 2020 however it appears that americans parsimony was shortlived a more recent cnbc story states that household debt jumped the most in 14 years in the second quarter of 2021 though mostly driven by the housing market credit card debt is reportedly back on the rise despite significant paying down card balances the average balance is above 5 000 and there are signs that fiscal prudence may be waning including the fact that government stimulus checks are slowing and that consumers are in the mood for spending with around 2 trillion in forced savings ready to be unleashed a creditcards com survey quoted by cnbc found 44 of people saying they are willing to take on debt in the second half of 2021 for non essential purchases such as dining out a may report from the federal reserve found that credit card balances rose 11 from april to may the largest increase in five years on aug 4 the fed reported the highest second quarter jump in household debt in 14 years to nearly 15 trillion conclusion as stated at the top the fed is severely constrained in how much it can raise interest rates to quell rising inflation due to ballooning debt following 4 5 trillion already spent on pandemic relief and trillions more to come through biden administration spending along with the continuation of quantitative easing what i like to call quantifornication to the tune of 120 billion in asset purchases per month the fed has in one year doubled its balance sheet to around 8 2 trillion and the national debt currently sits at 28 6 trillion total assets of the us federal reserve source federal reserve us national debt over the past year interest paid by the federal government this year on its debt is estimated at just under 400 billion by our calculations the national debt could reach 34 trillion this year and that is excluding the nearly 5 trillion in federal budget deficits expected in 2021 22 by 2031 the congressional budget office predicts as deficits grow and interest rates eventually rise the debt to gdp ratio could reach 202 from its current 125 at that rate for every dollar the us economy produces 2 is borrowed as we have shown the massive debt overhang is not only an american problem governments companies and households raised 24 trillion last year to offset the pandemic s economic toll bringing total global debt to an all time high at the end of 2020 of 281 trillion countries with large budget deficits are expected to add another 10 trillion in 2021 pushing their global debt accumulation past 92 trillion by year s end as central banks around the world hold interest rates near 0 to ensure that their economies keep growing companies have taken on fresh loans and issued tens of trillions in bonds global debt in the financial sector hit 86 of gdp in 2020 the largest increase since 2007 the debt of non financial corporations has nearly doubled from 46 6 trillion in the second quarter of 2009 to 81t in the third quarter of 2020 the ability to repay debt has deteriorated for all companies except the largest ones creating a kind of corporate debt inequality whereby many businesses risk being dumped from investment grade to junk bond status if interest rates are raised by even 100 basis points we could be in for a slew of debt defaults and bankruptcies in 2020 50 companies worth 200 billion in debt were downgraded five times the dollar amount in a normal year we talk about government debt corporate debt and household debt as though they were separate but in reality households ie your average joe and jane are ultimately the ones paying the piper when all three levels of debt increase and especially when interest rates go up consider interest paid on the 28 trillion national debt is currently 400 billion and that s 0 15 if rates go up say to 0 6 the interest on the debt jumps to 1 4 trillion raise it to 1 2 and the federal government will be paying 2 8 trillion in interest nearly the amount of the current budget deficit just for the interest who pays this ultimately it s the american consumer government revenues don t bring in enough to cover it so they only have two ways of raising the money raise taxes or issue more debt raising taxes is political suicide unless you re a democrat and support taxing high wealth individuals and corporations this though won t help the little guy because most companies will either find ways to avoid higher taxes or they will pass it onto their customers if the other route debt issuance is chosen the us government is asking bond holders in country and overseas not only to pay the interest on its existing debt but the interest on the new debt being issued to entice them into accepting what is looking to be more and more of a risky investment the fed must raise interest rates this affects corporations who have issued and are obliged to pay back with interest trillions worth of corporate bonds as well as individuals holding mortgages car loans student loans etc us companies now face the highest debt levels on record at more than 10 5 trillion attracted by low interest rates these bonds seemed like a risk free way for companies to borrow with higher interest rates they will quickly become an albatross around their necks mortgage holders will be faced with a sudden increase in monthly payments the overleveraged will default or be forced to sell potentially triggering another housing crisis consumers are already feeling the pinch of 5 4 inflation but now they must contend with even higher prices this is because the companies who have floated all these corporate bonds are now forced to raise the prices of their goods and services so they can continue paying their bondholders and avoid debt default and or bankruptcy the higher rates could also mean layoffs to preserve profit margins remember too there are still hundreds of billions worth of tariffs levied on imports by the previous trump administration these are effectively a tax on the american consumer since most companies simply pass the cost of the tariff onto their customers the bottom line the fed simply cannot raise interest rates without killing the american consumer whose spending is relied upon for economic growth comprising two thirds of gdp but if inflation keeps rising as it has been sooner or later they will have to lest the united states becomes the united states of zimbabwe qe s success in holding down yields has eliminated the us federal reserve s maneuvering room the fed must continue quantitative easing to monetize the issuing of treasuries which are needed to fund deficits he fed cannot increase interest rates as long as the politicians keep creating billions of new debts affirms ron paul in an opinion piece about the 50th anniversary of president nixon taking the united states off the gold standard with respect mr paul the federal government is creating

stocks to buy and hold according to bill gates in its q2 2021 investor letter oakmark funds praised grupo televisa sab nyse tv for the attractive valuation it received as part of the 4 8 billion sales of its content business the fund believes that the combined assets will be a huge force in the spanish language streaming market and that they should prove more profitable than they were as separate entities oakmark funds an investment management firm published its oakmark international fund second quarter 2021 investor letter and mentioned grupo televisa sab nyse tv here is what the fund said grupo televisa a media company headquartered in mexico and the world s largest producer of spanish language content was a top contributor for the second quarter grupo televisa s share price jumped when the company revealed that it would merge its content and media assets with univision in a call with shareholders ceo of televisa alfonso de angoitia and ceo of univision wade davis provided details on the 4 8 billion agreement which combines these leading media businesses in the two largest spanish speaking markets in the world overall we think the deal makes strategic sense as streaming is the future in television and the new company will very likely become the dominant spanish language streaming service there will also be synergies from combining the two businesses which should improve profitability versus when they were stand alone businesses in addition over the long term we believe consolidation in the media sector will continue providing an opportunity for the new entity to partner with a larger company aside from the strategic merits we believe televisa received an attractive valuation for its content business as the 4 8b value was higher than our internal estimates we commend management for this transaction 9 advanced drainage systems inc nyse wms advanced drainage systems inc nyse wms has been in mig capital s 13f portfolio since the first quarter of 2019 as of september 30 the fund owns 452 602 wms shares valued at 48 96 million on september 30 making it the fund s 12th largest long position the fund picked the perfect time to first buy into the stock which

highlighted advanced drainage systems inc nyse wms here is what the fund said advanced drainage systems is a leader 60 70 market share in plastic pipe drainage systems for non residential residential agriculture and public infrastructure projects the company s products are used in the full storm water drainage system capturing transporting treating and redistributing water into the water table further plastic pipe systems are easier to install have a longer useful life and require fewer deliveries to the project sites than traditional concrete pipe systems our research suggests a relatively new management team is taking the appropriate steps to enter new markets and expand its product service offerings by providing higher performance pipes and a more comprehensive suite of products for its infrastructure residential and distribution center amazon walmart etc projects furthermore we expect a cyclical acceleration will magnify this company s execution over the past three years and several operational initiatives sourcing lower cost materials optimizing machine utilization automation should improve margins over time mig capital s ownership of t mobile us inc nasdaq tmus shares

has benefited greatly from merger synergies in recent years allowing it to expand its margins and free cash flow on top of an already solid history of growth for t mobile us inc nasdaq tmus clearbridge investments an investment management firm published its large cap value strategy first quarter 2021 investor letter and mentioned t mobile us inc nasdaq tmus here is what the fund said the portfolio s quality bias and valuation discipline have generated compelling returns over time with typically strong relative results in more challenging environments as it did through the first three quarters of 2020 however that same quality bias tends to create a more challenging relative performance environment for the strategy during periods of sharp economic acceleration which tend to benefit stocks that are more commodity linked or of lower quality this has been the case during the vaccine and stimulus driven rally experienced late last year and during the most recent quarter sectors that lagged in the quarter included communication services where t mobile trailed after generating robust returns earlier in the recovery 7 mastercard incorporated nyse ma next up is mastercard

according to a theory that is gaining support among academics and practitioners we should expect index fund managers to undertake the role of climate stewards and push companies into reducing their carbon footprint in a new paper roberto tallarita shows the limits of this theory and suggests that policymakers should not rely on index fund stewardship as a substitute for traditional climate regulation index funds own a large fraction of the us stock market according to some estimates the so called big three blackrock vanguard and state street the largest index fund managers in the world are together the largest shareholders in 40 percent of the publicly listed companies in the united states and in 88 percent of the companies in the s p 500 by 2039 they are projected to vote 41 percent of the shares in s p 500 companies many experts are worried about such a massive concentration of ownership and voting power others by contrast believe that index fund managers will use their growing influence to persuade companies to reduce their carbon emissions and therefore mitigate the risk of climate change for society this optimistic prediction is based on a simple and suggestive theory which i will call portfolio primacy theory climate change is a quintessential negative externality individual companies have no incentives to reduce their carbon emissions because they would bear the entire cost of the reduction while most of the benefits would be reaped by someone else index funds by contrast hold the entire economy and therefore the argument goes internalize the costs and benefits of carbon emissions and carbon mitigation by maximizing the value of their entire portfolio portfolio primacy rather than the value of each individual company shareholder primacy index funds should be expected to pressure their portfolio companies to mitigate their impact on climate change even if such mitigation comes at the expense of some individual companies but to what extent can we trust index fund managers to become effective climate stewards and mitigate climate risk for society in my new paper the limits of portfolio primacy i argue that the optimism surrounding this view is grossly overstated stock prices do not necessarily reflect climate risk to begin with it is far from clear whether stock prices accurately reflect climate risk the emerging literature on climate finance has found mixed evidence on this issue furthermore many investment managers believe that stock prices underestimate climate risk if stock prices do not fully incorporate climate risk they will not fully reward investors for climate mitigation why would an index fund sacrifice profits in one company if the corresponding benefits for other portfolio companies are not reflected in their stock price underpricing of climate risk means underinvestment in climate mitigation index funds give very low weight to the distant future moreover index funds assign a very low weight to the benefits of climate mitigation that are expected to occur in the distant future while most experts believe that society should discount intergenerational climate damage at a rate between 1 percent and 3 percent stock investors like index funds typically use a discount rate of 7 percent or higher such a high discount rate results in massive underinvestment in climate mitigation to illustrate the figure below shows the maximum amount that an index fund that owns 1 percent of the economy would be willing to pay in 2021 in order to produce 1 trillion climate benefits in 2150 if the fund used the 1 1 percent discount rate proposed by the stern review a seminal work on the economic effects of climate change published in 2007 it would be willing to pay up to 2 5 billion if it used a consensus social discount rate between 2 percent and 3 percent it would be willing to pay a sum between 221 million and 777 million but index funds discount future cash flows at 7 percent or even more therefore in this hypothesis the fund would not pay more than 1 6 million for the proposed mitigation measure a very small sum the simulation assumes that the index fund owns 1 percent of the economy and therefore captures 1 percent of all the positive externalities of the mitigation measure the vertical axis reports figures in millions of dollars index fund portfolios are biased let s suppose for a moment that a given carbon mitigation measure will produce a large stock market gain even with a 7 percent discount rate for example let s suppose that the measure would reduce the stock value of oil companies by 1 trillion but will increase the stock value of all other public companies by 1 3 trillion a net gain of 300 billion what would the index funds that invest in exxonmobil do would they push exxonmobil to adopt such a measure surprisingly the answer is not as straightforward as many would think index funds are not real universal owners they invest only in subsets of the market and the specific composition of their portfolios inevitably affects their incentives with respect to climate change the figure below simulates with some minimal assumptions the net portfolio effect of the above mitigation measure on the 20 big three index funds with the largest holdings in exxonmobil while some funds would make substantial gains for example vanguard total stock market which invests in more than 4 000 companies other funds would take a hit for example those specialized in the energy sector interestingly only for vanguard the aggregate net effect of the proposed mitigation measure would be positive for blackrock and state street the measure would result in a net loss despite the huge positive effect for the whole market the simulation assumes that the effects of the mitigation measure are entirely captured by the 11 512 companies in which the above funds invest oil companies bear the cost of the mitigation in proportion to their market capitalization the other companies capture the benefit of the mitigation in proportion to the square root of their market capitalization i e with diminishing marginal benefits data on the portfolio composition of the various funds were collected from factset as of november 30 2021 another form of portfolio bias regards geography even index funds with a very broad market base are biased in favor of richer countries and therefore do not internalize the relatively larger losses that poorer countries are expected to suffer from climate change for example the united states accounts for 24 percent of the global economy and india accounts for 5 percent of the global economy however 63 percent of the aggregate revenues of the portfolio companies of the vanguard total stock market index fund come from the united states and only 1 percent come from india since india is expected to suffer significantly larger climate losses than the united states the portfolio bias towards the unites states means that the fund internalizes only a fraction of the global cost of carbon and therefore is incentivized to underinvest in climate mitigation the figure below simulates this effect a value greater than 1 means that the fund internalizes more than its proportional share of the local social cost of carbon a value smaller than 1 means that the fund internalizes less than its proportional share of the local social cost of carbon as the figure shows vanguard total stock market index fund internalizes less than half of the world s social cost of carbon fraction of country level social cost of carbon internalized by vanguard total stock market index fund assuming that an index fund internalizes the social cost of carbon of a given country in proportion to the local revenues of its portfolio companies relative to the size of the local economy gdp data on country level revenues were collected from factset georev as of july 6 2021 data on country gdp were collected from the world bank database and refer to 2019 estimates of country level social cost of carbon are taken from richard tol 2019 portfolio primacy creates serious fiduciary conflicts even if index funds did have strong incentives to become climate stewards however the implementation of this strategy would prove extremely problematic from a fiduciary standpoint portfolio primacy creates unsolvable fiduciary conflicts on multiple levels between fund managers and fund beneficiaries between influential shareholders such as the big three and undiversified shareholders between corporate directors and the individual company as we have seen climate mitigation might benefit some funds and damage other funds managed by the same institution thus creating conflicts of interest within the fund family furthermore portfolio primacy calls for decisions that may reduce firm value in order to benefit the portfolio of some large investors to the detriment of minority shareholders who are not maximally diversified all these aspects clash against the current structure of fiduciary and corporate law on a close examination the promise of portfolio primacy appears unreliable given the urgency of the climate threat and the significant limits of portfolio primacy policymakers should focus their efforts on altering the incentives of individual companies with traditional regulatory tools most firms and carbon emitters are partially or totally shielded from index fund stewardship finally even if all the above obstacles disappeared and index funds started pressuring companies on climate mitigation in a serious way we should not overestimate the impact of their stewardship on a global scale to begin with most firms around the world including most carbon emitters are partially or totally insulated from the influence of index funds because they are privately held are owned by state governments or have a controlling shareholder furthermore in a growing number of large us public companies there is a ceo founder or other main shareholder with the largest equity stake and the most voting rights for example half of the twenty largest companies in the s p 500 have a controlling or influential shareholder who has no financial incentive to reduce the value of their company which often represents most of their personal wealth in order to create a portfolio gain for the big three finally even public companies with a dispersed ownership could easily go private or sell their most carbon intensive assets to private owners thus shielding them from index fund stewardship when we take account of this reality which involves most firms around the world and many of the largest us firms the sphere of influence of index funds appears quite narrow some policy implications portfolio primacy has a powerful appeal it offers a tool to fight climate change without intrusive government regulation and it argues that index funds are eager to fight climate change not because of prosocial and altruistic inclinations which many people find hard to believe but because of mere financial incentives on a close examination however the promise of portfolio primacy appears unreliable given the urgency of the climate threat and the significant limits of portfolio primacy policymakers should focus their efforts on altering the incentives of individual companies with traditional regulatory tools carbon tax cap and trade systems prescriptive regulation rather than rely on the portfolio incentives of index funds the full paper the limits of portfolio primacy is available on ssrn learn more about our disclosure policy here

garfield county s unemployment consistently trended downward in 2021 ending in november at about 4 according to the bureau of labor statistics it s a healthy unemployment rate said carolyn tucker a colorado department of labor and employment spokesperson from our perspective it s healthier than pre pandemic levels which were about 2 3 while data is not yet available for december labor statistics indicate the 2021 average unemployment rate for garfield county was about 5 down from about 7 in 2020 the cdle regional business services manager for western eagle pitkin and garfield counties tucker said a slightly higher unemployment rate can be better for employers because more workers are seeking jobs unemployment rates she explained are determined by dividing the total labor force by total number of unemployed workers claiming benefits the numbers are a guidepost but can be skewed because they do not include people whose unemployment benefits expired or workers who voluntarily left the workforce for reasons such as child care if there s anything i ve seen about the pandemic it s that it accentuated prior trends like challenges with affordable housing and child care tucker said these problems existed before the pandemic but they re worse now and we ve seen a number of workers mostly women leave their careers to take care of their children unemployed workers leaving an area for jobs elsewhere can also lower the unemployment rate she said as a tourism economy garfield county s labor force typically fluctuates year to year and month to month depending on the season the county s average labor force of about 33 000 in 2019 dropped to about 29 000 workers in 2020 but in 2021 the average through november rose back up to about 32 000 i m not seeing a huge deficit of people moving away or out tucker said however we have an aging workforce and a lot of people have decided to retire during the great recession of 2008 older workers stayed in the workforce longer because of uncertainty in the stock markets but during the pandemic the stock market remained relatively healthy and many retirement aged people across the nation stowed their work boots for good she said we knew this retirement wave was going to come this silver tsunami tucker said explaining labor prediction models forecast the shortage a decade ago boomers are aging out of the workforce but people are having fewer kids and there are less people entering the workforce than are exiting while the exodus of older workers creates opportunities for the remaining labor force fewer people entering the workforce contributes significantly to the labor shortages facing many entry level positions across garfield county and the nation tucker said regardless of the challenges that lay ahead tucker said she was optimistic about the future of employment throughout garfield county the trend over the last eight months has been pretty encouraging she said i see a lot of positive things going on for 2022 it will be rough but from my perspective the garfield county business community has been tremendous at adapting to those changes reporter ike fredregill can be reached at 970 384 9154 or by email at ifredregill postindependent com

review and preview south africa has lifted a midnight to 4 a m curfew on people s movement with immediate effect believing the country has passed the peak of its fourth covid 19 wave driven by the omicron variant a government statement said on thursday all indicators suggest the country may have passed the peak of the fourth wave at a national level a statement from the special cabinet meeting held earlier on thursday said south africa lifts curfew says omicron wave has peaked reuters december 31 2021 it was a good closing week on a good year for world equity markets after falling to multi week lows on december 20 the first trading day after the very important venus retrograde of december 19 the santa claus end of the year rally finally kicked in in some cases like the u s and switzerland stock indices posted new all time highs in the united kingdom the ftse soared to its highest level since the march 2020 pandemic crash in most others it was a secondary rally that fell short of making a new all time high gold and silver also had a very good week gold soared to 1828 70 its highest level in over a month silver rallied to 23 48 on december 28 its highest mark since posting its double bottom at 21 41 on december 15 and also its highest price since november 26 the price action was similar in crude oil which soared to 77 44 on december 20 its highest mark since november 26 and sharply up from its primary cycle trough of 62 43 on december 2 bitcoin showed some promise going into the final saturn uranus waning square of december 24 when it rallied to 52 104 on december 27 its highest price since the selloff on december 4 down to 42 101 but then it fell back into its congestion zone of 45 000 50 000 ethereum did not make a new multi week high during this same holiday period instead it re tested its 3504 low of december 4 when it fell to 3584 its secondary low on december 30 short term geocosmic trump who is fully vaccinated told fox news that he received a booster dose of a covid 19 vaccine for those still hesitant to receive a covid vaccine trump said you have to embrace it you don t have to do it and there can t be mandates and all those things but you have to embrace it trump said getting americans vaccinated is really a matter of tone instead of mandates brooke singman trump very appreciative and surprised biden acknowledged his administration s covid vaccine success www foxnews com december 22 2021 maybe he s changing but one has to be surprised not because biden praised trump which was indeed a very nice gesture but because trump acknowledged that achieving a healing between the divisive political ideologies that plague america is a matter of tone he is right of course but does he have any idea that the major reason he lost the 2020 election had a lot to do with his tone oh sorry of course what was i thinking he lost because the election was stolen it was fraudulent and rigged and the tone that continues today as a result of that unverified claim continues to fester like salt in a wound that will take a long time to heal until he moves on and accepts or forgives yet as outlined in the forecast 2022 book there is hope that the nation will now be able to embark on a more common sense path of moderation with less attention given to extremist and divisive narratives from both sides of the political spectrum the cosmic hope comes from the early stages of the jupiter saturn cycle that is now underway plus the fact that a majority five of the seven outermost planetary cycles are now in their waxing growth phase for the first time in over 20 years looking at the market through the lens of geocosmic studies as we enter the new year we cannot help but be impressed with the performance of global stock indices throughout the three passage series of the saturn uranus waning square the first passage was on february 17 2021 which correlated with multiyear highs in china and japan s stock markets the second passage was june 14 which was nearby to the primary cycle crest in each of those same stock markets the third and final exact passage just ended on december 24 and once again stock markets are rising the saturn uranus waning square is a very challenging aspect one of the most challenging and difficult in the study of astrology that most astrologers anticipated would be bearish for equities on the contrary the stock markets of the world were bullish throughout the entire 11 months which supports two axioms expressed over and over again in our research first astrological aspects do not always manifest solely or directly in the field of financial markets in this case the world was seriously challenged in other areas than equity markets such as with additional waves of covid 19 affecting travel and leisure and a number of other sectors of the economy there were serious disruptions in the supply chain of essential goods and materials like computer chips affecting automobile production and sales certainly consistent with the themes of saturn and uranus this in turn led to a sudden unexpected rise in inflation the second axiom is that geocosmic signatures are by and large not bullish or bearish but rather representative of changes in direction or reversals given a reasonable orb of time dependent on the length of the planetary cycle the fact that many of the world stock indices have made new all time highs under the longest of the planetary cycle that was in effect in 2021 suggests a stronger possibility that there will be a significant reversal decline as saturn starts to separate from its square to uranus but will it be immediate not necessarily because these two planetary powerhouses will return to within one degree of this same aspect in september october 2022 technically they have made their last exact square aspect for this series but in astrology a 3 degree orb can still be considered influential this matter and its implications are discussed in greater detail in forecast 2022 we now leave the three star geocosmic reversal zone of december 24 27 which requires at least a 2week orb of time due to the length of the saturn uranus cycle this time band also contained the very important venus retrograde of december 19 both venus retrograde and saturn uranus square have a very high correlation to primary cycles or their secondary lows or highs within 12 trading days we note that december 20 could qualify as secondary lows in most world stock indices to the primary cycle lows of december 3 but so too can the rallies of last week qualify as secondary highs to all time highs of november this is where technical studies and chart pattern recognition studies can be very useful we know something cosmically important just happened december 19 31 according to the tenets of astrology we suspect important announcements from central banks will come out while venus is retrograde through january 29 and maybe close to the midpoint of that passage which is next weekend january 8 9 we know major changes in banking are already underway as discussed for this aspect in the forecast 2022 book given that banks will need to switch from libor rate setting of new contracts for loans which will affect everything from mortgages to car loans thank you subscriber john h for this info from bank of england and we know inflation is far from over as jupiter now enters pisces on its way to conjoin neptune on april 12 it s good to know these things it s good to know astrology it gives one a sense of greater understanding and tolerance for what is going on here as it coincides with the symbology of what is taking place in the heavens in this season of goodwill and personal reflection it is good to be reminded that nothing brings me closer to god or an awareness of a creative divine intelligence and order than the study of the stars and their correlation to cycles in human activity to each and every one of you may you have a wonderful and prosperous new year
by veronika dolar suny old westbury marlon williams university of dayton melanie g long the college of wooster the conversation the us economy ended 2021 with a lot of uncertainty inflation surged to levels not seen since the 1980s seriously eroding consumer purchasing power while the highly contagious omicron variant forced many americans to hunker down as case counts soared to record levels reducing economic activity how will the economy fare in 2022 and given its size and complexity how will we even know whether things are improving to offer some clues the conversation us recruited three economists to highlight one measurement tool they ll be following closely in the new year and explain why it will help them and you better understand how the economy is doing will inflation keep rising veronika dolar professor of economics suny old westbury americans especially those on low incomes have felt the pinch of higher prices in recent months the price people pay for everything from fish to gasoline has soared with the pace of change the highest it s been in decades inflation is a sustained generalized increase in the prices of many goods and services in an economy inflation erodes consumers purchasing power and the value of their cash in effect reducing their real incomes a modern economy has millions of goods and services whose prices are continually quivering in the breezes of supply and demand how can all of these shifts be boiled down to a single inflation rate as with many problems in economic measurement the conceptual answer is reasonably straightforward prices of a variety of goods and services are combined into a single price level or index and the inflation rate is simply a measure of its change over some period economists have many ways to measure inflation from the ubiquitous consumer price index to the little known gross domestic product deflator even the satirical publication the onion has a guide each has its strengths and weaknesses i prefer the tool that journalists commonly use and you ve almost certainly seen in recent weeks trumpeting the highest inflation rate in about 40 years headline cpi which rose 6 8 in november 2021 compared with a year earlier this is the broadest version of the consumer price index many economists and the federal reserve prefer what is known as core cpi which excludes volatile food and energy prices because prices for food and fuel fluctuate frequently even as demand for them remains stable policy makers argue excluding them makes it easier to figure out what s really going on in the economy but this ignores two categories that absorb a significant share of most household budgets especially among the less affluent after all people need food up 6 1 percent over the past year and energy up 33 3 percent in 2021 to survive as such it seems problematic to exclude them economists like me will be watching the main consumer price index closely in 2022 to see if it stays elevated continues to climb or finally begins to fall which is what mosteconomistsforecast not only will it tell us a lot about the state of the us economy and how quickly the fed may have to raise interest rates but it will likely also be a major factor in who gains most in the midterm elections research has found that high inflation rates and especially gas prices are strongly correlated with disapproval in the president s job performance will americans return to the work force marlon williams assistant professor of economics university of dayton the labor force participation rate is not one of the big three macroeconomic indicators gross domestic product inflation and the unemployment rate that economists financial markets and journalists slavishly follow as a matter of fact it might not even make the top 10 but it is one of the variables that i will be following especially closely in 2022 the labor force participation rate is the percentage of the civilian population aged 16 and up who are either employed or are actively seeking a job this measure gives us a sense of the share of working age population who are making themselves available to work from the 1970s through the turn of the century there was an almost uninterrupted increase in the labor force participation as more women joined the work force during that period it rose from a low of roughly 60 percent to an all time high of 67 3 percent in the first quarter of 2000 from the early 2000s until the pandemic hit the participation rate steadily declined and was about 63 percent at the end of 2019 it fell sharply in april 2020 as the us began a period of lockdowns to try to contain the rapid spread of covid 19 reaching a nearly 50 year low of 60 2 percent that month although the rate has recovered somewhat it continues to flounder below 62 percent because of a combination of factors brought on or exacerbated by the pandemic such as fear about returning to a physical workplace and pandemic related benefits that made it more financially feasible to go without a job while economists don t identify a specific participation rate as ideal it s generally believed that a sudden sizable reduction in the rate presents significant challenges to the smooth functioning of an economy that s because it represents a rapid withdrawal of productive resources workers that can t be easily or quickly offset this is one cause of the recent surge in inflation not to mention the supply chain problems the global economy is currently experiencing if the rate doesn t rise to pre pandemic levels in the coming year or two that would dash hopes for a stronger economic recovery and would signal high inflation and supply chain shortages will be with us for some time to come will real wages climb melanie long assistant professor of economics the college of wooster as an economist who studies consumer finances i spend a lot of time thinking about how much americans spend that is why i will be watching one number particularly closely in 2022 median usual weekly earnings in short this data point tells us how much the typical worker rather than the average one which can be misleading receives in pretax pay each week adjusted for inflation anyone who manages a budget knows that how much you make is only half the story prices matter just as much real weekly earnings are adjusted based on the cost of consumer goods higher prices mean that families can afford to buy less with the same pay so their real earnings would fall unfortunately this number is a bit delayed coming several months after the release of the nominal data which doesn t factor in inflation but accounting for prices is more important now than ever the prices of everything from used cars to chicken are rising at the fastest rate in a decade these increases will cut into families buying power and threaten to stall an already slow economic rebound before the pandemic real weekly earnings were on the rise as historically low unemployment rates forced companies to pay more to attract workers in the second quarter of 2020 real earnings suddenly spiked primarily because millions of low wage workers lost their jobs because of lockdowns and so their incomes weren t being calculated in the figure earnings subsequently fell back to pre pandemic levels as low wage workers returned to work now there are signs that wages could again be on the rise for some workers for example service workers have been quitting their jobs in droves in part in search of better pay with other employers given the ongoing labor shortage some companies seem to have had little choice but to raise wages one concern economists have about these wage hikes is that employers might react by raising prices further to help pay for them this in turn could prompt workers to demand higher wages economists call this a wage price spiral which if allowed to spin out of control could lead to stagflation slow growth high inflation or worse the direction that real earnings take in 2022 will have a major impact on families spending and the pace of economic growth consumer spending makes up nearly 70 percent of us economic activity each year i will be watching this number carefully this year to see how the competing forces of increasing prices and rising wages ultimately shape the fragile pandemic economic recovery this

diversification is key in investing it is always a good idea to not put all your eggs in one basket diversification in investing is beneficial for the portfolio choosing growth stocks from different sectors will keep one s portfolio balanced while helping earn fruitful returns over the long term these three fascinating stocks from three different sectors are stable companies that have been doing exceptionally well new york based cannabis company columbia care cchwf 8 18 ireland based healthcare company medtronic mdt 2 48 and washington based consumer company costco wholesale corporation cost 0 14 have high growth prospects that will bring huge returns over the years let s take a look at their performance this year and how 2022 is looking for all three costco wholesale this retail company has made its mark globally it operates 828 warehouses worldwide with the highest number of 512 in the u s surprisingly the pandemic hasn t put any dent in its performance most of the credit goes to its price leadership position in the industry which acts as a competitive moat for the company costco offers consumers reasonable prices for most of the products even in an inflationary environment it also benefits from its membership fees which jumped 85 million from the year ago quarter to 946 million in the first fiscal quarter ended nov 21 despite the pandemic induced supply problems costco has managed to grow substantially for its first quarter fiscal 2022 its total sales including membership fees increased 16 year over year to 50 3 billion its net income for the quarter also jumped 18 to 1 3 billion with its recent monthly sales report costco gave investors a hint that it is heading into the new year strong its total sales for the retail month of december for the five weeks ended jan 2 2022 jumped 16 2 to 22 2 billion costco is also a dividend paying stock and consistently pays dividends its rising profits indicate investors can be assured of receiving consistent income by investing in this stock columbia care this u s cannabis company might be small in size with a market cap of just 1 2 billion but it s heading up to compete against some of the bigger multi state operators msos it operates 131 facilities out of which 99 are retail stores its strategy of targeting limited license markets has worked in its favor since cannabis is still illegal under u s federal law some states are careful in how many licenses they issue to each operator this strategy allowed columbia care to garner a loyal customer base for its products this strategy brought in another stellar quarter in its third quarter revenue surged 144 year over year to 132 million its adjusted earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization ebitda grew 634 to 31 million from third quarter 2020 its gross profit margin also jumped to 49 from 39 a year ago besides the bigger markets of california and colorado its presence in limited license markets like pennsylvania illinois maryland massachusetts ohio and virginia boosted this performance columbia care is strengthening its position in colorado and the mid atlantic through smart acquisitions it recently completed its buyout of green leaf medical and the acquisition of colorado based medicine man the company isn t profitable yet but it won t be too long before it starts earning profits when these acquisitions start showing their full potential analysts see upsides of 203 for columbia care s stock for the next 12 months which i think is possible given the rapid expansion of the cannabis industry medtronic this ireland based medical device manufacturer has been growing at an outstanding rate it operates across 150 countries and treats close to 70 health conditions despite the pandemic the company managed to increase sales in all of its segments geographically besides a slight 1 dip in u s revenues from the year ago quarter management stated that the market impact of the pandemic resurgence and healthcare system staffing challenges on medical procedure volumes had an effect on u s revenues but it still comprised 51 of total revenue for the quarter at 4 billion emerging markets revenue showed amazing 20 year over year growth to 1 3 billion it s good news that with the market recovery of non elective procedures all of its product lines cardiovascular medical surgical neuroscience and diabetes showed an increase in revenue for the quarter its total reported revenue grew 3 year over year to 7 8 billion medtronic s adjusted net profits also jumped 30 to 1 7 billion from the year ago quarter the strong performance made the company reaffirm its full year eps guidance range of 5 65 to 5 75 however management still expects some pandemic related challenges and expects the fiscal year 2022 revenue growth of 7 to 8 on an organic basis compared to the earlier estimate of 9 another perk of investing in medtronic is that it is a dividend aristocrat that has increased its payouts for the past 44 years recently it increased its third quarter dividend by 9 from the prior year to 0 63 per share the dividend aristocrat tag is a sign of a stable and growing company a company that consistently pays a dividend also knows how to consistently grow its earnings so investors can be assured dividend payments aren t stopping any time sooner these three exciting and outstanding growth stocks can boost up your portfolio returns in 2022 and beyond

the netflix drama the power of the dog starring benedict cumberbatch won three golden globes at a nontelevised ceremony that saw zero nominees in attendance in hollywood the maxim goes the show must go on even it seems if there is no show so it was that on sunday evening the embattled hollywood foreign press assn bumped off the air by nbc following months of blistering controversy sparked by a february 2021 times investigation handed out its 79th golden globe awards at a glitz free private event in the ballroom of the beverly hilton hotel with no celebrities no host and no free flowing champagne as in any year the night had its big winners jane campion s brooding western power of the dog won the best picture prize in the drama category and steven spielberg s sweeping new take on west side story claimed the top prize in the musical or comedy category the hbo series succession and hacks won the top series prizes while actors including will smith nicole kidman michael keaton and kate winslet claimed trophies too but none of the nominees chose to attend the event no stars were there to deliver snappy comic banter or give tearful acceptances speeches and no one was watching advertisement with the stars gone the spotlight was turned on the hfpa s recent woes and its ongoing efforts to deliver on its promised reforms last year the hollywood foreign press assn was challenged to change and we did hfpa president helen hoehne said in her remarks we are on a journey of change and we re not going to rest we are going to be outspoken about what we re learning and challenge others to join us roughly 70 of the hfpa s 105 members gathered for the black tie ceremony and reception according to one attendee along with a handful of recent recipients of charitable grants from the organization and other friends and supporters with the pandemic wreaking havoc for a second year straight on the usual awards traditions strict covid protocols were followed where the hilton would in former years have been the epicenter of hollywood glamour power and money there was just a quiet sunday night with only hilton staff and the occasional oblivious hotel guest passing outside the ballroom a modest reception was held on the pool deck afterwards but there were no glamorous and high priced studio hosted afterparties no limousines no breathless red carpet interviews no snapping flashbulbs with the event neither televised nor live streamed and with the media barred from covering it in person the hfpa unveiled this year s winners to the public on its web site and via social media a format that sorely lacked the snap and crackle of a live tv show featuring hollywood s funniest and most charismatic talent if laughter is the best medicine westsidemovie is the cure for what ails you read the tweet announcing the climactic win for west side story a tragic love story involving racial tensions that is not exactly intended to be hilarious the tweet was later revised to read if music is the best medicine advertisement a number of tweets failed to cite the work the winner was being honored for save the drama for will smith who takes home the goldenglobe for best actor motion picture drama read one about the king richard star awards the complete list of 2022 golden globe winners in the absence of a telecast the hollywood foreign press assn announced the winners for the 2022 golden globe awards during a small private event for the hfpa the muted event the very existence of which many regular globes viewers were likely unaware represented a stunning stumble from the improbable perch of influence the small cadre of foreign entertainment journalists had enjoyed for decades fighting for its survival the organization was determined to hand out its awards as it had for nearly 80 years but the run up to the event was overshadowed by questions of whether they had any real meaning or relevance if a tree wins a golden globe in the forest but it s not televised does it still make an embarrassing speech conan o brien joked on twitter on friday though frequently dogged by questions of credibility and legitimacy the globes have long been touted as hollywood s party of the year drawing a cheerfully lubricated crowd of a listers and in pre pandemic times an audience of some 18 million viewers but in the wake of the times investigation which raised questions about the hfpa s ethics and governance and highlighted the fact that the then 87 member group had no black members the association s members have been all but exiled by an industry that had long courted their favor for nearly a year the hfpa has undertaken a series of reforms overhauling its bylaws hiring a chief diversity officer and bringing in 21 new members including six who are black at its event on sunday the hfpa sought to highlight its progress when it comes to issues of inclusion with kyle bowser senior vice president of the naacp hollywood bureau speaking about a joint five year partnership the organization has forged with the hfpa dubbed the reimagine coalition to increase representation in the industry and support artists and journalists of color bowser concluded his speech by nodding to the attention that has deservedly been paid to the hfpa s shortcomings while affirming that the naacp supports their effort to reform and applauds hfpa s offer to share its transitional experience as a template for the entire industry to emulate advertisement still the organization has struggled to get back in the industry s good graces accustomed to being lavished with special attention by celebrities and studios the hfpa has faced a boycott led by the industry s leading talent publicists cutting it off from its lifeblood of star power when the hfpa announced this year s nominations in december the event emceed by rapper and pitchman snoop dogg who mangled more than a few of the nominees names was greeted with a mix of silence and befuddlement beset by external criticisms and internal frictions the hfpa used sunday s event to put a spotlight on its philanthropy work showcasing four of its newest grantees get lit st elmo village streetlights and los fotos as the event went on the golden globes twitter account shared videos showcasing the beneficiaries work and actress jamie lee curtis a seven time globes nominee and two time winner appeared in a video to honor and stand with the organization s philanthropic efforts i m proud to be associated with them in this venture said curtis who has twice hosted hfpa s grantee banquets near the show s conclusion arnold schwarzenegger also appeared in a short video touting the generosity and openness of the hfpa noting that in 1977 the group awarded him an austrian bodybuilder with a last name some in hollywood advised him to change the best newcomer globe in 1977 for the film stay hungry these are the international journalists with the world view he said of the group in recent years the non profit organization has stepped up its charitable giving donating millions of dollars annually to organizations supporting the arts journalism and humanitarian causes at the same time the times investigation revealed the organization has funneled an increasing amount each year reaching around 2 million in 2020 to its own rank and file for serving on numerous committees and performing various tasks no other awards community shows as much love and generosity to others quite like the hfpa the globes posted on its official live blog mid way through the event but for all of its efforts to burnish its reputation the hfpa s only real currency in hollywood rests in the perceived value of its awards and there its stock has plummeted while trophies will be sent to this year s winners it remains to be seen whether any stars will acknowledge them or whether any of the studios that pump millions annually into wooing globes voters will tout the wins in their marketing campaigns in the lead up to the oscars in march advertisement indeed given the hfpa s current troubles and precarious position many in hollywood feel that the group would have been better off simply sitting this year out rather than attempting to plow ahead awkwardly with a celebrity free ceremony i think they definitely shot themselves in the foot said one source who has dealt with the organization for years but declined to be named out of fear of retaliation they needed to do a james franco when you up go away and let people miss you or hope they do instead they ve been in the news constantly for things they

while tesla is busy shouting about how awesome its new model s is with 604 km of range and then under delivering in real world testing our next energy a startup in southeast michigan is retrofitting its own batteries into and older model s and doing a road trip more than double that without charging while this is still a proof of concept prototype battery the goal is to turn this into a big business re powering old teslas to do big miles image our energy next while one inc doesn t provide any exact details about the battery we can assume that this battery holds a whole lot more batteries than the original tesla pack had the largest tesla pack right now is around 100 kwh of energy storage if we assume a standard model s achieves efficiency around 3 5 mi kw in ideal conditions that 1 210 km road trip would take at least 214 kwh so how do you fit twice as much battery in the same volume it would seem that our next energy has figured out some energy density tricks that tesla doesn t yet have nailed down while also packaging things tighter and with hand built tolerances that tesla s mass production factories can t manage image our energy next at a steady state 89 km h on a dynamometer with no wind resistance the car managed to run 1 419 km on that same battery obviously that would be nearly impossible unless you were running with a 97 km h tailwind the whole way and one must presume that this test was conducted indoors at a reasonable temperature pushing that same battery into service to drive through a michigan winter and still returning 1 207 km non stop is pretty impressive the route took one engineers from its headquarters in novi up across the legendary mackinac bridge back down through the state capital in lansing back across to detroit then back to novi all of that was done without a single stop to charge that s pretty cool and extremely impressive apparently no modifications were made to the car other than the battery presumably there is a slight aerodynamic advantage to the one battery pack s truly flat floor but other than that it looks like a pretty stock model s with these temperatures and road conditions it would be unlikely that a standard tesla would even make it 563 km without a charge let alone 750 image our energy next we want to accelerate the adoption of electric vehicles by eliminating range anxiety which holds back most consumers today said mujeeb ijaz founder and ceo of one we are now focused on evolving this proof of concept battery into a new product called gemini which will enable long distance trips on a single charge while improving cost and safety using sustainable materials gemini is the name of the company s battery retrofit for tesla model s it doesn t provide much information about gemini beyond the stated range test and this one rendered image of the pack on the company s website there s also no mention of what one of these bad boys might cost but i can assure you it won t be cheap you can buy used 100 kwh tesla packs on ebay right now for around us25 000 34 808 if that gives you any idea what big batteries cost these days image our energy next that said how much is it worth to you to be able to drive 1 207 km non stop 30 grand 50 grand 75 grand plus the cost of buying a used tesla model s for some people that might be true but certainly not for me it s a really cool idea but i m not sure how much practical application there is for such a battery retrofit 1 207 km is about two months of daily use for the average american why would you need the ability to drive for two months without charging image our energy next one which was founded in 2020 claims its batteries are engineered with a focus toward safer battery chemistries with more sustainable materials the company plans to launch its first product a standalone configurable battery pack called aries presumably for grid energy storage and off grid power backup later this year gemini for tesla model s applications is anticipated to hit the market in 2023

imf warns developing countries of economic turbulence people cross a street to shop in the divisoria district of manila on november 30 2021 manila philippines emerging economies should gird for possible rough times as the us federal reserve prepares to raise interest rates and world economic growth slows because of the omicron variant of covid 19 the imf warned monday the international monetary fund which is scheduled to release updated economic forecasts on january 25 said that for now global economic recovery from the ravages of the pandemic should continue this year and next but risks to growth remain elevated by the stubbornly resurgent pandemic imf economists stephan danninger kenneth kang and helene poirson wrote in a blog post the highly contagious omicron strain has spread like wildfire around the world since mid december causing record numbers of new covid cases in the latest wave of the global health crisis omicron which seems to cause less severe disease than previous strains of the coronavirus is causing countries to reinstitute health measures that hamper economic growth given the risk that this could coincide with faster fed tightening emerging economies should prepare for potential bouts of economic turbulence the economists said as these countries are also confronting elevated inflation and substantially higher public debt the fed has signalled that it will raise key interest rates sooner and more aggressively than it had planned in order to counter rampant inflation in the us that is hitting us households and consumption the engine of economic growth in america higher interest rates mean financing costs for some emerging economies with dollar denominated debt will rise these countries are already lagging behind in the global economic recovery and thus less able to absorb added expenditure while dollar borrowing costs remain low for many concerns about domestic inflation and stable foreign funding led several emerging markets last year including brazil russia and south africa to start raising interest rates the imf said quicker fed rate hikes could rattle financial markets and cause tighter financial conditions on a global scale the blog says the risk is there will be a slowing of demand and trade in the us as well as capital flight and a depreciation of the dollar in markets of emerging countries the imf recommended that emerging economy nations tailor their response based on their circumstances and vulnerabilities and central banks that are raising interest rates to fight inflation should engage in clear and consistent communication so people better understand the need for price stability the international lender said
