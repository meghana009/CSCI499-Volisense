i never thought the day would come i d be putting these words to paper or computer screen but i ve written my last column i m not finally moving to wyoming have no fatal disease save being banal not finally fed up with people simply it s just too damn hot to write another column or inhale the last couple weeks a cool spell s been 105 my all time favorite commentary on heat waves came from a mighty signal editor nearly a century ago a b dad thatcher commented in his front page space about a grizzled old cowboy wandering into this newspaper s office back when it was on main street the westerner dryly noted he was visiting to report a news story we were suffering through a stifling depression era august heat wave and the bovine relocator reported that it was so hot he had witnessed a coyote chasing a rabbit according to his report they were both walking it s been stupid hot about 50 years ago i was married living on the ranch we were blessed with a gigantic swimming pool where we lived la vie submergée from july to september friends and sworn enemies would show up toward sunset with big smiles cold beer and peach ice cream one entire august the mercury bubbled between 105 and 117 every damn day the thermometer was nailed to a tree in the shade the pool while it was secluded in a lovely oak grove there wasn t a paint swab of shadow from dawn to midnight you couldn t stand poolside in cowboy boots let alone bare feet without incinerating your feet that summer the water in the darn pool was hot soup hot you couldn t go in ain t making it up we called newhall ice and they delivered first a half ton then a few hours later another half ton of ice each in 100 pound blocks in bathing suits and cowboy hats me and the missus quietly stood neck deep in the shallow end sipping mai tais as huge ice floes lazily sailed past part of my problem of ol sol moving a few million miles closer to earth is that as i approach middle age i m becoming more of a weather sissy i get colder in the winter and fry in the summer when i was younger i was so much tougher surrounded by eerie heat waves shimmering skyward i d do chores in triple digits run the tractor in the midday blazing sun when it got too hot for even a snake from the planet mercury i d steer the old ford tractor under the big water tank open the spigot and get properly deliciously drenched with cold well water then i d put my hat back on there s nothing like that indescribable sensation of your core temperature plummeting down to the marrow of your bones five minutes later my clothes would be completely dry again and i d be back strafing the ancient enemy weeds life is given to us in such unfair increments the parenthesis of young and ferocious is not very wide we re children with boundless energy and play yet without bank accounts or drivers licenses then we re young and ferocious for 20 minutes then elderly begins at 35 and what wisdom we possess is channeled toward accumulating debt when i was in gladiator shape i d run midday during the worst smog alert no not run sprint i d jog over to hart park then race up one of the back trails to bill s castle i d sprint straight uphill without stopping until i reached the silent movie star s big white home isn t that something that god can lovingly craft for us bodies to accomplish tasks at 23 that would make hercules scratch his beard and wince cripes no darn way you ll catch me doing that still let the record state at some point after thumping my chest and gazing triumphantly over the pathetic scv scenery from a newhall mountaintop i did finally stop running went home showered searched for an air conditioning vent to stand in front of and sob lightly as a teen i had a series of wretched summer jobs i steam cleaned carpets for about a week with a baptist minister steam cleaning carpets is like moving four houses a day in a sauna you move bedroom sets pianos aquariums fill a 90 degree plus house with steam move everything back repeat it wasn t the life sucking back breaking work that killed me it was that baptist minister merrily adding okey doke to the end of every sentence over a 12 hour day the worst was being a grocery store box boy i worked at the mega canyon country safeway at the corner of whites and soledad in the late 60s again remember it s not the heat that sucks it s going back and forth in and out from saharan to arctic circle conditions i d hate to see safeway s electric bill then it was a huge store impossible to regulate with thousands going in and out when it s a million in the parking lot don t forget they measure temperature in the shade when it s to be found on the asphalt you can stir fry noodles my daily job description included retrieving hundreds of shopping carts outside shoving a few dozen into one unwieldy mile long metal snake then pushing the caravan into the store then drenched in sweat i d ask heat stroked shoppers if they wanted their groceries bagged by color alphabetized or would they like to eat them here then i d stock the dairy case 34 degrees or worse load ice cream in the freezer within minutes you could be basting in death valley like 135 degrees then be shivering at 5 degrees repeat children fainted amazing what the human body can take because safeway allowed we teen peons to drink as much free fountain soda as possible up to kidney failure there d be summer days i d drink a couple gallons of coke then wonder why slight shaving scratches never seemed to heal let some grizzled mojave prospector top that one

the u s federal reserve has published the second quarter 2022 balance sheet of u s total household wealth in the second quarter april may june 2022 the total u s household wealth dropped 6 1 trillion despite a calculated increase in home value of 1 5 trillion the majority of the loss is connected to a drop in corporate equity stock market and household investment in the stock market fed the net worth of households and nonprofit organizations declined 6 1 trillion to 143 8 trillion in the second quarter the value of stocks on the household balance sheet declined by 7 7 trillion while the value of real estate increased by 1 5 trillion keep in mind this is backward looking data and after a period of decelerating rates of growth the overall real estate market is now in a period of decline as calculated for the most recent month of july the equity position of homeowners is now considerably less than the equity position when the feds calculated the second quarter household wealth two months ago part of the issue goes back to what we have been discussing with inflation and specifically energy driven increases in fuel and electricity inflation sucks money out of the economy making people less wealthy energy inflation sucks money exponentially faster out of each household potentially making the already working class poor much poorer the higher prices paid for housing food fuel and energy do not contribute to anything the increased costs are just sucked out of the consumers pockets without generating any additional value it just costs more to live and that reduces wealth consider this the cost of going green joe biden and his economic team are introducing phrases like a growth recession to explain a dynamic where earned wages are replaced by government subsidy you can no longer afford food energy housing etc so the government steps in as the provider of subsidy based on income level to supplement the gap between wages and the new costs of products and services within the biden created green economy however in the bigger of big pictures the government does not create wealth wealth is created outside government by private activity government income via taxation is lowered when the economic activity of the private sector drops there is currently a massive lag in recording dropped economic activity that is going to surface very soon the rate of energy price increase has been so large so fast the ability of producers to transfer the cost creates an economic lag total product costs except imports are rising faster than finished good prices to consumers at the same time consumer demand for goods has dropped dramatically due to the speed and rate of increased energy costs as a combined result the equity market will likely continue to decline as each earnings report comes in lower than prior expectation now looking at wealth over time what happens to the economic model of biden when current housing value 41 2 trillion simply drops back to 2020 levels 33 0 trillion a conservative real estate market correction continued higher prices to consumers less money to government less economic activity and lower household equity that s trouble big trouble wave 3 of food inflation starts hitting hard next month as the increased costs at the field start to transfer through the supply chain from harvest to the fork washington dc the sour mood appears to stem from record food energy and housing prices positive views of the grocery industry dropped 14 percentage points from last year the biggest drop in the survey the real estate industry dipped 9 points the second largest decline just 22 percent of respondents reported having a positive view of the oil and gas industry down from 28 percent last year twenty nine percent reported having a positive view of electric and gas utilities down from 36 percent last year grocery prices rose a stunning 13 1 percent over the last 12 months ending in july the largest annual increase in more than four decades according to labor department data housing affordability has fallen to its lowest level since the great recession according to the national association of home builders with rents and home prices at record levels gas prices reached an all time high in june before falling slightly in recent months while energy bills are also soaring amid huge demand for natural gas read more meanwhile biden s economic team is bragging that main street is in better shape the president s first two years in office have been two of the most productive in american history and as the blueprint explains these accomplishments are all part of one economic vision more

the u s federal reserve has published the second quarter 2022 balance sheet of u s total household wealth in the second quarter april may june 2022 the total u s household wealth dropped 6 1 trillion despite a calculated increase in home value of 1 5 trillion the majority of the loss is connected to a drop in corporate equity stock market and household investment in the stock market fed the net worth of households and nonprofit organizations declined 6 1 trillion to 143 8 trillion in the second quarter the value of stocks on the household balance sheet declined by 7 7 trillion while the value of real estate increased by 1 5 trillion keep in mind this is backward looking data and after a period of decelerating rates of growth the overall real estate market is now in a period of decline as calculated for the most recent month of july the equity position of homeowners is now considerably less than the equity position when the feds calculated the second quarter household wealth two months ago part of the issue goes back to what we have been discussing with inflation and specifically energy driven increases in fuel and electricity inflation sucks money out of the economy making people less wealthy energy inflation sucks money exponentially faster out of each household potentially making the already working class poor much poorer the higher prices paid for housing food fuel and energy do not contribute to anything the increased costs are just sucked out of the consumers pockets without generating any additional value it just costs more to live and that reduces wealth consider this the cost of going green joe biden and his economic team are introducing phrases like a growth recession to explain a dynamic where earned wages are replaced by government subsidy you can no longer afford food energy housing etc so the government steps in as the provider of subsidy based on income level to supplement the gap between wages and the new costs of products and services within the biden created green economy however in the bigger of big pictures the government does not create wealth wealth is created outside government by private activity government income via taxation is lowered when the economic activity of the private sector drops there is currently a massive lag in recording dropped economic activity that is going to surface very soon the rate of energy price increase has been so large so fast the ability of producers to transfer the cost creates an economic lag total product costs except imports are rising faster than finished good prices to consumers at the same time consumer demand for goods has dropped dramatically due to the speed and rate of increased energy costs as a combined result the equity market will likely continue to decline as each earnings report comes in lower than prior expectation now looking at wealth over time what happens to the economic model of biden when current housing value 41 2 trillion simply drops back to 2020 levels 33 0 trillion a conservative real estate market correction continued higher prices to consumers less money to government less economic activity and lower household equity that s trouble big trouble wave 3 of food inflation starts hitting hard next month as the increased costs at the field start to transfer through the supply chain from harvest to the fork washington dc the sour mood appears to stem from record food energy and housing prices positive views of the grocery industry dropped 14 percentage points from last year the biggest drop in the survey the real estate industry dipped 9 points the second largest decline just 22 percent of respondents reported having a positive view of the oil and gas industry down from 28 percent last year twenty nine percent reported having a positive view of electric and gas utilities down from 36 percent last year grocery prices rose a stunning 13 1 percent over the last 12 months ending in july the largest annual increase in more than four decades according to labor department data housing affordability has fallen to its lowest level since the great recession according to the national association of home builders with rents and home prices at record levels gas prices reached an all time high in june before falling slightly in recent months while energy bills are also soaring amid huge demand for natural gas read more meanwhile biden s economic team is bragging that main street is in better shape the president s first two years in office have been two of the most productive in american history and as the blueprint explains these accomplishments are all part of one economic vision more
the church of scientology has been abusing the visa system to import powerless minimally paid workers for decades according to new york magazine under the headline how scientology exploits foreign workers the church has used an obscure visa to bring in thousands of laborers and benefit from their toil reporter kevin dugan wrote for decades scrutiny of scientology has tended to focus on the outrageous and the glamorous missing how the church aggressively used an obscure visa program and created a pool of exploited laborers numbering in the thousands over the past 30 years scientology s use of foreign workers has probably saved the church hundreds of millions of dollars and potentially more than 1 billion the article is based on testimony from some of the church s former acolytes including a girl from the united kingdom england 1994 tina was 14 her parents lived at scientology compounds in the united states and church officials wanted tina to come join them by using an r 1 visa a permit recently created by congress for religious workers good for five years the officials told tina a pseudonym what to tell anyone who asked that she would be attending a special scientology school and volunteering for the church part time it wasn t true once approved tina worked shifts as long as 24 hours doing construction building furniture and performing administrative tasks none of it s voluntary she told me the scientology organization is now being sued by some of the workers for decades the federal government has quietly supported massive labor trafficking by criminal gangs companies and supposedly non profit organizations the government s supportive policy dubbed extraction migration has cut wages for millions of americans and raised their housing costs while fattening company profits and wall street stock values much of the labor trafficking is camouflaged by the asylum programs for poor southern migrants in february 2022 the department of justice convicted five members of a family run latino sex trafficking organization that operated between 2006 and 2017 the trafficking is also hidden among the many temporary visa worker programs that supposedly allow employers to overcome claimed labor shortages in an economy of more than 165 million employees these visa programs keep a foreign workforce of at least 2 million people in u s jobs including at least 1 5 million foreign workers in white collar jobs other companies import legally import people on b 1 b 2 tourist visas and put lease them to other businesses under the shared pretense that they are temporary legal visa workers this august federal officials finally jailed a ukrainian who was part of a gang that trafficked illegal workers to florida s key west since 2007 hbo hires 160 lawyers before making film about scientology and hollywood oscar winning documentarian alex gib breitbart news breitbartnews november 26 2014 organizations that claim religious status use visa laws to smuggle in cheap workers in 2021 federal officials shut down a labor trafficking scheme by a hindu sect that used r 1 visas for religious workers to import lower caste dalit workers so they could be used illegally to build temples in the united states in the scientology case the imported workers were allowed to the united states enter after they got r 1 visas for religious workers the visas were awarded at u s embassies in europe and elsewhere this is an entirely predictable and almost guaranteed result and that s why congress should just get rid of the program said jessica vaughan the director of policy studies for the center for immigration studies she added managers in agencies want these visas rubber stamped without too many questions because they are susceptible to pressure from the employer groups and because they are in denial about the abuse of these programs that can occur moreover there s no reason to have this category if bona fide religious institutions need workers they should be able to apply through other programs they re nonprofits and are not subject to any cap vaughan said adding there s no shortage of people who could work as church secretaries federal officials have done little to curb the labor inflow to the scientology groups dugan wrote this blind spot even seems to extend to law enforcement in 2018 serge gil met with investigators at the fbi and department of homeland security in los angeles to discuss human trafficking he hasn t heard anything since the same year mike rinder says he met with an immigration and customs enforcement agent in tampa bay to raise similar concerns he also doesn t know if investigators have acted on his information the labor extraction process is protected by lobbyists and legislators the nymag com article also quotes a november 2021 letter by gop sen susan collins r me and sen tim kaine d va objecting to the reduced inflow of r 1 workers partly due to the 9 11 atrocity but also because of increased scrutiny of the r 1 visas under president donald trump the letter was sent to alejandro mayorkas a pro migration zealot who is president joe biden s border chief there are many more religious workers waiting outside of the united states unable to serve in our communities these challenges have been compounded by covid 19 related suspensions of visa services at u s embassies and consulates around the world in 2020 and 2021 resulting in lengthy visa processing wait times for religious workers seeking to complete consular processing abroad the collins letter included a wish list from 17 religious groups including the scientologists as well as jewish christian and muslim groups one of biden s pro migration deputies responded to collins in february promising faster processing and reduced fraud checks uscis has reallocated personnel to address the backlog of religious worker petitions and worked with its fraud detection and national security directorate to arrange for the waiver of the pre adjudication verification site visit requirement for certain petitioners that have demonstrated a history of compliance with that program but the long understood problems in the r 1 program are obscured by business lobbies that use other visa programs vaughan said all of these cheap labor employers will defend each other whether it s the catholic church big tech or big agriculture she said the nymag com article includes a denial from the church karin pouw a spokesperson for scientology said by email that the organization strictly complies with u s immigration policies and works directly with immigration counsel to ensure compliance with the immigration policies and regulations of the united states she added that my sources were liars engaged in a coordinated and premeditated conspiracy to level false allegations extraction migration it is easier for government officials to grow the economy by importing people than by growing exports productivity or the birth rate so the federal government officially and unofficially extracts millions of migrants from poor countries and uses them as extra workers consumers and renters this extraction migration policy both grows and skews the national economy but it prevents tight labor markets and so it shifts vast wealth from ordinary people to investors billionaires and wall street it makes it difficult for ordinary americans to advance in their careers get married raise families or buy homes extraction migration slows innovation and shrinks americans productivity partly because it allows employers to boost stock prices by using stoop labor and disposable workers instead of the american professionals and productivity boosting technology that would allow americans and their communities to earn more money this migration policy also reduces exports by minimizing shareholder pressure on u s companies to build up beneficial and complementary trade with people in poor countries migration undermines employees workplace rights and it widens the regional economic gaps between the democrats cheap labor coastal states and the republicans heartland and southern states an economy fueled by extraction migration also drains americans political clout over elites alienates young people and radicalizes americans democratic civic culture because it gives an excuse for wealthy elites and progressives to ignore weak americans at the bottom of society such as drug addicts this economic strategy is enthusiastically pushed by progressives who wish to transform the u s from a society governed by european origin civic culture into an economic empire of jealous identity groups overseen by progressive hall monitors we re trying to become the first multiracial multi ethnic superpower in the world rep rohit khanna d ca told the new york times in march 2022 it will be an extraordinary achievement we will ultimately triumph he boasted but the progressives colonialism like economic strategy kills many migrants it exploits the poverty of migrants and splits foreign families as it extracts human resources from poor home countries to serve wealthy u s investors progressives hide this extraction migration economic policy behind a wide variety of noble sounding narratives and theatrical border security programs for example they claim the u s is a nation of immigrants that migration helps migrants and that the state must renew itself by replacing populations similarly establishment republicans media businesses and major gop donors hide the skew caused by migration they suppress any recognition of the pocketbook impact and instead tout border chaos welfare spending migrant crime and drug smuggling many polls show the public wants to welcome some immigration but the polls also show deep and broad public opposition to labor migration and the inflow of temporary contract workers into jobs u s graduates need this third rail opposition is growing anti establishment multiracial cross sex non racist class based bipartisan rational persistent and recognizes the solidarity that american citizens owe to one another

president joe biden recently gave a speech in wilkes barre pennsylvania touting his safer america plan and a gun control bill he had signed into law for many american gun owners these speeches on preventing gun violence so obviously have become stump speeches for gun control that they no longer tune in unable to bear cringey zingers about deer in kevlar vests and blatantly false gun facts but don t worry i listened to the president s aug 30 speech so that you didn t have to here are the top 5 most unserious things biden said about guns and the second amendment 1 right now you can t go on and buy an automatic weapon you can t go out and buy a cannon biden has made some variation of this assertion numerous times since taking office as president and every time it has been roundly debunked by fact checkers private cannon ownership apparently was so widespread that one of the first types of gun control laws implemented in the early 1800s by some towns was a prohibition on firing one s cannon inside city limits during certain times or without permission today it s still not uncommon for civilians to own heavy ordnance including 18th century cannons and their modern equivalents in fact civilians even may buy tanks and other tactical military vehicles if they can afford the steep price tags but fair warning to would be tank owners many places won t consider your tank street legal and you ll be able to drive it only on private property it s also simply not true that civilians can t legally buy machine guns today these firearms are subject to special taxing and registration provisions under the national firearms act and the firearm owners protection act prohibits civilian ownership of machine guns manufactured after 1986 nevertheless over 700 000 of them currently are registered to american civilians 2 do you realize the bullet out of an ar 15 travels five times as rapidly as a bullet shot out of any other gun five times lighter and can pierce kevlar a simple internet search by an intern could have told the president that this statement about an ar 15 s muzzle velocity and weight was laughably false although a 223 5 56 bullet the most common caliber for an ar 15 platform is certainly among the lighter and faster of rifle rounds it s not even close to the lightest or fastest much less five times faster or lighter several important factors will affect muzzle velocity including the weight of the bullet also known as the bullet s grain and the length of the barrel from which it is fired a typical 223 5 56 round fired from an ar 15 with a standard 16 to 20 inch barrel generally will have a muzzle velocity between 2 800 and 3 300 feet per second at the moment it leaves the barrel many other rifle calibers will fall within that velocity range again depending on the grain of the bullet and the barrel length of the firearm this muzzle velocity also pales in comparison to the average velocity of rounds such as the 220 swift which generally will travel between 4 000 and 4 300 feet per second even if it were true that a 223 5 56 round travels far faster than other caliber muzzle velocity is not synonymous with lethality or stopping power a faster bullet doesn t necessarily mean a deadlier bullet or even necessarily more carnage as anyone who has seen the devastating power of a shotgun blast at close range will attest the ar 15 s alleged but fictional super lethality is also just a poor basis for banning so called assault weapons these bans don t define assault weapons based on caliber muzzle velocity or any other functional measure but on the presence of features such as pistol grips barrel shrouds and collapsing stocks how would banning ar 15s with these features lessen their muzzle velocity or alleged deadliness the answer it wouldn t as for biden s claim that rounds fired from an ar 15 can pierce kevlar this is true of almost all common rifle calibers against soft body armor which is not typically graded to stop rifle rounds 3 for god sake what s the rationale for these weapons outside of a war zone they inflict severe damage the ar 15 just rips the body apart biden can t really believe that ar 15s are solely useful for combat if he did he and other gun control advocates wouldn t universally exempt law enforcement officers from these bans including while the officers are off duty in the united states law enforcement officers aren t waging offensive warfare or engaging in open combat on a battlefield instead they are peace officers responding to common criminal threats in a civilian context they routinely carry ar 15s precisely because these guns are genuinely useful for a wide variety of lawful civilian purposes the president s appeal to the horrific school shooting in uvalde texas as evidence of the ar 15 s ability to inflict severe damage on the human body is horribly misguided as should already be clear at this point rounds fired from an ar 15 don t have a particularly devastating effect compared to either other types of rifle rounds or to the exact same round fired from a nonassault weapon as difficult as it is to consider not a single child in uvalde would be any less dead or any less horribly maimed had the gunman used a shotgun handgun or nonassault rifle under the exact same circumstances 4 for those brave right wing americans who say it s all about keeping america independent and safe if you want to fight against the country you need an f 15 you need something more than a gun this is an odd assertion for the president to make after dedicating so much time to the mutually exclusive argument that ar 15s are ultra deadly weapons of war and useful only for combat purposes either the gun is a useless hunk of carbon fiber without any value in a hypothetical armed defense against a tyrant s military forces or it is a war zone weapon that should be limited to the battlefield it cannot be both at the same time more importantly biden s argument misunderstands how any large scale armed defense against a tyrannical government or foreign invader would unfold and underappreciates the role of federalism in ensuring a far more adequate response to such a scenario the framers well understood that an armed but disorganized citizenry alone might struggle against a large standing army under the control of a tyrannical central power this is precisely why every state has its own organized militia unit in the form of its state guard and national guard units any hypothetical large scale revolt against a tyrannical federal government almost certainly would involve these well trained and well equipped state organized militias including their fighter jets tanks anti aircraft weapons and special operations forces in other words although the body of armed citizens constituting the unorganized militia creates an incredibly valuable foundation for resisting tyranny these citizens are not the sole mechanism for it 5 there are certain gun dealers that are basically not gun dealers they re wholesalers providing the weapons to anybody who has the money is biden alleging that these gun dealers are breaking federal law either by failing to obtain a federal firearms license or by failing to abide by laws requiring such licensees to conduct background checks on firearm purchasers if so the president as chief executive should direct federal law enforcement agencies to do their jobs investigate this alleged criminal noncompliance and ensure these criminals are prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law but if biden is not suggesting that these gun sellers are breaking the law it s not clear why he seems to hold such disdain for them selling their products in compliance with state and federal regulations by definition if these transactions are conducted lawfully the prospective buyer passed a federal background and took possession of a firearm that he was permitted to own under all relevant state laws does the president believe that gun stores should act unilaterally to deny law abiding citizens the exercise of their constitutional rights should they not sell to certain customers for arbitrary reasons despite their ability to pay biden never has shown himself to be a particularly serious person when it comes to guns gun violence or the second amendment but this perhaps was his most unserious speech yet on these issues if biden really were concerned with saving lives he would have been in philadelphia a city wracked by three straight years with record levels of violence denouncing rogue prosecutors and detailing his plans to combat straw purchasing of firearms instead biden was in wilkes barre arguing that law abiding citizens should be stopped from buying more of the nation s most commonly owned rifles because after all what s the point of those rifles when he could just carpet bomb them into compliance at least we ve now been duly reminded of the dangers posed by large

s is home to thousands of advisors that can meet your specific needs based on the methodology outlined below smartasset identified these financial advisor firms as among the top 5 financial advisor firms in the u s rank financial advisor assets managed 1 714 587 898 072 2 173 418 270 044 3 46 803 858 104 4 94 617 046 882 5 19 851 537 239 methodology to find the top financial advisors in the u s we first identified all firms registered with the sec in the country next we filtered out firms that don t offer financial planning services those that don t primarily serve individual clients and those that have disclosures on their record the qualifying firms were then ranked according to the following criteria aum firms with more total assets under management are ranked higher firms with more total assets under management are ranked higher individual client count firms that serve more individual clients as opposed to institutional clients are ranked higher firms that serve more individual clients as opposed to institutional clients are ranked higher clients per advisor firms with a lower ratio of clients per financial advisor are ranked higher firms with a lower ratio of clients per financial advisor are ranked higher years in business firms that have been in business longer are ranked higher firms that have been in business longer are ranked higher fee structure

criteria smartasset is not a client of the aforementioned firms smartasset did not receive compensation for including any of the firms on the aforementioned list why work with an advisor we believe it s more important now than ever to review your retirement plan with a fiduciary financial advisor here s why the pandemic has shown us just how quickly decades of planning investing and saving can be completely upended this could mean your current financial plan might leave you without enough money to last your retirement additionally emotionally charged decisions to sell off large quantities of stocks or other investments now lock in your losses removing any chance for future growth research suggests people who work with a financial advisor feel more at ease about their finances and could end up with about 15 more money to spend in retirement 1 consider this example a recent vanguard study found that on average a hypothetical 500k investment would grow to over 3 4 million under the care of an advisor over 25 years whereas the expected value from self management would be 1 69 million or 50 less in other words an advisor managed portfolio would average 8 annualized growth over a 25 year period compared to 5 from a self managed portfolio 2 a 2020 northwestern mutual study found that 71 of u s adults admit their financial planning needs improvement however only 29 of americans work with a financial advisor 3 assuming 5 annualized growth of 500k portfolio vs 8 annualized growth of advisor managed portfolio over 25 years the hypothetical study discussed above assumes a 5 net return and a 3 net annual value add for professional financial advice to performance based on the vanguard whitepaper putting a value on your value quantifying vanguard advisor s alpha please

states similar to nearly all major automobile insurance writers state farm has experienced underwriting losses in 2021 and through the first six months of 2022 in its personal automobile line primarily reflecting both a higher incidence of highway accidents since the onset of the global pandemic and significant claim cost inflation as a result of supply chain disruptions and higher repair

so they returned to the drawing board to develop a more seaworthy design tapping into the help of the well respected sailor and naval architect rod stephens jr of sparkman stephens inc following the bombings in pearl harbor that catapulted the united states into joining the war the concept of developing an amphibious vehicle became a top priority at first military engineers thought of wrapping a huge tarp under a standard army truck to make it float and propel it using oars which immediately got thrown out of the window because 1 the idea was obsolete and 2 there was no way it could win in the modern warfare amphibious assaults were among the most challenging offensive to pull off particularly if you re coming in against a well defended beachhead however despite weeks of thorough planning things could still array especially if the execution wasn t as meticulous as expected the british army learned this lesson the hard way during the first world war when troops conducted an offensive on turkey s shores it wasn t poor planning and execution that led troops to their bloody demise well it was one factor but rather the lack of viable transportation that could safely ferry dozens of its men from their naval warships to the beachhead the dukw amphibious vehicle is arguably the most phenomenal innovation during world war ii it s remarkably ingenious and highly versatile and the timing of its emergence it s just chef s kiss perfect do you need a capable vehicle to transport troops dukw do you need to transport supplies from a ship to the shores dukw do you need to ferry wounded soldiers on the ground into hospital ships without having to move them at all dukw the only thing it couldn t do was fly dukw was the perfect transport and support vehicle on the battlefield with a team of four stephens converted the two and a half ton general motors corporation gmc cckw military truck commonly used for transporting ammunition and other supplies into an amphibian vehicle the small team worked around the clock and completed the project in a record time of just 38 days the new machine rolled into the light of day and everyone was in awe at the strange looking vehicle that some gis began calling the duck it didn t really have an official name as it was introduced using the gmc code letters dukw which stands for d the 1942 production series u for utility k for front wheel drive and w for rear axles the duck endearment however stuck the first of its kind the duck was the first of its kind it followed most of the gmc cckw designs and components with the additional watertight hull and a propeller to make it traverse ashore and float on water respectively it was powered by a gmc model 270 straight six engine that generated up to 91 horsepower it measured 31 ft long 8 ft 3 in wide and 7 ft 2 in high with the folding canvas top down and 8 ft 9 in high with the top up it weighed 5 900 kg empty and carried up to 24 troops on the road the duck can operate up to 80 km h while on the water it can propel up to 5 5 knots or 10 2 km h if holes breached its thin hull a high capacity bilge pump system would keep the duck afloat overall the dukw was a phenomenal piece of mechanical equipment but the military remained skeptical about the usefulness of the amphibious vehicle they weren t sure if it could do its job especially under the immense pressure on the battlefield the production of the dukw however pushed through but was only limited to 200 units with most of them kept away in storage proving its seaworthiness how can one know one s limits if not tested amirite i d like to think stephens thought the same too because in a last ditch effort to keep the dukw project afloat to prove to the military that the duck has what it takes to be in combat he asked to demonstrate and test its capabilities in a series of trials located off the new england coast by a stroke of luck a violent storm hit the area days before the trials commenced that wrecked a coast guard vessel on a sandbar offshore the incident may have been unfortunate for the stranded crew but it was the opportunity duck needed to prove its seaworthiness when all rescue attempts failed the dukw was given a chance to save the stranded men surprising everyone that it actually did all seven of the crew were rescued hours before the wreck vanished senior military chiefs who initially snubbed the amphibious vehicle now wanted to commission it even then president franklin d roosevelt was impressed and stephens couldn t be happier the once thought ugly duckling previously expected to become either a lame duck a sitting duck or a dead duck finally received the spotlight it deserved additional vehicle production ensued increasing the stocks to over 2 000 quack corp assemble soon after the dukw was commissioned into the us marine corp special operating companies were formed dubbed the quack corp which led to confusion in the ranks i would too because what the heck are ducks doing in the corp the unit would be designated and responsible for operating manning and maintaining the amphibious vehicle spending five weeks training before it was shipped to war to ensure that the drivers and the assisting crew would be as versatile as the dukw while in training the marines learned and familiarized the ropes around operating the vehicle including its gadgets and emergency toolkit did you know it can haul itself out if stuck on sand without towing pretty cool right throughout the training they also discovered weaknesses that were quickly resolved the tires needed a specific amount of pressure for different types of surfaces at first a crew had to make manual adjustments but it was soon upgraded allowing the driver to remotely adjust the tire pressure from inside the cab for hard surfaces such as roads the tires need to be fully inflated while less air was applied when transiting over softer surfaces like the beach sand adding versatility to the vehicle this feature would soon become a standard on many military vehicles even today british army adored the beloved duck too as soon as it was introduced to them and had immense respect for the ingenious vehicle doubts surrounding the combat capability of the dukw were further squashed when it had proven its usefulness and effectiveness in the guadalcanal campaign in the asiatic pacific theater in 1942 in the invasion of sicily operation husky in 1943 and most prominently on the d day beaches of normandy in 1944 the duck successfully delivered supplies to the troop and at some point repurposed as an ambulance for wounded men ferrying them directly into hospital ships without having to unload and load them a couple of times like its counterparts a prolonged service a long lasting impact after the war several dukws remained in service while the others were transferred to a couple of civilian organizations usually rescue units like the police and fire departments the us army reactivated more than a hundred ducks back to service when the korean war broke out it deployed to deliver supplies onshore and ferried troops during amphibious assaults finally in 2012 the ducks were honorably retired entirely in service and replaced by newer more sophisticated amphibian vehicles capable of retaliation with outfitted powerful armaments nevertheless it remained serving as a tour bus for some tourists company steering through harbors and river cities across the globe you can watch the full documentary about the dukw below

good morning and thank you gurbir for that kind introduction i am pleased to join you for the first sec speaks conference to be conducted in person since the start of the pandemic during the past two and a half years we have used new methods to communicate and work with each other our ability to improvise adapt and overcome has allowed our economy to sustain itself during this period importantly robust and efficient capital markets have played a key role in fostering innovation and creativity which has resulted in new services and products to address the challenges of the pandemic while i have attended sec speaks in the past today is the first where i have the privilege of addressing you with this appearance coming slightly over two months since i was sworn into office as a commissioner it is an opportune time to describe the factors and principles that will guide how i will approach upcoming policy decisions my views have been shaped by my professional experience for nearly nine years i was in private practice drafting securities offering disclosures as well as preparing periodic reports and proxy statements as a state securities regulator i witnessed some of the most egregious retail level frauds and their impact on investors but i also observed firsthand inspiring stories of entrepreneurs seeking capital for nearly 16 years at the commission i have been involved in rulemaking ensuring that such efforts complied with the administrative procedure act including a robust consideration of all public comments and a comprehensive economic analysis the sec s tripartite mission is my foundation maintaining a focus on investor protection capital formation and fair and orderly markets will promote high quality regulatory standards although capital markets have grown increasingly complex our mission remains the same as it did when the sec was first created ferdinand pecora an early architect of the sec put the following question to the convention of the farmers union of iowa while speaking in 1934 hat are the objectives of the securities act of 1933 his response was o see it that those who issue securities and offer them for sale to the public shall first tell the truth and the whole truth to the public with respect to these securities this observation remains true today and should guide our regulatory responses through both calm and turbulent markets prioritize effective and cost efficient regulations i analyze regulations using a two by two matrix one axis is labeled whether a regulation is effective or ineffective the other axis is labeled whether a regulation is costly or not costly thus one can categorize a regulation into one of four boxes the commission and any regulator should strive for regulations that are effective and not costly this box contains regulations that address the identified problem and do so at the lowest possible cost the second box contains regulations that are effective but costly these regulations may resolve the identified problem but at a significant cost the goal of a responsible regulator should be to modify these types of regulations and shift them to the first box a solid economic analysis can enable a regulator to distinguish between approaches that are effective and efficient on the one hand and effective but costly on the other the third box contains regulations that are ineffective but not costly given the thousands of pages of sec rules contained in the code of federal regulations many of which have not been scrutinized for effectiveness for decades i fear that a large number may fall within this box however as the rules are not particularly costly from a compliance perspective further reform or removal may not be at the top of the regulatory agenda that brings us to the final box regulations that are ineffective and costly these rules must be avoided the ultimate cost of such rules falls not on wall street or corporations but on investors and the public more importantly investors and the public will still remain vulnerable to the very concern that such rules were intended to address as i evaluate the proposals on the commission s regulatory agenda and the various choices presented thereunder this two by two matrix will frame my analysis limited scope and regulator independence financial regulators including the sec the commodity futures trading commission and the federal trade commission have a unique place in our constitutional structure although part of the executive branch they are not subject to direct control by the president in the same manner as the department of justice the department of labor or the department of commerce the commission is structurally designed to promote regulation that is the product of consideration by five individuals with different perspectives the underlying statute that created the commission requires that the commissioners come from different political parties with no more than three being from the same party i view this arrangement as creating a basic bargain that the sec will enjoy a degree of independence and insulation from political accountability to the voters but in return will have a narrow scope of responsibilities the lack of political accountability however can make it tempting to use the federal securities laws to alter or influence general business conduct or to resolve pressing societal concerns in the absence of financial materiality taken to an extreme everything everywhere is securities fraud i disagree with that view the commission best serves the american public when it works within the statutory framework enacted by congress and the limitations imposed by the courts the commission is not well suited nor should it attempt to resolve complex societal questions that do not relate to financial market practices those questions are best addressed by the legislature economic analysis is important and should consider the effects of multiple overlapping rule proposals final rules should result from careful and thoughtful analysis including sufficient time for the public to comment on a proposal the commission should ensure that rulemakings consider all known economic impacts including the cumulative impact of concurrent rulemakings while individual regulations may not be costly when aggregated they may impose significant compliance costs for firms and individuals the commission staff s guidance on economic analysis sheds light on how to carry out this exercise that guidance states that an economic analysis compares the current state of the world including the problem that the rule is designed to address to the expected state of the world with the proposed regulation or regulatory alternatives in effect the guidance further states that proposing releases should include a discussion of any existing studies or data that bear on the proposal so that the public knows what studies or data we are relying on can comment on it and can provide additional data relevant to the topic this is an important component of the rulemaking process and one that should underpin our decision making don t take steps that deter robust public comment several rulemaking proposals issued by the commission in 2021 and in early 2022 had a comment deadline of only 30 days after publication in the federal register which i view as insufficient under the circumstances the 30 day comment period stands in contrast to executive orders issued by the administrations of president clinton president obama and president biden all of which recognized the importance of a 60 day comment period a comment period of at least 60 days is also endorsed by the administrative conference of the united states for significant regulatory actions the commission recently finalized a proposal that had a short 30 day comment period in that case the commission proposed amendments on november 18 2021 and comments were due by december 27 of that year this period overlapped with major holidays it also fell during the first holiday season since the rollout of covid vaccines which allowed families to gather for the first time since the start of the pandemic the short comment period likely deterred some interested persons from submitting comment letters it may have also resulted in the commission seeing a narrower picture of the public concerns and failing to capture relevant data and perspectives short comment periods are also inappropriate when the commission is asking for public comment on multiple proposals affecting the same stakeholders at the same time or in short order don t take rulemaking shortcuts as a rulemaking convention staff practice has been generally to recommend re proposal if more than five years have elapsed since the original proposal yet the commission has instead recently decided to simply reopen the comment period for several proposals that were past the five year expiration date these reopening notices went even further and introduced new regulatory alternatives the reopening notices however did not provide any accompanying economic analysis or examine the effects that such alternatives may have on smaller entities in other words the commission used procedural shortcuts that undercut the robust notice and comment process required by the administrative procedure act one example was the proposal to implement the dodd frank act s pay versus performance requirement initially issued on april 29 2015 on january 27 2022 the commission reopened the comment period on the proposed rule the reopening notice did not update any economic analysis benefits and costs discussion or analysis required by the paperwork reduction act and the regulatory flexibility act the failure to update the economic analysis from the 2015 proposal was problematic because significant parts of the data justifying the original proposal were from 2010 and 2012 while other data was from the period between 1997 2008 yet the adopting release contained an economic analysis using data from 2020 one that the public had never seen or been given the chance to comment on avoid issuing new interpretations through enforcement actions rulemaking can be challenging and time consuming it may be tempting to develop new interpretations of existing statutes and rules and apply them through enforcement action this temptation should be avoided one significant shortcoming of regulation by enforcement is that it fails to provide a mechanism for the commission to consider the views by market participants which can result in a myopic approach in contrast through the rulemaking process the public can provide their perspectives on market practices and developments leading to an informed regulatory response regulation through litigation fails to provide these important inputs that result in better crafted rules additionally regulation by enforcement fails to provide the nuanced and comprehensive guidance that allows market participants to tailor their practices and instead requires regulated entities to divine how the facts and circumstances of another case apply to their own business model market participants should be able to look to the commission s rules rather than compare how their particular facts and circumstances may differ from those in a specific enforcement case this principle while often requiring a longer timeline and more deliberation often results in a more transparent and understandable regulatory framework be willing to tackle the big difficult and complex issues today one big difficult and complex issue that is conspicuously absent from the commission s published regulatory agenda is how to regulate crypto assets and related services market participants have expressed significant concerns regarding the lack of regulatory guidance in this space there is a widespread concern that the lack of predictability with regard to our regulation may encourage crypto firms to relocate to other jurisdictions there are two major issues and areas of uncertainty does the crypto asset constitute a security and if so how do market participants comply with the federal securities laws and the commission s rules to date the commission s views in this space have been more often expressed through enforcement action this is an example of a situation where regulation through enforcement does not yield the outcomes achievable through a process that involves public comment without the benefit of comments from crypto investors and other market participants the commission is unable to consider their perspectives in developing an appropriate regulatory framework to the extent that crypto assets raise unique issues not otherwise addressed in the current rule book the commission should consider proposing rules or issuing interpretive releases thank you for listening to my thoughts this morning even if you will not be receiving cle credit for it i want to acknowledge the many hard working members of the sec staff who have contributed to the presentations and materials for this conference it has been a privilege and an honor to call them colleagues and friends i have seen firsthand their dedication to serve the public by creating robust dynamic and resilient markets that work for all americans

thank you all so much for being here today and to david and the brookings institution for hosting me it has been a little more than six months since russia began its brutal and unprovoked invasion of ukraine the most significant threat in generations to the post world war ii international order over those six months we have worked with our allies and partners to mount an unprecedented global response to help end russia s unjustified aggression as part of our overarching strategy to end russia s invasion we have deployed sanctions with two primary objectives in mind to deny putin revenue to pursue his war of choice and to erode russia s ability to wage war going forward by disrupting the critical supply chains feeding russia s military industrial complex according to independent academic analysis at yale russia s imports have collapsed by as much as half domestic production has been hammered due to shortages of key inputs and foreign companies accounting for 40 of russian gdp have left the country moreover our sanctions and export controls targeting their military industrial complex have denied russia access to critical equipment and imports degrading their military capabilities in ways we re already seeing on the battlefield with russia increasingly reliant on outdated soviet era weapons without access to the chips needed to replenish their stocks of modern munitions however there is one part of the russian economy doing even better than when the war began their oil industry this summer russia received prices 60 percent higher than last year for its energy exports more than offsetting the decline in its export volumes this situation is unacceptable to us to our allies and to the people of ukraine but this situation is also complicated consumers and businesses in the u s and around the world are already facing elevated energy prices simply banning or sanctioning purchases of russian oil might deny russia some revenue but it would have the perverse effect of sharply increasing global consumers cost of living and increasing the risk of a global recession it is important to remember that the united states and a number of our g7 allies have already banned the import of russian oil into our countries the impact of further actions to prevent the export of russian oil to other countries would disproportionately fall on the low and middle income countries still buying it these countries are already facing high energy and food prices due to russia s unprovoked invasion of ukraine we know that economic instability in low income countries often leads to political instability and the last thing we want is for additional countries to be destabilized by russia s actions and more broadly we know that ensuring the continued flow of as much oil as possible onto the global market is critical to reducing prices in our country and around the world that is why last friday the g7 finance ministers agreed to finalize and implement an innovative policy that puts downward pressure on global energy costs by allowing russian oil to continue to flow onto the global market while reducing russian revenue a price cap on russian oil today i d like to share why we think the price cap is so critical explain how it will work and dispel a few myths we ve heard along the way let s start with how it will work in june the eu agreed to a sixth package of sanctions that will ban not only imports of seaborne russian oil in the eu but as of december 5th will also ban the provision of associated maritime services like insurance trade finance banking brokering and navigation services by companies in the eu to those associated with russia s seaborne export of crude oil regardless of where those shipments are headed these maritime services are often essential in many cases seaborne oil shipments cannot be made without them critically the providers of some of these services are heavily concentrated in the eu and g7 countries for example the eu and g7 provide 90 of global shipping insurance and they provide the majority of financing and payments services for the oil trade one potential byproduct of this package could be a substantial shut in of russian production of oil and refined product and associated elevated prices which could limit or reverse the intentions of the action this price increase would undermine the well intentioned goal of limiting russia s revenue from oil sales while imposing an additional and unintentional burden on global consumers of oil the price cap is designed to address this outcome by creating a carveout for services related to the seaborne transport of russian oil that is sold at or below the cap level keeping this oil on the market and flowing to consumers who need it but still restricting russian revenue countries outside the g7 can keep buying russian oil and companies in the g7 can continue to offer services to support those sales as long as the oil these services support is purchased at or below a certain price and in particular some of the most vulnerable countries in the world low and middle income oil importers will benefit most from access to this lower priced oil when it comes to implementation two critical pieces are compliance and enforcement how market participants know oil is coming from russia and therefore needs to be priced below the cap and how we deter and punish evasion and knowing violations on compliance we re working with the g7 to develop a robust but simple documentation and attestation system that can give service providers comfort that they are complying appropriately on enforcement those that evade the price cap by falsifying documentation or otherwise hiding the true origin or price of the oil would face consequences under the domestic law of jurisdictions implementing the price cap our approach to implementation is guided by the principle that russian oil should continue to reach the global market provided purchasers and service providers abide by the price cap in good faith that is why today to offer greater clarity to the market and help achieve this objective i am announcing that treasury s office of foreign assets control is issuing preliminary guidance on how this compliance system will work ofac will follow up with additional formal guidance in the coming weeks to help ensure these compliance expectations are sufficiently clear to facilitate the flow of russian oil this action helps formalize the united states commitment to implementing the price cap finally from a technical perspective one of the questions i ve heard most often is how the price will be set and this relates closely to a common objection i ve heard that russia will not sell oil at or below the cap and instead will simply refuse to export the way the cap is set is the reason we think that won t happen russia may bluster and say they won t sell below the capped price but the economics of holding back oil just don t make sense the price cap creates a clear economic incentive to sell under the cap we intend to set the price cap above russia s marginal cost of production at a level consistent with prices they have historically accepted russia doesn t have much storage capacity for oil and many of its wells and equipment are far from state of the art which makes it hard for them to stop and later restart production without incurring significant costs and that problem is only going to get worse as our sanctions continue to deny them access to critical software and drilling equipment as a result russia will be forced to continue selling or risk long term degradation of its capacity to produce that leaves quite a bit of room below both prevailing market prices and the price russia is receiving today it means we have an opportunity to deny russia the revenue to pursue its unconscionable war while lowering some of the economic pressure countries around the world are feeling russia knows that and it s why they are already responding to those clear economic incentives they are already offering long term contracts to potential buyers at steep discounts of 30 or more far in advance of the price cap s implementation the fact that they are doing this reveals how worried they are and shows how the price cap is already working to drive down russia s revenues we view this as one of the policy s key features that it can achieve its objectives even if some buyers choose not to formally join because they also want to pay lower prices for russian oil the price cap gives them greater price transparency and leverage when they negotiate with russia so even if russia tries to get around the cap with buyers outside our coalition their revenue will still be driven down as we re already seeing we are clear eyed that russia can go find service providers outside the g7 and the other members of our coalition to replace the maritime services blocked by the eu ban but these alternative services will be expensive and less reliable than the services provided by g7 firms there is a reason the world relies on eu and g7 firms for the vast majority of these services building up a services ecosystem outside the coalition will cost russia more money which will help reduce the kremlin s revenues even more let me conclude by taking a step back from the details we are moving forward with this extraordinary proposal because it is essential that the global community take steps to deny the kremlin the revenue it is using to prop up its economy and fight its unjustifiable war in ukraine the price cap seeks to create incentives that reduce russia s revenues while its oil continues to flow the bottom line is that everyone wins but the kremlin this is not an academic conversation we face the largest ground invasion in europe since the end of world war ii one being perpetrated by a regime that will not be easily deterred it is critical that we take this step to deny russia the revenue they are using to pursue this brutal invasion while continuing our efforts to disrupt their critical supply chains and degrade their military industrial complex we look forward to your advice on implementation as we move forward with this policy thank you again for being here i ll turn it back to david to introduce a panel where you ll hear more on this from my colleague ben harris

a new study conducted by scientists at the university of colorado confirms that the covid 19 vaccines have been shedding and transmitting antibodies to those who chose to avoid the injection via aerosols these findings should not come as a surprise though because a confidential pfizer document had already confirmed that exposure to the mrna injections was perfectly possible by skin to skin contact and breathing the same air as someone who had been given the covid 19 jab this means that the vast majority of humanity has had absolutely no choice in the matter of whether they wish to get the covid 19 injection

if the rule isn t that anything goes with enough votes what is it experienced entrepreneurs and investors alike understand that equity dilution is a fundamental aspect of investing in corporations this is especially true when companies anticipate needing additional capital prior to their prospective profitability but investors do not always trust management to act fairly and wisely when they sell additional stock or restructure shareholder rights this is the first part in a series of blogs focusing on modifications to corporate capital in equity financings in this first part i evaluate the law applicable to charter amendments in both texas and delaware as many readers know delaware is the leading u s jurisdiction for domiciling corporations and has a highly developed body of corporate decisional law texas does not benefit from the same depth or breadth of case law accordingly texas courts like those of other states frequently look to delaware precedent when making determinations in connection with texas corporate law nevertheless both statutory and judge made law in texas and delaware are different in important aspects charter amendments equity financings often require charter amendments to modify corporate capital this could be for a variety of reasons a team of founders may have issued all of the corporation s authorized capital alternatively an investor may have required that the charter limit authorized capital to existing holdings in another scenario investors may have sought anti dilution protection by demanding the insertion of certain preferred rights in the corporate charter these rights might include agreed ratios for converting their preferred stock to common stock upon an ipo or other event with the conversion ratios protected by adjustments for certain dilutive stock issuances because unreasonably restricting changes to capital structure can hamstring corporations in desperate need of capital and change these provisions are subject to amendment but what laws govern the amendment of corporate charters if they are essentially contracts as maintained by delaware courts who gets to modify the contract if not everyone agrees delaware corporate statute section 242 of the delaware general corporation law dgcl authorizes corporations to amend the structure of equity ownership established in their charters to recapitalize upon approval of a simple majority in relevant part section 242 a of the delaware general corporation law dgcl allows amendments to increase or decrease its authorized capital stock or to reclassify the same by changing the number par value designations preferences or relative participating optional or other special rights of the shares or the qualifications limitations or restrictions of such rights or by changing shares with par value into shares without par value or shares without par value into shares with par value either with or without increasing or decreasing the number of shares or by subdividing or combining the outstanding shares of any class or series of a class of shares into a greater or lesser number of outstanding shares further delaware law provides that measures affecting a class or series must be approved by a majority of the affected class or series dgcl 242 b 2 texas corporate statutes texas law qualifies charter amendments as fundamental transactions which require approval of two thirds of shareholders entitled to vote except in limited circumstances tex bus org code 21 364 1 see tex bus org code 21 053 if a charter sets forth separate classes or series of shares approval of an amendment that would affect the charter s capital or the rights of any class or series requires approval by each separate class or series tex bus org code 21 364 d in contrast to delaware for class approval of an amendment and any other fundamental transaction texas requires approval by at least two thirds of the voting shares of the class or series tex bus org code 21 364 c no breach of contract claim for an appropriately approved charter amendment delaware courts have held that by virtue of statutory authorization corporations are contractually authorized to restructure their capital by amending their charters see hartford a i co v w s dickey c m co 24 a 2d 315 del 1942 similarly section 21 051 of the texas business organizations code states that shareholder of a corporation does not have a vested property right resulting from the certificate of formation including a provision relating to the management control capital structure dividend entitlement purpose or duration of the corporation but this begs a question is any validly approved charter amendment affecting corporate capital lawful just because it is authorized by statute what can i do if a corporate action impairs or permits dilution of my voting rights or economic ownership imagine a corporation in need of capital whose charter offers significant anti dilution protections to preferred investors to reward investors willing to provide capital and to create pressure on others a corporation amends its charter to allow for a pay to play system under such a system any investor that declines or is denied the right to participate in a future equity financing would see her percentage of equity in the company diluted including voting and economic rights if a fair price or better is paid for the share existing stockholders will see their share value stay the same or increase if lower than fair value is paid share value will be impaired in such circumstances is there anything a diluted shareholder can do to challenge this type of action or will they be relegated to shouting we re not gonna take it as they re shoved down the front steps of the courthouse i found the answer somewhat surprising it depends perhaps after years in this profession i should not have haha twice testing of corporate actions in the words of delaware courts corporate actions are twice tested see e g carsanaro v bloodhound techs inc 65 a 3d 618 641 del ch 2013 in both delaware and texas in addition to being subject to review under principles of law i e for statutory and contractual compliance courts review corporate actions under principles of equity review for compliance with principles of equity equates to scrutiny of director actions for breach of fiduciary duty although the law of contract does not supply a method for challenging charter amendments that are approved consistent with statutory requirements suits for breach of fiduciary duty can sometimes provide a remedy when actions are taken that dilute shareholder equity whether a remedy will be provided depends on a silent factor and principally on two stated factors 1 whether the board is independent of the stockholders participating in the transaction and 2 whether the transaction is fair the silent factor the finder of fact fairness and independence are fair and independent in the eye of the beholder absent an arbitration clause in delaware this means a judge specialized in corporate matters in texas it means a jury unless the parties waive their right to a jury trial or they have contractually agreed to a bench trial the next post in this series will address under both delaware and texas law the scope of fiduciary duties owed to common and preferred shareholders by corporate directors and certain shareholders later posts will address potential shareholder claims for breach of fiduciary duty standards of review applied to evaluating shareholder claims in different context and actions

bulgaria marks an unprecedented growth in the global ranking of economic freedom the country ranks 23rd out of 165 countries and territories included in the economic freedom around the world 2022 study published yesterday by the market economy institute in association with canada s fraser institute this year s edition is based on 2020 data the latest internationally comparable data for all countries for another year hong kong and singapore topped the ranking followed by switzerland new zealand denmark australia usa estonia mauritius and ireland at the bottom are venezuela sudan and zimbabwe where is bulgaria and why is it so far ahead the study ranked bulgaria in 23rd place among the freest countries but the assessment of economic freedom in the country is actually decreasing the result of bulgaria is 7 69 points out of the maximum 10 points which is a decrease of 0 10 points compared to last year the reason for bulgaria s rise in the ranking by as many as 8 positions is actually the deterioration of freedom in a number of countries the average result of the countries of the world marked a record collapse in 2020 it was 0 16 points lower than in 2019 this erases a decade of growth and increased economic freedom around the world and the decline is more than three times greater than that reported in the immediate aftermath of the 2008 2009 financial crisis thus the covid 19 pandemic is becoming the biggest catastrophe for economic freedom on a global scale however this is precisely what allows bulgaria to overtake many countries while in 2020 most of the other member countries significantly increase transfers and subsidies take on new debts and print money in bulgaria these negatives are delayed and on a relatively limited scale compensations are relatively few measures are relatively loose a comparison of the most crisis affected components of the index shows the large decrease in results in european countries austria loses half a point due to increased redistribution and subsidies in the country spain loses a quarter of a point for stable money on falling stocks and money printing portugal loses almost a full point because of the increase in its public debt where bulgaria really performs well apart from the improvement in the ranking due to the deterioration of other countries bulgaria has some anchors that have consistently provided stability over the years and actually show high marks and a good place in the ranking of the index these are low income taxation flat tax stable money currency board low tariffs eu membership free credit a large number of banks long term policies for growth and prosperity that the institute for market economy has defended since its inception what are the problems in the weakest category for bulgaria legal system and property rights there is no improvement the result is 5 96 points or 0 02 points more than last year s edition despite the low base the country s performance is particularly poor in the impartiality of the courts trust in the police and protection of property rights all with less than 5 points thus while in the other member countries the scores are around 8 points bulgaria s result is close to that of countries such as uruguay bhutan mongolia india a weak legal system and protection of property rights hinders investment entrepreneurship and long term economic development and this cannot be compensated for and overcome by better achievements in other measures of freedom other such factors which are not visible from the result of bulgaria in the index and not only in this one are the formal implementation of legislation and the large regional differences in a number of components the index takes into account the provisions in the normative acts rather than actually whether and how they are implemented especially in the category reporting regulations this is particularly pernicious when corruption is widespread illegal regimes are in place there is dominance of one employer institutions do not work and courts do not act as a corrective to other authorities to ensure justice why freedom is important again this year the index examines the relationship between freedom and various aspects of economic and social life and illustrates the differences in development between the freest of countries 42 countries and the least free 40 countries the gross domestic product per capita is 7 times higher the income of the poorest 10 of the population is more than 8 times higher life expectancy is 15 years higher child mortality is 10 times lower the poverty level from much lower the proportion of children enrolled in school is much higher people in free countries consider themselves happier follow on and write to us at copyright c novinite com published with permission via big news network news agency

bloomberg inflation will fall back down to the federal reserve s 2 target by early 2025 the san francisco fed said in a research note friday price increases which reached a four decade high this year are moderating and will continue to do so as the us central bank raises interest rates sylvain leduc research director at the san francisco fed wrote in a note the decline in inflation is expected to be gradual reflecting the typical persistence in services inflation and lags in the effects of monetary policy leduc wrote overall we expect inflation to be back at 2 by the beginning of 2025 price pressures from both goods and services consumption are each already moderating leduc wrote while the run up in housing prices which led to an increase in rent costs has cooled recently the persistent gains will continue to weigh on inflation the fed has been aggressively raising interest rates this year including 75 basis point increases in june and july with a third such hike seen possible at its meeting this month policy makers have said their no 1 priority is bringing inflation which reached 6 8 in june according to the fed s preferred benchmark back down to 2 fed chair jerome powell has said the central bank s cooling of the economy will likely bring some pain but may not tip the economy into a recession some economists have been skeptical of the fed s ability to execute this so called soft landing financial markets do not fully appear to anticipate a recession in the near future although the risk has clearly risen leduc wrote updates with inflation data in fifth paragraph 2022 bloomberg l p

a new study conducted by scientists at the university of colorado confirms that the covid 19 vaccines have been shedding and transmitting antibodies to those who chose to avoid the injection via aerosols these findings should not come as a surprise though because a confidential pfizer document had already confirmed that exposure to the mrna injections was perfectly possible by skin to skin contact and breathing the same air as someone who had been given the covid 19 jab this means that the vast majority of humanity has had absolutely no choice in the matter of whether they wish to get the covid 19 injection
by michael i have been hearing from so many people that have a really bad feeling about what the months ahead will bring global events are starting to spiral out of control and it has become exceedingly clear that we are rapidly moving into extremely challenging times in the past we would always talk about famine war and pestilence in hypothetical terms but now they have become clear and present dangers for weeks i have been warning that the period of relative stability that we have been enjoying this summer would soon be over the fall is almost here and winter is coming of course the difficulties that we will be facing as 2022 rolls into 2023 will just be the beginning of our problems the years in front of us aren t going to look anything like the years that we have just been through and many will be absolutely shocked by how fast conditions change today i went to the grocery store and i was horrified by how much prices have risen but these prices will look like bargains six months from now as i have carefully been documenting we are in the beginning stages of the worst global food crisis that any of us have ever seen right now crops are being devastated by endless drought all over the globe china is currently experiencing the worst drought that it has witnessed in recorded history the western half of the u s is in the midst of the worst multi year megadrought in 1 200 years and europe is enduring the worst drought that it has been through in at least 500 years agricultural production is going to be way down all over europe in 2022 and now the energy crisis is threatening crops that have actually been grown successfully that is because putting harvested vegetables in cold storage is no longer profitable because of how insanely high energy prices have become for example norwegian vegetable farmer per odd gjestvang is leaving tons of leeks in the field to die because it simply costs too much to store them as he normally does around 29 tonnes of leeks are lost it has a gross value of around 700 000 this is madness this is food that should have been harvested and taken care of says gjestvang on the farm the family grows around 3 000 tonnes of vegetables each growing season the leeks had normally been taken to cold storage so that they would be found in norwegian vegetable counters this winter but the calculation simply does not add up for the farmer with today s electricity prices gjestvang does not see it as financially sound to spend money on storing the vegetables in that case it will be a purely loss making project he believes so tons and tons of good vegetables will rot instead of showing up in the stores in the months ahead gjestvang knows that this is a tremendous waste but he just can t afford to pay 16 times as much for cooling than he did last year in the high season gjestvang uses around 80 000 kilowatt hours a month for cooling previously gjestvang paid around 24 000 for electricity per month now the price is almost 16 times as high the way the market is now with a cautiously high electricity price of nok five it will be nok 400 000 it is not possible to achieve he says this is happening all over europe if europeans think that vegetable prices are high now just wait until we get into early 2023 meanwhile crops are failing here in the united states on a widespread basis the following comes from the washington post it was a bad year for corn and for tomatoes and for many other american crops farmers agricultural economists and others taking stock of this summer s growing season say drought conditions and extreme weather have wreaked havoc on many row crops fruits and vegetables with the american farm bureau federation suggesting yields could be down by as much as a third compared with last year if yields really are down by as much as a third what do you think that will do to food prices it doesn t take a genius to answer that question we are primarily funded by readers please subscribe and donate to support us a global food crisis is here and there is no short term hope on the horizon in fact one un official is now projecting that total global grain production could be down another 40 percent in 2023 due to elevated fertilizer prices more than six months into the russian invasion of ukraine the global fertilizer crunch threatens to starve a planet as prices are too high for some farmers ahead of the next planting season that s the view of maximo torero chief economist from the food agriculture organization fao of the united nations un who told bloomberg tv that elevated fertilizer prices could decrease global grain production by upwards of 40 in the next planting season if that actually happened it would be catastrophic the one thing that would really help is if the war in ukraine ended that would definitely stabilize global energy prices and give us a chance to start digging our way out of this mess unfortunately that isn t going to happen instead of trying to find a way to achieve peace with russia the biden administration continues to escalate matters the biden administration is arming ukraine with weapons that can do serious damage to russian forces and unlike early in the war u s officials don t appear worried about moscow s reaction in the past several months washington has detailed tranches of new drones harder hitting missiles and deadly rocket systems as part of billions of dollars pledged to the former soviet country the clear support is a far cry from the early days of the war when the u s government seemed hesitant to list exactly what was being sent into ukraine so as not to tip off or draw the ire of moscow all of this assistance is starting to really help on the battlefield in recent days a counter offensive in the kharkiv area has had great success apparently a very large number of foreign fighters under the umbrella of the international legion of ukraine are involved in this counter offensive but the russians suspect that a lot of these foreign fighters are actually special operations personnel from the united states the uk and other nato countries if that is true the war in ukraine has now gone to an entirely new and dangerous level of course the russians continue to escalate matters as well cutting off the flow of gas to europe through the nord stream 1 pipeline was a very aggressive move and now europe is facing a winter in which large segments of the economy literally shut down for the foreseeable future in addition energy prices have reached a level that threatens the existence of many companies just this week german toilet paper company hakle filed for bankruptcy with the owners citing unsustainable energy and material costs as the primary factor meanwhile the wall street journal reports that europe s steel industry which requires massive amounts of cheap natural gas to run is slashing production and facing severe financial headwinds other sectors such as chemical production agriculture and automating are all facing unprecedented hurdles as the energy crisis continues to grip europe cries for help from the once booming german economy are now coming from business leaders associations and consumers with the federation of german industries bdi also warning of a wave of bankruptcies due to energy cost inflation a new analysis by the bdi states that this is a major challenge for 58 percent of companies and 34 percent believe the current crisis represents a matter of survival germany is no exception either with warning from the united kingdom showing that six in ten manufacturing companies face the risk of closure due to the energy crisis the fall of the european economy has arrived and the winter that follows is going to be extraordinarily painful of course the u s economy is headed for major league problems as well we are facing a massive global food crisis a massive global energy crisis a massive global inflation crisis and a war with russia all at the same time and to be honest what we have been through so far is just the very small tip of a very large iceberg decades of incredibly bad decisions have brought us to this point and our leaders continue to make even more incredibly bad decisions so buckle up because the ride ahead is going to be extremely unpleasant

mediated disease that substantially impairs patients physical health quality of life and work productivity 7 psoriasis is a serious global problem with at least 100 million people worldwide impacted by some form of the disease 8 including approximately 7 5 million people in the u s 3 nearly one quarter of people with psoriasis have cases that are considered moderate to severe 3 up to 90 percent of patients with psoriasis have psoriasis vulgaris or plaque psoriasis 6 which is characterized by distinct round or oval plaques typically covered by silvery white scales about sotyktutm sotyktu deucravacitinib is a selective allosteric inhibitor of tyrosine kinase 2 tyk2 tyk2 is a member of the janus kinase jak family sotyktu binds to the regulatory domain of tyk2 stabilizing an inhibitory interaction between the regulatory and the catalytic domains of the enzyme this results in allosteric inhibition of receptor mediated activation of tyk2 and its downstream activation of signal transducers and activators of transcription stats as shown in cell based assays janus kinases function as pairs of homo or heterodimers in the jak stat pathways tyk2 pairs with jak1 to mediate multiple cytokine pathways and also pairs with jak2 to transmit signals as shown in cell based assays the precise mechanism linking inhibition of tyk2 enzyme to therapeutic effectiveness in the treatment of adults with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis is not currently known sotyktu is under regulatory review by the european medical association and other health authorities around the world for the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis and by japan s ministry of health labour and welfare for the treatment of adults with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis pustular psoriasis and erythrodermic psoriasis indication sotyktu deucravacitinib is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in adults who are candidates for systemic therapy or phototherapy limitations of use sotyktu is not recommended for use in combination with other potent immunosuppressants important safety information contraindications sotyktu is contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity reaction to deucravacitinib or to any of the excipients in sotyktu warnings and precautions hypersensitivity hypersensitivity reactions such as angioedema have been reported if a clinically significant hypersensitivity reaction occurs institute appropriate therapy and discontinue sotyktu infections sotyktu may increase the risk of infections serious infections have been reported in patients with psoriasis who received sotyktu the most common serious infections reported with sotyktu included pneumonia and covid 19 avoid use of sotyktu in patients with an active or serious infection consider the risks and benefits of treatment prior to initiating sotyktu in patients with chronic or recurrent infection who have been exposed to tuberculosis with a history of a serious or an opportunistic infection with underlying conditions that may predispose them to infection closely monitor patients for the development of signs and symptoms of infection during and after treatment a patient who develops a new infection during treatment should undergo prompt and complete diagnostic testing have appropriate antimicrobial therapy initiated and be closely monitored interrupt sotyktu if a patient develops a serious infection do not resume sotyktu until the infection resolves or is adequately treated viral reactivation herpes virus reactivation e g herpes zoster herpes simplex was reported in clinical trials with sotyktu through week 16 herpes simplex infections were reported in 17 patients 6 8 per 100 patient years treated with sotyktu and 1 patient 0 8 per 100 patient years treated with placebo multidermatomal herpes zoster was reported in an immunocompetent patient during pso 1 pso 2 and the open label extension trial the majority of patients who reported events of herpes zoster while receiving sotyktu were under 50 years of age the impact of sotyktu on chronic viral hepatitis reactivation is unknown consider viral hepatitis screening and monitoring for reactivation in accordance with clinical guidelines before starting and during therapy with sotyktu if signs of reactivation occur consult a hepatitis specialist sotyktu is not recommended for use in patients with active hepatitis b or hepatitis c tuberculosis tb in clinical trials of 4 patients with latent tb who were treated with sotyktu and received appropriate tb prophylaxis no patients developed active tb during the mean follow up of 34 weeks one patient who did not have latent tb developed active tb after receiving 54 weeks of sotyktu evaluate patients for latent and active tb infection prior to initiating treatment with sotyktu do not administer sotyktu to patients with active tb initiate treatment of latent tb prior to administering sotyktu consider anti tb therapy prior to initiation of sotyktu in patients with a past history of latent or active tb in whom an adequate course of treatment cannot be confirmed monitor patients for signs and symptoms of active tb during treatment malignancy including lymphomas malignancies including lymphomas were observed in clinical trials with sotyktu consider the benefits and risks for the individual patient prior to initiating or continuing therapy with sotyktu particularly in patients with a known malignancy other than a successfully treated non melanoma skin cancer and patients who develop a malignancy when on treatment with sotyktu rhabdomyolysis and elevated cpk treatment with sotyktu was associated with an increased incidence of asymptomatic creatine phosphokinase cpk elevation and rhabdomyolysis compared to placebo discontinue sotyktu if markedly elevated cpk levels occur or myopathy is diagnosed or suspected instruct patients to promptly report unexplained muscle pain tenderness or weakness particularly if accompanied by malaise or fever laboratory abnormalities treatment with sotyktu was associated with increases in triglyceride levels periodically evaluate serum triglycerides according to clinical guidelines during treatment sotyktu treatment was associated with an increase in the incidence of liver enzyme elevation compared to placebo evaluate liver enzymes at baseline and thereafter in patients with known or suspected liver disease according to routine management if treatment related increases in liver enzymes occur and drug induced liver injury is suspected interrupt sotyktu until a diagnosis of liver injury is excluded immunizations prior to initiating therapy with sotyktu consider completion of all age appropriate immunizations according to current immunization guidelines including prophylactic herpes zoster vaccination avoid use of live vaccines in patients treated with sotyktu the response to live or non live vaccines has not been evaluated potential risks related to jak inhibition it is not known whether tyrosine kinase 2 tyk2 inhibition may be associated with the observed or potential adverse reactions of janus kinase jak inhibition in a large randomized postmarketing safety trial of a jak inhibitor in rheumatoid arthritis ra patients 50 years of age and older with at least one cardiovascular risk factor higher rates of all cause mortality including sudden cardiovascular death major adverse cardiovascular events overall thrombosis deep venous thrombosis pulmonary embolism and malignancies excluding non melanoma

we first identified all firms registered with the sec in the country next we filtered out firms that don t offer financial planning services those that don t primarily serve individual clients and those that have disclosures on their record the qualifying firms were then ranked according to the following criteria aum firms with more total assets under management are ranked higher firms with more total assets under management are ranked higher individual client count firms that serve more individual clients as opposed to institutional clients are ranked higher firms that serve more individual clients as opposed to institutional clients are ranked higher clients per advisor firms with a lower ratio of clients per financial advisor are ranked higher firms with a lower ratio of clients per financial advisor are ranked higher years in business firms that have been in business longer are ranked higher firms that have been in business longer are ranked higher fee structure

relationship with smartasset in which smartasset is compensated for lead referrals such relationships have no impact on our rankings and firms are included and ranked based strictly on the above criteria smartasset is not a client of the aforementioned firms smartasset did not receive compensation for including any of the firms on the aforementioned list why work with an advisor we believe it s more important now than ever to review your retirement plan with a fiduciary financial advisor here s why the pandemic has shown us just how quickly decades of planning investing and saving can be completely upended this could mean your current financial plan might leave you without enough money to last your retirement additionally emotionally charged decisions to sell off large quantities of stocks or other investments now lock in your losses removing any chance for future growth research suggests people who work with a financial advisor feel more at ease about their finances and could end up with about 15 more money to spend in retirement 1 consider this example a recent vanguard study found that on average a hypothetical 500k investment would grow to over 3 4 million under the care of an advisor over 25 years whereas the expected value from self management would be 1 69 million or 50 less in other words an advisor managed portfolio would average 8 annualized growth over a 25 year period compared to 5 from a self managed portfolio 2 a 2020 northwestern mutual study found that 71 of u s adults admit their financial planning needs improvement however only 29 of americans work with a financial advisor 3 assuming 5 annualized growth of 500k portfolio vs 8 annualized growth of advisor managed portfolio over 25 years the hypothetical study discussed above assumes a 5 net return and a 3 net annual value add for professional financial advice to performance based on the vanguard whitepaper putting a value on your value quantifying vanguard advisor s alpha please carefully review the methodologies employed in the vanguard whitepaper to receive a copy of the whitepaper please contact compliance smartasset com the value of professional investment advice is only

the land that jim scala and his family have been ranching for three generations is parched and brown as far as he can see the pond where his cattle used to drink is now a puddle ringed with cracked mud in other years water pumped from the shasta river would have periodically flooded this land keeping his pasture alive and pond full but the state had ordered scala and other ranchers and farmers in rural siskiyou county to stop irrigating when the drought plagued river dipped below a certain level with bills mounting from trucking in water and buying hay to replace dead pasture and facing the prospect of selling half his herd scala and others made a decision to defy the state s order we said to hell with it scala said we re starting the pumps in a single day in mid august the shasta river s flows dropped by more than half and stayed there for a week which could jeopardize the salmon and other fish that spawn there klamath river tribes were outraged and california water regulators sounded the alarm the state water resources control board ordered the shasta river water association which serves roughly 110 farms and ranches in central siskiyou county to stop pumping fines would start at 500 per day but could rise to 10 000 after a 20 day waiting period or a hearing the unlawful diversion sets a terrible precedent that irrigators can egregiously violate state water rights and impact listed and tribal trust species said jim simondet klamath branch chief for the national oceanic and atmospheric administration s fisheries division a week later on aug 24 scala and the other ranchers and growers turned the water pumps off we accomplished what we set out to do said rick lemos a fifth generation rancher who also is a board member of the rural water association we got relief for the cattle that were out of water and wading out in the mud and getting stuck he said one of his cows had died in the mud the weeklong standoff crystallized a warning from california water watchers the state has limited power to speedily intervene in urgent conflicts over water which are expected to flare across the state as drought squeezes water supplies for ranches farms tribes cities and fish this is about the shasta and it s about klamath salmon and it s about tribes in the klamath but this is really about can the state protect its water supplies or is it just going to be the wild west is it going to be every cowboy for himself said craig tucker a natural resources consultant for the karuk tribe the second largest native american tribe in california farmers open the floodgates scala is the president and lemos sits on the board of the shasta river water association a private non profit water distributor that operates in the heart of siskiyou county in the shadow of mount shasta in normal years the water association pumps from the shasta river from april to october sending the water through a network of canals to irrigate roughly 3 400 acres the county where locals have long chafed under sacramento s authority was primed for simmering tensions over water to boil over the dictatorial whims of the state water board has no authority to tell the people of siskiyou county what to do with their property they own u s congressman doug lamalfa a republican whose district includes the county said in an emailed statement this violates our constitutional guarantee against unlawful seizure i encourage anyone to stop voluntarily complying with government looters this has been the fourth driest year to date in a region where drought has been tightening its grip for years even in 2020 the local agricultural commissioner reported an increase in fallowed acres and limited irrigation that reduced yields wildfires have burned through rangeland and timber but agriculture too has taken its toll on water in the region warming the shasta river and degrading its water quality according to the shasta valley resource conservation district these changes impact key spawning and rearing grounds for fall run chinook salmon and threatened coho salmon other fish culturally important to tribes in the region such as steelhead and pacific lamprey rely on the river as well salmon runs have been declining for decades and few adult coho return every year noaa s simondet said fish he said are not doing fine the shasta river empties into the larger klamath a small source of its flow but an outsized producer of its fish can the state protect its water supplies or is it just going to be the wild west is it going to be every cowboy for himself craig tucker karuk tribe consultant in happy camp along the klamath river about 75 miles east from the pumps that the ranchers turned on karuk tribal council member arron troy hockaday has been watching the river and its salmon populations change over his lifetime if those fish are gone our people suffer those fish don t spawn our people suffer we live off that it s our culture said hockaday a fourth generation traditional fisherman hockaday has been dipping handmade nets into the rapids at somes bar to catch salmon since he was a child and worries that his grandson won t be able to continue the tradition there ain t going to be no fish for him to fish he s never going to learn how to catch fish and be a karuk tribal fisherman seeing the salmon populations decline even as water continues to flow through irrigation canals hurts it hurts so bad to see that hockaday said and then to put pain into my soul into our family into the river the farmers open the floodgates on the shasta river from his vantage point he said nobody gets into trouble for it bottom of form egregious and blatant disregard of emergency order last year the state water resources control board adopted emergency regulations that allow state regulators to curtail water users in the region when summertime flows in the shasta river drop below 50 cubic feet per second near yreka the aim is to protect salmon and trout species including steelhead fall run chinook and threatened coho salmon but the limit is fiercely contested by area ranchers who note that it s higher than the average historic flows in august since 1933 the shasta river water association petitioned in early august to continue diverting water to fill stock ponds for approximately 5 000 cattle plus calves and other assorted animals according to a copy of the petition the water board shared with calmatters the water board said the request was still under review lemos said the ranchers couldn t afford to wait how long do they review it while the cows are dying of thirst lemos said we didn t just fly off the handle and say hey we re going to break the law and get into a big mess we tried the other way first in a letter dated aug 17 the water association notified state regulators that they planned to violate the curtailment that day we were in a critical situation we have cattle out of water we have nowhere to move them you can t just get them in and sell them tomorrow lemos said so that s why we started diverting water the pumps rapidly sucked away river water dropping flows by more than half in a day state officials said it s an egregious and blatant disregard for the environment and for our regulations we are really really interested in taking some swift action because we do take this so seriously said julé rizzardo permitting and enforcement branch manager for the water board s division of water rights the board is still investigating and determining whether to seek fines we were in a critical situation we have cattle out of water so that s why we started diverting water rick lemos siskiyou county rancher it took only a day after flows began dropping for the agency to notify the water association that they had violated their curtailment and could face fines of up to 500 per day but under state law the ranchers had 20 days to respond and request a hearing only after the 20 days are up or a hearing has occurred can the water board adopt a final cease and desist order and raise the fines to 10 000 a day by then fall run chinook salmon would have been migrating through the river it s really unfortunate that we have those limitations rizzardo said felicia marcus a visiting fellow at stanford s water in the west program and former chair of the california water board was more blunt in theory the water board has a lot of authority to deal with illegal diversions in practice they have to do it blindfolded and with one hand tied behind their back california water law experts have been pushing for the water board to be granted more power to act swiftly jennifer harder a law professor at the university of the pacific s mcgeorge school of law urged california lawmakers to consider granting state water regulators the authority to temporarily pause water diversions and stem the damage in emergencies while still allowing due process similar efforts have failed in the past the bottom line is we live in a very different world than we lived in 20 30 40 years ago in terms of the immediacy of some of these threats harder said after receiving the board s notices scala lemos and the rest of the shasta river water association kept pumping the river s water for almost a week only regret i have is we didn t start earlier scala said on aug 24 with irrigation water running across his land we re going to lose the crop anyway we re going to have to pay a fine probably but later that day lemos said they shut off the pumps they had accomplished what they d set out to do he said we were going to fill our stock ponds and get some stock water and get things where we could survive and shut off lemos said and that s what we basically did the 20 day period before fines escalate had also factored into their discussions lemos said considering the costs of hay replanting desiccated pasture and selling off cows he said at 500 a day it would probably be worth it i ll be quite honest it d probably be more than affordable at 10 000 a day it wouldn t be lemos estimates he s bought around 50 000 worth of hay so far this year with more on the way scala counts over 100 000 in hay costs between this year and last both are bracing to sell off large proportions of their herds to make it through the coming year for scala it could be as much as half and he doesn t think the water even made it a third of the way across his field i ve been pretty depressed the last couple of days scala said there s no future we don t have water without water we re done and we can t sell the place who s going to buy a place without water pumps turned off but will the damage remain hockaday of the karuk tribe was relieved to see flows returning to the shasta river but hopes to see the ranchers and growers held accountable for diversions that the state water board says are illegal it s great that they turned off the pumps but they knew they weren t supposed to turn them on in the first place hockaday said the california department of fish and wildlife is still evaluating the damage that the pumping may have caused tina bartlett the department s northern regional manager said in a letter to the water board friday but the department expects that the rapid reduction in flows could have put young salmon and trout species at risk by shrinking their habitat increasing temperatures downstream and interfering with critical food production it is likely that some perished wrote bartlett who added that the rapid dewatering also does not bode well for adult chinook salmon migrating from the pacific to their spawning grounds if those fish are gone our people suffer those fish don t spawn our people suffer we live off that it s our culture arron troy hoc karuk tribal council member lemos said he doubts that fish were harmed by the diversions he expects warm summertime temperatures kept salmon species out of the lower reaches of the shasta i wish you d go down the canyon and look for some dead fish because you won t find them lemos said there was nothing harmed by our diversion at all but mike belchik a senior water policy analyst for the yurok tribe said the damage goes beyond salmon fish species like lamprey that also are culturally important to the yurok people are vulnerable to being stranded by a rapidly retreating water line belchik said and reducing the river s flows can cause long term harm to the food web that can affect production for in the years to come if you interrupt the food production in the summer you don t just get it back it s like removing the oxygen from a room for 20 minutes he said it s lethal hockaday said land can be replanted and economies rebuilt if a species of fish disappears from the river it s gone forever the ranchers who pumped the water need to take care of his family i understand that hockaday said but he wants to know when it ll be the tribes turn to stop sacrificing so much we gave up everything since the colonist people came here hockaday said we ve given our land we ve given our water we ve given our homeland we gave everything up
composite image with background stock photo of 5th district court and overlay booking photo of bradly scott hunt 34 taken in washington county utah may 8 2020 booking photo courtesy of the washington county sheriff s office st george news st george a jury returned with a guilty verdict last week following a four day trial in which defense attorneys argued that their defendant was within his rights to kill 38 year old christopher montgomery who was shot at a residence in washington city in may 2020 on sept 2 a jury found 34 year old bradly scott hunt guilty of first degree murder and a third degree felony firearms charge while they found him not guilty of drug and paraphernalia charges the trial was held before district judge keith c barnes in 5th district court in st george the state s prosecutors included jim weeks and zachary weiland while hunt was represented by skye lazaro and justin hamady two defense attorneys out of salt lake city the case originally was filed may 8 2020 after officers found montgomery lying with a gunshot wound to the chest on the front driveway of a residence off huntington hill road the victim was transported to st george regional hospital where he later died from his injuries at the time of the incident hunt reportedly told police he had a physical altercation with montgomery earlier in the day shortly thereafter the defendant told police that montgomery who lived next door possibly was armed with a gun and in response a shotgun was placed near the front door in case he returned to the residence several hours later hunt said he was in the backyard with friends a little after 10 p m when he heard his dogs barking and went inside to look out the front window he told officers it was then that he observed the neighbor attempting to enter the home through a window which is when the defendant said he grabbed the shotgun opened the front door and then fired a shot at the victim without exchanging any words hunt also told police he thought he saw an item in the victim s hand when he looked out the window just before opening the door but he said he was unable to identify what it was leaving him unsure if montgomery was armed this account that was called into question by several witness statements provided to investigators at the scene during opening statements presented during the trial last week weiland told the court that at the time of the incident hunt attacked montgomery as he was walking up the driveway toward the home knocking him unconscious hunt then proceeded to drag montgomery down the driveway while yelling that he would shoot the victim according to several witness accounts gathered at the scene the confrontation was so violent that it caused a number of neighbors to call 911 weiland said when officers arrived shortly after 8 p m they found montgomery bleeding and confused but they were unable to arrest him weiland said with covid restrictions in place at the jail at the time thus making it impossible for officers to arrest the victim for public intoxication following the attack weiland said montgomery s state of confusion was apparent when he entered the home of another neighbor thinking he was at a friend s house and left the residence from there he started walking up the driveway of hunt s home where minutes later he was shot in the chest with a shotgun at the time of the shooting hunt was a convicted felon and was prohibited from having a gun hunt provided varying statements to several officers immediately after the shooting telling one officer he saw montgomery looking through his window and then he opened the front door and shot the victim he told another officer that montgomery was looking over the fence into his backyard and hunt said he came out and shot him weiland closed by saying the defendant did exactly what he told montgomery he was going to do earlier that evening when he told the victim if you come back i will kill you a statement that held true when hunt grabbed a shotgun and shot the victim spreading pellets throughout montgomery s upper body hunt s defense attorney lazaro opened by saying the defendant never denied shooting the victim but it was the reason behind the shooting that did not line up with the state s position she said there were a number of previous situations wherein the victim had reportedly entered her client s home without permission and stole tools food and other items as time went on lazaro said the victim s behavior escalated and the situation between the neighbors continued to deteriorate then on the night of the shooting she said hunt believed that montgomery had tried to enter his home armed with a gun and it was only after the defendant saw the victim coming up the driveway that he fired the shot this case is about self defense nothing more hunt took the stand on the fourth day of the trial and said that montgomery had threatened to shoot him on multiple occasions adding those were threats he took very seriously he said he never planned to kill his neighbor and has felt sadness since the incident but at the time he said he was operating under the belief that he had a right to defend his home and his family he said he has continued to take full responsibility for his actions since the beginning during cross examination weeks went over the statements the defendant made to detectives during the investigation including one where the defendant called montgomery annoying but never did the defendant mention anything about the victim threatening him hunt also told detectives that he saw montgomery looking in the window weeks said and that he shot montgomery from the front door of the home an account he provided at least three times the defendant s story began to shift after witnesses reported seeing the suspect walking around the outside of the home from the backyard which weeks said was the point at which the defendant changed his account saying he saw montgomery when he looked over the back gate and then grabbed the gun from inside the home during redirect lazaro said the varying statements were likely due to her client s inability to see montgomery in the darkness she added that the trauma from the incident likely caused her client to remember the events differently and now that hunt has had two years to think about what happened that night the details of how the incident unfolded are clearer she also asked hunt if he still thinks about what happened to which he replied every single day weeks then asked the defendant if he desired to shoot montgomery to which the defendant said no but when asked if he intended to shoot the victim hunt said yes the fourth day of the trial opened with closing arguments and weeks was first to address the court he said montgomery had been described several times during the trial as a sniper who was lying in wait for the defendant despite any evidence suggesting such nor did investigators find any evidence of a burglary or of any type of theft that took place prior to the shooting as the defendant had claimed weeks said the defense s position that montgomery was the aggressor in the case was not valid nor was it supported by the evidence and he reiterated that hunt was not a victim in the case weeks closed by saying that hunt snuck up on chris and he killed him in cold blood lazaro began her closing by saying that montgomery did not have to break into the defendant s home to support the shooting as an act of self defense he only had to attempt to get into the residence she also reminded the jury that hunt and montgomery had lived next door to each other for 15 years she explained that utah is one of the states where a person not only has the right to defend themselves and their property but a person also has no duty to retreat which does not only apply when someone is at home but when they are in any other place where they can lawfully be she said that montgomery had terrorized hunt s family as well as his own family adding he had discharged a firearm in his own home prior to the shooting she closed by saying her client did not want to kill montgomery that night nor did he intend to kill the victim hunt s actions were intended to stop a threat lazaro said during weiland s rebuttal he said montgomery was not a threat to hunt on the day of the incident instead the prosecutor said the victim was looking for his truck and he was confused injured and in pain following the physical attack that left him battered after being dragged down the driveway montgomery was asking for help weiland added he said the defendant s story of where the shooting occurred was impossible improbable and was one of the many lies hunt told to investigators lies that revealed a consciousness of guilt weiland said that montgomery never attempted to break into the suspect s home nor was hunt fearful of the victim otherwise he would not have inflicted the injuries upon the victim during the beatdown shortly before the shooting you cannot kill somebody for just criminally trespassing on the property weiland said after less than three hours the jury returned with the guilty verdict hunt who has been in jail since his arrest more than two years ago will remain in custody until his sentencing hearing scheduled to take place oct 27 in st george copyright st george
