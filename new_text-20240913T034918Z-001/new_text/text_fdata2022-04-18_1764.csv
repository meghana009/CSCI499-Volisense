commentary when i was a kid growing up in new york city in the 1950s my parents were liberal democrats they were gladly for adlai stevenson in the presidential elections of 1952 and 1956 and therefore as their loyal child so was i dwight eisenhower the winner in those elections turned out to be one of the better presidents in u s history they of course supported freedom of speech that pillar of american democracy all members of the democratic party did then at least publicly by the time i was in high school i had gone like many in my generation to the left of my parents but never not once did i or my friends of the time think to forego free speech we were exercising it enshrined in the first amendment of the bill of rights along with its natural cohorts freedom of religion press assembly and petition freedom of speech was and is the very essence of what makes america america without it democracy doesn t exist at least since the magna carta 1215 and no doubt earlier people have been fighting for this right so they can speak their minds to their overlords and live as much as possible in a just society when i was young and also as i grew older and became more conservative i never wavered in my devotion to freedom of speech as i imagine few of you have restriction of speech is something we associate with hitler stalin and later mao by far the three greatest mass murderers in human history with roughly 100 million deaths between them that they regularly censored speech was no accident it was part of the plan but in the united states we were largely allowed to say what we wished with the normal caveats of course such as shouting fire in a crowded theater that is until big tech the arrival of those barely controlled transnational behemoths facebook twitter and google was accompanied by happy talk that now borders on the ludicrous such as google s original slogan don t be evil what we got instead was mass censorship of the citizens of the united states and the world via what s arguably the most covert and dangerous method in history secret algorithms were designed and myriad hall monitors hired to govern contributions to these companies resulting in the canceling of who knows how many supposed ideological miscreants across the globe i was among them facebook recently canceled me with no explanation other than stating that i had violated community standards i had long left twitter of my own initiative for some time twitter has been the go to place for people in the news business giving the company outsized influence on the flow or more often the suppression of information this suppression reached its apotheosis with the deliberate censorship of the new york post s absolutely accurate reporting on the hunter biden laptop according to pollsters if this had been allowed to see the light of day trump would have fairly easily won the election of 2020 assuming he didn t anyway a second trump presidency would have been the antithesis of what we have now in the widely disdained biden administration whoever is actually running it in other words twitter could be held responsible for the extraordinary level of inflation the unprecedented supply chain woes the insane departure from afghanistan in which the united states left behind 80 billion in advanced military equipment for terrorists the also unprecedented porous southern border with more drugs and human trafficking than ever and of course putin s invasion of ukraine that never happened nota bene while trump was in office to name but a few which brings us to elon musk you knew i would get there sooner or later who knew the world s richest man would become the savior of free speech it certainly goes against the famous quote attributed to balzac behind every great fortune there is a crime but it s quite clear that s why he s attempting to buy twitter lined up against him is the company s board of directors essentially a politburo determined as are most of their ilk to preserve the status quo they re doing it via a recent legal construct called a poison pill which expands stock offerings to make the purchase of the company more expensive for the entity that intends to take it over i m not going to name this board person by person you can find it elsewhere because i don t want to give such reactionary wretches publicity but twitter ceo parag agrawal s skepticism about free speech has been widely quoted a moral narcissist someone should write a book about that he prefers to inform us ignoramuses of the real truth no matter what the outgrowth or veracity of his pronouncements which raises the question why do these apparatchiks masquerading as board members oppose free speech what s so bad about people expressing their views obviously the problem for this twitter board and the company s ceo is that deep down they probably would never acknowledge this they fear these people may be correct in their views in other words the board members are cowards afraid to submit their ideological biases to the light of day they re panicked why else would they go to the lengths they have to stop musk from installing free speech where it should have been in the first place well their jobs i suppose channeling what the prelates told galileo when he insisted that the world was round they brand speech they don t agree with as misinformation and now according to fox business charles gasparino our government is sticking its nose into the fray gasparino said both the doj and the sec are clearly scrutinizing this entire matter now we re getting this from lawyers they re clearly monitoring and scrutinizing this entire issue whether filed the right forms whether there s a stock manipulation case here whether he s making public statements that he probably shouldn t make what we do know is that he s stirred up a regulatory hornets nest doj sec i m getting this from lawyers who deal with them shall we say welcome back comrade stalin is it time to replace the star spangled banner with the east is red elon don t let these communist creeps stop you freedom of speech is the soul of america fight for it fight for all of us do it and i might even buy a tesla the tech is cool and i love the idea of a self driving car when it s ready even though i m skeptical electric cars do much for the environment and i bet you ll let me say that on twitter when you own it and for those of you who think i m exaggerating when i call even corporate board members communists here are the words of alexander trachtenberg speaking at the national convention of communist parties in madison square garden 1944 when we get ready to take the united states we will not take you under the label of communism we will not take you under the label of socialism we will take the united states under labels we have made very lovable we will take it under liberalism under progressivism under democracy but take it we will if he had known he might have added we will take it under twitter correction this article has been updated to include the correct year for the national convention of communist parties in madison square garden views expressed in this article are

stock image photo by ilkercelik istock getty images plus st george news contributed content a child with alcohol drug or other addictions creates challenges for parents wanting to leave them money but not wanting to enable the child s addiction at brindley sullivan we know that most parents worry that an inheritance will provide a way for their addicted child to further indulge in their addiction waste their inheritance and exacerbate their self destructive behavior sometimes completely disinheriting the child is the answer parents usually only consider this if the relationship between the parents and child has been strained to the breaking point but it can also make sense if it is truly in the best interest of the child if the child has a long pattern of returning to the addictive behavior it may be the best option if parents elect this option the parents need to make their documents perfectly clear that they intend to disinherit the child a no contest provision in their will and trust should also be included that specifically names the child so that if he or she starts a lawsuit they will not be able to inherit anything another option is to create a trust that holds that child s share for his or her lifetime or until the child can show they have overcome their addiction trusts can be tailored for the circumstances and the personality of the child and their needs for example a trust may say that no funds will be paid out as long as the addiction continues or the trust may require drug testing before any distributions are to be made a trust may also include incentives for the addicted child to find and keep a job by matching money earned for example it might include provisions to require attendance at alcoholics anonymous meetings or other addiction treatment programs as a prerequisite to receiving distributions there are as many options as there are ideas and that s what makes a trust such a popular planning tool if using a trust is the right strategy to help the addicted child a real key to success in carrying out the intentions of the parents is to name the right trustee to manage the finances of the addicted child addicts are usually skilled manipulators and deceivers the trustee will need to be strong in dealing with the child and holding to the terms of the trust third party trustees can be a good option to act as the trustee of the child s share or naming two family members as co trustees often works well family co trustees are usually better than one in these situations because they can present a united stand to hold to the terms of the trust co trustees will be able to support each other through the potential stress of working with the addicted child there are many considerations and good options when dealing with the inheritance of an addicted child the parents simply have to make the best of an already tough situation proper planning will give a family the direction and instructions to deal with it as best they can written by m sean sullivan a founding partner at brindley sullivan about m sean sullivan m sean sullivan is an attorney with 22 years of experience in will trust and estate planning law and he has worked with clients from all parts of the united states his office offers free initial consultations at your convenience which can be requested online or by calling 435 673 9220 s p o n s o r e d c o n t e n t resources brindley sullivan address 50 e 100 south suite 302 st george telephone 435 673 9220 website copyright st george news saintgeorgeutah com llc 2022 all rights reserved
last updated on march 30 2024 a group of 22 state attorneys generals is demanding congress to look upon the glaring vagueness leading to legal cannabis being sold otc online or through vending machines reported the hill republicans with the tremendous faux pas allowed the legalization of hemp production in the 2018 omnibus farm bill which has led to an expansion of a multibillion dollar market that is arguably federally legal according to the hill the ags in play have set out a letter to somehow squash the legalization and essentially the market they help create the new farm bill reportedly would enshrine in statute that intoxicating cannabis is not federally legal which is contrary to the current law the legal hemp market has expanded over the past decade to include highly regulated recreation and medicinal cannabis along with exotic cannabinoids sold without restrictions sometimes posing a dangerous threat to people s health the ag s wrote because of the ambiguity created by the 2018 farm bill a massive gray market worth an estimated 28 billion has exploded forcing cannabis equivalent products into our economies regardless of states intentions to legalize cannabis use the group is bipartisan from states where cannabis is legal illegal or used for medical purposes only the group argues that concreated cannabinoids are dangerously undermining regulations and consumer protections in states where adult use legal cannabis programs are already in place the problem lies in the idea that marijuana is intoxicating but highly regulated and hemp is neither the thing about this is hemp and cannabis tend to be considered the same word as it comes from the language of the ancient scythian nomads of the eurasian steppe according to the hill former president donald trump signed the 2018 farm bill in which an all republican congress supported the legal production of hemp reported the hill the bill essentially split the plant into those aforementioned two categories plants that did not have significant amounts of thc the high part were assessed by 3 by weight this form hemp became legal while the latter marijuana was in a weird legal but sometimes illegal area it is federally illegal in the same class as heroin and only available through regulated and taxed markets in an increasing amount of states reported the hill the hill adds that cannabis markets could sell the drug for 30 thc by weight which is a hundred times more potent than the limit established by congress in the 2018 farm bill however there was what the ags referred to as a loophole where the american industry filled in entrepreneurs understood that congress focused on the form of thc called delta 9 thc other versions like delta 8 delta 10 or delta 11 were still considered legal which led to the expansion of edibles and drinks containing this kind of thc the entrepreneurs also knew that the 3 of delta 9 thc was not enough for a high when smoked but was enough to intoxicate through an edible so they seized upon the industry now the hill reports that edibles carry 20 milligrams of delta 9 thc making it much less potent than 3 in a 10 gram candy but still enough for a high the attorneys general believe these products are a significant risk particularly to children in fact the national association of poison control center reported 7 000 cases of children with acute thc intoxication the evident problem is regulation which has allowed the flow of counterfeit candies they wrote as hemp based thc infused products increase in popularity particularly edibles illicit suppliers have begun co opting legitimate brand names and packaging to sell candy snacks and cereal that are intoxicating and confusing to consumers these copycat hemp products place children at exceptional risk in 2023 congress banned cannabis flower with 3 of delta 9 thc over variants of thc are not intoxicating unless smoked this has allowed for the 2018 farm bill to allow the growth of hemp fibers but also made it legal for smokeable intoxicating cannabis on the purchaser s point reads the hill the hill also notes that one online vendor claims thca is completely legal across the u s it contains less than 3 of delta 9 thc which according to the dea makes it federally legal the outlet reports that growers can start from a variety of cannabis fibers and selectively breed until they have high amounts of thca the ags said instead hemp derived intoxicants have proliferated across our states posing a significant threat to public health and safety and benefiting unregulated untaxed and unaccountable market actors perhaps their concern is the lost taxes in 2022 there were a record 3 77 billion in taxes on recreation and medicinal marijuana unregulated hemp continues to be a growing industry the food and drug administration promised more cut and dry regulation in 2019 but has yet to do so according to the hill the attorneys generals have some serious and valid concerns though senior council of the roundtable told the dallas observer but their solution s the wrong one we need regulation we need the fda to come in and start regulating hemp products like they promised they would five years ago the answer is not a prohibition or changing the definition of hemp in a federal law to ban these products the trade group is ushering congress to protect the current definition of hemp as well as regulation of labeling to protect children the ags view this as a layered issue in which they can reap massive tax gains by allowing the market to spread but the main problem is regulating a market they don t fully understand by approaching this as marijuana versus hemp they are trying to make it clear cut but it isn t there are too many derivatives of cannabis and they seemingly need an individualized approach when regulating the other issue is to avoid prohibition but protect minors from access to such drugs these ags have a long way to go to rectify the situation since they really have little to no idea about cannabis or hemp bipartisan action is a good step but understanding the drug and its derivatives is essential for proper regulation they also need a better grasp of the cannabis economy
tom krisher the associated press detroit ap a group of tesla shareholders suing ceo elon musk over some 2018 tweets about taking the company private is asking a federal judge to order musk to stop commenting on the case lawyers for stockholders of the austin texas based company also say in court documents that the judge in the case has ruled that musk s tweets about having funding secured to take tesla private were false and that his comments also violate a 2018 court settlement with u s securities regulators in which musk and tesla each agreed to pay 20 million fines musk during an interview thursday at the ted 2022 conference said he had the funding to take tesla private in 2018 he called the securities and exchange commission a profane name and said he only settled because bankers told him they would stop providing capital if he didn t and tesla would go bankrupt the interview and court action came just days after musk the world s richest person made a controversial offer to take over twitter and turn it into a private company with a 43 billion offer that equals 54 20 per share twitter s board on friday adopted a poison pill strategy that would make it prohibitively expensive for musk to buy the shares in court documents filed friday lawyers for the tesla shareholders alleged that musk is trying to influence potential jurors in the lawsuit they contend that musk s 2018 tweets about having the money to take tesla private at 420 per share were written to maniuplate the stock price costing shareholders money now lawyers say musk is campaigning to influence possible jurors as the case gets closer to trial musk s comments risk confusing potential jurors with the false narrative that he did not knowingly make misrepresentations with his aug 7 2018 tweets the lawyers wrote his present statements on that issue an unsubtle attempt to absolve himself in the court of public opinion will only have a predjudicial influence on a jury the lawyers asked judge edward m chen in san francisco to issue restrain musk from making further public comments on the issue until after the trial chen gave musk s lawyers until wednesday to respond alex spiro a lawyer representing musk wrote in an email sunday that the plaintiffs lawyers are seeking a big payout nothing will ever change the truth which is that elon musk was considering taking tesla private and could have he wrote all that s left some half decade later is random plaintiffs lawyers trying to make a buck and others trying to block that truth from coming to light all to the detriment of free speech but the shareholders lawyers wrote that chen already ruled that musk s tweets were false and misleading and that no reasonable juror could conclude otherwise judge chen s order issued april 1 was not in the public court file as of sunday adam apton a lawyer for the shareholders said it was sealed because it has evidence that musk and tesla say is confidential it will stay sealed until the parties agree if anything should remain sealed he wrote in an email our motion for tro temporary restraining order accurately desribes the issues decided by the court apton wrote after musk s 2018 tweets the sec filed a complaint against him alleging securities law violations musk then agreed to the fine and signed the court agreement part of the agreement says that musk will not take any action or make or permit to be made any public statement denying directly or indirectly any allegation in the complaint or creating the impression that the complaint is without factual basis if musk violates the agreement the sec may ask the court to scrap it and restore the securities fraud complaint the agreement says a message was left sunday seeking comment from the sec spiro on behalf of musk already has asked a manhattan federal court to throw out the agreement he contends the sec is using the pact and near limitless resources to chill musk s speech court documents filed by spiro say musk signed the agreement when tesla was a less mature company and sec action jeopardized its financing

will come under significant pressure in the coming years when its best selling drug humira will lose patent protection in 2023 accordingly abbvie s future revenue and earnings depend in large part on its ability to develop new sources of revenue to offset humira s lost sales rinvoq an anti inflammatory drug manufactured by abbvie and used to treat rheumatoid arthritis ra and other diseases by inhibiting janus kinase jak enzymes was touted as one such drug rinvoq was initially approved in the united states to treat only moderate to severe ra however abbvie was actively pursuing additional treatment indications and in 2020 asked the u s food and drug administration fda to approve rinvoq for the treatment of several other diseases as is relevant here rinvoq is similar to other jak inhibitor drugs including xeljanz manufactured by pfizer inc when the fda approved xeljanz in 2012 for the treatment of ra it required an additional safety trial to evaluate xeljanz s risk of triggering certain serious side effects beginning in february 2019 the fda repeatedly warned the public that the safety trial indicated that xeljanz s use could lead to serious heart related issue cancer and other adverse events notwithstanding the similarities between rinvoq and xeljanz during the class period defendants assured investors that rinvoq was far safer than xeljanz and not subject to the same regulatory risks however investors began to learn the truth about rinvoq s significant risks on june 25 2021 when abbvie revealed that the fda was delaying its review of expanded treatment applications for rinvoq due to the safety concerns associated with xeljanz on this news the price of abbvie common stock declined 1 76 per share or approximately 1 5 from a close of 114 74 per share on june 24 2021 to close at 112 98 per share on june 25 2021 then on september 1 2021 the fda announced that final results from the xeljanz safety trial established an increased risk of serious adverse events even with low doses of xeljanz as a result the fda determined that it would require new and updated warnings for xeljanz and rinvoq because rinvoq share similar mechanisms of action with xeljanz and may have similar risks as seen in the xeljanz safety trial the fda also indicated that it would further limit approved indications for rinvoq as a result of these safety concerns on this news the price of abbvie common stock declined 8 51 per share or more than 7 from a close of 120 78 per share on august 31 2021 to close at 112 27 per share on september 1 2021 after the class period on december 3 2021 abbvie announced that the fda had updated rinvoq s label to require additional safety warnings and limit marketing of rinvoq to only its use after treatment with other drugs has failed on january 11 2022 defendants admitted that these changes to rinvoq s label would negatively impact sales forcing the company to reduce its long term guidance for rinvoq s sales in 2025 the complaint alleges that throughout the class period the defendants made materially false and or misleading statements about the company s business and operations specifically defendants misrepresented and or failed to disclose that 1 safety concerns about xeljanz extended to rinvoq and other jak inhibitors 2 as a result it was likely that the fda would require additional safety warnings for rinvoq and would delay the approval of additional treatment indications for rinvoq and 3 therefore defendants statements about the company s business operations and prospects lacked a reasonable basis as a

joining me now is news national correspondent james packard in los angeles where concerns are growing that trans pacific trade from china could again be derailed further complicating the global supply chain and potentially worsening price increases james what s driving all of this yeah and the president addressed this today natalie there is some serious concern about the way that china is approaching the coronavirus and particularly in shanghai which has a critical part right now that is stranding hundreds of ships out at sea waiting to get into that sport which obviously could have a direct impact on trade across the pacific here to los angeles and to give you a sense of how strict the restrictions are in the city there in shanghai there s a video that i want you to watch and what

happening in china as we speak obviously if you have a critical part in a city like that it raises a lot of concern uh there is some optimism though among experts because this isn t a blanket policy across china and there are other critical ports around the country that can still supply some of that trans pacific trade yes it s tough to see how that situation is being treated in china and james china s trade with russia is way up as sanctions and war cut off most channels from russia to the west so what is that going to do to global trade yeah there s some serious concern about famine really around the world i mean it takes for instance that ukraine and russia supplied 20 and 30 of the world s wheat and corn and now you re looking at a a sort of cocktail of factors that are creating massive disruptions in those supplies and could come down hard on already food insecure people i want you to listen to what the head of the world trade organization had to say the most immediate economic effect of the war has been a sharp spike in the prices of food energy fertilizer and some important minerals for which ukraine and russia key suppliers the world market a potential food crisis is looming i mean there s no more stark way to put it except perhaps how janet yellen phrased it a little earlier today she s talking about what s going to happen next week as economic leaders convened in washington and she said a primary concern for them natalie is going to be in her words how to stave off global starvation definitely something that will be watching as this moves forward my goodness james packard in los angeles we thank you james advertisement the biggest risk to the global economy no one is talking about share copy link copy nearly 400 million people across 45 cities in china are under full or partial lockdown as part of china s strict zero covid policy together they represent 40 or 7 2 trillion of annual gross domestic product for the world s second largest economy according to data from nomura holdings analysts are ringing warning bells but say investors aren t properly assessing how serious the global economic fallout might be from these prolonged isolation orders global markets may still underestimate the impact because much attention remains focused on the russian ukraine conflict and u s federal reserve rate hikes lu ting nomura s chief china economist and colleagues wrote in a note last week most alarming is the indefinite lockdown in shanghai a city of 25 million and one of china s premier manufacturing and export hubs the quarantines there have led to food shortages inability to access medical care and even reported pet killings they ve also left the largest port in the world understaffed the port of shanghai which handled over 20 of chinese freight traffic in 2021 is essentially at a standstill food supplies stuck in shipping containers without access to refrigeration are rotting incoming cargo is now stuck at shanghai marine terminals for an average of eight days before it s transported elsewhere a 75 increase since the recent round of lockdowns began export storage time has fallen but that s likely because there are no new containers being sent to the docks from warehouses according to supply chain visibility platform project44 cargo airlines have canceled all flights in and out of the city and more than 90 of trucks supporting import and export deliveries are currently out of action shanghai produces 6 of china s exports according to the government s statistical yearbook for 2021 and factory closures in and around the city are further rattling supply chains sony and apple supplier plants in and around shanghai are idle quanta the world s biggest contract notebook manufacturer and a macbook maker has stopped production entirely the plant accounts for about 20 of quanta s notebook production capacity and the company previously estimated it would ship 72 million units this year tesla has shuttered its shanghai giga factory which produced about 2 000 electric cars a day on friday china s ministry of industry and information technology said in a statement that it sent a taskforce to shanghai to work on a plan to resume production at 666 key manufacturers in the locked down city tesla executives hope they ll be allowed to reopen their doors by monday ending the factory s longest pause since its 2019 opening the automaker has lost over 50 000 units of production thus far according to materials reviewed by reuters the impact on china is major and the knock on effects on the global economy are quite significant said michael hirson eurasia group s practice head for china and northeast asia i think we re in for more volatility and economic and social disruption for at least the next six months the prolonged disruptions to chinese manufacturing and shipping could help accelerate a key biden administration initiative aimed at reducing u s dependence on chinese products and supply chains but the task comes with serious immediate economic repercussions in a report released last week the world trade organization warned of a worst case scenario involving decoupling global economies spurred on by russia s invasion of ukraine could reduce long term global gdp by 5 that s highly unlikely given the deep financial connections between china and the us investment in each others stocks and bonds reached 3 3 trillion at the end of 2020 according to data from rhodium group these are still very intertwined economies said hirson that integration is not something that s going to be easily reversed because it would be incredibly costly for the u s and for the global economy still american economic leaders believe decoupling is already underway oaktree co founder howard marks wrote in late march that the pendulum swung back towards local sourcing and away from globalization blackrock chairman larry fink echoed the sentiment in a letter to the company s shareholders the russian invasion of ukraine he wrote has put an end to globalization we have experienced over the last three decades in a speech to the atlantic council last week treasury secretary janet yellen said the u s is watching china s political and economic connections to russia closely going forward it will be increasingly difficult to separate economic issues from broader considerations of national interest including national security she said while she said she hopes a bipolar split between china and the u s can be avoided the world s attitude towards china and its willingness to embrace further economic integration may well be affected by china s reaction to our call for resolute action on russia a third of china meanwhile is stuck in quarantine and its economy is suffering china s recent pandemic response is likely to cost at least 46 billion in lost economic output per month or 3 1 of gdp according to research from the chinese university of hong kong analysts no longer believe that china s 2022 target of 5 5 economic growth the country s least ambitious goal in three decades is realistic the world bank revised its estimates for chinese economic growth this week to 5 but noted that if its restrictive policies continue that could fall to 4 the economic burdens come at a politically precarious moment this fall chinese president xi jinping will petition for a third term as the nation s leader breaking with the tradition of a two term maximum
there are several millionaires seeking missouri s open u s senate seat financial disclosure reports show but voters won t see the finances of the only likely billionaire in the race until july trudy busch valentine a democrat and anheuser busch beer heiress who jumped into the race during the final days of filing on monday filed for a 48 day extension of the may 15 deadline for reporting her personal financial data other candidates have previously been granted extensions republican attorney general eric schmitt for example filed tuesday for an extension for what will be his second disclosure report and also received an extension for his initial filing last year but valentine will be the last candidate to file at least one disclosure report delaying until july 3 when voters will get a glimpse into her potential to self fund her campaign an extension can be for up to 90 days but it is due on that date because it must be submitted at least 30 days before the aug 2 primary in

other candidates have tapped their personal wealth such as when missouri senate president pro tem dave schatz made a 1 million loan to his campaignfor the republican nomination u s rep billy long put 250 000 into his gop primary campaign and st louis businessman spencer toder has used 240 000 of his own money for his effort in the democratic primary valentine filed march 28 for the seat being

disclosure reports will also be due may 15 for candidates who filed initial reports during 2021 valentine asked for the extension because of the complexity of her finances her campaign said in a response to inquiries from the independent it is not as simple as taking numbers from a tax return the campaign stated because it needs to precisely state each investment and how to place its value in the mandated ranges the personal disclosures are separate from campaign finance reports the next report for the first three months of the year is due friday schatz who owns an underground telecommunications contracting company as well as real estate and securities said it is time consuming to unravel complex personal finances to meet reporting requirements he was granted a 90 day extension in december for his initial filing which was submitted march 31 taormina photography sen dave schatz speaks on the senate floor on feb 22 2022 i could see where she would have a lengthy

000 and earned income including his senate salary of 224 029 there is just a lot of information it asks for that you don t really have at your fingertips schatz said all individual holdings must be listed he said i don t track every investment so it makes it challenging to figure that out schatz said long said he too understands the extension request he has received extensions in each of the past two years for his house disclosures but those were automatic because of the covid 19 pandemic those things are pretty hard to put together and once you do it two or three times you kind of get a system going long said it is pretty daunting one time my accountant spent a half a day looking for a 4 stock long who was an auctioneer and sold real estate before winning his 7th district seat in

islamabad a high powered pakistan delegation is scheduled to visit washington this week for participation in the upcoming annual spring meeting of the breton wood institutions bwis such as the imf world bank with chances of fresh contacts with the international monetary fund on the sidelines of the meeting however the revival of the imf programme still remains a far cry in the wake of the existing widening gap on account of twin deficits including the budget deficit and current account deficit for the current fiscal year the ministry of finance would have a technical meeting with the imf on coming friday but there is no scheduled virtual meeting for review talks at this point in time one top government official confirmed to the news here sunday night the probable pm s adviser on finance miftah ismail told the news that pakistan s delegation was scheduled to participate in the upcoming annual spring meeting of bwis this week the official delegation will consist of finance secretary state bank of pakistan sbp governor and additional secretary external finance it s also a possibility that the name of miftah ismail might be excluded from the ecl and he might join the official delegation to represent pakistan at the upcoming annual meeting of the imf wb secretary finance hamid yaqoob told the news discussions with the imf are never halted there was an interregnum because there was no finance minister we have been sharing data with the imf now with the spring meeting next week our discussions have become more regular and focused on completing the 7th review however he did not mention any specific time frame for completion of 7th review under the 6 billion extended fund facility eff in the wake of yawning twin deficits the revival of imf programme will be highly difficult the government decision to keep petroleum prices unchanged also sent out wrong signals to the imf without changing approach and doing away with the relief mechanism the revival of imf programme will remain impossible when contacted renowned economist yousuf nazar who is also the author of a book on pakistan s economy said that the pol prices should be adjusted upward in a staggered or gradual manner he proposed to adopt a comprehensive approach whereby the unjustified subsidies for big industrialists such as for fertilizer sugar and other sectors to the tune of rs1 000 billion per annum should be abolished and diverted towards financing targeted fuel subsidies he also proposed that fixation of pricing mechanism of pol products should be made transparent and a parliamentary committee should be formed for allowing public hearing to ascertain the facts and then place price fixation mechanism in a transparent manner he suggested that russian oil should be purchased without violating international sanctions as being done by india he said that there was a mechanism available where payment system through third country could be placed and pakistan could import cheap oil with the help of such mechanism from russia he also proposed that the pol import on deferred payment from china and other friendly countries could also be explored under the comprehensive strategy to combat with arising challenging situation faced by pakistan s economy dr khaqan najeeb former advisor at the ministry of finance told this reporter that subsidised energy pricing policies are a heavy burden on the exchequer and thus unsustainable on the other hand higher prices driven by the global commodity super cycle and the effect of rupee adjustment are hard to pass to the consumers already reeling under inflationary pressures he said there was a dire need to show prudence over populism the government has just come in and it is hoped that in future after taking stock of the situation the pricing decision will be reconsidered a possible way is to pass the prices of petroleum products gradually to the extent of covering the full cost of the products the pdl and gst could be left at negligible levels dr khaqan explained that increasing breadth and quantum of targeted subsidy is now possible because of new databases developed by the government to cover a larger populace other options like fuel cards linked to income support databases especially for motorcycle users for up to a certain amount at discounted prices and diesel fuel cards for public transporters and agriculturists using tube wells and tractors can be started targeted subsidies will help the government in taking the tough decision of eliminating general subsidies in the economy from which the rich and less privileged are all benefiting he concluded

joining me now is news national correspondent james packard in los angeles where concerns are growing that trans pacific trade from china could again be derailed further complicating the global supply chain and potentially worsening price increases james what s driving all of this yeah and the president addressed this today natalie there is some serious concern about the way that china is approaching the coronavirus and particularly in shanghai which has a critical part right now that is stranding hundreds of ships out at sea waiting to get into that sport which obviously could have a direct impact on trade across the pacific here to los angeles and to give you a sense of how strict the restrictions are in the city there in shanghai there s a video that i want you to watch and what s happening in this video is police in hazmat suits are forcibly isolating covid patients from an apartment complex you can hear the shouts of anger and the cries of terror for people there who didn t want these people separated and are terrified about what s going to happen to them just watch this oh it s i mean just sheer terror in those voices natalie that s the severity of restrictions happening in china as we speak obviously if you have a critical part in a city like that it raises a lot of concern uh there is some optimism though among experts because this isn t a blanket policy across china and there are other critical ports around the country that can still supply some of that trans pacific trade yes it s tough to see how that situation is being treated in china and james china s trade with russia is way up as sanctions and war cut off most channels from russia to the west so what is that going to do to global trade yeah there s some serious concern about famine really around the world i mean it takes for instance that ukraine and russia supplied 20 and 30 of the world s wheat and corn and now you re looking at a a sort of cocktail of factors that are creating massive disruptions in those supplies and could come down hard on already food insecure people i want you to listen to what the head of the world trade organization had to say the most immediate economic effect of the war has been a sharp spike in the prices of food energy fertilizer and some important minerals for which ukraine and russia key suppliers the world market a potential food crisis is looming i mean there s no more stark way to put it except perhaps how janet yellen phrased it a little earlier today she s talking about what s going to happen next week as economic leaders convened in washington and she said a primary concern for them natalie is going to be in her words how to stave off global starvation definitely something that will be watching as this moves forward my goodness james packard in los angeles we thank you james advertisement the biggest risk to the global economy no one is talking about share copy link copy nearly 400 million people across 45 cities in china are under full or partial lockdown as part of china s strict zero covid policy together they represent 40 or 7 2 trillion of annual gross domestic product for the world s second largest economy according to data from nomura holdings analysts are ringing warning bells but say investors aren t properly assessing how serious the global economic fallout might be from these prolonged isolation orders global markets may still underestimate the impact because much attention remains focused on the russian ukraine conflict and u s federal reserve rate hikes lu ting nomura s chief china economist and colleagues wrote in a note last week most alarming is the indefinite lockdown in shanghai a city of 25 million and one of china s premier manufacturing and export hubs the quarantines there have led to food shortages inability to access medical care and even reported pet killings they ve also left the largest port in the world understaffed the port of shanghai which handled over 20 of chinese freight traffic in 2021 is essentially at a standstill food supplies stuck in shipping containers without access to refrigeration are rotting incoming cargo is now stuck at shanghai marine terminals for an average of eight days before it s transported elsewhere a 75 increase since the recent round of lockdowns began export storage time has fallen but that s likely because there are no new containers being sent to the docks from warehouses according to supply chain visibility platform project44 cargo airlines have canceled all flights in and out of the city and more than 90 of trucks supporting import and export deliveries are currently out of action shanghai produces 6 of china s exports according to the government s statistical yearbook for 2021 and factory closures in and around the city are further rattling supply chains sony and apple supplier plants in and around shanghai are idle quanta the world s biggest contract notebook manufacturer and a macbook maker has stopped production entirely the plant accounts for about 20 of quanta s notebook production capacity and the company previously estimated it would ship 72 million units this year tesla has shuttered its shanghai giga factory which produced about 2 000 electric cars a day on friday china s ministry of industry and information technology said in a statement that it sent a taskforce to shanghai to work on a plan to resume production at 666 key manufacturers in the locked down city tesla executives hope they ll be allowed to reopen their doors by monday ending the

bloomberg when sri lankan officials arrive in washington this week to meet with the international monetary fund amid an economic and political crisis the main question they ll need to answer is how the country plans to manage its billions in debt sri lanka is seeking up to 4 billion this year to help it import essentials and pay creditors to get any of that through the imf s various programs the government of president gotabaya rajapaksa must present a sustainable debt program that s a standard requirement for aid from the so called lender of last resort even if a shortage of food fuel and medicine is pushing the country toward a humanitarian crisis the downward economic spiral dwindling foreign reserves and soaring inflation has triggered political unrest in colombo where rajapaksa has

lanka would require adequate assurances that debt sustainability will be restored meeting that criteria could include even initial steps like hiring advisers which the government is pursuing the administration has set a friday deadline for applications from financial and legal advisers extending its original date by a week that makes finance minister ali sabry s stated goal of securing emergency funds as early as a week after negotiations start look optimistic stand by arrangement given sri lanka has a 1 billion bond maturing in july and more repayments over the course of 2022 it will probably need access to the imf s stand by arrangement termed as its workhorse instrument sri lanka would be eligible for a loan of as much as 435 of its quota roughly 3 4 billion net of repayments for up to 36 months the payout can be front loaded if the need is dire but is contingent upon the borrower agreeing to conditions such as specific revenue and deficit targets central bank governor nandalal weerasinghe said last week that it was too early to estimate a value of the lending that sri lanka could get from the imf or to confirm the type of program that the lender could agree to while he said that an extended fund facility which allows longer repayment periods may be best suited to the country it typically requires deeper structural reforms sri lanka had that facility approved in 2016 and a stand by arrangement before it during the financial crisis of 2009 weerasinghe noted that sri lanka in the 2009 loan was approved for access to 400 of its quota i do not see why we cannot get at least that amount he said now the financial gap is much much higher debt sustainability keeping deficits in check will entail extending the maturity of existing debt and smaller interest payments when the government last week announced it would halt debt payments and warned it was heading for an unprecedented default weerasinghe said authorities were seeking to negotiate with creditors nomura holdings inc envisions an ecuador style restructuring where sri lanka will swap notes for longer dated bonds with lower coupon rates and some reduction to principal barclays plc said sri lanka could roll all of its debt into a new bond with a final maturity in 2037 and semi annual amortizations starting in 2027 coupons could be in the range of 4 5 lower than its current average 6 6 bilateral help rajapaksa s government has also appealed to china one of its biggest creditors for an additional 2 5 billion in support while president xi jinping has pledged to help an apparent reluctance reflects both a rethink in its external lending practices and a hesitancy to be seen interfering in messy domestic political situations earlier this month jin liqun president of the china backed asian infrastructure investment bank encouraged sri lanka to turn to the imf neighbor india is also assisting sri lanka with credit lines to purchase food and fuel sabry the finance minister said last week that the country will hold talks with other lenders including the world bank and asian development bank adding that the country is committed to honoring its debt we

the central question is what could happen in a country willing to go to great lengths to achieve its leader s goals president xi jinping s friendship with russian leader vladimir putin has made investors more distrustful of china while a strongman narrative is gaining momentum as the communist party doggedly pursues a covid zero strategy and unpredictable campaigns to regulate entire industries as a result some international investors are finding an aggressive allocation to china increasingly unpalatable outflows from the country s stocks bonds and mutual funds accelerated after russia s invasion of ukraine while norway s 1 3 trillion sovereign wealth fund has snubbed a chinese sportswear giant due to concerns about human rights abuses u s dollar private equity funds that invest in china raised just 1 4 billion in the first quarter the lowest figure since 2018 for the same period the scale and speed of sanctions imposed on russia forced a rethink of western attitudes to china according to simon edelsten of u k investment firm artemis investment management llp his team at the 37 billion money manager sold all its china investments last year following beijing s interventions in high profile listings like didi global inc and ant group co saying such moves threatened shareholder rights china s more assertive rhetoric around hong kong and sovereignty claims in the south china sea also made the investment team uneasy edelsten said politics and governance factors should now set a cautious tone especially for long term commitments to china said edelsten adding that european measures taken against russia show that strong trade ties are no guarantee of diplomatic security the ukraine invasion raises these risks very sharply and our funds are likely to remain very lowly weighted in china for some years to come he added brendan ahern chief investment officer at krane funds advisors llc describes indiscriminate and price insensitive selling of chinese shares

global investors in a speech last week u s treasury secretary janet yellen called beijing to account for its ever closer relationship with moscow the world s attitude towards china and its willingness

global times updated 2022 04 18 10 04 editor s note since the start of the military conflict between russia and ukraine the international community has grown increasingly aware of the role the us and nato behind the crisis from imposing sanctions on disobedient countries to coercing other nations to pick sides lip service on the ukraine refugee issue to a questionable overseas human rights record the us has acted like a cold war schemer or a vampire who creates enemies and makes its fortunes from pyres of war the global times is publishing a series of stories and cartoons to demonstrate how the us abusing its superpower status has been creating trouble in the world one crisis after another this is the final installment unmasking the superpower voldemort of global order illustration xu zihe gt just in one year our sanctions are likely to wipe out the last 15 years of russia s economic gains and make russia an outcast on the international stage these remarks by us president joe biden after the outbreak of the russian ukrainian military conflict are frightening the us could implement such a strangulation plan economically and politically to a superpower like russia not to mention other countries that are not as powerful fanning the flames to create turmoil using economic and financial hegemony to sanction opponents and forming cliques to create political isolation the us is using its hegemony to undermine the international order in fact the us government s approach is quite similar to voldemort s they both believe in power recruit followers use violence and repeatedly want to kill competitors in order to maintain supremacy paralyzing sanctions after the russia ukraine conflict broke out the us did not persuade moscow and kiev to negotiate and promote peace but instead continued to provide military assistance to ukraine in an attempt to prolong the conflict and to bring down russia on april 13 biden announced that he would provide ukraine with an additional 800 million in military aid to help kiev strengthen its defenses since the conflict washington s aid to kiev has surpassed 2 4 billion in addition to supporting ukraine ensnare russia the us has also imposed paralyzing sanctions on moscow involving economic financial technological and other fields kicking some russian banks out of the society for worldwide interbank financial telecommunication swift canceling the most favored nation for trade with russia depriving russian citizens access to their overseas assets restricting the sale of russian vodka the us sanctions against russia are all inclusive unwilling to act alone the us is also pulling together european countries australia japan south korea and many other allies to deal with russia trying to turn the ruble into paper with their joint efforts russia has become the country that has suffered the most sanctions from the us in recent years according to a report by sputnik news agency data from a sanctions tracking platform shows that since 2014 russia has been subject to 5 532 sanctions surpassing iran and syria meanwhile since the conflict began at least 300 multinational companies have withdrawn from russia jpmorgan chase previously predicted that russia s gdp will shrink by 12 percent due to western sanctions some russian experts have warned that living standards in russians may drop to 1990s levels meanwhile the world bank predicts that ukraine s gdp will plummet by about 45 1 percent this year the war brought disaster to both russia and ukraine while the us benefited a heartless dependence on sanctions the crazy sanctions against russia are just the latest manifestation of the us sanction addiction over the past 20 years the us has relied on the tool of sanctions almost to the point of insanity the number of sanctioned targets on the us department of the treasury s office of foreign asset control sanctions list has grown from 912 in 2000 to 9 421 in october 2021 a net increase of 933 percent iran syria cuba venezuela and north korea are all on the us sanctions list the reasons given by the us government for punishing these countries include the so called anti terrorism anti corruption and protection of human rights but the real reasons are in fact closely related to the us ideological differences and geopolitical interests the sanctions have ultimately triggered huge humanitarian disasters in these countries observers said john mueller professor of political science at the university of rochester has compared the threat of chemical and biological weapons to the massive death and destruction caused by us economic sanctions and found that more people have been killed because of the sanctions than have been killed by all weapons of mass destruction in history except for sovereign states companies of all countries will be hunted down by the us as long as they affect the country s interest germany s siemens japan s toshiba france s alstom the us has set one trap after another for these competitors in the high tech sector they were all fined heavily by washington and their core businesses were severely affected some employees were even arrested by the us government on trumped up charges frederic pierucci former executive of alstom detailed in his book the american trap about how the us under the guise of anti corruption manage to dismantle many of europe s biggest multinationals for more than a decade the us has always stressed the need to maintain the so called rules based international order but when it comes to international trade rules the us applies them when it suits them and abandons when it doesn t the wto report shows that two thirds of the organization s violations are caused by the us making the country the biggest non compliant nation of wto ruling secret cold war the so called rules based order a termed pushed by the us had gained currency after then us president george w bush ordered the invasion of iraq without the approval of the united nations un security council which exemplified his general disregard for international restraints on american power according to an article published on the new york times nyt in june 2021 looking back at the wars in the korean peninsula vietnam iraq kosovo afghanistan and syria the us under the banner of upholding justice stopping aggression and humanitarian intervention participated in almost all major wars and armed conflicts around the world since wwii to maintain its hegemony that has led to untold humanitarian disaster to the invaded countries and regions and plunged them into instability and economic recession former us president jimmy carter once referred to the us as the most warlike nation in the history of the world in order to impose its political system and values the us willfully interferes in other countries internal affairs it also provokes the so called color revolutions and incites unrest in the involved countries in addition to military invasions according to american scholar lindsey a o rourke s book covert regime change america s secret cold war the us engaged in 64 covert attempts at regime change during the cold war after the 9 11 attacks the us started to use counter terrorism as an excuse to force regime change abroad the war on terror spread to more than 40 percent of the world s countries since 2001 according to a special report by the smithsonian magazine another study conducted by brown university showed that the post 9 11 wars have led to over 929 000 deaths and over 38 million refugees and displaced persons us economic bullying not only affects the economic livelihood of the sanctioned countries but also causes serious damage to the global economic order and economic security western sanctions against russia have also had a profound impact on the global energy food and financial markets according to the financial times sanctions against russia are the biggest blow to globalization devouring not only the real wealth but also expectations of future global economic growth a rogue superpower as a principal architect and custodian of the international order after wwii the us is the initiator founder and participant of many existing international organizations and international treaties however if these rules affect us interests washington is quick to push them to one side in january 2017 the us withdrew from the trans pacific partnership agreement in december 2018 the us announced its withdrawal from the global compact for safe orderly and regular migration and in the following years the us has withdrawn from the iran nuclear deal the intermediate range nuclear forces treaty the open skies treaty and other international agreements in terms of international organizations the us has twice officially withdrawn from the united nations educational scientific and cultural organization in october 2017 and again in january 2019 when the international criminal court encroached on us interests washington was quick to threaten sanctions in september 2020 in the early 21st century if any power sought world domination coercing others and flouting rules it was the united states commented a nyt opinion piece in october 2020 noam chomsky and other prominent us scholars also bluntly said that the us has become a rogue superpower experts point out that countries of the world are seeing ever more clearly the behavior of the us in undermining the international order after the outbreak of the russia ukraine conflict facing the extreme pressure from the us serbia refused to follow the west to impose sanctions on russia on april 9 iran which has suffered from decades of us sanctions announced the inclusion of 24 americans on its blacklist of sanctioned individuals for violations of human rights of the iranian people conclusion in the harry potter series voldemort s arrogance and unchecked need for absolute power lead to his eventual demise unmasking the nature of us government as voldemort its face has now been revealed to readers piece by piece the us is not only the ukraine crisis instigator and cold war schemer but also the instability brewer poison disseminator vampires in the war who spread plague and creates hatred a human rights destroyer who committed grave crimes against humanity and the voldemort of global order the world has suffered from the us for too long and it is only a matter of time before the us hegemonic behavior and destruction of the international order backfires

the 2022 tax season predicted by some to be a perfect storm is coming to a close with barely a stiff wind for the first time in three years the scheduled deadline april 18 will be met as the internal revenue service ended up largely being able to manage processing the millions of individual returns despite continuing complications from the pandemic delayed due dates for 2020 and 2021 returns had sown confusion for taxpayers and created a last minute chaos within the irs to update systems for most taxpayers who have fairly simple taxes and they e file and they choose direct deposit that process for the most part has been very smooth said mark jaeger vp of tax operations at taxact a tax prep software company bull and bitcoin wall art inside a cryptocurrency exchange in barcelona spain angel garcia bloomberg it s a big contrast with the picture in january when treasury officials warned to gird for a challenging and frustrating season with processing delays and customer service shortages a shift in how the child tax credit was administered in 2021 with half of it distributed in monthly payouts meant some might have seen smaller refunds than past years the average refund so far for 2021 is 3 175 9 9 higher than in 2020 that s likely the result of several credits that were expanded under president joe biden s 1 9 trillion american rescue plan one surprise for many an increasing attention by the irs to transactions in digital currencies and non fungible tokens while a law requiring notification to the irs of transfers of at least 10 000 in cryptocurrency doesn t take effect until 2023 the agency does have reporting requirements for acquisitions and sales on individual returns this is surprising many new crypto owners who don t yet realize that the irs asks for the data mike greenwald a partner at accounting firm friedman llp said it requires a conversation that clients weren t expecting to have greenwald said they don t think about digital currencies the same way the irs does more broadly those who ve participated in the kind of retail trading popularized by robinhood are finding the need to account for how they ve fared day traders nicole rosen a washington state based tax preparer has noticed a significant increase among her clients of people using services like robinhood to buy and sell stock that requires additional forms and adds to the complexity of the tax returns in the past about one third of the returns rosen prepared reported stock transactions she estimates now that s closer to 80 to 90 the average time to complete a return has accordingly increased from taking as many as two hours to as much as four new automated irs tools such as a platform to upload power of attorney paperwork have helped save time in other areas rosen said the irs has been working hard on its own paperwork the backlog of paper returns reached a high water mark of 24 million this year irs commissioner chuck rettig has said that should be reduced to the normal levels of less than 1 million by the year end with less catch up work to focus on the irs could now be in a better position to step up audits of the wealthy as advocated by progressive democratic lawmakers no jinxing the irs recently got approval for an expedited hiring process to bring on as many as 10 000 new employees with half of those being hired in the coming months rettig has said this will help improve customer service and speed up processing times irs employees want to do more to help taxpayers rettig said in testimony to the senate finance committee this month we want to be able to answer the phones and respond to questions tax professionals who are scarred from the past two years helping their clients navigate ever changing pandemic payments paycheck protection program loans and unemployment benefits are wary of jinxing the possibility of easier tax seasons ahead we re hopeful that there aren t going to be any changes that are going to create the mechanical chaos that s been going on over the last couple of years bret scholl a california based cpa said but while things are so fluid and unpredictable i m hesitant to predict just about anything with assistance from christopher condon

twitter said friday that its board of directors has unanimously adopted a poison pill defense in response to tesla ceo elon musk s proposal to buy the company and take it private tesla ceo elon musk offers to buy twitter for 43b tesla ceo elon musk offers to buy twitter for 43b musk twitter s largest shareholder offered to buy the remaining shares in the company for more than 43 billion calling it his final offer learn more the move would allow existing twitter shareholders to buy additional shares at a discount thereby diluting musk s stake in the company and making it harder for him to corral a majority of shareholder votes in favor of the acquisition twitter s plan would take effect if musk s roughly 9 stake grows to 15 or more twitter said the poison pill would enable its investors to realize the full value of their investment by reducing the likelihood that any one person can gain control of the company without either paying shareholders a premium or giving the board more time to evaluate their offer such defenses formally called shareholder rights plans are used to prevent the takeover of a corporation by making any acquisition prohibitively expensive for the bidder even if it discourages his takeover attempt musk could still take over the company by waging a proxy fight in which shareholders vote to retain or dismiss the company s current directors twitter said the plan doesn t prevent the board from engaging with parties or accepting an acquisition proposal if it s in the company s best interests taking twitter private at 54 20 should be up to shareholders not the board elon musk elonmusk april 14 2022 twitter revealed in a securities filing thursday that musk offered to buy the company outright for more than 43 billion saying the social media platform needs to be transformed as a private company in order to build trust with its users i believe free speech is a societal imperative for a functioning democracy musk said in the filing i now realize the company will neither thrive nor serve this societal imperative in its current form later on thursday during an onstage interview at a ted event he went even broader having a public platform that is maximally trusted and broadly inclusive is extremely important to the future of civilization musk revealed in regulatory filings over recent weeks that he d been buying twitter shares in almost daily batches starting jan 31 ending up with a stake of about 9 only vanguard group controls more twitter shares a lawsuit filed tuesday in new york federal court alleged that musk illegally delayed disclosing his stake in the social media company so he could buy more shares at lower prices after musk announced his stake twitter quickly offered him a seat on its board on the condition that he would limit his purchases to no more than 14 9 of the company s outstanding stock but the company said five days later that musk had declined additional reporting by the associated press
a confluence of circumstances has come together to create a perfect storm for global food production and now that perfect storm is about to get even worse for months i warned that this crisis was coming and in recent weeks i have been documenting how dire conditions have already become all over the globe the head of the un world food program is warning that this is going to be the worst worldwide food crisis since world war ii and even joe biden is admitting that the approaching food shortages are going to be real unfortunately there have been some new developments which threaten to significantly escalate things in recent days the number of newly confirmed covid cases in china has soared to record highs and chinese authorities have responded to this with unprecedented lockdowns as a result almost 400 million chinese are now under full or partial lockdown nearly 400 million people across 45 cities in china are under full or partial lockdown as part of china s strict zero covid policy together they represent 40 or 7 2 trillion of annual gross domestic product for the world s second largest economy according to data from nomura holdings analysts are ringing warning bells but say investors aren t properly assessing how serious the global economic fallout might be from these prolonged isolation orders chinese lockdowns are a lot more brutal than lockdowns in the western world by now you have probably seen video footage of shanghai residents literally screaming from their apartment windows i have never seen anything like that before and these lockdowns will continue as long as covid keeps spreading to put this in perspective the number of people that are currently locked down in china is greater than the total population of the united states needless to say these lockdowns are bringing the chinese economy to a grinding halt and that is going to affect the entire planet at the port of shanghai activity is essentially at a standstill the port of shanghai which handled over 20 of chinese freight traffic in 2021 is essentially at a standstill food supplies stuck in shipping containers without access to refrigeration are rotting this is an enormous problem for those of us in the western world because our stores are normally filled with goods that have been made in china and this even extends to our food supply for example we send giant mountains of apples to china where they are processed and sent back to us as apple juice we need to hope that the lockdowns in china end soon because if that does not happen it will likely create tremendous shortages all over the planet meanwhile the fertilizer crisis in the united states is about to get even worse previously i have written about how the skyrocketing cost of fertilizer is going to cause massive problems for many u s farmers and now many of those farmers may not be able to get the fertilizer that they need at all due to railroad mandated shipping reductions the following comes directly from a notice released by cf industries cf industries holdings inc nyse cf a leading global manufacturer of hydrogen and nitrogen products today informed customers it serves by union pacific rail lines that railroad mandated shipping reductions would result in nitrogen fertilizer shipment delays during the spring application season and that it would be unable to accept new rail sales involving union pacific for the foreseeable future the company understands that it is one of only 30 companies to face these restrictions cf industries ships to customers via union pacific rail lines primarily from its donaldsonville complex in louisiana and its port neal complex in iowa the rail lines serve key agricultural areas such as iowa illinois kansas nebraska texas and california products that will be affected include nitrogen fertilizers such as urea and urea ammonium nitrate uan as well as diesel exhaust fluid def an emissions control product required for diesel trucks cf industries is the largest producer of urea uan and def in north america and its donaldsonville complex is the largest single production facility for the products in north america i was astounded to hear that 30 different companies will be affected by these reductions someone at union pacific needs to give us some straight answers about what is really going on because the ceo of cf industries says that this change could not come at a worse time for farmers the timing of this action by union pacific could not come at a worse time for farmers said tony will president and chief executive officer cf industries holdings inc not only will fertilizer be delayed by these shipping restrictions but additional fertilizer needed to complete spring applications may be unable to reach farmers at all by placing this arbitrary restriction on just a handful of shippers union pacific is jeopardizing farmers harvests and increasing the cost of food for consumers of course this comes in the aftermath of a disastrous winter wheat harvest in the united states and the winter wheat harvest over in china is being called the worst in history so we desperately need a really good growing season in the months ahead and now that is being jeopardized by more supply chain issues at the same time the new bird flu pandemic in the u s just continues to intensify on friday we learned that idaho has become the 27th u s state to have confirmed cases at a commercial facility on friday the u s department of agriculture announced yet another outbreak this one in two flocks in idaho making that the 27th state in which the virus has been found since february according to the usda the price of a dozen eggs in november hovered around 1 right now that price is 2 95 and rising the cost of eggs has already gone completely nuts and it is only going to go higher if you don t eat eggs or anything that contains eggs then this will not affect you unfortunately the vast majority of us will be affected by this and we are being warned that this pandemic could get a lot worse in the months ahead of course the cost of chicken meat and the cost of turkey meat will both continue to soar as well in fact one of my readers just wrote to let me know that the price of chicken breasts at his local store shot up 43 percent i thought i would give you a quick update on inflation food shortages i just got back from the dollar general store in holden mo i was going to buy some tyson chicken breasts to stock up for the future they went from 6 95 to 9 95 that s a 43 jump in price there was plenty of them 6 packages but i just felt like i couldn t afford them so i didn t buy any michael have you heard anything about shortages of crackers i had to wait 4 months for a certain type of cracker to get restocked in the dollar general store i also have been having a lot of trouble getting saltine crackers at our local grocery store 2 weeks ago they finally had 1 box of the type i buy and i grabbed it up immediately this week none again not sure what the problem is gas here is 3 49 diesel fuel is 4 69 i feel sorry for the guys that have these big diesel pickups with 40 gallon fuel tanks i have been combining shopping and errands in 1 trip plus letting my pickup set in the driveway to conserve gas a lot of the factors that are contributing to this growing global food crisis are outside of our control but if we could at least bring a halt to the shooting in ukraine that would give us a ray of hope unfortunately negotiations have totally broken down and u s secretary of state antony blinken just told cnn that the war could continue through the end of the year secretary of state antony blinken told washington s european allies that the us believes the war in ukraine could last through the end of 2022 cnn reported friday citing two european officials the report said that many western officials have assessed there s no short term end in sight for the war and public comments from us officials have reflected this national security advisor jake sullivan has warned of a protracted conflict that he said could go on for months or even longer ukraine and russia usually account for approximately 30 percent of all global wheat exports and so we desperately need that war to end sadly that isn t going to happen these days it seems as though almost everything that can go wrong for global food production is going wrong and the stage is being set for the sort of horrific global famine that i have been relentlessly warning about our leaders may be able to print money but they can t print food if you are waiting for them to wave their magic wands and conjure up a perfect solution to this crisis then i am afraid that you are going to be bitterly bitterly disappointed it is

japan s giant investors look set to bet on yen weakness continuing and boost their purchases of treasurys over the rest of the year that s the view of money managers in tokyo who see conservative buyers like life insurers helping the country reaffirm its position as the biggest foreign holder of treasurys after heavy selling in recent months while yields on japanese government bonds have climbed to six year highs the premium offered by their u s counterparts has surged even more as monetary policy in the two economies diverges that divergence is seen by some as keeping the yen under pressure as the federal reserve raises interest rates already at a 20 year low that will make dollar denominated assets attractive to japanese investors

islamabad the international mon e tary fund imf has confirmed that the new government in pakistan has reached out to it seeking support for the country s balance of payments it said a delegation of the country would be in washington this week for a follow up meeting the imf looks forward to continuing supporting pakistan s authorities on economic policies and reforms to ensure macroeconomic stability in the country amidst the current challenging global economic environment imf s resident representative in islamabad esther perez ruiz told dawn she also confirmed that as part of the imf s continued engagement with pakistan she last friday met with finance minister designate miftah ismail ahead of the visit of pakistan s delegation to washington during spring meetings top government sources confirmed that a delegation also comprising secretary hamed yaqoob shaikh and state bank of pakistan sbp governor dr reza baqir would be meeting the new imf mission chief to pakistan nathan porter on monday evening besides other fund officials pakistani delegation likely to meet fund officials this week efforts were on to ensure that mr ismail also joins the washington meetings physically and hopefully take this opportunity to call on imf managing director kristalina georgieva and seek her support for the revival and completion of the stalled fund programme these sources said former finance minister shaukat tarin had sought to arrange a meeting with ms georgieva during these meetings as negotiations with the fund staff had stalled following feb 28 fuel subsidies and tax amnesty announced by former prime minister imran khan the new finance minister would be more eager to seek blessings of the imf s top management at the outset for smooth engagements with the staff to put the programme back on track and ensure foreign inflows for the direly needed balance of payment support there are however at least three issues that the authorities are trying to resolve as the spring meetings april 18 24 are opening today to start with the government has to notify mr ismail as minister adviser finance even though he has unofficially assumed the responsibility then his name has to be excluded from the exit control list on which he was placed soon after his last visit to the us for imf meetings and still remains efforts are already in place for his travel arrangements including the us visa well in time mr ismail had met the imf s resident representative in islamabad to discuss the revival and completion of the extended fund facility eff along with disbursement of 3 billion outstanding funds to counter the fast depleting foreign exchange reserves amid widening fiscal and current account deficits the three year fund programme worth 3bn got suspended thrice and remained off track most of the time over the past three years the fund officials had suggested the authorities to prepare their side of the homework including corrective measures that could stop the bleeding that particularly started after the last month relief cum amnesty package with financial implications of more than rs300bn to become the basis for meetings in washington mr ismail last week blamed the pti government for creating an unprecedented economic mess particularly leaving behind domestic and external financial accounts in a precarious position with estimates of fiscal deficit for the current year at a record rs6 4 trillion or 10pc of gdp against a target of rs3 99tr and current account deficit estimated at 20bn by end june this year he promised to honour all the contractual obligations of the previous government including commercial agreements and the imf programme saying we will take the existing programme forward and complete its three reviews the possible revival will ensure about 3bn in outstanding disbursement till september 2022 former finance minister ismail had been speaking critically of the relief package announced by former prime minister imran khan at the last moment to save the government in particular mr miftah criticised the tax amnesty scheme saying there was no justification for it since the government had given a written commitment not to offer such schemes least the one that also promised amnesty on future incomes as well according to mr ismail current account deficit cad for the current fiscal year was estimated at 20bn by far the highest ever that meant pakistan had to fund 6bn cad on top of about 3bn debt repayments in remaining period of the fiscal year on top of next year s financing needs of 30bn the central bank has since reported the forex reserves held by it to have dropped to 10 8bn as of april 8 which are less than two months of import cover the fund umbrella was thus inevitable to secure assistance from friendly countries from world bank and asian development bank or the international bond market the 6bn extended fund facility eff approved by the imf board on july 3 2019 had remained mostly off track throu ghout its 33 month period and sho uld have come to its completion by sept ember 2022 under original schedule published in dawn april 18th 2022
the last pml n government had succeeded in achieving moderately high economic growth with subdued inflation and relative stability of exchange and interest rates but the then balance of payments bop position deteriorated prime minister mian shahbaz sharif while using his twitter account for the first time as the prime minister said if the stock market and strengthening currency is any indication the journey towards our goals has already started seeing an end to political instability the pakistan stock exchange benchmark index recorded the highest day on day increase of 1 700 points last monday during two sessions on the same day and earlier on friday the rupee recovered by rs5 20 to a dollar or by 2 8 per cent in the third session last tuesday the local currency gained another 91paisa while conscious of the rough road ahead the business community across the country expressed confidence that prime minister shahbaz would be able to take the country out of the crisis by engaging the industry leaders of trade and industry have also almost unanimously demanded a cut in interest rates and expressed their deep concern over the free fall of the rupee there is no sense in allowing the rupee to depreciate recklessly and then trying to overcome its adverse impact with unaffordable subsidies particularly on industrial inputs and foodstuff looking at the short term there is some room for doing away with excessive devaluation and linking the exchange rate to core inflation this would save money spent on the surging rupee cost of debt servicing which has soared to an all time record let exporters benefit from the hike in international commodity prices mr shahbaz has also promised to address the issue of energy prices while approaching the international monetary fund for help to tide over the balance of payments problem former pml n financial advisor miftah ismail says we will try to persuade the fund to ease the tough conditions so that the government could provide relief to the nation a stronger rupee and lower interest rates would help bring down the cost push inflation rate there is no sense in allowing the rupee to depreciate recklessly and then trying to overcome its adverse impact with unaffordable subsidies particularly on industrial raw materials inputs and foodstuff productive industrial investment is stifled owing to volatility in the exchange rate the solution lies in increasing savings investment production and exports as well as in import substitution the prime minister who is reputed to be a competent administrator has promised to make pakistan a paradise for investment just a day after assuming office he presided over a meeting attended by prominent economists to deliberate on the ways and means to find a solution for the country s financial stability the proposals would be devised in line with the existing situation in consultation with stakeholders in such areas as agriculture trade investment and banking while promising to encourage investments prime minister shahbaz has increased minimum wages and pensions for civil and military personnel and urged industrialists to hike wages of those earning less than rs100 000 per month it is an effort to compensate the workers for the loss of wages due to double digit inflation he also stressed the need for comprehensive corporate policy options to overcome inflation there has been zero increase in average income and pakistan never got out of the balance of payments crisis atif mian an internationally acclaimed pakistani american economist and head of the princeton school s center for public policy and finance affairs wrote in a tweet he said pakistan is back in serious trouble a formidable challenge for the pml n government is to maintain unity among its allies in the first instance on a minimum two point programme electoral reforms and the schedule for the next elections mr shahbaz says he would consult each and every party in the parliament on developing a consensus on electoral reforms he said the word victimisation does not exist in his dictionary ppp leader syed khursheed shah advised the pti parliamentarians not to resign but play the role of constructive parliamentary opposition the prime minister also recalled that his previous call for a charter of economy went unheeded the pti s confrontationist approach may also help the opposition with its diverse views and interests maintain unity as it did to unite them in an alliance yet another imperative for the incumbent coalition government being formed for maintaining unity is that none of the mainstream parties has a significant presence in all the four provinces ruling out any major upset in the next national polls pml n ppp and pti may emerge as the largest or majority party in punjab sindh and khyber pakhtunkhwa if pti s performance in the second phase of local bodies is any indication baluchistan is likely to send local parties to the parliament with the influence of mainstream parties weakened in the province the situation demands that the representatives of all four provinces actively cooperate to evolve a common agenda to strengthen democratic and fiscal federalism for this to happen the national finance commission nfc should further refine the formula for the distribution of horizontal resources from the nfc pool to spur regional development let participatory federal democracy come into full play to ensure political stability the vote of no confidence is a milestone in pakistan s constitutional democratic journey to make the whimsical executive subservient to a sovereign parliament with the constitutional powers of the legislature restored and arbitrary extra constitution decisions of the executive declared illegal by the supreme court parliamentary politics has been put on a correction course if this trend is sustained which looks likely it would have a positive impact on the democratisation of the economy pakistan is not an exception in trying to shake off authoritarian rule just a few days earlier kuwait s prime minister resigned ahead of a vote of no confidence the sri lankan president is facing a revolt from his supporters and allies in the parliament owing to a worsening economic crisis they want a new prime minister this is a trend that can further destabilise authoritarianism over

by michael a confluence of circumstances has come together to create a perfect storm for global food production and now that perfect storm is about to get even worse for months i warned that this crisis was coming and in recent weeks i have been documenting how dire conditions have already become all over the globe the head of the un world food program is warning that this is going to be the worst worldwide food crisis since world war ii and even joe biden is admitting that the approaching food shortages are going to be real unfortunately there have been some new developments which threaten to significantly escalate things in recent days the number of newly confirmed covid cases in china has soared to record highs and chinese authorities have responded to this with unprecedented lockdowns as a result almost 400 million chinese are now under full or partial lockdown nearly 400 million people across 45 cities in china are under full or partial lockdown as part of china s strict zero covid policy together they represent 40 or 7 2 trillion of annual gross domestic product for the world s second largest economy according to data from nomura holdings analysts are ringing warning bells but say investors aren t properly assessing how serious the global economic fallout might be from these prolonged isolation orders chinese lockdowns are a lot more brutal than lockdowns in the western world by now you have probably seen video footage of shanghai residents literally screaming from their apartment windows i have never seen anything like that before and these lockdowns will continue as long as covid keeps spreading to put this in perspective the number of people that are currently locked down in china is greater than the total population of the united states needless to say these lockdowns are bringing the chinese economy to a grinding halt and that is going to affect the entire planet at the port of shanghai activity is essentially at a standstill the port of shanghai which handled over 20 of chinese freight traffic in 2021 is essentially at a standstill food supplies stuck in shipping containers without access to refrigeration are rotting this is an enormous problem for those of us in the western world because our stores are normally filled with goods that have been made in china and this even extends to our food supply for example we send giant mountains of apples to china where they are processed and sent back to us as apple juice we need to hope that the lockdowns in china end soon because if that does not happen it will likely create tremendous shortages all over the planet meanwhile the fertilizer crisis in the united states is about to get even worse previously i have written about how the skyrocketing cost of fertilizer is going to cause massive problems for many u s farmers and now many of those farmers may not be able to get the fertilizer that they need at all due to railroad mandated shipping reductions the following comes directly from a notice released by cf industries cf industries holdings inc nyse cf a leading global manufacturer of hydrogen and nitrogen products today informed customers it serves by union pacific rail lines that railroad mandated shipping reductions would result in nitrogen fertilizer shipment delays during the spring application season and that it would be unable to accept new rail sales involving union pacific for the foreseeable future the company understands that it is one of only 30 companies to face these restrictions cf industries ships to customers via union pacific rail lines primarily from its donaldsonville complex in louisiana and its port neal complex in iowa the rail lines serve key agricultural areas such as iowa illinois kansas nebraska texas and california products that will be affected include nitrogen fertilizers such as urea and urea ammonium nitrate uan as well as diesel exhaust fluid def an emissions control product required for diesel trucks cf industries is the largest producer of urea uan and def in north america and its donaldsonville complex is the largest single production facility for the products in north america i was astounded to hear that 30 different companies will be affected by these reductions someone at union pacific needs to give us some straight answers about what is really going on because the ceo of cf industries says that this change could not come at a worse time for farmers we are primarily funded by readers please subscribe and donate to support us the timing of this action by union pacific could not come at a worse time for farmers said tony will president and chief executive officer cf industries holdings inc not only will fertilizer be delayed by these shipping restrictions but additional fertilizer needed to complete spring applications may be unable to reach farmers at all by placing this arbitrary restriction on just a handful of shippers union pacific is jeopardizing farmers harvests and increasing the cost of food for consumers of course this comes in the aftermath of a disastrous winter wheat harvest in the united states and the winter wheat harvest over in china is being called the worst in history so we desperately need a really good growing season in the months ahead and now that is being jeopardized by more supply chain issues at the same time the new bird flu pandemic in the u s just continues to intensify on friday we learned that idaho has become the 27th u s state to have confirmed cases at a commercial facility on friday the u s department of agriculture announced yet another outbreak this one in two flocks in idaho making that the 27th state in which the virus has been found since february according to the usda the price of a dozen eggs in november hovered around 1 right now that price is 2 95 and rising the cost of eggs has already gone completely nuts and it is only going to go higher if you don t eat eggs or anything that contains eggs then this will not affect you unfortunately the vast majority of us will be affected by this and we are being warned that this pandemic could get a lot worse in the months ahead of course the cost of chicken meat and the cost of turkey meat will both continue to soar as well in fact one of my readers just wrote to let me know that the price of chicken breasts at his local store shot up 43 percent i thought i would give you a quick update on inflation food shortages i just got back from the dollar general store in holden mo i was going to buy some tyson chicken breasts to stock up for the future they went from 6 95 to 9 95 that s a 43 jump in price there was plenty of them 6 packages but i just felt like i couldn t afford them so i didn t buy any michael have you heard anything about shortages of crackers i had to wait 4 months for a certain type of cracker to get restocked in the dollar general store i also have been having a lot of trouble getting saltine crackers at our local grocery store 2 weeks ago they finally had 1 box of the type i buy and i grabbed it up immediately this week none again not sure what the problem is gas here is 3 49 diesel fuel is 4 69 i feel sorry for the guys that have these big diesel pickups with 40 gallon fuel tanks i have been combining shopping and errands in 1 trip plus letting my pickup set in the driveway to conserve gas a lot of the factors that are contributing to this growing global food crisis are outside of our control but if we could at least bring a halt to the shooting in ukraine that would give us a ray of hope unfortunately negotiations have totally broken down and u s secretary of state antony blinken just told cnn that the war could continue through the end of the year secretary of state antony blinken told washington s european allies that the us believes the war in ukraine could last through the end of 2022 cnn reported friday citing two european officials the report said that many western officials have assessed there s no short term end in sight for the war and public comments from us officials have reflected this national security advisor jake sullivan has warned of a protracted conflict that he said could go on for months or even longer ukraine and russia usually account for approximately 30 percent of all global wheat exports and so we desperately need that war to end sadly that isn t going to happen these days it seems as though almost everything that can go wrong for global food production is going wrong and the stage is being set for the sort of horrific global famine that i have been relentlessly warning about our leaders may be able to print money but they can t print food if you are waiting for them to wave their magic wands and conjure up a perfect solution to this crisis then i am afraid that you are going to be bitterly bitterly disappointed
joining me now is news national correspondent james packard in los angeles where concerns are growing that trans pacific trade from china could again be derailed further complicating the global supply chain and potentially worsening price increases james what s driving all of this yeah and the president addressed this today natalie there is some serious concern about the way that china is approaching the coronavirus and particularly in shanghai which has a critical part right now that is stranding hundreds of ships out at sea waiting to get into that sport which obviously could have a direct impact on trade across the pacific here to los angeles and to give you a sense of how strict the restrictions are in the city there in shanghai there s a video that i want you to watch and what s happening in this video is police in hazmat suits are forcibly isolating covid patients from an apartment complex you can hear the shouts of anger and the cries of terror for people there who didn t want these people separated and are terrified about what s going to happen to them just watch this oh it s i mean just sheer terror in those voices natalie that s the severity of restrictions happening in china as we speak obviously if you have a critical part in a city like that it raises a lot of concern uh there is some optimism though among experts because this isn t a blanket policy across china and there are other critical ports around the country that can still supply some of that trans pacific trade yes it s tough to see how that situation is being treated in china and james china s trade with russia is way up as sanctions and war cut off most channels from russia to the west so what is that going to do to global trade yeah there s some serious concern about famine really around the world i mean it takes for instance that ukraine and russia supplied 20 and 30 of the world s wheat and corn and now you re looking at a a sort of cocktail of factors that are creating massive disruptions in those supplies and could come down hard on already food insecure people i want you to listen to what the head of the world trade organization had to say the most immediate economic effect of the war has been a sharp spike in the prices of food energy fertilizer and some important minerals for which ukraine and russia key suppliers the world market a potential food crisis is looming i mean there s no more stark way to put it except perhaps how janet yellen phrased it a little earlier today she s talking about what s going to happen next week as economic leaders convened in washington and she said a primary concern for them natalie is going to be in her words how to stave off global starvation definitely something that will be watching as this moves forward my goodness james packard in los angeles we thank you james advertisement the biggest risk to the global economy no one is talking about share copy link copy nearly 400 million people across 45 cities in china are under full or partial lockdown as part of china s strict zero covid policy together they represent 40 or 7 2 trillion of annual gross domestic product for the world s second largest economy according to data from nomura holdings analysts are ringing warning bells but say investors aren t properly assessing how serious the global economic fallout might be from these prolonged isolation orders global markets may still underestimate the impact because much attention remains focused on the russian ukraine conflict and u s federal reserve rate hikes lu ting nomura s chief china economist and colleagues wrote in a note last week most alarming is the indefinite lockdown in shanghai a city of 25 million and one of china s premier manufacturing and export hubs the quarantines there have led to food shortages inability to access medical care and even reported pet killings they ve also left the largest port in the world understaffed the port of shanghai which handled over 20 of chinese freight traffic in 2021 is essentially at a standstill food supplies stuck in shipping containers without access to refrigeration are rotting incoming cargo is now stuck at shanghai marine terminals for an average of eight days before it s transported elsewhere a 75 increase since the recent round of lockdowns began export storage time has fallen but that s likely because there are no new containers being sent to the docks from warehouses according to supply chain visibility platform project44 cargo airlines have canceled all flights in and out of the city and more than 90 of trucks supporting import and export deliveries are currently out of action shanghai produces 6 of china s exports according to the government s statistical yearbook for 2021 and factory closures in and around the city are further rattling supply chains sony and apple supplier plants in and around shanghai are idle quanta the world s biggest contract notebook manufacturer and a macbook maker has stopped production entirely the plant accounts for about 20 of quanta s notebook production capacity and the company previously estimated it would ship 72 million units this year tesla has shuttered its shanghai giga factory which produced about 2 000 electric cars a day on friday china s ministry of industry and information technology said in a statement that it sent a taskforce to shanghai to work on a plan to resume production at 666 key manufacturers in the locked down city tesla executives hope they ll be allowed to reopen their doors by monday ending the factory s longest pause since its 2019 opening the automaker has lost over 50 000 units of production thus far according to materials reviewed by reuters the impact on china is major and the knock on effects on the global economy are quite significant said michael hirson eurasia group s practice head for china and northeast asia i think we re in for more volatility and economic and social disruption for at least the next six months the prolonged disruptions to chinese manufacturing and shipping could help accelerate a key biden administration initiative aimed at reducing u s dependence on chinese products and supply chains but the task comes with serious immediate economic repercussions in a report released last week the world trade organization warned of a worst case scenario involving decoupling global economies spurred on by russia s invasion of ukraine could reduce long term global gdp by 5 that s highly unlikely given the deep financial connections between china and the us investment in each others stocks and bonds reached 3 3 trillion at the end of 2020 according to data from rhodium group these are still very intertwined economies said hirson that integration is not something that s going to be easily reversed because it would be incredibly costly for the u s and for the global economy still american economic leaders believe decoupling is already underway oaktree co founder howard marks wrote in late march that the pendulum swung back towards local sourcing and away from globalization blackrock chairman larry fink echoed the sentiment in a letter to the company s shareholders the russian invasion of ukraine he wrote has put an end to globalization we have experienced over the last three decades in a speech to the atlantic council last week treasury secretary janet yellen said the u s is watching china s political and economic connections to russia closely going forward it will be increasingly difficult to separate economic issues from broader considerations of national interest including national security she said while she said she hopes a bipolar split between china and the u s can be avoided the world s attitude towards china and its willingness to embrace further economic integration may well be affected by china s reaction to our call for resolute action on russia a third of china meanwhile is stuck in quarantine and its economy is suffering china s recent pandemic response is likely to cost at least 46 billion in lost economic output per month or 3 1 of gdp according to research from the chinese university of hong kong analysts no longer believe that china s 2022 target of 5 5 economic growth the country s least ambitious goal in three decades is realistic the world bank revised its estimates for chinese economic growth this week to 5 but noted that if its restrictive policies continue that could fall to 4 the economic burdens come at a politically precarious moment this fall chinese president xi jinping will petition for a third term as the nation s leader breaking with the tradition of a two term maximum

if you walked the streets of depaul s lincoln park campus on the morning of good friday the setting might feel off in comparison to its usual hustle and bustle with no students gathered outside arts and letters hall no one sitting on the steps outside the levan center and no one entering and exiting the revolving doors of the student center you might think the campus was empty it wasn t while many students and faculty had vacated campus to enjoy a long easter weekend depaul s facility operations employees were hard at work it s an opportunity at moments like this when students and staff aren t around that we can get in here to fine tune things said danny cruz the head custodian of the schmitt academic center cruz and his crew use days like the friday of a holiday weekend to accomplish things they typically wouldn t get to on a regular school day we have thousands of students here so there s wear and tear cruz said we can do things like paint and touch things up there s always so much to do the details that facility operations maintains affect students more than many might realize according to kellen brown the executive vice president of depaul s student government association even though you may not see it these are the people that are making sure that everything goes efficiently and smoothly for all of our students brown said i m blown away by the amount of work they juggle too overwhelmed depaul s custodial crews like cruz s are just one piece of facility operations the department manages numerous aspects of campus such as public safety emergency management parking and housing management and more while depaul has grown both in physical size and student enrollment over the past half century one constant has partly witnessed and played a role in this growth and development depaul s vice president of facility operations bob janis on oct 31 janis will retire from a 48 year career working at depaul as head of facility operations janis oversees a department that employs 173 full time depaul workers and nearly 200 contracted employees bob janis he sets the example cruz said he commands authority but in the same token he s really went to bat for me in many ways because that s who bob is as a person while some of janis employees currently see him as an esteemed and accomplished department head that hasn t always been his place at depaul janis first stepped foot on depaul s lincoln park campus in 1974 to interview for a custodian job in the vincentian residence to fill in for an injured employee what was supposed to be a six month stint at a temporary position turned into a year and a half for the chicago native afterwards janis was given a permanent custodial job i was scrubbing bathrooms cleaning toilets and doing whatever else needed to be done janis said slowly but surely janis began to move up the ranks after working in the vincentian residence janis started working in the residence hall and later moved to work with the on campus carpenter from there janis was pulled into what was then called the physical plant office where he began managing small construction and remodeling projects i was blessed to have people in positions above me who were observing that i wanted to work hard and i wanted to do more janis said they gave me opportunities and gave me a chance to learn from them and grow with them as he moved up the ranks as a depaul employee janis also took steps to better his life through education while working as a custodian in mccabe hall janis formed relationships with its residents many of whom were mba and law students i interacted quite a bit with that group i said i want to be more like these guys janis said i need to go to school i need higher education in my life like his methodical rise through facility operations janis gradually made his way towards two degrees over the course of 11 years he attended night classes and earned a bachelor s degree from depaul s school of continuing and professional studies in 1982 and a master s degree in interdisciplinary studies from the college of liberal arts and social sciences in 1986 all while working here janis said been rocking and rolling every day to get this place clean and to make sure kids can come in knowing that danny cruz head custodian schmitt academic center throughout the past 48 years at depaul janis has seen depaul grow in physical size from under a million square feet to over five million square feet today between the loop and lincoln park campuses facility operations is at the forefront of physical planning of projects on campus making decisions on what a new building s layout should look like or the methods of renovation that should take place over the years janis has played a significant role in the physical assembly of depaul university that current students like brown are familiar with today for me my favorite building is arts and letters brown said he presided over the construction of that building the richardson library the music school the list goes on and on he s the glue that holds depaul together for members of facility operations continuity like janis tenure of almost 50 years has been instrumental to the group s long term success by my count our divisional leadership team has over 150 years of collective depaul experience said richard wiltse director of facility operations when the leadership team has worked together for so long it a cohesive and effective team janis and facility operations have also had to navigate disasters at depaul wednesday marked the 30 year anniversary of the chicago flood of 1992 an event that facility operations had their hands full with at depaul s loop campus there was 30 plus feet of water in the lower levels of the lewis center building janis said all the primary mechanical equipment and electrical gear was underwater we had to shut down everything facility operations have been the primary force in managing recent crises too the covid 19 pandemic brought on many changes at depaul and crews had to roll with the punches the team has done much to enable students to learn in a safe environment from extensive cleaning practices to renovating workstations for increased safety protocols during the pandemic we took it to another level cruz said been rocking and rolling every day to get this place clean and to make sure kids can come in knowing that if you ask janis how he s been able to accomplish so much at depaul he ll tell you in his calm yet commanding voice that all of his success is due to those that surround him janis said the key is filling the department with talented workers from top to bottom you have to make sure that you always have the right people in place to deal with all the moving parts janis said make sure you have properly trained individuals that all touch some component of a very complicated and dynamic operation nothing moves forward without them although some depaul students might not realize it this cohesive team has a big part in students education the department s web page on depaul s website explains that facility operations is a service department that provides for the effective operation and maintenance of depaul university s buildings and campus grounds facility operations stock supplies in campus bathrooms repair broken elevators and remove snow for easy access to campus buildings amongst countless other responsibilities i always hope that everybody understands that everybody from the top to bottom works really hard on behalf of the entire community here janis said but first and foremost especially for the students we re here to serve
joining me now is news national correspondent james packard in los angeles where concerns are growing that trans pacific trade from china could again be derailed further complicating the global supply chain and potentially worsening price increases james what s driving all of this yeah and the president addressed this today natalie there is some serious concern about the way that china is approaching the coronavirus and particularly in shanghai which has a critical part right now that is stranding hundreds of ships out at sea waiting to get into that sport which obviously could have a direct impact on trade across the pacific here to los angeles and to give you a sense of how strict the restrictions are in the city there in shanghai there s a video that i want you to watch and what s happening in this video is police in hazmat suits are forcibly isolating covid patients from an apartment complex you can hear the shouts of anger and the cries of terror for people there who didn t want these people separated and are terrified about what s going to happen to them just watch this oh it s i mean just sheer terror in those voices natalie that s the severity of restrictions happening in china as we speak obviously if you have a critical part in a city like that it raises a lot of concern uh there is some optimism though among experts because this isn t a blanket policy across china and there are other critical ports around the country that can still supply some of that trans pacific trade yes it s tough to see how that situation is being treated in china and james china s trade with russia is way up as sanctions and war cut off most channels from russia to the west so what is that going to do to global trade yeah there s some serious concern about famine really around the world i mean it takes for instance that ukraine and russia supplied 20 and 30 of the world s wheat and corn and now you re looking at a a sort of cocktail of factors that are creating massive disruptions in those supplies and could come down hard on already food insecure people i want you to listen to what the head of the world trade organization had to say the most immediate economic effect of the war has been a sharp spike in the prices of food energy fertilizer and some important minerals for which ukraine and russia key suppliers the world market a potential food crisis is looming i mean there s no more stark way to put it except perhaps how janet yellen phrased it a little earlier today she s talking about what s going to happen next week as economic leaders convened in washington and she said a primary concern for them natalie is going to be in her words how to stave off global starvation definitely something that will be watching as this moves forward my goodness james packard in los angeles we thank you james advertisement the biggest risk to the global economy no one is talking about share copy link copy nearly 400 million people across 45 cities in china are under full or partial lockdown as part of china s strict zero covid policy together they represent 40 or 7 2 trillion of annual gross domestic product for the world s second largest economy according to data from nomura holdings analysts are ringing warning bells but say investors aren t properly assessing how serious the global economic fallout might be from these prolonged isolation orders global markets may still underestimate the impact because much attention remains focused on the russian ukraine conflict and u s federal reserve rate hikes lu ting nomura s chief china economist and colleagues wrote in a note last week most alarming is the indefinite lockdown in shanghai a city of 25 million and one of china s premier manufacturing and export hubs the quarantines there have led to food shortages inability to access medical care and even reported pet killings they ve also left the largest port in the world understaffed the port of shanghai which handled over 20 of chinese freight traffic in 2021 is essentially at a standstill food supplies stuck in shipping containers without access to refrigeration are rotting incoming cargo is now stuck at shanghai marine terminals for an average of eight days before it s transported elsewhere a 75 increase since the recent round of lockdowns began export storage time has fallen but that s likely because there are no new containers being sent to the docks from warehouses according to supply chain visibility platform project44 cargo airlines have canceled all flights in and out of the city and more than 90 of trucks supporting import and export deliveries are currently out of action shanghai produces 6 of china s exports according to the government s statistical yearbook for 2021 and factory closures in and around the city are further rattling supply chains sony and apple supplier plants in and around shanghai are idle quanta the world s biggest contract notebook manufacturer and a macbook maker has stopped production entirely the plant accounts for about 20 of quanta s notebook production capacity and the company previously estimated it would ship 72 million units this year tesla has shuttered its shanghai giga factory which produced about 2 000 electric cars a day on friday china s ministry of industry and information technology said in a statement that it sent a taskforce to shanghai to work on a plan to resume production at 666 key manufacturers in the locked down city tesla executives hope they ll be allowed to reopen their doors by monday ending the factory s longest pause since its 2019 opening the automaker has lost over 50 000 units of production thus far according to materials reviewed by reuters the impact on china is major and the knock on effects on the global economy are quite significant said michael hirson eurasia group s practice head for china and northeast asia i think we re in for more volatility and economic and social disruption for at least the next six months the prolonged disruptions to chinese manufacturing and shipping could help accelerate a key biden administration initiative aimed at reducing u s dependence on chinese products and supply chains but the task comes with serious immediate economic repercussions in a report released last week the world trade organization warned of a worst case scenario involving decoupling global economies spurred on by russia s invasion of ukraine could reduce long term global gdp by 5 that s highly unlikely given the deep financial connections between china and the us investment in each others stocks and bonds reached 3 3 trillion at the end of 2020 according to data from rhodium group these are still very intertwined economies said hirson that integration is not something that s going to be easily reversed because it would be incredibly costly for the u s and for the global economy still american economic leaders believe decoupling is already underway oaktree co founder howard marks wrote in late march that the pendulum swung back towards local sourcing and away from globalization blackrock chairman larry fink echoed the sentiment in a letter to the company s shareholders the russian invasion of ukraine he wrote has put an end to globalization we have experienced over the last three decades in a speech to the atlantic council last week treasury secretary janet yellen said the u s is watching china s political and economic connections to russia closely going forward it will be increasingly difficult to separate economic issues from broader considerations of national interest including national security she said while she said she hopes a bipolar split between china and the u s can be avoided the world s attitude towards china and its willingness to embrace further economic integration may well be affected by china s reaction to our call for resolute action on russia a third of china meanwhile is stuck in quarantine and its economy is suffering china s recent pandemic response is likely to cost at least 46 billion in lost economic output per month or 3 1 of gdp according to research from the chinese university of hong kong analysts no longer believe that china s 2022 target of 5 5 economic growth the country s least ambitious goal in three decades is realistic the world bank revised its estimates for chinese economic growth this week to 5 but noted that if its restrictive policies continue that could fall to 4 the economic burdens come at a politically precarious moment this fall chinese president xi jinping will petition for a third term as the nation s leader breaking with the tradition of a two term maximum

it comes as no surprise that some influencers don t care to even check what they are promoting and on top of that they often don t even put disclaimers that they re being paid to promote a project despite regulatory requirements to do so this has often led to multiple problems the nft scams and sketchy projects attract a large number of supporters drawn in investors lose money and their creators ditch the projects running off with millions of dollars the bored bunny project is just one of the most recent examples of a slow rug pull that caused the project to fall apart after raising over 20 million bored bunny nfts became quite popular and its community rapidly expanded due to influencer and celebrity marketing the project was hyped and promoted by various famous figures including dj khaled french montana jake paul floyd mayweather and david dobrik bored bunny nfts which were ready to take over the metaverse and nft space launched in december 2021 with 4 999 nfts priced at 0 4 eth each about the bored bunny nft scam top tier nft scam detective zachbxt recently revealed details about the rug pull according to him one obvious red flag on the official website s benefits utilities section was the promised benefit of 2x 5x or maybe even 10x the value of your investment within a few days the first bored bunny collection sold out within an hour raising 2000 eth 7 5m usd and 916 eth 3m usd in secondary sales the profits were then distributed from the bored bunny contract to seven other unknown wallets soon after the first collection the bored bunny team announced another nft drop 11 111 bored bad bunnies priced at 0 4 eth which swiftly generated 3 195 eth 10 1m usd and 95 eth 300 000 usd in secondary sales for the project a few days later a third collection named bored mutant bunny appeared this set featured 3 000 nfts with individual valuations of 0 25 eth according to zachxbt this was the moment the community began to suspect that something was off about the project only 532 nfts out of 3 000 were sold from the third collection while the floor prices of the three bb collections plummeted below their original prices the project s founders then suddenly became inactive and disappeared for a month the founder known as jeff returned after some time explaining his absence to the public with a ridiculous excuse primarily the reason of my absence this last month was that i have been through a lot of the emails messages in private then he promised to refund holders 600 000 and send free bored bunny merchandise to the nft holders many ridiculed his generosity demanded their money back and called him a scammer who stole millions from investors influencer marketing and money laundering famous youtuber and co owner of esports organisation faze clan knowledgeable in nfts faze banks disclosed a message in which the bored bunny founders asked him to promote their project offering to pay 500 000 750 000 for a 10 second video

counts of wire fraud and conspiracy to commit money laundering the project founders could face a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison on the flipside rug pull nft projects damage the image of the

by gertrude chavez dreyfuss new york reuters the dollar rose to a fresh two year high on monday in thin and choppy trading in line with higher u s treasury yields as investors braced for multiple half a percentage point rate hikes from the federal reserve volume was light on the day with hong kong european australian and new zealand markets closed for easter monday the u s rate futures market has priced in a 96 chance of a 50 basis point tightening at next month s fed policy meeting and about 215 basis points in cumulative rate increases in 2022 providing ample support for the dollar the greenback also climbed to a new 20 year peak of 126 98 yen versus the japanese currency highlighting the contrast in monetary policy between a hawkish fed and an ultra dovish bank of japan the benchmark meanwhile touched a three year high of 2 884 the a gauge of the greenback s value against six major currencies surged to 100 86 the highest since april 2020 it was last up 0 3 at 100 77 there is indeed history that when the fed plans for hiking and tightening the buck ends up losing during those cycles but at the moment there is little in optimism out there that can knock the buck down said juan perez director of fx trading at monex usa in washington speculators net long bets on the u s dollar fell for a second straight week according to calculations by reuters and u s commodity futures trading commission data released on friday the value of the net long dollar position was 13 22 billion for the week ended april 12 the currency positioning lacked a clear sense of narrative for the reduction in u s dollar bullish sentiment while a further rise in bearish bets in the swiss franc and the yen reflected the u s dollar s yield advantage over these two currencies whose respective central banks remain far from tightening policy scotiabank said in a research note the yen on the other hand earlier came off a 20 year low after both bank of japan governor haruhiko kuroda and finance minister shunichi suzuki voiced concerns about their weakening currency the rally proved short lived as the yen hit a fresh 20 year trough in the new york session and was last up 0 3 at 126 93 yen there s growing speculation about fx intervention to save the yen although that seems unlikely marios hadjikyriacos senior investment analyst at forex broker xm wrote in a research note japan would have to intervene alone since the americans and europeans wouldn t agree to weaken their own currencies in this inflationary environment and japanese authorities haven t even described the moves as disorderly yet to foreshadow action across the atlantic the euro hamstrung by a lack of clarity on when rates in the euro zone would rise was down 0 3 at 1 0782 just off last week s low of 1 0758 a level unseen since april 2020 currency bid prices at 3 17pm 1917 gmt description ric last u s close pct change ytd pct high bid low bid previous change session dollar index 100 7800 100 5100 0 28 5 349 100 8600 100 5000 euro dollar 1 0780 1 0810 0 27 5 17 1 0821 1 0770 dollar yen 126 9200 126 5600 0 30 10 27 126 9750 126 2500 euro yen 136 81 136 63 0 13 4 98 137 0200 136 4700 dollar swiss 0 9444 0 9436 0 08 3 53 0 9453 0 9424 sterling dollar 1 3007 1 3058 0 38 3 81 1 3064 1 3005 dollar canadian 1 2615 1 2616 0 02 0 23 1 2644 1 2606 aussie dollar 0 7349 0 7390 0 55 1 11 0 7403 0 7347 euro swiss 1 0179 1 0189 0 10 1 83 1 0201 1 0175 euro sterling 0 8287 0 8277 0 11 1 35 0 8296 0 8274 nz 0 6725 0 6763 0 58 1 77 0 6776 0 6717 dollar dollar dollar norway 8 8605 8 8170 0 46 0 54 8 8615 8 8250 euro norway 9 5545 9 5150 0 42 4 58 9 5635 9 5133 dollar sweden 9 5984 9 5479 0 16 6 44 9 6152 9 5611 euro sweden 10 3482 10 3202 0 16 1 12 10 3617 10 3259
the dollar rose against all the major currencies last week but the british pound which eked out a small gain in the holiday shortened week the weakest was the japanese yen where rising us yields exerts an irresistible tug lifting the dollar to new 20 year highs yet the 50 basis point hikes from the and the bank of canada did not prevent their currencies from succumbing to the greenback s surge falling around 1 1 and 0 35 respectively surging inflation was insufficient to give the ecb an added sense of urgency and a disappointed market took the euro to its lowest level since may 2020 slightly below 1 0760 the powerful rally extended last week and the dollar index reached slightly above 100 75 its highest level in almost two years with the small advance 0 2 before the weekend the dollar index has risen in 11 of the past 12 sessions the pandemic high from march 2020 was 103 00 the macd is increasing as it has since the start of the month but remains below the peak set on march 15 the slow stochastic did not confirm last week s high and has flatlined in the overextended territory the dollar index has been fraying the upper bollinger band for the past couple of weeks it begins the new week around 100 70 support is seen in the 99 40 99 60 band is there a bull case for the common currency which is fallen in all but four of the year s first 15 weeks the interest rate differential means one is paid to be long dollars the divergence of monetary policy suggests that the policy rate differential will widen further the dramatic rise in energy prices and the threat of further disruption of supplies also contribute to its vulnerability there are also 4 7 mln refugees from ukraine what a contrast to the arab spring reaction a decade ago the tightness of the french presidential contest may also deter some who want to pick a bottom in the euro the frustration with the ecb s unwillingness to bring forward the end of its bond purchases spurred a drop in the euro that took it slightly below 1 0750 as stops were triggered when 1 08 was given there isn t much ahead of the march 2020 low near 1 0600 there is scope for the macd to fall further but the slow stochastic is oversold and moving sideways a move above the 1 0925 1 0950 area is needed to be anything of note the dollar has appreciated against the yen for the past 11 sessions the us yield uncoincidentally has risen in nine of those sessions as one would expect the momentum indicators are stretched but do not seem poised to turn lower japanese official comments the jawboning have been largely limited to comments about the pace of the move not the level speculative participants trend followers and momentum traders have not found the official pain threshold in the past some us industries e g autos have complained about the yen s weakness but so far nothing interestingly some parts of japanese industry have begun expressing concern about yen weakness we had suggested a break above the jpy126 50 area would target jpy130 and more participants seem to recognize this possibility based on current volatility it could be seen over the next few weeks on the downside initial support is likely jpy124 50 jpy125 00 sterling posted a key upside reversal on april 13 initially the selling pressure pushed it to around 1 2975 its lowest level since november 2020 it then rallied and closed above the previous day s high there was follow through the following day to almost 1 3150 before stalling the macd is going sideways which is understandable from march 15 to april 15 net net sterling is virtually flat still the slow stochastic has turned up despite intrasession violations sterling was unable to close below 1 30 sterling needs to re establish a foothold above 1 32 to confirm a low is in place this coming week s data highlights are the march and the preliminary both are expected to reflect the more challenging economic times the swaps market is pricing in less than a 1 in 4 chance of a 50 bp hike at the may 5 boe meeting compared with 98 at the fomc meeting the day before the canadian economy may be the fastest growing among the major economies in q1 with around a 4 annualized pace atlanta fed s gdp tracker says 1 1 for the us the central bank is the first g7 central bank by 50 bp its balance sheet will begin shrinking before the end of the month and the canadian dollar has fallen in seven of the past nine sessions the drag on the canadian dollar did not come from the rate differential that saw the small premium halved to about four basis points nor did the headwind come from prices june wti gained around 12 5 a barrel last week instead it faces two challenges first the market is already discounting an aggressive tightening sequence by the bank of canada the bonds bought during covid have a shorter average maturity than other central banks that suggests the rollover may be faster second the canadian dollar is susceptible to risk appetites as expressed by the movement of the the s p 500 fell in seven of the past eight sessions the cad1 2675 cad1 2700 band may offer formidable resistance the macd is rising gently but the slow stochastic is overextended and could turn lower early next week support is seen around cad1 2525 cad1 2550 the australian dollar has fallen in seven of the past eight sessions it has fallen for three consecutive weeks the longest decline this year the aussie consolidated with a lower bias for the last several sessions it has been unable to distance itself from the 0 7400 support area that frayed a bit last week it traded below 0 7400 on an intraday basis for a few sessions before settling below there ahead of the weekend the next technical target is closer to 0 7350 if the rally from the january low 0 6970 is over there may be scope toward 0 7300 which is also where the 200 day moving average is found the macd and slow stochastic are falling and the latter is stretched a note of caution comes from the lower bollinger band that begins the new week slightly below 0 7390 the peso s surge continued last week starting march 11 it has only fallen in four sessions such strong one direction moves often seem to spark sizeable counter trend moves the average dollar bounce during this period has been almost 0 8 that is what happened last week truckers paralyzed the texas border and the greenback jumped nearly 1 on april 14 it rose to around mxn20 0280 just shy of the 20 day moving average the 20 day moving average begins the new week around mxn20 0165 and the dollar has not closed above it for a month the macd bottomed in early april and has been gently rising the slow stochastic traded higher at the start of the month but turned down early last week the economic highlight in the week ahead is the bi weekly figures on april 22 the headline may slow 7 5 vs 7 6 but the may push above 7 for the first time in this cycle banxico is expected to lift rates another 50 bp when it meets again on may 12 we suspect the most likely scenario for the exchange rate is a consolidative phase a move above mxn20 20 would point instead to a correction that could see mxn20 60 the us dollar is trading near the upper end of this year s range against the chinese yuan the high was set on march 31 around cny6 3860 last week s high set on april 14 was slightly above cny6 38 but it did post the highest close for the year cny6 3785 the lower end of the range over the past month is about cny6 34 last week was the first week since early january that the greenback held above cny6 36 the wobbled a bit after the small reduction in reserve requirements was announced before the weekend the one year medium term was left unchanged defying market expectations net net if anything it was slightly firmer after the cut than before but still in a narrow range we suspect the chinese currency is particularly vulnerable the it offered over the us on is now a small discount the stock market is underperforming most of the other large markets the free float index of the top 300 a share stocks listed on the shanghai or shenzhen exchanges is off a little more than 15 through the middle of april this speaks to the loss of the portfolio channel of support for the yuan the impact of covid and the lockdown response will have a significant economic impact officials seem slow to mobilize the state

on april 14 houston american energy corp husa saw another upsurge which was soon followed by corrections in the after hours it seems investors are trying to make some more profits from the stock during the regular session hus shot up by 38 46 to reach 4 86 a share following this the stock fell under corrections to reach 4 55 apiece in the after hours thus the stock declined by 6 38 in the after hours session there is no official news or sec filing from the company behind the latest upsurge what has been happening with husa last month the russian invasion of ukraine and increasing sanctions against the country caused a spike in oil prices oil prices went well over 100 per barrel to reach near all time highs while other gas and other energy prices also saw an uptick this resulted in increased enthusiasm toward oil and gas companies while having been a relatively unknown stock husa came under the light in the oil and gas rally in meme like sessions the stock exploded and went from 2 per share to as much as 16 a share in a matter of days but the huge uptrend was then followed by corrections and profit booking caused the stock to give back most of its gains a major contributor to this was a pullback in oil prices crude oil has started going down and has dropped back to below 100 a barrel while its went as high as 126 a barrel what now after shedding most of its gains husa has been trading around the 3 price level recently but it seems investors are not done with the stock yet remaining slightly bullish the stock once again burst out on friday to register some big gains but like always the gains were then followed by corrections in the after hours in the week ending april 22 oil prices are expected to be weighed down by supply disruptions in libya and further reductions in the russian oil supply hence it is most likely that investors wanted to make some more gains from the stock before oil prices cause its shares to plunge down being a small independent oil exploration and production company husa s operating performance relies heavily on crude oil and natural gas prices conclusion investors in a race for making some more profits drove husa up on friday before the market situation bring in some more woes for the company with a further hit down expected at oil prices in the ongoing week husa gave some gains to investors before succumbing to corrections in the after hours
joining me now is news national correspondent james packard in los angeles where concerns are growing that trans pacific trade from china could again be derailed further complicating the global supply chain and potentially worsening price increases james what s driving all of this yeah and the president addressed this today natalie there is some serious concern about the way that china is approaching the coronavirus and particularly in shanghai which has a critical part right now that is stranding hundreds of ships out at sea waiting to get into that sport which obviously could have a direct impact on trade across the pacific here to los angeles and to give you a sense of how strict the restrictions are in the city there in shanghai there s a video that i want you to watch and what s happening in this video is police in hazmat suits are forcibly isolating covid patients from an apartment complex you can hear the shouts of anger and the cries of terror for people there who didn t want these people separated and are terrified about what s going to happen to them just watch this oh it s i mean just sheer terror in those voices natalie that s the severity of restrictions happening in china as we speak obviously if you have a critical part in a city like that it raises a lot of concern uh there is some optimism though among experts because this isn t a blanket policy across china and there are other critical ports around the country that can still supply some of that trans pacific trade yes it s tough to see how that situation is being treated in china and james china s trade with russia is way up as sanctions and war cut off most channels from russia to the west so what is that going to do to global trade yeah there s some serious concern about famine really around the world i mean it takes for instance that ukraine and russia supplied 20 and 30 of the world s wheat and corn and now you re looking at a a sort of cocktail of factors that are creating massive disruptions in those supplies and could come down hard on already food insecure people i want you to listen to what the head of the world trade organization had to say the most immediate economic effect of the war has been a sharp spike in the prices of food energy fertilizer and some important minerals for which ukraine and russia key suppliers the world market a potential food crisis is looming i mean there s no more stark way to put it except perhaps how janet yellen phrased it a little earlier today she s talking about what s going to happen next week as economic leaders convened in washington and she said a primary concern for them natalie is going to be in her words how to stave off global starvation definitely something that will be watching as this moves forward my goodness james packard in los angeles we thank you james advertisement the biggest risk to the global economy no one is talking about share copy link copy nearly 400 million people across 45 cities in china are under full or partial lockdown as part of china s strict zero covid policy together they represent 40 or 7 2 trillion of annual gross domestic product for the world s second largest economy according to data from nomura holdings analysts are ringing warning bells but say investors aren t properly assessing how serious the global economic fallout might be from these prolonged isolation orders global markets may still underestimate the impact because much attention remains focused on the russian ukraine conflict and u s federal reserve rate hikes lu ting nomura s chief china economist and colleagues wrote in a note last week most alarming is the indefinite lockdown in shanghai a city of 25 million and one of china s premier manufacturing and export hubs the quarantines there have led to food shortages inability to access medical care and even reported pet killings they ve also left the largest port in the world understaffed the port of shanghai which handled over 20 of chinese freight traffic in 2021 is essentially at a standstill food supplies stuck in shipping containers without access to refrigeration are rotting incoming cargo is now stuck at shanghai marine terminals for an average of eight days before it s transported elsewhere a 75 increase since the recent round of lockdowns began export storage time has fallen but that s likely because there are no new containers being sent to the docks from warehouses according to supply chain visibility platform project44 cargo airlines have canceled all flights in and out of the city and more than 90 of trucks supporting import and export deliveries are currently out of action shanghai produces 6 of china s exports according to the government s statistical yearbook for 2021 and factory closures in and around the city are further rattling supply chains sony and apple supplier plants in and around shanghai are idle quanta the world s biggest contract notebook manufacturer and a macbook maker has stopped production entirely the plant accounts for about 20 of quanta s notebook production capacity and the company previously estimated it would ship 72 million units this year tesla has shuttered its shanghai giga factory which produced about 2 000 electric cars a day on friday china s ministry of industry and information technology said in a statement that it sent a taskforce to shanghai to work on a plan to resume production at 666 key manufacturers in the locked down city tesla executives hope they ll be allowed to reopen their doors by monday ending the factory s longest pause since its 2019 opening the automaker has lost over 50 000 units of production thus far according to materials reviewed by reuters the impact on china is major and the knock on effects on the global economy are quite significant said michael hirson eurasia group s practice head for china and northeast asia i think we re in for more volatility and economic and social disruption for at least the next six months the prolonged disruptions to chinese manufacturing and shipping could help accelerate a key biden administration initiative aimed at reducing u s dependence on chinese products and supply chains but the task comes with serious immediate economic repercussions in a report released last week the world trade organization warned of a worst case scenario involving decoupling global economies spurred on by russia s invasion of ukraine could reduce long term global gdp by 5 that s highly unlikely given the deep financial connections between china and the us investment in each others stocks and bonds reached 3 3 trillion at the end of 2020 according to data from rhodium group these are still very intertwined economies said hirson that integration is not something that s going to be easily reversed because it would be incredibly costly for the u s and for the global economy still american economic leaders believe decoupling is already underway oaktree co founder howard marks wrote in late march that the pendulum swung back towards local sourcing and away from globalization blackrock chairman larry fink echoed the sentiment in a letter to the company s shareholders the russian invasion of ukraine he wrote has put an end to globalization we have experienced over the last three decades in a speech to the atlantic council last week treasury secretary janet yellen said the u s is watching china s political and economic connections to russia closely going forward it will be increasingly difficult to separate economic issues from broader considerations of national interest including national security she said while she said she hopes a bipolar split between china and the u s can be avoided the world s attitude towards china and its willingness to embrace further economic integration may well be affected by china s reaction to our call for resolute action on russia a third of china meanwhile is stuck in quarantine and its economy is suffering china s recent pandemic response is likely to cost at least 46 billion in lost economic output per month or 3 1 of gdp according to research from the chinese university of hong kong analysts no longer believe that china s 2022 target of 5 5 economic growth the country s least ambitious goal in three decades is realistic the world bank revised its estimates for chinese economic growth this week to 5 but noted that if its restrictive policies continue that could fall to 4 the economic burdens come at a politically precarious moment this fall chinese president xi jinping will petition for a third term as the nation s leader breaking with the tradition of a two term maximum
georgians are suffering through a surge in fentanyl overdoses as the synthetic opioid finds its way into more illicit substances across the state we re packing out clean syringes and taking the dirty ones we re also distributing naloxone a drug that can reverse the effects of opioid overdoses and training people how to use it we re covering pretty much all the bases from a harm reduction perspective probably keeping pace with atlanta said christian frazier executive director of focus on recovery augusta that being said we instituted this program a because it was necessary b because it helps us keep our finger on the pulse of the still using opioid community and it s bad fentanyl related overdose deaths have spiked since the start of the pandemic rising more than 106 between may 2020 and april 2021 according to the georgia department of public health the department has also reported at least 66 emergency department visits statewide involving drugs laced with fentanyl between february and mid march in some cases patients were brought in under what was assumed to be a stimulant overdose but they responded when given naloxone cocaine methamphetamine and counterfeit pills are the most common but other laced drugs including cannabis products have also resulted in emergency department visits dph said it seems like there s just fentanyl in nearly everything said mona bennett co founder of atlanta harm reduction coalition this past summer there were quite a few overdose deaths because of fentanyl laced cocaine fentanyl laced stimulants we had some naloxone distribution events at little five points east atlanta village some other places and in the past i had to beg stimulant users to please take some narcan a brand of naloxone but now that fentanyl is so common in stimulants it s an easier sell manufacturers mix fentanyl into their drugs to increase potency and lower costs but when users don t know their supply has fentanyl the dose they are accustomed to can be deadly there are test strips available that can quickly determine whether a substance contains fentanyl but they are in a legal gray area you can buy them online from places including amazon but a police officer could consider them a drug related object a bill on gov brian kemp s desk seeks to remove strips that test for fentanyl from the list of drug paraphernalia to help make them more accessible the governor has until may 14 to sign or veto the bill or to take no action and allow it to become law atlanta democratic state sen jen jordan who introduced the idea said she has been hearing from constituents who have lost loved ones to drugs laced with fentanyl she compared the idea with steps the state has already taken to reduce the harm of opioid overdoses like providing naloxone and passing a shield law that protects people who call 911 to report an overdose it s one of those things where it s hard to acknowledge that people are taking these drugs right that s not great she said but at the same time we ve got such a problem that if we don t acknowledge it and try to do something to mitigate the harm we re going to lose so many more people the change to the testing strip policy took a strange path to passage it was attached to a bill designed to legalize raw milk sales jordan said she had nearly given up on her test strip plan when she noticed the section of state law addressing adulterated food products like milk also addressed adulterated drugs so she felt amending it to include the test strip language would stand up to objection the bill s republican sponsors in both chambers agreed and it passed the senate 42 10 and the house 110 55 effective but pricey the strips work great if you can get your hands on them bennett said they typically require so small an amount of the substance that users can test using the residue on the container that was holding the drugs she said it takes literally a few seconds to get a result bennett said it s kind of the opposite of a pregnancy test where one stripe means that there is the presence of fentanyl in the substance test and two stripes is saying that it is not in the substance and there are always new analogs but the test strip does detect many of them bennett tells users to reduce their dose if their supply shows the presence of fentanyl no matter what the strip says she tells them to always have a friend nearby with narcan and gives them a hotline they can call if they have to use alone she said atlanta harm reduction s current supply of test strips is limited and comes from donations but she s hoping the rule change will mean more vendors will carry them and the price will drop right now a box of 100 single use test strips costs between 125 and 150 on average she said when you are serving a large population of daily users a buck and a half per strip can add up quickly especially for a nonprofit frazier said we get requests for it every single day we explain to them every single day why we don t carry it because it s expensive he said we just tell them listen assume that your dope has got fentanyl in it and use accordingly otherwise you re going to be back here tomorrow asking for more narcan if the price point was lower i would absolutely keep more of it in stock because i think that it has a multitude of uses not only for the active user community but for family members and allies spouses i wish it was cheaper telling heroin users to expect that their drugs contain fentanyl is not hyperbole said riley kirkpatrick program director at the athens based access point of georgia a study using spectrometers to analyze substances sold as heroin in georgia found 100 of samples contained fentanyl he said there s literally no such thing as heroin without fent in it anymore down here he said it is much more likely that people s heroin has fentanyl in it than it actually has heroin it s harder to justify allocating resources to test strips for heroin users when a negative test would be a surprise but the strips can come in handy for people who use other substances kirkpatrick said we really just give the fentanyl test strips to folks that are using other things that they re unsure of like especially now with pressed pills and there s a lot of pills that people don t know are pressed he said some pills bought from strangers or through social media can be marketed as and formed to look like prescription opioids but actually contain fentanyl those are the kinds of things where it helps even more like the fentanyl test strips actually helps them see if there is or isn t fent in their supply and with cocaine sometimes kirkpatrick added kirkpatrick said he was heartened by a group of students who came by around new year s eve who were planning on taking ecstasy but wanted to make sure their pills did not contain fentanyl we had college kids show up getting fent test strips because they were going to roll on e take ecstasy mdma and that just made me really happy he said with a laugh because we were able to supply them and they were able to test their stuff and make an informed decision as to what they were doing as harm reductionists we know that people are going to use no matter what but we can help them be safe jordan said she hopes a wider prevalence of test strips will help get the word out among those who are not regular opioid users that fentanyl could find its way into their drug of choice i think what we re seeing is especially a spike in terms of younger users recreational maybe girls weekend whatever it is she said we re not even talking about regular users so there is an opportunity for education here even talking about these strips

new delhi a growing list of risks is turning china into a potential quagmire for global investors the central question is what could happen in a country willing to go to great lengths to achieve its leader s goals president xi jinping s friendship with russian leader vladimir putin has made investors more distrustful of china while a strongman narrative is gaining momentum as the communist party doggedly pursues a covid zero strategy and unpredictable campaigns to regulate entire industries as a result some international investors are finding an aggressive allocation to china increasingly

giant due to concerns about human rights abuses us dollar private equity funds that invest in china raised just 1 4 billion in the first quarter the lowest figure since 2018 for the same period the

billion money manager sold all its china investments last year following beijing s interventions in high profile listings like didi global inc and ant group co saying such moves threatened shareholder rights china s more assertive rhetoric around hong kong and sovereignty claims in the south china sea also made the investment team uneasy edelsten said politics and governance factors should now set a cautious tone especially for long term commitments to china said edelsten adding that european measures taken against russia show that strong trade ties are no guarantee of diplomatic security the ukraine invasion raises these risks very sharply and our funds are likely to remain very lowly weighted in china for some years to come he added brendan ahern chief investment officer at krane funds advisors llc describes indiscriminate and price insensitive selling of chinese shares by international investors in the past year beijing s regulatory actions felt like an attack on the most respected

world bank building in washington dc and logo of the imf reuters file high profile pakistan delegation set to attend upcoming annual spring meeting of breton wood institutions revival of imf programme still remains a far cry with widening gap of twin deficits says news report miftah ismail likely to accompany delegation after removal of his name from ecl islamabad a high profile pakistan delegation is set to attend the upcoming annual spring meeting of the breton wood institutions bwis such as the international monetary fund imf and world bank wb in washington and likely to make fresh contacts with the imf on the sidelines of the meeting the news reported however with the existing widening gap on account of twin deficits including the budget and current account deficits for this fiscal year the revival of the imf programme still remains a far cry a top government official confirmed that the ministry of finance will hold a technical meeting with the imf this friday but there is no virtual meeting scheduled for review talks at this point the potential prime minister s adviser on finance miftah ismail also confirmed the participation of the pakistani team in the bwis meeting the official delegation will comprise the finance secretary state bank of pakistan sbp governor and additional secretary on external finance there is a chance that ismail also accompanies the delegation after his name is removed from the exit control list under the pml n led federal government the publication reported finance secretary hamid yaqoob told the news discussions with the imf are never halted there was an interregnum because there was no finance minister we have been sharing data with the imf now with the spring meeting next week our discussions have become more regular and focused on completing the 7th review however he did not mention any specific time frame for the completion of 7th review under the 6 billion extended fund facility eff in the wake of yawning twin deficits the revival of the imf programme will be highly difficult meanwhile the government s decision to keep petroleum prices unchanged also sent out wrong signals to the imf without changing the approach and doing away with the relief mechanism the revival of the imf programme will remain impossible when contacted renowned economist yousuf nazar who is also the author of a book on pakistan s economy said that the pol prices should be adjusted upward in a staggered or gradual manner he proposed to adopt a comprehensive approach whereby the unjustified subsidies for big industrialists such as for fertilizer sugar and other sectors to the tune of rs1 000 billion per annum should be abolished and diverted towards financing targeted fuel subsidies he also proposed that the fixation of the pricing mechanism of pol products should be made transparent and a parliamentary committee should be formed for allowing a public hearing to ascertain the facts and then transparently place the price fixation mechanism he suggested that russian oil should be purchased without violating international sanctions as being done by india he said that there was a mechanism available where a payment system through a third country could be placed and pakistan could import cheap oil with the help of such a mechanism from russia he also proposed that the pol import on deferred payment from china and other friendly countries could also be explored under the comprehensive strategy to combat with the arising challenging situation faced by pakistan s economy dr khaqan najeeb the former adviser at the ministry of finance told this reporter that subsidised energy pricing policies are a heavy burden on the exchequer and thus unsustainable on the other hand higher prices driven by the global commodity super cycle and the effect of rupee adjustment are hard to pass to the consumers already reeling under inflationary pressures he said there was a dire need to show prudence over populism the government has just come in and it is hoped that in the future after taking stock of the situation the pricing decision will be reconsidered a possible way is to pass the prices of petroleum products gradually to the extent of covering the full cost of the products the pdl and gst could be left at negligible levels dr khaqan explained that increasing the breadth and quantum of targeted subsidies is now possible because of new databases developed by the government to cover a larger populace other options like fuel cards linked to income support databases especially for motorcycle users for up to a certain amount at discounted prices and diesel fuel cards for public transporters and agriculturists using tube wells and tractors can be started targeted subsidies will help the government in taking the tough decision of eliminating general subsidies in the economy from which the rich and less privileged are all benefiting he concluded
like like love haha wow sad angry 1 thyblackman com to hear liberals talk about our founding fathers you d think they were nothing but a bunch of racist sexist neanderthals who only stopped raping and murdering anyone not white long enough to write some words conservatives revere for their awfulness these evil monsters existed to oppress trans people and stole everything they had from black people somehow change just a few of a adjectives and you re got yourself a pretty accurate description of the modern democrat party democrats have always been what they accuse us of being which party contains the sexists who used the full power of their party s machine and eventually the white house and presidency to quell bimbo eruptions which party consists for people who call clarence thomas and tim scott uncle toms which party when not smearing him ignores the existence of ric grenell the first openly gay member of any presidential cabinet you know the answers to those questions and all the rest like them now we see the left once again exposing themselves for what they really are when elon musk offered almost 10 percent more than the company is worth to buy twitter any normal person who owned stock would have been ecstatic at the prospect the stock had already surged since it was reported he d been gobbling up shares so another 10 percent is like an unexpected christmas bonus especially if you d been holding the stock for a while instead this news was greeted like a loud fart in an elevator how could that be it s because musk has threatened to institute what the left fears more than almost anything actual free speech on a public platform if you re terrified by the prospect of free speech for everyone you re probably a fascist it doesn t really matter how much fair trade coffee you drink or how many pictures of yourself holding up a haloed cartoon drawing of george floyd you have in your facebook profile photos you are everything your virtue signaling pretends to be against you are those mini nazis screaming this is what democracy looks like endlessly to prevent someone they don t agree with from speaking without irony or self awareness people with confidence in their beliefs and facts on their side don t do everything possible to prevent contrary opinions from being heard democrats are terrified that elon musk has publicly stated his belief that people even and especially people with unpopular opinions or thoughts contrary to the establishment should be free to express them online this terrifies the left progressives have never embraced free speech as anything more than a shield to protect themselves from responsibility for what they inspire see james hodgekinson because the very idea is a threat to their hold on power they don t debate they re ill equipped to they just insist and threaten others into silence if people were allowed to spread ideas to contradict progressive dogma openly who knows where that might lead would some bad ideas spread too of course progressivism is popular again among self proclaimed academics the way it was in the early 20th century until hitler exposed the horrors of it especially its embrace of eugenics but bad ideas will always exist which is why the united states has traditionally embraced the idea of allowing anyone with an idea to express it democrats are learning the hard way that their message isn t selling to hispanic voters in particular they d hoped to capture the hispanic vote the way they have the black vote with empty promises to address problems they ve created met with blind loyalty put all the polling data shows it s been a failure for democrats playing identity and race politics to garner their support the reason why is pretty simple whether they just immigrated here legally yesterday or 3 generations ago they know they came to the united states to get away from what democrats are promising to impose here socialism fascism communism are what either they or their parents or grandparents fled why would they want that here they ve heard all these promises of equality and equity before and it ended up in terror why would they replace what they ran to with what they were running from democrats can t have this and other truths spread freely they can t have jokes told that belittle sacred cows on the left they can t be seen as anything other than magnanimous which they decidedly are not anyone who dares rock that boat is a threat to what they insist the world must be they aren t in the business of convincing people they are in the business of silencing dissent elon musk threatens that so much so that media outlets are applauding saudi arabia s government a stakeholder in twitter for objecting to musk s offer after years of attacking saudi arabia for the murder of jamal khashoggi and with a history of homophobia try being gay there they re now heroes to the left because they believe in nothing but their own power and us being able to express ourselves freely is a threat to that power that kind of tells you everything you need to know about democrats today doesn t it written by derek hunter official website share post twitter facebook email

how pentagon contractors are cashing in on the ukraine crisis by william d hartung julia gledhill and tom engelhardt the russian invasion of ukraine has brought immense suffering to the people of that land while sparking calls for increased military spending in both the united states and europe though that war may prove to be a tragedy for the world one group is already benefiting from it u s arms contractors even before hostilities broke out the ceos of major weapons firms were talking about how tensions in europe could pad their profits in a january 2022 call with his company s investors raytheon technologies ceo greg hayes typically bragged that the prospect of conflict in eastern europe and other global hot spots would be good for business adding that we are seeing i would say opportunities for international sales he tensions in eastern europe the tensions in the south china sea all of those things are putting pressure on some of the defense spending over there so i fully expect we re going to see some benefit from it in late march in an interview with the harvard business review after the war in ukraine had begun hayes defended the way his company would profit from that conflict so i make no apology for that i think again recognizing we are there to defend democracy and the fact is eventually we will see some benefit in the business over time everything that s being shipped into ukraine today of course is coming out of stockpiles either at dod or from our nato allies and that s all great news eventually we ll have to replenish it and we will see a benefit to the business over the next coming years arms to ukraine profits to contractors the war in ukraine will indeed be a bonanza for the likes of raytheon and lockheed martin first of all there will be the contracts to resupply weapons like raytheon s stinger anti aircraft missile and the raytheon lockheed martin produced javelin anti tank missile that washington has already provided to ukraine by the thousands the bigger stream of profits however will come from assured post conflict increases in national security spending here and in europe justified at least in part by the russian invasion and the disaster that s followed indeed direct arms transfers to ukraine already reflect only part of the extra money going to u s military contractors this fiscal year alone they are guaranteed to also reap significant benefits from the pentagon s ukraine security assistance initiative usai and the state department s foreign military financing fmf program both of which finance the acquisition of american weaponry and other equipment as well as military training these have in fact been the two primary channels for military aid to ukraine from the moment the russians invaded and seized crimea in 2014 since then the united states has committed around 5 billion in security assistance to that country according to the state department the united states has provided such military aid to help ukraine preserve its territorial integrity secure its borders and improve interoperability with nato so when russian troops began to mass on the ukrainian border last year washington quickly upped the ante on march 31 2021 the u s european command declared a potential imminent crisis given the estimated 100 000 russian troops already along that border and within crimea as last year ended the biden administration had committed 650 million in weaponry to ukraine including anti aircraft and anti armor equipment like the raytheon lockheed martin javelin anti tank missile despite such elevated levels of american military assistance russian troops did indeed invade ukraine in february since then according to pentagon reports the u s has committed to giving approximately 2 6 billion in military aid to that country bringing the biden administration total to more than 3 2 billion and still rising some of this assistance was included in a march emergency spending package for ukraine which required the direct procurement of weapons from the defense industry including drones laser guided rocket systems machine guns ammunition and other supplies the major military industrial corporations will now seek pentagon contracts to deliver that extra weaponry even as they are gearing up to replenish pentagon stocks already delivered to the ukrainians on that front in fact military contractors have much to look forward to more than half of the pentagon s 6 5 billion portion of the emergency spending package for ukraine is designated simply to replenish dod inventories in all lawmakers allocated 3 5 billion to that effort 1 75 billion more than the president even requested they also boosted funding by 150 million for the state department s fmf program for ukraine and keep in mind that those figures don t even include emergency financing for the pentagon s acquisition and maintenance costs which are guaranteed to provide more revenue streams for the major weapons makers better yet from the viewpoint of such companies there are many bites left to take from the apple of ukrainian military aid president biden has already made it all too clear that we re going to give ukraine the arms to fight and defend themselves through all the difficult days ahead one can only assume that more commitments are on the way another positive side effect of the war for lockheed raytheon and other arms merchants like them is the push by house armed services committee chair adam smith d wa and ranking committee republican mike rogers of alabama to speed up production of a next generation anti aircraft missile to replace the stinger in his congressional confirmation hearing william laplante the latest nominee to head acquisition at the pentagon argued that america also needs more hot production lines for bombs missiles and drones consider that yet another benefit in waiting for the major weapons contractors the pentagon gold mine for u s arms makers however the greatest benefits of the war in ukraine won t be immediate weapons sales large as they are but the changing nature of the ongoing debate over pentagon spending itself of course the representatives of such companies were already plugging the long term challenge posed by china a greatly exaggerated threat but the russian invasion is nothing short of manna from heaven for them the ultimate rallying cry for advocates of greater military outlays even before the war the pentagon was slated to receive at least 7 3 trillion over the next decade more than four times the cost of president biden s 1 7 trillion domestic build back better plan already stymied by members of congress who labeled it too expensive by far and keep in mind that given the current surge in pentagon spending that 7 3 trillion could prove a minimal figure indeed pentagon officials like deputy secretary of defense kathleen hicks promptly cited ukraine as one of the rationales for the biden administration s proposed record national security budget proposal of 813 billion calling russia s invasion an acute threat to the world order in another era that budget request for fiscal year 2023 would have been mind boggling since it s higher than spending at the peaks of the conflicts in korea and vietnam and over 100 billion more than the pentagon received annually at the height of the cold war despite its size however congressional republicans joined by a significant number of their democratic colleagues are already pushing for more forty republican members of the house and senate armed services committees have in fact signed a letter to president biden calling for 5 growth in military spending beyond inflation which would potentially add up to 100 billion to that budget request typically enough representative elaine luria d va who represents the area near the huntington ingalls company s newport news military shipyard in virginia accused the administration of gutting the navy because it contemplates decommissioning some older ships to make way for new ones that complaint was lodged despite that service s plan to spend a whopping 28 billion on new ships in fy 2023 who benefits that planned increase in shipbuilding funds is part of a proposed pool of 276 billion for weapons procurement as well as further research and development contained in the new budget which is where the top five weapons producing contractors lockheed martin boeing raytheon general dynamics and northrop grumman make most of their money those firms already split more than 150 billion in pentagon contracts annually a figure that will skyrocket if the administration and congress have their way to put all of this in context just one of those top five firms lockheed martin was awarded 75 billion in pentagon contracts in fiscal year 2020 alone that s considerably more than the entire budget for the state department dramatic evidence of how skewed washington s priorities are despite the biden administration s pledge to put diplomacy first the pentagon s weapons wish list for fy 2023 is a catalog of just how the big contractors will cash in for example the new columbia class ballistic missile submarine built by general dynamics electric boat plant in southeastern connecticut will see its proposed budget for fy 2023 grow from 5 0 billion to 6 2 billion spending on northrop grumman s new intercontinental ballistic missile icbm the ground based strategic deterrent will increase by about one third annually to 3 6 billion the category of missile defense and defeat a specialty of boeing raytheon and lockheed martin is slated to receive more than 24 billion and space based missile warning systems a staple of the trump administration created space force will jump from 2 5 billion in fy 2022 to 4 7 billion in this year s proposed budget among all the increases there was a single surprise a proposed reduction in purchases of the troubled lockheed martin f 35 combat aircraft from 85 to 61 planes in fy 2023 the reason is clear enough that plane has more than 800 identified design flaws and its production and performance problems have been little short of legendary luckily for lockheed martin that drop in numbers has not been accompanied by a proportional reduction in funding while newly produced planes may be reduced by one third the actual budget allocation for the f 35 will drop by less than 10 from 12 billion to 11 billion an amount that s more than the complete discretionary budget of the centers for disease control and prevention since lockheed martin won the f 35 contract development costs have more than doubled while production delays have set the aircraft back by nearly a decade nonetheless the military services have purchased so many of those planes that manufacturers can t keep up with the demand for spare parts and yet the f 35 can t even be properly tested for combat effectiveness because the simulation software required is not only unfinished but without even an estimated completion date so the f 35 is many years away from the full production of planes that actually work as advertised if that s ever in the cards a number of the weapons systems which in the ukraine moment are guaranteed to be showered with cash are so dangerous or dysfunctional that like the f 35 they should actually be phased out take the new icbm former secretary of defense william perry has called icbms some of the most dangerous weapons in the world because a president would only have minutes to decide whether to launch them in a crisis greatly increasing the risk of an accidental nuclear war based on a false alarm nor does it make sense to buy aircraft carriers at 13 billion a pop especially since the latest version is having trouble even launching and landing aircraft its primary function and is increasingly vulnerable to attack by next generation high speed missiles the few positives in the new budget like the navy s decision to retire the unnecessary and unworkable littoral combat ship a sort of f 35 of the sea designed for multiple tasks none of which it does well could easily be reversed by advocates from states and districts where those systems are built and maintained the house of representatives for instance has a powerful joint strike fighter caucus which in 2021 mustered more than one third of all house members to press for more f 35s than the pentagon and air force requested as they will no doubt do again this year a shipbuilding caucus co chaired by representatives joe courtney d ct and rob wittman r va will fight against the navy s plan to retire old ships to buy new ones they would prefer that the navy keep the old ones and buy new ones with more of your tax money up for grabs similarly the icbm coalition made up of senators from states with either icbm bases or production centers has a near perfect record of staving off reductions in the deployment or funding of those weapons and will in 2022 be hard at work defending its budgetary allocation towards a new policy coming up with a sensible realistic and affordable defense policy always a challenge will be even more so in the midst of the ukrainian nightmare still given where our taxpayer dollars go it remains all too worthwhile such a new approach should include things like reducing the numbers of the pentagon s private contractors hundreds of thousands of people many of whom are engaged in thoroughly redundant jobs that could be done more cheaply by civilian government employees or simply eliminated it s estimated that cutting spending on contractors by 15 would save around 262 billion over 10 years the pentagon s three decades long near 2 trillion modernization plan to build a new generation of nuclear armed bombers missiles and submarines along with new warheads should for instance simply be scrapped in keeping with the kind of deterrence only nuclear strategy developed by the nuclear policy organization global zero and the staggering american global military footprint an invitation to further conflict that includes more than 750 military bases scattered on every continent except antarctica and counterterror operations in 85 countries should at the very least be sharply scaled back according to the center for international policy s sustainable defense task force and a study of alternative approaches to defense carried out by the congressional budget office even a relatively minimalist strategic rethinking could save at least 1 trillion over the next decade enough to make a healthy down payment on investments in public health preventing or mitigating the worst potential impacts of climate change or beginning the task of narrowing record levels of income inequality of course none of these changes can occur without challenging the power and influence of the military industrial congressional complex a task as urgent as it is difficult in this moment of carnage in europe no matter how hard it may be it s a fight worth having both for the security of the world and the future of the planet one thing is guaranteed a new gold rush of defense spending is a disaster in the making for
