britain s politico economic fiasco of the past six weeks culminated in a tragicomic anticlimax the 45 day prime minister liz truss resigned as many had predicted before she even took high office last month rishi sunak the incumbent prime minister britain s third in two months had vociferously criticized truss flamboyant yet idiotic fiscal plan during the summer run up campaign to replace boris johnson by syed zain abbas rizvi in hindsight while she successfully managed to woo the ultra right tories with her anti immigrant and pro brexit rhetoric her inane economic policies failed to enchant the financial markets and in mere weeks as great britain nudged normalcy after grieving its longest reigning monarch truss ill timed tax cuts and brazen borrowing plans wreaked havoc the british pound tanked to record low mortgage rates shot to stratospheric levels forcing the bank of england boe to intercede to soothe the markets and safeguard the vulnerable pension funds from collapse admittedly the united states is witnessing relative political stability at least compared to the trump tenure the american economy is heading toward a recession piecemeal however the federal reserve shows no sign of panic or loss of control and the investors are patently not losing confidence in the us government unlike the jitters on display across the atlantic nonetheless there are a few concerning parallels between the western duo to recap and analyze in depth we should first ask ourselves why did the british economic plan backfire it is a well known fact that britain is one of the most pivotal western industrialized economies 6th largest in the world yet an inflationary mini budget still earned it a rare public rebuke from the international monetary fund imf over fiscal imprudence such remarks are usually reserved for emerging economies with a notoriety for fiscal irresponsibility it was not because of the 45 billion in unfunded tax cuts britain s biggest tax package in over five decades but it was a reaction to the contradiction sketched by the truss regime between britain s conservative monetary policy and quasi liberal fiscal strategies the imf unerringly realized that this tussle would only exacerbate the economic uncertainty already looming in the aftermath of the russian invasion of ukraine in a period when the western world alongside the bank of england boe tightened policy to wrestle with energy fueled inflation the british government tabled a plan sans any independent assessment of potential fiscal impact to borrow funds to finance utopian tax cuts and eliminate limits on bankers bonuses in a span when the working class witnessed ballooning energy bills the truss government planned to kickstart economic growth via primitive trickle down economics without any substantive agenda to invite foreign investments naturally the financial markets revolted by dumping uk debt causing interest rates to spiral mortgages to skyrocket pound to drop to almost parity with the us dollar the new chancellor of the exchequer immediately reversed most of her policies before she even egressed the office while forewarning of painful spending cuts to come still the markets shadowed the announcement of the uk s next prime minister with an ambiguous reaction as sterling slipped 0 17 against the greenback erasing the earlier gains while bonds rallied to pre budget levels thankfully the united states is not even remotely in the same shoes but political uncertainty is brewing in the us congress as well the biden administration has somewhat restored the lost stability totemic to the american political scene the make america great again maga tendencies have receded if not completely effaced and the united states is seemingly back to its classical balance of diplomacy and deterrence that was noticeably missing since 2017 yet not all is sunshine in the domestic and international dynamics the democrats welcomed this year with a thin majority in both houses their mid term election prospects gradually improved with collective success in europe against russia the republican blunders like the reversal of roe v wade further favored biden s case however the short sightedness of the group of seven s g7 ambitious price cap on russian energy supplies and china s force posturing in the indo pacific region disillusioned the american patriots iran s bold collusion with russia by allegedly supplying military drones in ukraine has further weakened the american illusion of power the recent slap in the face has been the saudi betrayal leading opec to cut global oil supply by 2 million barrels day even after biden bumped fists with crown prince mohammad bin salman mbs during his domestically criticized visit to saudi arabia in july as the gasoline prices have picked up in the last few weeks and inflation is increasingly proving obdurate the democrats could lose both houses or at least the senate which could plausibly trigger a britain like bedlam the trigger point is somewhat apparent the contentious us debt ceiling according to the imf estimates the us and the uk are two of the most highly industrialized economies running huge deficits in both their budgets and current accounts according to data from the imf s world economic outlook weo database britain s current account deficit this year would be about 4 8 of its gross domestic product gdp 3 9 for the united states both nations have borrowed over 4 of their respective gdps to fund these gaps such huge deficits imply a continual need for capital inflow now i admit that advanced economies like japan and france also run huge government deficits but no member of the g7 has a deficit on their current account quite like that of britain and the us register and while i unequivocally agree that the us treasuries are currently running in the opposite trajectory of uk gilts a crisis could ensnare the american economy if the republicans gain control of either of the houses of congress and enforces a debt limit on government borrowing while theoretically it could push the us government to default on its debt and plunge the global economy into chaos the more likely outcome is a compromise in the form of spending cuts a repeat of obama s begrudging submission to republican pressure in 2013 in hopes of a long term deficit reduction deal nonetheless this impending political browbeating could spook the already febrile bond markets courtesy of the aggressive tightening schedule of the federal reserve remember investors doubt in the british government s fiscal plan caused the current market meltdown not any actual sign of imminent default it illustrates that in the sensitive market environment today all it takes is market skepticism that gradually snowballs into a formidable economic nightmare even for an advanced economy another risk is the bustling value of the us dollar this year alone the greenback has gained more than 18 against a basket of key currencies according to the benchmark ice u s dollar index the fed s accelerating rate hikes have pushed the dollar to a multi decade high even against the currencies of its major trading partners consequently american exports have turned expensive imports have turned cheaper thus us exports are in line to fall while imports gain further widening the current account deficit i fear that a sell off in the us treasury market could invoke a financial crisis dwarfing the great recession of 2008 fortunately us securities are a staple for risk averse investors seeking an economic haven and virtually every major global transaction from the oil market to commodities is settled in the us dollar thus i reckon that the us markets are far more stable than their british counterparts ultimately the ubiquity of the us economic presence does pose some challenges the economic pain exported globally by the united states due to a straightening dollar could lead to financial turmoil in one of its major trading partners japan is a perfect example the rate hikes by the federal reserve have plummeted the japanese yen to a 32 year low against the us dollar yet the bank of japan boj is persistent in keeping interest rates low to allow its historically moribund inflation to liven up my apprehension however lies in the perception of inflation japan s inflation of 3 is not demand driven but imported from abroad on the back of inflated fuel and food prices recent history suggests that japan would not resort to rate hikes which would pinch local businesses and dent public sentiment without actually lowering inflation however japan could stop buying or even partly liquidate its immense holdings of us treasury securities totaling about 1 23 trillion to service its staggering debt circa 260 of its gdp without cutting public spending this scenario is just one example of many that could spark a crisis the frightening reality is that unlike the contained financial debacle of britain a panic run in the us capital markets would devastate the global economy and hence britain s fiscal blunder should be an omen to the us policymakers to address its chronic budget and current account deficits and mitigate its prohibitive borrowing sprees before it is too late to redress read more america is hanging by a treadbare flag thread free julian assange now
9 11 j accuse zelikow cheney rumsfeld bush and o brien veterans today august 30 2012 as the founder of scholars for 9 11 truth 2005 the editor of the 9 11 conspiracy 2007 the chair of the madison conference 2007 and the co chair of the vancouver hearings 2011 it has been astonishing to me to discover that the atrocities of 9 11 were not simply allowed to happen but come closer to having been produced as a hollywood style spectacle with phantom flights faked phone calls and fabricated crash sites anyone who wants to continue in a state of naive belief in their government as a nurturing institution that is dedicated to the best interests of the american people and to promoting their welfare should read no further because 9 11 appears to have been a national security event that was approved at the highest levels of the bush cheney administration including the cia the pentagon the nsa and the white house itself when consideration is given the the totality of the evidence no alternative explanation is reasonable for those who find this difficult to believe check out seismic proof 9 11 was an inside job by gordon ross and craig furlong who undertook the systematic study of reports from willie rodriquez who was the senior custodian in the north tower and reported that an enormous explosion had taken place in the subbasements even before there were any effects from the impact of a plane they used very precise seismic data from a lab run by columbia university and compared it with very precise faa and military radar data and discovered that he was right there had been explosions in the subbasements of both towers which occurred 14 and 17 seconds prior to the hits of those planes on either tower but this is only the tip of an enormous iceberg which we can now seen encompasses the faking of the major events of 9 11 including the crash of flight 93 in shanksville the hit by flight 77 on the pentagon and both flights 11 hitting the north tower and flight 175 the south it seems incredible i know but the evidence is there and as i explain here we know who the perps were who brought us 9 11 they were among the most familiar faces on our political stage at the time actors one and all 1 evidentiary submission 1 of 5 by james h fetzer at the vancouver hearings held 15 17 june 2012 judges asked participants to write an evidentiary submission of at least two persons regarding their complicity in the 9 11 plot philip zelikow i submit the names of philip zelikow richard b cheney donald rumsfeld george w bush and lt col steve o brien mnang based upon the facts as noted and sourced below name philip zelikow title at the time of his offense executive director the 9 11 commission probable cause in his capacity as executive director of the 9 11 commission and the principal author of its report philip zelikow caused false claims to be disseminated about the events of 9 11 including the following 1 that flight 11 had hit the north tower 2 that flight 77 had hit the pentagon 3 that flight 93 had crashed in shanksville and 4 that flight 175 had hit the south tower information published in the 9 11 commission report 2004 regarding 1 though 4 is demonstrably false because a bureau of transportation statistics bts records show that flight 11 was not scheduled for 9 11 1 b bts records show that flight 77 was likewise not scheduled for 9 11 2 c faa registration records show that the plane corresponding to flight 93 was not deregistered formally taken out of service until 28 september 2005 3 d faa registration records show that the plane corresponding to flight 175 was likewise not deregistered formally taken out of service until 28 september 2005 4 e pilots for 9 11 truth has established that flight 93 was in the air but was over champaign urbana il subsequent to the time it was reported to have crashed in shanksville pa 5 and f pilots for 9 11 truth has also established that flight 175 was in the air but was over harrisburg and pittsburgh pa long after the time it was reported to have crashed into the south tower 6
in this article we will be taking a look at the largest defense contractors in the world in 2022 to skip our detailed analysis you can go directly to see the 5 largest defense contractors in the world in 2022 the world seems to be heading towards a recession despite being able to seemingly get over a global pandemic due to the early development of a vaccine which saved millions of lives inflation has reached recorded highs and while you may think that most countries would be focused on their own economies and trying to ease the lives of the people living in them geopolitical upheaval has made a mockery of this belief in february 2022 russia initiated an unprovoked invasion of ukraine which eight months later is still no closer to an end with heavy losses to both sides though the latter has definitely suffered the worst of it with thousands of civilians dying and major infrastructure being destroyed by russia the west to counter growing russian threat has united against it despite some disagreements and supplied weapons and aid to ukraine to be able to defend its territory regardless of who emerges victorious the current geopolitical scenario bodes quite well for the defense contractor industry the defense industry is one of the few industries to have emerged largely unscathed from the pandemic and has continued to maintain modest growth in the us while delivering significant growth in europe according to a report by pwc according to the stockholm international peace research institute global military spending set a new record of 2 1 trillion in 2021 and remember this was before a major war which has led to significantly higher military spending in 2022 by most of the western countries while the industry wasn t majorly affected by the pandemic it did face some issues especially due to worker absenteeism and supply chain shortages after the global supply chain faced considerable challenges before the russian invasion most military spending was to counter terrorism especially in the united states and europe for other countries such as india and pakistan military spending is to ensure preparedness amidst rising tensions between the two countries especially after india s air force transgressed pakistani territory and was shot down by the pakistan army meanwhile china has also continued to spend massively on its military to establish its might even as relations with the west continue to deteriorate and skirmished with india its neighbor have taken place as well china along with the united states dominates the list of the biggest defense contractors in the world after russia s invasion priorities of western nations have changed significantly reverting more to cold war style priorities as an example both finland and sweden have applied for nato membership after the invasion despite threats by russia meanwhile the united states realizing the importance of countering russian aggression has pledged at least 16 9 billion to ukraine since january 2021 of which 16 2 billion have been provided after the invasion in february the european union member countries have also not held back providing important weapons and aid to ukraine which is a major reason why it has been able to resist russia s invasion to this extent so far and this increase in defense spending is beneficial to the biggest defense contractors in the world in 2022 according to the business research company the global defense market grew from 475 billion in 2021 to 514 billion in 2022 at a cagr of 8 2 aided by the russia ukraine war and is expected to increase at a cagr of 3 2 to 581 billion by 2026 to determine the biggest defense contractors in the world in 2022 we referred the fortune 500 global list and the fortune 500 list we then ranked each

sustain and after beginning in 2011 faded by 2012 after the covid 19 pandemic disrupted the world lockdowns were imposed in most countries around the globe and economies came to a standstill with most

being at its most profitable however the pandemic provided an opportunity to employees which resulted in an improvement in work life balance in their lives many are now refusing to work unless it s completely remote citing the reduced expenses because of not having to commute not to mention the invaluable time saved as the economy rebounded many businesses realized that they needed more employees to run operations smoothly only for employees to have realized their self worth in the meanwhile and not being willing to go back to work under the same conditions that they d been subjected to earlier this has also led to the great resignation an ongoing economic trend where employees are resigning en masse starting in april 2021 where in the united states more than four million resigned from their jobs followed by 3 9 million resignations in june 2021 the demand of the employees is similar regardless of class background and level of experience better work life balance more flexibility and better compensation according to a study carried out by pwc 65 of employees said they were looking for a new job while 88 of executives admitted that the rate of turnover in their

sacramento calif ap â the good times might soon be over for californiaâ s government what you need to know the nationâ s most populous state has had so much cash lately that lawmakers have spent freely that seemingly endless flow of money has started to dry up as state tax collections have fallen below expectations for four months in a row thereâ s now an 80 chance california will be about 8 billion short when its fiscal year ends next summer according to the latest estimate from the nonpartisan legislative analystâ s office despite the shortfall california is likely not headed toward another cash crisis like the one that engulfed the state during the great recession more than a decade ago the nationâ s most populous state has had so much cash lately that lawmakers have spent freely â handing out free health care to low income immigrants paying for every 4 year old to attend kindergarten and sending more than 21 billion in stimulus checks to taxpayers over the past two years that seemingly endless flow of money has started to dry up as state tax collections have fallen below expectations for four months in a row thereâ s now an 80 chance california will be about 8 billion short when its fiscal year ends next summer according to the latest estimate from the nonpartisan legislative analystâ s office thereâ s still plenty of time for a comeback but the trend of declining revenues is already having an impact last month democratic gov gavin newsom blocked a tax cut for manufacturers halted an expansion of full day kindergarten programs and nixed unemployment benefits for immigrants living in the country without legal permission â all while citing the stateâ s potential shortfall â those shortfalls not only will be coming they will be ample and weâ ll have to make some adjustments â newsom said â weâ re working with the legislature right now to do just that â despite the shortfall california is likely not headed toward another cash crisis like the one that engulfed the state during the great recession more than a decade ago california had less than 8 billion available to spend at the end of september 2008 during the great recession this year california has more than 130 billion available including 37 2 billion in its various savings accounts â i think the state is far better positioned for a potential economic downturn this time around than it has been in contemporary history â said chris hoene executive director of the california budget policy center whatâ s happening in california could be a sign of troubling things to come for other states nationally tax collections in most states appear to be above expectations so far according to brian sigritz director of state fiscal studies for the national association of state budget officers but revenue is growing much slower with states anticipating a 1 4 average increase this year compared to a 16 5 jump in 2021 the problem in california is not jobs as the state has plenty of people working and paying taxes californiaâ s unemployment rate tied a record low in september and employment has nearly returned to what it was before the pandemic â even as hiring has slowed in recent months instead the problem is a declining stock market â meaning rich people arenâ t making as much money thatâ s an issue in california where a progressive tax system means the top 1 of earners pay close to half of the stateâ s income taxes the biggest factor has been the governmentâ s attempts to slow down the soaring costs of goods and services because of inflation the federal reserve has done this by raising a key interest rate which has had a cascading effect on the rest of the economy the s p 500 an index of the 500 publicly traded companies in leading u s industries has fallen more than 18 from its peak in january as a result a declining stock market means thereâ s less incentive for tech startups to begin selling shares of stock to the public tech companies â going publicâ has been a reliable source of cash for californiaâ s government because it makes a lot of people very rich very fast â and all money that is taxable last year 206 california based companies went public creating a huge windfall of tax revenue for the state this year less than 50 california based companies will go public according to an estimate from the california department of finance â the newsom administrationâ s budget agency â it doesnâ t mean that tech itself is not a source of strength though it may not be a source of as rapidly increasing revenues as it was a year ago for the state general fund â said jerry nickelsburg faculty director for the ucla anderson forecast which projects economic trends california collects the majority of its income taxes in april the deadline for people to file their state tax returns but the state does get money each month from â withholding taxesâ â money companies withhold from workersâ paychecks each month and send to the government that revenue has been down significantly since june â what that suggests to our forecasters is there have been layoffs and cutbacks in some of the high wage high tech sectors of the stateâ s economy â department of finance spokesperson h d palmer said â itâ s a reflection of the volatility of the stock markets â it could also signal some volatility between newsom and californiaâ s democratic controlled state legislature this year newsom scolded lawmakers for passing bills at the end of the session that when added all together would have allowed 22 billion in new spending that was not accounted for in the state budget newsom called the proposed spending â remarkable â he blocked most of it by vetoing those bills in september â i made it crystal clear that we are seeing economic headwinds â newsom said assembly speaker anthony rendon a democrat from los angeles said lawmakers make proposals to benefit their districts and the people of california â what is remarkable is that the senate and assembly have managed to unite on the budget in recent years â rendon said â we have worked with the administration to make californiaâ s budget stronger more resilient and just plain better we have more reserves and more cash on hand now than ever before our differences are minor compared to that achievement â toni atkins the democratic president pro tempore of the california senate said itâ s too early to know what the budget will look like next year but she said â weâ re more prepared than ever to protect our progress and withstand a revenue downturn without harmful program cuts or middle class tax increases â
china s stock market rebounded on the afternoon of oct 25 with its a share index continuing the upward trend on oct 26 after plunging on oct 24 however a financial analyst believes that the stock market recovery is a result of government intervention to appease investors which will only have a short term effect china s a share stock market experienced a black monday on oct 24 at the close of the day the three major indices of the chinese stock market had fallen by more than 2 percent the shanghai stock exchange index fell 2 02 percent to close at 2 977 56 points the shenzhen stock exchange index fell 2 05 percent to close at 10 694 61 points and the growth enterprise market index fell 2 43 percent to close at 2 336 84 points on that same day hong kong s hang seng index opened at 15 879 points fell to 15 091 points and closed at 15 180 69 points on june 27 1997 the last day of stock market trading before hong kong s hand over to the chinese communist regime the hang seng index closed at 15 196 that means the index fell to the same level as 25 years ago overnight on oct 25 the following day the hang seng index opened at 14 958 5 points then rallied more than 400 points before falling back down on oct 26 the index rose by more than 300 points to close at 15 317 67 then at the opening of oct 27 it rebounded to 15 690 points the situation of a shares was similar the three major indices started to rebound on oct 25 ending the net outflows of foreign capital seen for the previous six trading days mike sun an investment strategist and china expert residing in north america told the epoch times on oct 27 that black monday s plunge was global investors response to beijing s new leadership after the 20th national congress while the rebound must be the result of government intervention with the new leadership introduced to the public investors have a pessimistic outlook for china s future economic development so a large amount of capital especially off shore capital flowed out hurting both the stock market and the value of rmb sun said he believes that the chinese authorities are manipulating the market by selling dollars in the foreign exchange market and buying rmb leading to a rebound in the exchange rate of rmb and a rebound in the stock market by purchasing heavyweight stocks to stabilize the market and pacify investors of course some investors would act on the rebound by entering the stock market he added sun explained that the chinese authorities definitely want to save the market to avoid large scale flight of capital out of china and their efforts can certainly provide a short term protective effect but the long term trend depends on whether the economy will experience stable development he said chinese state media china finance reported on oct 26 that the central bank and foreign exchange bureau claimed that they would strengthen collaboration to protect the stock bond and property markets china s central bank is determined not to raise interest rates and it is even lowering interest rates against the backdrop of aggressive interest rate hikes in the united states in order to protect the property market and consequently protect the banks to avoid a financial crisis sun explained although the chinese authorities have introduced multiple incentives to boost the real estate market this year official figures so far show that china s property market is still in the doldrums on oct 24 china s bureau of statistics released the september sales data for 70 large and medium sized cities of these 70 cities 54 experienced price drops for new homes and 61 cities saw price drops for pre owned homes wang xiaolu deputy director of the national economic research institute neri a non profit organization founded in 1996 for the study of economic theory and policy discussed the outlook of china s property market at a financial forum on sept 21 he pointed out that china s urban housing inventory is close to saturation even if the current pace of construction is maintained with no further growth on average one third of new housing each year will represent a surplus he said

already underway for bond yields jpmorgan says bond yields are already in a peaking process and that s a good thing for equities if that belief catches on according to jpmorgan if the view of bond yields peaking gains traction this would go a long way in helping the equity market stabilize with valuation multiples that would then appear more credible wrote strategist mislav matejka in a note to clients monday matejka believes the disinflation phase is also progressing and he expects meaningfully lower headline and core inflation within the next three to six months finally as economic activity has weakened closer to contraction territory bond yields are likely to be capped by subdued levels of growth from here matejka wrote with earnings disappointments largely digested by investors matejka anticipates a bounce in growth stocks and some tech names going forward that includes an expected rebound in shares of semiconductor giant asml tactically growth could bounce vs value but both growth and value appear better than pure defensives which are very unattractively priced even as they are inversely correlated to the bond yields direction he wrote samantha subin blackrock says central banks are on a path to overtightening blackrock said the markets are rallying on hopes that policy tightening is coming to an end which it thinks is premature we see central banks on a path to overtighten policy jean boivin head of blackrock investment institute said in a note we think the fed like other developed market central banks will only stop when the severe damage from rate hikes is clearer the asset manager said rates have already hit levels that may trigger a recession blackrock said it remains underweight stocks and government bonds shrinking central bank

for s p 500 chronert says investors are closely watching the upcoming midterm elections and worrying about their potential impact on equities but the market has other things to worry about according to scott chronert of citi in his view election effects will be second to the ongoing focus on fed rate policy inflation and recession risk that said it is hard to ignore the historical data which points to strong positive returns for the s p 500 in the year following midterm elections he wrote in a friday note rather than incorporate this into our base case for 2023 we consider it a positive tail risk data from predictit polls shows the likelihood of house and senate control shifting to republicans resulting in a slit government that reduces the chances of any large scale policy reform which could weigh on technology media and entertainment and energy stocks on the flip side materials and semiconductors could do well with republican control of both parts of congress according to the note still data show that the years after midterm elections are usually good for stocks interestingly outcomes even with a recession in the subsequent year post midterm elections are surprisingly robust said chronert some of this may be because elections relieve volatility from uncertainty carmen reinicke transportation index outperforming the dow jones transportation index is outperforming on

cyclical stocks the economy will experience a slow erosion not a dramatic implosion according to trivariate research that makes cheap cyclical stocks attractive this will not be the collapse in earnings followed by government intervention and a v shaped recovery that were the primary features of prior cycles trivariate fonder adam parker said in a sunday note rather it will be a slow decline from a very high nominal gdp if we are right many cyclicals are just too cheap investors are either discounting an earnings collapse or they are not giving the companies credit for the massive balance sheet improvement in the interim parker said energy metals and homebuilder stocks remain attractive compared to machinery semiconductors capital equipment and electronic equipment even if earnings estimates are cut 30 to 50 he pointed to energy as the poster child for cheap cyclicals saying he maintains the view that the sector will be up 15 to 20 compared to an annual stock market appreciation

about reducing the pace of rate hikes wells fargo says the federal reserve this week likely will provide at least a nod toward slowing the pace of interest rate increases according to wells fargo with the market already expecting the central bank to hike its benchmark rate 0 75 percentage points when its two day meeting concludes wednesday the only mystery left is what clues officials will provide about what s ahead some market participants are expecting an indication that the december rate hike could be pulled down to a 0 5 point move overall we do not believe the fed will commit to 50bp

rishi sunak has just been chosen 2 00 p m on 24th october 2022 by a fair margin the next prime minister the first ethnic asian briton to be so elected and we wish him well his appointment comes after a considerable period of turmoil which has raised many eyebrows around the world britain is supposed to be the home of parliamentary democracy it still is despite the fractious behaviour which has not been seen for some time it was occasionally in the past but there was nothing like the same level of media scrutiny history as a teacher for the present go back to 1946 when i was a boy just returning from india after wwii with my parents the population of britain was 46 billion and predominantly nearly all born and bred british britain claimed vast colonial territories but they were fatigued by the war however there was change in the air which had gradually been increasing the precepts of socialism had taken hold in the 1930s and labour a socialist party were displacing the liberal party as the main opposition to the conservative party much to everyone s surprise to some even a shock clement attlee s labour socialist party beat winston churchill s conservative party in the election held in 1946 the most notable legacy of this labour government was the setting up of the national health service labour were taking over the mantle largely held by conservatives who had the reputation of caring for the working class whose political awareness had matured over the past 15 20 years this was a one term government with the conservatives led by churchill who at last was being thanked for his service taking power for the next 15 years first under anthony eden and latterly under harold macmillan with the slogan you ve never had it so good but internationally attitudes were changing the war end saw the establishment of the united nations in new york a theme being the dismantling of colonial rule which affected britain the most france and the netherlands the rise of the soviet bloc which saw all of eastern europe being grabbed under a communist government run out of moscow with josef stalin insisting it was his right for russia s part of the war effort germany was divided in two around berlin the western part growing to the fore of european nations once it was united with its eastern part the robert schuman declaration of 1950 which underscored democracy for europe was followed by the establishment of the european coal and steel community ecsc in 1951 which included w germany france and the benelux countries an agreement which stayed in force until expiring in 2002 the industrial zone of the ruhr was the heart of the ecsc in time ongoing work by the western european nations gave rise to the first countries of the european economic community in 1957 at the treaty of rome britain was not accepted as a member until 1st january 1973 being out of favour by france s de gaulle or sometimes known as monsieur non the eec finally became the european union in 1992 at the treaty of maastricht which became a sizeable bloc of most of european countries 27 at the latest count britain withdrew in 2020 britain went through a difficult period in the 1970s with the population increased by 9 million to 55 million partly through immigration from former colonies india and the caribbean countries mostly a restive workforce with strong unions especially the coal miners and a poorly performing economy an interesting time to be a parliamentary candidate in 1977 the callaghan labour government embarrassingly had to call in the imf for assistance its tenure was shortly brought to a close and the next general election gave way to a decade of margaret thatcher and 20 years of conservative government the most notable points from the thatcher years were the falklands war the diminution of the power of the trade unions and her strong rapport with ronald reagan the 1980 88 us president almost the whole of the time that margaret thatcher was in office somewhat surprisingly the conservatives won the 1992 general election with john major which brought in the longest period of economic growth for some time and the beginning of the n ireland peace process he had been working with a small overall majority but with lost by elections this had been whittled down so it was no surprise when tony blair preaching a moderate labour message took the next general election the labour party held the government mandate for the next ten years with gordon brown taking over for the last period before it was once more the conservatives with david cameron at the helm until brexit the 2000s were a turbulent period what with the twin towers debacle in 2001 and the aftermath that has created the introduction of the us to the region subsequently russia to bolster the syrian regime and the start of the flight of refugees to europe that is another long and complicated tale from brexit to sunak come the 24th june 2016 i was addressing in jakarta a breakfast meeting as a board member of the european chamber the foreign correspondents group and others on sustainable development someone was watching the unfolding news on brexit the time difference to uk being 6 hours at the beginning of the meeting it looked like the vote count was going the way of those who wanted to remain an hour later it all changed and the brexiteers had won there was great puzzlement an element of shock and i was left with some explaining to do in britain david cameron resigned as leader and pm of the conservative government having failed to maintain britain s place in europe as a result of the referendum and theresa may who had voted remain took over his position in her relatively short tenure as the prime minister she concentrated her efforts in trying to reach a fair agreement with the eu for the europeans it was a whole new and very complicated ball game also however theresa may presided over a divided cabinet and lost two divisions in the house of commons concerning europe with arch brexiteers seeing a chance to make a change she resigned and boris johnson replaced her he seized the day so to speak and played up to the english vote mostly the middle aged to older voters looking backwards that he had hood winked at the time of the referendum getting away with uncontested untruths playing up to the old times which were no longer true the voters from the scottish welsh and irish nations had opted to remain in the eu which is another interesting play today united kingdom it has added fuel to the scottish national party snp s desire to have independence for scotland the snp has an over whelming majority in the scottish parliament and will seek an injunction in the near future assuming there is a referendum held with a positive outcome on this very important issue the snp would hope not too long after to re join the eu but there is much to be done before that in 2019 an election for the uk parliament was due the usual five year term expiring the conservatives having been in power for ten years one of their promotions for continuation in office was get brexit done and they had the ideal man for this one not too worried about bending the truth boris johnson the brexit negotiations were due to be finalised on 31st january 2020 and were not surprisingly protracted and not concluded to this day e g the irish protocol the conservatives won the election with an overwhelming majority 80 seats largest since 1979 with margaret thatcher partly because of the conservative manifesto and partly due to the labour party choosing a leader who leaned too far to the left and espoused out of date doctrines jeremy corbyn and then the covid pandemic struck the world for the next two years and is still around boris johnson did a reasonably good job throughout the pandemic and very credibly in his support of ukraine against russian aggression but became unstuck when he was less than truthful to parliament in his personal goings on and lost credibility with his cabinet and a good number of the conservative party and he was asked to resign he resigned on 7th july this year the 1922 committee the parliamentary group of the conservative party in the house of commons duty had then to proceed to choose the next prime minister from the sitting body of mps in the first rounds which took seven days the list of candidates was whittled down to two liz truss and rishi sunak they then had over 5 weeks to debate each other either on tv programmes or go around the country giving their views on what was needed for the country at a very difficult time they had quite divergent views truss promoting growth almost at the expense of everything else while sunak with good experience as chancellor of the exchequer was much more cautious in his approach at the end of the period paid up members of the party not a cross section of conservative voters as well as mps voted for which of the two candidates they would choose the mps had clearly chosen sunak but party members by a significant margin chose truss and since their numbers were considerably more truss was chosen it only took a mere two weeks to show that truss s policy was a disaster one could only have growth growth growth policy if the foundations had been sorted first one can t build on ground which is unstable truss was ignoring the fundamentals and the financial markets quickly told her so she was forced to resign and sunak was quickly chosen in her place the markets have shown their relief by significantly bringing down the cost of borrowing to pre truss government levels rishi sunak has started well and will bring common sense to the governance and look at growth in a measured way because truss was right to highlight this but only after the house was in order the population of britain is now 68 million and immigration largely from the commonwealth includes over 3 million of asian descent and over i million from african many from the caribbean sunak is breaking new ground as an indian born in britain 3rd generation reaching the pinnacle of a career at the relatively young age of 42 there are a good number of overseas people of different descent who have worked hard and so continue to earn good positions however britain has been in decline for the past 20 years or so and brexit hasn t helped i would paraphrase derek thompson who wrote in the atlantic a view from across the pond the uk is an object lesson for other countries dealing with a dark triad of deindustrialization degrowth and denigration of foreigners having offshored industry in favour of finance its economy wasn t resilient the resulting erosion of living standards made the public desperate for something to blame blame seeking conservatives spotted bogeymen abroad brexit cut off the economy from further growth and set the stage for a rolling political circus there is more than an element of truth in that it is to be hoped that rishi sunak understands this and starts to repair bridges with our nearest neighbour it will greatly help the economy it is a rule of trading that you should keep transport distances as short as possible

markets on board for another 75bp hike a fourth consecutive 75bp rate hike from the federal reserve looks like a done deal for next week s federal open market committee fomc meeting after all core inflation readings are heading higher rather than lower the economy has returned to growth after two consecutive quarters of falling gdp while job creation continues apace with job vacancies exceeding the number of unemployed americans by four million the fed continues to believe inflation risks are weighted to the upside that ongoing rate hikes are appropriate and that a sustained period of below trend growth is required to get inflation under control unsurprisingly 75bp is fully priced by financial markets a 50bp hike is predicted by a tiny minority of analysts a view that got some traction following recent comments from a couple of doves on the committee about the perceived risks of over tightening policy and creating an unnecessarily deep recession however the general view is that this is more of a story regarding the size of rate hikes at subsequent meetings still it certainly dampened any talk of a 100bp rate rise no analyst is forecasting such an outcome based on consensus survey responses unlike at recent meetings fed could hint at a slower path ahead the market had been favouring a fifth consecutive 75bp hike at the december fomc meeting up until late last week however a wall street journal article last friday by nick timiraos who has gained a reputation as the fed s go to guy when senior management want to guide the market more directly helped alter the balance of thinking his article hinted that some officials are concerned that things were moving too fast too quickly and they need to rein the market back a bit which has re opened the possibility of just a 50bp hike in december this was followed by comments from san francisco fed president mary daly echoing sentiments from fed governor chris waller that the fed is thinking about a step down but we re not there yet smaller rate hikes from canada and australia have added to a sense that bankers are looking to tone down the aggressiveness as fed chair jerome powell has repeatedly admitted monetary policy works with long and varied lags and after having hiked rates 375bp it might soon be time to stop battering the economy so aggressively the speed with which treasury yields mortgage rates and other borrowing costs have been rising in the economy is causing some economic stress most notably in the housing market but there is also concern that financial stresses could potentially be brewing in the system consequently we do indeed expect the fed to open the door to a slower pace through formal forward guidance but it may not necessarily go through it inflation needs to soften to prevent a fifth 75bp hike with inflation failing to behave as the fed would like the central bank is going to be reluctant to slow the pace of hikes until there is evidence that price pressures are moderating the core cpi and pce deflator continue to show prices rising 0 5 or 0 6 month on month but to get inflation to trend toward the 2 year on year target we need to see month on month price changes of closer to 0 2 so while the recent commentary has offered some support to our current house view of a 50bp rate hike in december the data doesn t yet as such we have to keep the option open for a 75bp hike in december even if the fed language is a little softer next week indeed the stickiness of inflation also suggests the risk is that our call for december to mark the peak at 4 25 4 5 is perhaps too early and it could be that we get a final 50bp in february that would then mark the top this would leave a terminal rate of 4 75 5 the 10yr effect market liquidity and fed cost management the market discount for the terminal fed funds rate is very important for the trajectory of the 10yr treasury yield in the past week that market discount has moved from 5 down to 4 8 and if the fed hikes by 75bp on 2 november the effective funds rate will move up to 3 83 that s still some 100bp below where the market expects the effective fund rate to get to the issue for the 10yr is whether that 100bp gets delivered and if not whether it over or undershoots the 100bp discounted that s where the direction for the 10yr yield will come from the other issue that will be interesting for the federal reserve is whether it decides to talk about market technicals there is a running us 2 2tr going back to the fed on the overnight reverse repo facility reflective of an ongoing excess of liquidity in the system such is the size of that excess that the sofr rate effectively the general collateral rate has been dragged down to the 3 area at times it has even been below 3 which is not a great look as the fed funds floor is 3 the rate the fed pays on the reverse repo window is 3 05 so far the fed has viewed this through the prism of a facility that continues to do its job that s fair to a point but during deeper moments of reflection there must be a nagging feeling at the fed that this is not an ideal set of circumstances and a means to correcting this is through faster balance sheet run off alternatively the balance sheet run off will ultimately cumulate to a point where it begins to materially impact the liquidity excess but that will take some time likely another few quarters a final point that the fed may or may not opine on is its profit and loss account two issues here first the performance of its bond portfolio clearly it has seen a large capital loss so far this year just as practically all bond portfolios have further rises in yields add to this negative performance second it will be interesting to see whether the fed addresses the rising price to be paid on excess reserves which are compensated at the rate of 3 15 currently and that likely goes up by 75bp in line with other rates there has been minimal commentary on this from the fed to date but it s certainly something that could be commented on in line with the tiering discussions elsewhere fx markets hyper sensitive to the pivot the dollar goes into the october fomc 3 4 off its highs of the year the move has coincided with momentum towards the idea that the fed might want to slow the pace of hikes akin to what we have seen in australia and more recently in canada the big question for the market is whether powell wants to use the press conference to discuss slowing the tightening cycle frankly that is very uncertain and why we use the scenario approach above making the case for the dollar staying relatively supported is i the market already prices the pivot to a 50bp hike in december and ii the fed knows how sensitive rate markets are to communication where the european central bank saying it had made substantial progress in withdrawing monetary accommodation saw 30bp wiped off the pricing of the ecb cycle does the fed really want to send that message as long as further hikes are coming which seem likely unless core month on month inflation starts to fall sharply we would expect the dollar to meet strong demand into any weakness after all the fed is still battling with core inflation moving away from its year end targets and as real us interest rates push higher again into year end we would back the dollar making a return to the highs in terms of levels we doubt eur usd sustains any gains over the 1 01 1 02 area and would favour 0 95 perhaps lower for later this year huge fx intervention from the bank of japan should not stand in the way of usd jpy returning to 150 and usd cny should push towards the 7 40 area despite sporadic attempts from policymakers to slow the move source ing

the world s top central bankers are beginning to fear that an already weak global economy will stall if they keep pressing on the brakes unnerved by plunging commodity prices turmoil in emerging markets and potential flashpoints at home central bankers in the euro zone united states canada and australia have all been hinting that the bigger part of their series of aggressive rate hikes may be behind them even though inflation remains high this has fuelled market speculation that central banks may be heading for a pivot market parlance for a change in direction towards smaller rate hikes that would lower inflation without wreaking havoc in the economy and markets the main driver of that change is a darker outlook for the economy with the euro zone now firmly in recession and the rest of the world also struggling to varying degrees this is helping drive down the price of raw materials which was a key driver of inflation since russia s invasion of ukraine in the most glaring example natural gas has fallen by 90 in europe as a feared shortage morphed into a supply glut that existing infrastructure is struggling to digest finally there are fears of new bouts of the kind of financial instability seen in britain where pension funds almost went under as a result of soaring long term yields and emerging markets in recent weeks over the last two weeks several g10 central banks came across as ready to pivot alfonso peccatiello author of the macro compass financial newsletter said why such a sudden change of heart because all these jurisdictions have something in common inherent fragilities he singled out high mortgage debt in canada and public debt in southern europe which can t count on a bailout from across the alps due to the euro zone s lack of a common backstop australia is also grappling with falling property prices losses for pension funds and falling demand for its commodities even the u s economy until recently strong to the point of overheating is showing signs of fragility and its housing market is cooling stubbornly high but stubbornly high inflation is making central bankers job incredibly tricky prices have risen faster than expected in germany france and italy this month data showed on friday while there is nothing central bankers can do about present inflation rates the mere optics of runaway prices made a pivot more difficult to justify this requires an extraordinary balancing act by central bankers persuading the market that they are serious about bringing down inflation without choking the economy the fed needs to open a path towards smaller interest rate hikes without sounding too dovish christian scherrmann u s economist at dws said the european central bank tried that on thursday when it said it planned to increase rates further but it had already made substantial progress in withdrawing fuel from the economy the change of tone was minimal but it was enough for investors to start pricing in smaller hikes further down the road traders in euro zone money markets brought down their expectations of where they see the ecb s peak rate to 2 6 on thursday from 3 only weeks ago although that rate rebounded on friday after the inflation data after yesterday s jumbo rate hike the december meeting could indeed deliver a dovish pivot carsten brzeski an economist at ing said earlier in the week the bank of canada surprised the markets with a smaller than expected rate increase mirroring a similar move by the reserve bank of australia some analysts also see the risk of a smaller hike by the bank of england next week most importantly the federal reserve which governs the world s reserve currency and sets the tempo for global financial markets has started a debate over how much higher it can safely push borrowing costs and how and when to slow the pace of future increases while a 75 basis point hike was seen as a certainty next week investors were now positioning for a more cautious fed going forward it is inevitable that the fed has to pause soon chris iggo of the axa im investment institute said source reuters
the 2022 us midterm elections have seen a vast influx of corporate money into key races around the country according to an analysis of federal election commission data published last week by the washington post the total volume of campaign donations for the current election cycle is nearly double the total for 2018 data from adimpact an ad tracking company has put the figure at 7 5 billion this is nearly as much as the 9 billion spent during the presidential election cycle in 2020 the flood of money has poured into the campaigns of both the democratic and republican parties under conditions of an escalating war against russia near double digit rates of inflation an ongoing pandemic a looming recession and the transformation of the republican party into a platform for fascist violence while the democrats serve as the premier party of imperialist war the elections are increasingly devoid of genuine democratic content they have the character of a financial arms race between rival factions of the ruling class with top donors investing tens and hundreds of millions from their vast fortunes to install in positions of power the bribed politicians of their choice leading the pack is george soros who has donated a total of 128 5 million mostly to democracy pac ii a democratic party aligned super pac political action committee created by soros himself in 2021 soros is the pac s only listed donor george soros chairman soros fund management usa during the session redesigning the international monetary system a davos debate at the annual meeting 2011 of the world economic forum in davos switzerland january 27 they back far right politics and politicians promoting fascistic candidates such as ted cruz and donald trump most recently their political activities have included attacking anti covid policies including calling on the wisconsin legislature to remove governor tony evers for his lock down orders long since lifted other major republican donors include kenneth griffin the founder and owner of citadel and citadel securities two of the largest investment groups in the world griffin has donated nearly 66 million mostly for house and senate races around

aligned the democratic party has received its share of support from corporate oligarchs beyond soros the second largest democratic donor is sam bankman fried a billionaire investor and founder of the ftx cryptocurrency exchange he donated over 39 million with 27 million going to the protect our future pac an organization that ostensibly exists to support policies that will help prevent another pandemic of course the biden administration and democratic controlled congress have carried out essentially the same let it rip policies as trump and the republicans allowing over a million americans to die and countless more to be permanently scarred by long covid in the interests of corporate profit and the stock market the democratic party has also received large donations from unions such as the united brotherhood of carpenters and joiners which has given more than 31 4 million to democratic candidates and democratic party aligned groups according to the campaign finance tracker open secrets the carpenters union is closely followed by the national education association which has handed over 31 million other major union donors include the american federation of teachers the service employees international union and the communication workers of america each of which has donated 10 million unions in the transportation industry have donated a combined 10 million to democratic candidates and pacs even as the biden administration and congress have worked to force pro corporate contracts on rail workers that fail to meet workers demands for adequate time off and paid sick days the teachers unions for their part have worked hand in glove with both big business parties to isolate and sell out strikes by educators driven by opposition to the reopening of unsafe schools in the midst of the ongoing pandemic the campaign finance data for this election cycle further demonstrates the fact that the democratic party is not a party of labor or democracy but a party of wall street and the us military intelligence apparatus during the republican primary elections this year the democratic party funneled millions of dollars into ads designed to boost the campaigns of far right pro trump election deniers and defeat more moderate republicans cynically calculating that democratic candidates would fare better against trump acolytes in the november general election not only has this exposed the bankruptcy of the democratic party and its inability to advance any policies that address the needs of working people and defend their democratic rights it appears to have contributed to a republican surge that may result in the take over of one or both houses of congress and many key state offices by trump allies it has also exposed the pseudo left organizations such as the democratic socialists of america dsa who promote progressive frauds like bernie sanders and alexandria ocasio cortez based on the lie that the democratic party can be pushed to the left

the fed s strategic direction has enormous global repercussions not just for the range of central banks that take their cues from the us on fighting inflation but also for the indebted developing economies staring at potential defaults as the us dollar surges in an incredibly difficult spot says daleep singh who previously led the markets group at the new york fed before serving as deputy director of biden s national economic council really every central banker all over the world is feeling nervous anxious and fearful that they might lose decades of hard earned inflation fighting credibility under the hood of the us economy on the surface the us economy shows some signs of strength but with relentless inflation and high borrowing costs starting to bite cracks have emerged the labour market continues to make notable gains so far in 2022 420 000 positions have been added on average each month down from 562 000 last year but still well above what economists consider sustainable the unemployment rate meanwhile stands at the pre pandemic low of 3 5 per cent despite nascent signs of loosening the jobs market is still among the tightest in history for every unemployed person there are still nearly two vacancies in many states there are three to overcome this employers have had to rapidly boost pay with the pace only recently starting to ebb but wage bumps have largely been outpaced by inflation which is now running at an annual rate of 8 2 per cent worryingly core measures which strip out volatile items such as food and energy and include categories such as services and housing related costs keep accelerating suggesting price pressures are becoming harder to root out any residual optimism about the economy has been overshadowed by the intensity of the price shocks while gross domestic product growth rebounded in the third quarter after shrinking in the first half of the year there are clear signs that consumer demand is weakening us business activity has also already taken a hit contracting in october for a fourth straight month as manufacturers and services providers became increasingly downbeat that has helped to ease supply logjams pushing shipping costs lower centre stage is the housing market which is buckling as 30 year mortgage rates this week eclipsed 7 per cent the highest since 2002 prices nationwide have collapsed but the declines have been largest in cities that experienced the biggest booms since the start of the pandemic advertisement economists expect fractures to become even more apparent as the effects of the fed s tightening campaign start to amplify policy adjustments take time to filter through the economy and show up in the data long after the damage has been done homes in san francisco the housing market is starting to buckle under higher interest rates bloomberg this lag means that the bulk of the fed s actions to date which have triggered a substantial appreciation of the dollar and damped demand for risky assets have yet to fully materialise it also highlights the costs of the fed s slow reaction to inflation it initially thought was transitory the fed greatly complicated its task by waiting to begin interest rate increases until march says randal quarles the fed s former vice chair for supervision who left in late 2021 and supported rates rising last northern autumn had we done that given the lags of monetary policy we d already be able to see what the effects were of those interest rate increases the case for slowing down many now believe inflation has peaked and that a recession is likely next year igniting a discussion at the fed and externally about how much more it should squeeze the economy top officials have indicated greater concern about doing too little rather than too much harkening back to errors made in the 1970s that sowed the seeds for rampant inflation to ward off a redux the fed has said it will wait for substantive signs that inflation is falling back towards its 2 per cent target before pausing rate increases but the pace at which it is moving makes some queasy every additional 75 makes me feel like the plane is going to crash rather than land smoothly says ellen meade a senior adviser to the central bank s board of governors until 2021 there s a reason for going a little bit more slowly and that s to watch and to react to the effects your policy is having at this rapid clip they aren t doing themselves any favours advertisement some fed officials have already begun to lay the groundwork for smaller rate rises as canada s central bank did this week and australia s did earlier in october the time is now to start planning for stepping down san francisco fed president mary daly said last week december could mark a downshift to half point increments but that depends on jobs and inflation data due beforehand there is also not yet a clear consensus among policymakers with some worrying about being wrongfooted by faulty forecasts that inflation is moderating if they did scale back officials might move to lift next year s projection for the benchmark rate beyond the 4 6 per cent median level previously pencilled in to guard against investors again prematurely pricing in a pivot away from tight policy fed funds futures markets now point to it peaking at about 5 per cent as the fed ploughs ahead heavy handed political pressure is only set to intensify senate democrats have already stepped up their rebukes with sherrod brown chair of the senate banking committee and john hickenlooper of colorado joining senator elizabeth warren of massachusetts and vermont s bernie sanders in urging the central bank to reconsider its plans high profile senator elizabeth warren is among democrats urging the fed to reconsider its interest rate plans ap their concern is jobs most fed officials project the unemployment rate to rise to 4 4 per cent but many wall street and academic economists believe that forecast is far too optimistic deutsche bank reckons getting inflation back to target will require unemployment breaching 5 5 per cent laurence ball at johns hopkins university argues a more realistic estimate is upwards of 7 per cent such substantive job losses and the recession they would bring would cause most pain to those least able to weather it reversing most if not all of the gains accrued in the post pandemic recovery one of the very unfortunate truths of the current situation is that the people who are really suffering right now from high inflation low income households are also the people who are going to bear the brunt of the tightening says stephanie aaronson a former fed staffer now at the brookings institution this is a no win situation yet another fear is a financial accident that threatens the stability of the broader system advertisement we are still the 800 pound gorilla in the international economy and in the financial part of that we are the 8000 pound gorilla says alan blinder who served as the fed s vice chairman in the 1990s most vulnerable are highly indebted emerging and developing economies being hammered by the strength of the dollar and rapidly rising borrowing costs with 60 per cent of low income countries at or near debt distress there inevitably will be defaults the head of the imf warned last month angst is also growing in europe which is staring down an acute energy crisis linked to the ukraine war even as the economy teeters on the brink of recession the european central bank again this week followed in the fed s footsteps and raised rates by 0 75 percentage points to combat soaring costs the blowback to the us from events abroad is small blinder notes but he acknowledges it is not zero the turmoil in the uk financial markets last month while stemming from political missteps offered a cautionary tale about how unforeseen events can quickly spiral and demand costly interventions you don t want to be in the bank of england s shoes says coronado amplifying concerns is the fragility of the us24 trillion market for us government debt the foundation of the global financial system trading conditions have rarely been choppier and liquidity now hovers at levels last seen during the march 2020 meltdown back then the fed stepped in to ensure dislocations there did not set off a full blown crisis this time the treasury is discussing buying back some of its bonds to improve liquidity despite maintaining that the market on the whole is functioning such a policy would require clear communication that these interventions are purely about the health of the market and do not convey any signal about the appropriate stance of policy says singh now at pgim fixed income straight talk from the fed will also be crucial in the coming months other former officials say especially as views splinter internally quarles warns that the biggest challenge for the fed probably arising in the first quarter of 2023 will be overcoming a potential fracturing of the message as the data become less clear cut for andrew levin a two decade fed veteran what is most critical at this stage is for the central bank to be upfront about the pain forthcoming it owes it to the public to explain like a team of physicians and say this is a very serious illness we re going to have to take you into surgery and it s going to be a slow recovery but we think that this is essential to restore your health he says additional reporting by caitlin gilbert in new york financial times
new york the federal reserve fed and bank of england boe may both unleash 75 basis point bps interest rate hikes in the coming days in a show of aggression toward inflation even in the face of mounting recession risks the transatlantic double act illustrates the trade off confronting central banks as evidence of an impending global economic contraction becomes harder to ignore even as inflation lingers for the fed the fourth such out sized move soon will bring it to a crossroads the damage to growth inflicted by policy tightening is no longer being masked by the buoyancy of the post pandemic economy while its success in taming inflation has yet to materialise the boe s situation on thursday is even less comfortable as it delivers what would be the biggest uk rate hike since 1989 not only is the country probably already in a recession but officials are also trying to reestablish the credibility of the uk s framework after former prime minister liz truss s unfunded fiscal plan led to a disastrous market crisis for each central bank the week s action is likely to be only a stepping stone toward even higher borrowing costs economists surveyed by bloomberg reckoned fed rates will reach 5 by march while the boe may keep raising to settle above 4 then again recession worries could still temper policy makers enthusiasm for forceful hiking that s what happened with the bank of canada which hiked rates by a less than expected 50 bps in the united states many economists will look to the labour market for evidence of a deepening slowdown non farm payrolls due on friday may show the economy added 190 000 jobs in october the smallest addition since president joe biden s administration began in january 2021 with the architects of the chaos no longer in power and the risk premium on uk assets fading the pressure on the boe to act aggressively has eased said bloomberg economist dan hanson elsewhere this week a likely slowdown in eurozone growth possible rate hikes from norway to australia and a renewed surge in turkish inflation will keep financial markets busy china releases its purchasing managers index or pmi reports for october soon with a pullback expected market watchers will closely scrutinise the release of intervention figures to see how much japan spent to prop up the yen in october as the currency still hovers near 32 year lows australia s central bank chief philip lowe is set to raise rates again soon as inflation continues to heat up faster than expected by economists still the reserve bank of australia is more likely to opt for another quarter percentage point hike as it factors in concerns over the impact on households and businesses of raising rates too quickly south korea s export figures will give an early sign of how global commerce fared in october and how seriously the cratering won is widening the country s trade deficit inflation figures the following day will show if price growth is continuing to cool as the bank of korea hikes rates hong kong will likely follow the fed in raising borrowing costs and commercial banks may follow suit by increasing their prime rates for the second time since september another blow to consumer and business spending whether or not eurozone data show the economy grew in the third quarter it s likely to be the worst performance since early 2021 when the pandemic was still raging the report may still fare better than what will follow economists reckon a recession has taken hold during the current three month period inflation data due concurrently will illustrate the cost shock bearing down on the region s growth prospects with the pace of consumer prices seen accelerating to a eurozone record of 10 3 various european central bank speakers will make public remarks days after they raised rates by 75 bps among them are chief economist philip lane and president christine lagarde who ll speak while visiting the baltic region later in the week lagarde on saturday tweeted that defeating inflation is our mantra our mission our mandate in the united kingdom the first full week of prime minister rishi sunak s tenure s likely to feature continuing speculation on spending cuts that may be unveiled in mid november meanwhile just as the boe raises rates again evidence of the damaging impact on home loan approvals will emerge in data other central bank decisions on thursday include that from norges bank which is likely to raise rates by at least a quarter point recent faster than expected inflation data has fuelled speculation that norway s central bank could opt for a fourth straight half point hike by contrast the czech central bank will probably leave borrowing costs unchanged as policy makers assess they re high enough to bring consumer prices under control in poland inflation data may help determine whether central bankers will resume rate hikes an acceleration to a new high of 17 8 is forecast by economists looking south saudi arabia the fastest growing economy in the group of 20 will announce its third quarter growth figures soon as it reaps the benefits of higher energy prices and urgently seeks to funnel money into building an economy that can thrive beyond oil in kenya data today will likely show inflation slowed for the first time in seven months it s still expected to be above the top end of the central bank s 2 5 to 7 5 target range and remain there until at least the first quarter of 2023 which could prompt a rate increase next month turkish inflation on thursday will probably show another increase to 86 as the central bank s

bloomberg luiz inacio lula da silva won brazil s presidential election in a dramatic comeback for the left wing politician who was languishing in a jail cell for corruption just three years ago he defeated the incumbent jair bolsonaro with 50 9 to 49 1 of the votes in sunday s runoff according to the official tally the outcome signals a change in direction for latin america s largest economy after a heated campaign that showed extreme polarization among the electorate and marks the first time a sitting president in brazil has lost a re election bid i consider myself as someone who s been resurrected lula 77 said in his first speech as president elect in sao paulo they tried to bury me alive bolsonaro 67 has yet to concede or comment on the results lula told supporters he hasn t received a phone call from bolsonaro and o globo newspaper said he s been unavailable even for his closest allies the president s reaction will be closely watched by investors since he repeatedly questioned the electoral authorities during the campaign suggesting he might not recognize the result still brazil s lower house speaker arthur lira a bolsonaro ally wrote on social media that the will of the majority must not be challenged while senate chief rodrigo pacheco praised the country s electronic voting system us president joe biden quickly congratulated lula saying the elections were free fair and credible china brazil s largest trading partner also complimented the president elect in a twitter post by its local embassy the brazilian real underperformed most emerging market currencies on monday weakening 0 8 at 9 45 a m in sao paulo after dropping about 2 earlier futures on the local stock market also declined as investors awaited for picks to lead key cabinets including the finance ministry in his victory speech lula promised to reunite the country after the divisive race rebuilding ties with other government institutions his first goal he added is to end hunger again while attracting foreign investors to re industrialize the economy he also pledged zero deforestation of the amazon see brazil s election results here in downtown rio de janeiro a crowd that had gathered in front of the city s municipal chamber to watch the results erupted in jubilation as the final vote tally ticked in red clad supporters for the president elect shot off bottle rockets and tossed beers in the air couples embraced others cried it s been four very hard years i lost my job in the pandemic and see so many others struggle to get by said flavio nema 25 an out of work history teacher it s not going to be easy for lula he s got a congress against him the election exposed the divide between a sizable minority who support bolsonaro s right wing populist rhetoric and predominantly poorer voters with memories of better times under lula who oversaw an economic surge amid a boom in commodity exports when he ran the country from 2003 to 2010 despite his triumph the president elect will face a divided country and a divided congress with bolsonaro s allies having captured a large presence in both chambers on top of controlling the country s three most populous states sao paulo minas gerais and rio de janeiro lula s challenge of governing is bigger than that of winning the election brazilian society needs to be rebuilt in its institutional and fiscal basis said carolina botelho a political scientist with the institute of advanced studies at sao paulo university lula will need to recover the internal and external trust of financial agents and civil society social tension he returns to the helm at a moment of acute political and social tensions in brazil with concerns about rising levels of poverty in an economy that s yet to fully recover from the damage wrought by the pandemic internationally brazil is under pressure to reverse bolsonaro policies that contributed to deforestation in the amazon and affirm rights for the lgbtq community and other minorities that the president frequently ridiculed lula needs to broaden his government coalition analyst react as much as an endorsement of lula the outcome is a repudiation of bolsonaro s four years in office including his erratic handling of the pandemic that left some 700 000 brazilians dead and his constant clashes with institutions such as the electoral authorities the president consistently struggled with female voters who make up almost 53 of the total what defines this election is a rejection of bolsonarismo said christian lynch a political scientist at the state university of rio de janeiro lula s victory continues a trend of wins by left wing candidates in latin america over the past 18 months most prominently in chile colombia and peru as voters punished incumbents that were in charge during the covid 19 outbreak but it also showcases lula s sharp political skills particularly his ability to come back from the corruption scandal that marred his legacy lula was a wildly popular president before accusations of wrongdoing and fiscal mismanagement resulted in the impeachment of his hand picked successor dilma rousseff in 2016 by 2019 lula was behind bars and facing a long prison sentence amid accusations he steered billions of state contracts to allies released on a technicality it cleared the way for him to run last year after the supreme court quashed his convictions while today many brazilians see him as a symbol of corruption he remains revered by others for launching social programs that lifted millions out of poverty confronting bolsonaro s authoritarian bent lula campaigned as a defender of democracy alliances cabinet brazilians voted against the incumbent despite an improving outlook for the 1 8 trillion economy with unemployment falling for seven consecutive months easing inflationary pressures and the costs of borrowing steady after an 18 month tightening campaign by the central bank that s an encouraging setup for lula as he takes over the reins after forming alliances during the campaign most notably with senator simone tebet following the first round that should bolster his support in a center right leaning congress it sends a positive sign to investors as it means he can move faster on the reform front and addressing economic challenges according to adriana dupita a sao paulo based economist at bloomberg economics lula s victory brings the sense of an end of a cycle and the beginning of a new phase she said his third term comes amid very different circumstances than the first two politically globally economically as well brazil etf gains in tokyo as investors cheer smooth election investors will be watching closely to see who lula appoints as his finance chief after refusing to specify a name from the dozens of economists who advised him during the campaign former central bank chief henrique meirelles and ex health minister alexandre padilha have emerged as two strong candidates for the job three people with knowledge of the matter told bloomberg news before the vote early in his campaign lula reached out to a broad coalition comprising 10 parties and tapped a centrist former rival geraldo alckmin as his running mate while the multi party alliance amplifies the reach of the new government some experts warn that the different priorities within the coalition could be a weakness at the moment of taking decisions there are also questions about how an older lula who is a cancer surviver and said he will only serve one four year term will tackle a more complex country than when he first came to power two decades ago lula s main challenge will be to reconcile the divergent interests from the broad group that supports him said paulo gama a sao paulo based political

a national park wants to use rat poison to get rid of a fish they brought in glacier national park in montana is a fisherman s paradise hundreds of snow fed lakes pepper the park home to over 20 species of fish including six kinds of trout and because it s federal land no license is required to cast a reel but in a warming world the national park service nps is hoping to transform one of glacier national park s coldest lakes into a refuge for a species of trout but it s not as simple as translocating this species into the park in order to create an environment for these fish nps first needs to get rid of the non native trout that currently inhabit that lake the plan proposed by the park which if approved would begin september 2023 recommends using a long used pesticide and rat poison called rotenone despite being a naturally derived compound it has been banned for use on rodents since 2005 while it is still a widely used fish toxin or piscicide as well as a widely used pesticide researchers have unearthed strong epidemiological links with parkinson s disease advertisement advertisement like many lakes in the western united states gunsight lake was historically fishless however in the early 1900s this picturesque body of water nestled between the towering peaks of fusillade jackson and gunsight mountains was artificially stocked with rainbow trout to improve recreational fishing opportunities since then according to the scoping document or the proposed plan released by the nps the rainbow trout established a self sustaining population in the lake through hybridization i e the mixing of gene pools they threaten the existence of native cutthroat trout within the same saint mary s waterways a listed species of concern for the state of montana in order to help establish their population the park is proposing to apply the fish toxicant via an inflatable boat and backpack sprayers with helicopters transporting materials while rotenone naturally breaks down due to sunlight to further limit potential contamination of the saint mary river and the rest of the saint mary water system a neutralizing agent likely potassium permanganate would be used downstream once the non native fish are eradicated the park would then translocate i e stock the river with the cutthroat trout this is all to say the park is proposing using poison to kill one fish in order to save another and it s not uncommon either in the grand canyon the nps is currently planning to use similar methods in order to save a native endangered fish species in the park while environmentalists support the action being taken at the grand canyon arguing that the case aims to protect a federally endangered species whose only habitat is that river they insist that in the case of glacier national park perhaps an alternative to poison should be considered a cutthroat trout rests on the bottom of the flathead river near glacier national park getty margaret townsend an attorney for the center for biological diversity a non profit focused on conservation urged the park to consider alternatives something their scoping document did not discuss because poison is indiscriminate because it d just kill everything in the lake we d prefer other options be explored in a situation like this one she said advertisement advertisement townsend suggested a few alternatives she cited the idea of electrofishing a method which uses electricity in order to more effectively harvest undesirable fish another option to be explored according to townsend is hosting a fishing derby a contest that encourages anglers to catch as many fish as possible she also suggested a hybrid model perhaps one which utilizes both electrofishing then tracking to ensure all of the fish are captured chris downs a fisheries biologist for the park argued that these methods take too long we ve tried many of these other methods in the past and they haven t been extremely effective he said they can take years and years and years rotenone takes a week however townsend argues that perhaps the poison should only be used in emergency situations the main difference with the case in the grand canyon is that the native species is listed as endangered and that lake is their only habitat in the world for the grand canyon time is of the essence townsend argued but for glacier national park i m not so sure beyond the issue of whether or not to poison these fish in order to protect another dana johnson a staff attorney for wilderness watch a non profit organization dedicated to protecting wilderness areas argues that the way in which the park is planning to deploy the poison is a problem advertisement advertisement the proposals run head on into the wilderness act s untrammeled mandate which says natural processes and conditions are supposed to dictate what type and how many species persist rather than intentional human control and manipulation johnson said in short johnson argues that because most of glacier national park is recommended wilderness it should be treated as such and human interference should be limited it s an ideology townsend shares and in her opinion points to larger issues around conservation that need to be addressed in her opinion while the park is attempting to create a cold water refuge for this species it is a band aid solution one that does not address that waters are warming all over the west and the world killing one species to save another is something we have to come to terms with townsend said we ve created these problems and then are trying to resolve them with a very quick fix but there is so much more we could do to save cold water habitat advertisement advertisement on the other hand one could see this as the park attempting to take action and do their part in protecting wilderness in the face of a warming world we can t control the changing climate downs said we re just trying to buy these fish more

is selective and limited within cancer patients with cldn18 2 high expression leaving unmet need for patients with cldn18 2 low expressing tumors ibi343 is claudin 18 2 targeting adc with bystander effect and has demonstrated promising anti tumor effect in claudin 18 2 high and low in vivo models with tolerable safety profile we look forward to the positive results in the safety tolerability and efficacy of ibi343 in the clinic dr hui zhou senior vice president of innovent stated at present target treatment options are limited for gastric and pancreatic cancer where imply huge unmet clinical needs high expression of claudin 18 2 in aforesaid tumors suggests its high potential and innovent has been actively rolling out a cluster of claudin 18 2 drug candidates across different modalities to seek for differentiated therapeutic values while guarantee druggability we are pleased that the first patient dose of ibi343 has been completed in australia in parallel the ind for ibi343 has been filed in china last month we are looking forward to the positive results of ibi343 in patients with advanced solid tumors ibi343 is our first adc molecule to initiate clinical study in both australia and china adding a valuable clinical asset in our r d pipeline that represents innovent s global innovation strategy the company will also accelerate the development of more innovative molecules with high global potential taking advantage of cross regional r d and clinical resources adhering to the long term development strategy of driven by innovation developed through globalization with an aim to benefit cancer patients worldwide about claudin 18 2 claudin18 2 is a member of the claudin protein family which is a highly tissue specific protein expressed only in differentiated epithelial cells on the gastric mucosa under normal physiological conditions previous studies have revealed that claudin18 2 is highly expressed in multiple types of cancer such as gastric cancer pancreatic cancer esophageal adenocarcinoma and colorectal cancer the unique feature of limited expression in normal tissues and highly specific expression in cancer makes claudin18 2 an ideal target for developing the immunotherapeutic for solid tumors globally there are many candidate therapies in clinical development the drug modalities under development include monoclonal antibodies bispecific antibodies antibody conjugated drugs and car t cell products however currently no drug targeting claudin18 2 has been approved about ibi343 ibi343 is a recombinant human anti claudin 18 2 monoclonal antibody drug conjugate adc developed by innovent biologics ibi343 binds to the claudin 18 2 expressing tumor cells the claudin 18 2 dependent adc internalization will occurr and the drug is released resulting in dna damage and eventually apoptosis of the tumor cells the freed drug can also diffuse across the plasma membrane to reach and kill the neighboring cells resulting in bystander killing effect currently phase i study of ibi343 has been conducted in australia nct05458219 to assess the safety tolerability and preliminary efficacy of ibi343 in subjects with advanced solid tumors and to determine the maximum tolerated dose mtd and or recommended phase 2 dose rp2d about innovent inspired by the spirit of start with integrity succeed through action innovent s mission is to develop

the supply and distribution of food and disaster relief items to caribbean community caricom member states will soon be facilitated by two separately managed regional logistics hubs both based in barbados in a region in which extreme weather us import dependency and regional barriers to trade are ongoing threats to food security the two facilities will bring a promise of strengthened regional supply chains and logistics capacities as well as heightened intra regional trade and efficient distribution of humanitarian assistance in the event of disaster caribbean agriculture and fisheries are disproportionately exposed to climate impacts on weather patterns air and sea surface temperatures and freshwater availability threats that are compounded by the region s 5 billion food import bill representing 80 of all food consumed according to the united nations countries in the caribbean suffer annual losses from storm damages measured in in property crops and livestock equivalent to 17 of their gdp covid 19 supply chain impacts and the effect of the war in ukraine have contributed to a 46 increase in moderate to severe food insecurity in the region between february and august 2022 the highest rate since 2020 leaving 57 of the population struggling to put food on the table but there is hope for improved resilience amidst growing global uncertainty according to prime minister mia amor mottley barbados is ideally placed from a geographic perspective to serve as a trans shipment point from which you can reach multiple countries in both the caribbean island chain and in coastal latin america bajanpro for world food programme the hubs provide hope for a new intra regional logistical network that is efficient continuous sustainable and safe leading to reduced import dependence and improved climate resilience speaking in trinidad tobago in august 2022 at the second regional agri investment forum chairman of the caricom private sector organization gervase warner described food security as a critical issue for our own survival it is very clear to us we are not going to get help from our colonizers of the past we are not going to get help from big developing countries this is our problem for us to address the barbados guyana food terminal in a statement made during the inaugural agri food investment forum and expo in guyana in may 2022 prime minister mottley indicated that the caribbean needs an efficient supply chain that is safe and secure and not necessarily one that is driven by imports the barbados guyana food terminal and state of the art abattoir as provided for under the saint barnabas accord between barbados and guyana will house guyanese produce for local consumption and serve as a trans shipment point for exports the facility could serve as a cushion in the event of shocks that impact food security while also supporting the regional import substitution program 25 by 2025 which aims to cut food imports by 25 by 2025 office of the president of guyana the launch of the facility could also spur investment in a previously declining segment of the economy over the past few decades the sizeable economic contribution of sectors such as tourism have marginalized the agriculture sector leaving the caribbean highly dependent on extra regional food imports transportation and import costs have resulted in high food prices with the caribbean ranked second highest globally for the cost of a healthy diet and third for an energy sufficient diet consequently with 80 of food consumed being imported from outside the region the caribbean has become highly vulnerable to food systems disruptions and external shocks with scarce foreign reserves being expended on imported highly processed foods that have been connected to the region s high rates of non communicable diseases in many cases large amounts of imported fruits and vegetables could be substituted with locally and regionally grown foods but intra regional barriers to trade and logistical and transport issues have prevented the movement of food within the region according to barbados agriculture minister indar weir ground is to be broken in early 2023 for the development of the 7 acre facility which will serve as a food logistics hub and trans shipment point for produce originating in guyana a major agricultural producer in the caribbean the facility will also accommodate about 45 containers land for crop production a processing and packaging plant cold storage facilities and a reservoir that will hold 20 million gallons of water it is aimed at developing an important trans shipment hub for food here in barbados to move on to different hotel chains in other caribbean islands and to move on to miami said guyanese president irfaan ali in his feature address at the opening of barbados agro fest agricultural festival in may 2022 improving logistics performance from the perspective of customs transport through ports internal connections and the provision of advanced logistics services should be well received in the region as there is massive room for improvement as a point of reference it is much easier from both a financial and a logistical standpoint to trade in agriculture products between the caribbean and the united states than it is to trade identical products within the region with all that you are producing if we can t get it to the island chain in a manner that is quick and affordable then it is of no use said prime minister mottley of the necessity for infrastructural improvements to facilitate the intra regional movement of food world food programme wfp caribbean disaster management agency cdema government of barbados regional logistics hub and center of excellence elizabeth riley executive director of the caribbean disaster management agency cdema has said that the existing multi hazard environment in which the region operates has created the need to strengthen the emergency logistics response as the second most hazard prone region in the world having suffered over 22 billion in disaster related damages between 1970 and 2016 effective end to end supply chain management of relief assistance is critical for the disaster resilience of the region a regional logistics hub and centre of excellence which broke ground in august 2022 at grantley adams airport in barbados will operate as a central location for emergency logistics coordination for the english speaking caribbean and tracking assets and relief items in the wake of disasters once operational it will support air and sea operations and will serve as a prepositioning and response center and trans shipment point for relief items bajanpro for world food programme the hub which was developed as a partnership between the world food programme wfp the government of barbados and the caribbean disaster emergency management agency cdema will also serve as a center of excellence with the role of strengthening the logistics and emergency response capacities of practitioners in emergency logistics warehouse and fleet management and last mile delivery including targeting and distributing assistance there has never been greater urgency for a facility of this kind in the region climate change has increased the likelihood that the caribbean will experience a greater proportion of major hurricanes in the years to come the fact that natural disasters occur more frequently and cost more on average in the caribbean than elsewhere even in comparison to other small states holds significant implications for the food security of a region that consists predominantly of net food importing countries with small vulnerable agricultural sectors large coastal populations and over exploited natural resources when category 5 hurricane maria struck dominica in 2019 it resulted in losses amounting to 226 of 2016 gdp from the perspective of post disaster economic flows agriculture was the most significantly impacted sector government sources estimated that 80 100 of root crops vegetables bananas and plantains and 90 of tree crops were damaged with livestock losses estimated at 90 of chicken stocks and 45 of cattle in addition to damage to farm buildings and equipment the crop and livestock sectors suffered a total estimated loss of 179 6 million the fisheries sector was also heavily affected with 370 vessels being destroyed likewise in 2017 antigua and barbuda sustained half a million dollars in losses to its agriculture sector while the fisheries sector sustained 0 46 million in losses in the wake of hurricane irma in august 2022 wfp executive director david beasley joined the prime minister of barbados mia mottley cdema executive director elizabeth riley and wfp country director of the caribbean multi country office regis chapman for the groundbreaking ceremony of the hub thank you for this extraordinary partnership said mr beasley to prime minister mottley we know there will be more hurricanes we don t see mother nature easing down any time soon this is not about barbados alone this is about the entire region highlighting the constant and growing threat of climate change to the region and the need to deliver assistance to affected people prime minister mottley said of the logistics hub and wfp cdema barbados partnership this was just simply meant to be we have to recognize that no matter how we much money you have in any part of the world no matter how strong you are as a nation or a company you are not immune from certain realities that is why global cooperation and global moral strategic leadership is needed more ever at this point in time she continued according to the 2015 notre dame global adaptation country index the caribbean is one of the least climate resilient regions globally from the perspective of food security in its ranking of 189 countries food systems resilience to climate change impacts the index placed st kitts nevis and antigua barbuda in positions 175 and 177 respectively the two caribbean nations were the only countries from the americas to fall into the bracket of the twenty most climate vulnerable countries in the world with respect to food of the 14 caribbean countries accounted for by the index only two made it into the more climate resilient half of the ranking these were trinidad tobago which was in 66th position and suriname which was in 72nd position out of 189 countries jamaica was 99 barbados was 107 bahamas was 110 belize was 115 guyana was 128 dominica was also 128 st vincent the grenadines was 132 grenada was 133 haiti was 135 and st lucia was 143 out of 189 countries meaning that there are only 46 countries that have less climate resilient food systems than st lucia the notre dame global adaptation country index supports other findings that caribbean countries are among the most vulnerable in the world to climate impacts the caribbean islands are right on the front lines of climate change urged david beasley in his address at the ground breaking of the regional logistics hub over the past seven decades 511 global disasters have impacted small island developing states 324 of which occurred in the caribbean with damages at a ratio to gross domestic product six times higher than larger countries as hurricanes become more frequent and severe we need to be fully prepared so that lives are saved livelihoods are defended and hard won development gains are protected said mr beasley as he looked over at the future location of the regional logistics hub and center of excellence we are not here by accident follow me on or

justin ashley and past champ brittany force has a chance to make up some ground on second place force when they square off in round two force s lead over brown is just 18 points brown ran 3 709 to defeat kalitta but will cede lane choice to force it didn t take long to get the first major upset of the day as points leader justin ashley fell to clay millican the loss was especially stunning as millican s edelbrock group dragster didn t make it down the track on any of its four qualifying passes charting a best of just 4 27 for the no 14 spot then had trouble starting for the opening round but crew chief jim oberhofer got the ship righted with a stunning 3 695 for a huge upset ashley s loss was his second first round loss of the countdown he also exited in the opening stanza in st louis but true to fashion the second generation nitro racer appeared unfazed and positive of course i m disappointed he said but i m happy for clay and his team we knew coming into the countdown that it wasn t going to be easy this is the emotional rollercoaster but we re not going to ride those waves no matter what happens the rest of the day we re going to be in it come to pomona and i m super proud of our phillips connect team we ll regroup and be back in pomona and ready to rock with ashley s loss his lead over brittany force is down to 53 points but force will need to win the race to

trying to get back into the field they towed off with their heads hung low only to be informed later that they were back in arend s fortune was truly an out of the frying pan and into the fire situation as he was paired with low qualifier and points leader robert hight in round one and had no answer for hight s 3 88 hight s win kept alive his amazing 21 race streak as the only pro driver to not lose in round one this season matt hagan doesn t usually have to win races on holeshots especially in the first round but he needed one this time as his dodge power brokers charger dropped a cylinder early against steven densham densham s appearance in round one was testament alone to the team s resilience as they suffered a major engine fire on the first qualifying pass and had to drive back to california to retrieve their spare body hagan s slim 089 to 094 reaction time advantage earned him the win by just 003 second as densham actually ran quicker 4 121 to 4 123 some days you just need to be lucky and that was definitely our lucky round said hagan we ll have to earn the rest of them the car just wasn t happy the whole run it put some cylinders out early down there and the pan pressure or the crew chief shut me off when he came by me down there i didn t think we got the win light then i saw it on the wall we have to keep digging to stay in this hunt and we need every round

in his rad torque systems camaro anderson cut a great 011 light but his hendrickcars com camaro made a move toward the centerline as soon as he dumped the clutch and that likely cost him enough elapsed time to hold off glenn the championship battle in pro stock is not nearly as dramatic as those in the other three nhra classes but that doesn t make for any less race day drama especially since the entire pro stock field was separated by just six hundredths of a second the parity that exists in the pro stock class was on display early in eliminations as cristian cuadra defeated matt hartford on a holeshot 6 654 to 6 644 hartford wasn t bad on the tree with a 032 light but cuadra was better with a 014 most fans will remember that cuadra made the final round the last time we raced in las vegas at the four wide event in april in fact he was leading eventual champ erica enders in the final quad when his corral boots camaro went silent the point is that he s a strong bet to become nhra s next first time winner cuadra is now in tenth place following losses by bo butner and camrie caruso cristian wasn t the only member of the cuadra family to show off his driving skills in round one fernando jr took out bo butner on a holeshot when he got off the starting lien cleanly with a 005 light butner certainly wanted to have a longer stay in eliminations but he can now turn his

salmon was a hot topic in wednesday night s debate between candidates for alaska s sole u s house seat when asked what they would do to address declining salmon stocks all candidates pointed to bycatch as a continued threat to salmon and crab across the state republican and former gov sarah palin began her answer with a shout out to bristol bay and her time in the region near and dear to my heart the fish issues having for years set netted on the nushagak in bristol bay she said palin said the state is doing a good job with management and that it follows the maximum sustainable yield mandate outlined in state law but she said the federal government needs to step up it s the feds who lack the enforcement the bycatch laws that too many people are getting away with especially foreign trawlers she said they re not allowing those salmon to get back to where they need to be to spawn we need to bust these people who are doing these illegal activities you take their vessels you take their gear you take their permits and we start teaching them a lesson bycatch is the accidental harvest of species that fishermen are not targeting tribes communities and small boat fishermen in western alaska have been particularly vocal with concerns about whether and how bycatch has contributed to declines in their salmon returns democrat and incumbent rep mary peltola who previously directed the kuskokwim inter tribal fish commission said she wants to ensure there s funding for research on both the state and federal levels but she said managers can t wait for those results we ve got to take precautionary management we cannot allow metric tons of bycatch of juvenile salmon crab and halibut to be thrown overboard every year this has led to a very devastating collapse of not only salmon but halibut and now we re seeing it in the crab industry as well she said the bering sea snow crab fishery will be closed for the first time in its history this winter after the number of crabs dropped by nearly 90 since 2018 bristol bay red king crab populations have also declined drastically and that fishery will be closed for the second season in a row republican candidate nick begich agreed trawl bycatch should be addressed immediately and he pointed to the magnuson stevens act the main law regulating fishing in federal waters one of the late congressman don young s goals was to renew the magnuson stevens act in september the house natural resources committee passed a revision of the act adding in restrictions on bycatch and naming climate change as a threat to federal fisheries for the first time begich wants to proceed with caution i think that we need to be careful about how we go through our magnuson stevens act reauthorization and making sure that we re putting precision language into the act that is actually going to demonstrably improve the sustainability of these fisheries he said we have a mandate under the state constitution for a maximum sustainable yield and every fishery in the state needs to be managed with that objective begich also noted that while some runs in the state have declined bristol bay s sockeye salmon returns are at a record high he said managers must understand why bristol bay is succeeding biologists don t know exactly why bristol bay s runs have been so large in recent years but say it may be due to warming waters both in the ocean and in freshwater spawning grounds there is a strong correlation between warming temperatures and the increase in bristol bay sockeye runs other species have not fared as well king and chum salmon in the nushagak river were at some of their lowest numbers on record in recent years and neither species has been meeting the minimum goal for sustainability libertarian candidate chris bye said he saw just three king salmon on the chena river while working as a fishing guide this summer he also agreed bycatch is an issue but just throwing it back doesn t solve the problem i honestly think we need to get industry more involved in reducing their catch otherwise it s not going to be there he said it s only a renewable resource until it s all gone bye also suggested divvying up seats on the north pacific fishery management council by region rather than race that council decides fishery policy in alaska s federal waters peltola advocated adding two alaska native seats to that council as part of the magnuson stevens rewrite alaska public media ktoo and alaska s news source produced the debates for alaska governor and the u s house and senate which aired statewide on television and radio early voting is underway in many communities across the state election day is nov 8 get in touch with the author at izzy kdlg org or 907 842 2200

this post is also available in spanish the way in which the value of the argentine peso is fixed today is unconstitutional and it is up to congress to act urgently to determine in accordance with the constitution how to establish the argentine currency on the basis of sovereign criteria by miguel julio rodríguez villafañe currency plays a fundamental role in the modern monetary economy of a state since it is one of the clear manifestations of a nation s sovereignty and its unity in argentina the power to issue currency is the power of the national state and it is the national congress that is authorised to stamp currency fix its value and that of foreign currencies art 75 inc 11 c n at the same time there is an explicit prohibition for provincial powers to mint coins without the authorisation of the federal congress art 126 c n monetary integration also allows for the development of adequate commercial exchange of the provinces among themselves and with foreign nations art 75 inc 13 n c furthermore article 75 paragraph 19 of the national constitution when referring to the responsibility of the national congress among other basic aspects establishes the duty of defending the value of the currency to this must be added the international covenant on economic social and cultural rights and the covenant on civil and political rights of constitutional hierarchy art 75 inc 22 c n which determine that all peoples have the right to self determination and in function of this provide for their economic social and cultural development likewise the 1994 constitutional reform introduced article 76 which prohibits congress from delegating legislation to the executive branch except in specific matters of administration or public emergency with a fixed term for its exercise and within the basis of the delegation established by congress the constitutional monetary system is complemented by the power of the national congress to establish and regulate a federal bank with the power to issue coins art 75 inc 6 c n thus the carta orgánica del banco central de la república argentina bcra ley 24 144 provides that it is an autarchic entity whose primary and fundamental mission is to promote among other things monetary stability and shall develop a monetary and financial policy aimed at safeguarding the functions of money as a store of value art 3 the bank s functions are also f to establish and execute the exchange rate policy in accordance with the legislation approved by the honourable congress of the nation art 4 emergency laws in january 2002 the national congress passed law 25 561 by which it declared the public emergency in social economic administrative financial and foreign exchange matters delegating to the national executive power the powers included in the law until 10 december 2003 in view of the aforementioned powers delegated by the national congress the national executive was empowered to establish the system that will determine the exchange rate between the peso and foreign currencies and to dictate exchange regulations art 2 this emergency law had extensions by law 27 200 and then by law 27 345 the latter extended the emergency until december 2019 but the international monetary fund imf in the 2018 stand by agreement demanded that the exchange rate should exceed inflation in this way it came to determine exchange rate policy in substitution of the national congress then law 27 541 on social solidarity and productive reactivation in the framework of the public emergency of december 2019 does not have any mention of the delegation of congress made in article 2 of the previous emergency law as a result the power delegated to the executive power to set the value of the currency is non existent at this time the lack of any mention of any delegation for a specific period of time as javier llorens rightly says is perfectly in line with what was agreed in the extended facilities agreement with the imf in 2020 approved by congress with reticence in relation to the technical guidelines of the same and the value of the currency by order of the imf must continue to be adjusted above inflation this together with the expectations generated by the price of parallel dollars fixed from new york is the main cause of inflation this is substantially aggravated by the fact that the executive power without any authorisation from congress has generated an exchange chaos providing for the existence of numerous exchange rates ranging from an official base value to the same price of parallel dollars validating an exchange pluriverse that is the real engine of inflation and the unhinging of argentina s monetary economy then law 27 668 of march 2022 which approved the latest agreement with the imf only did so with respect to the debt and not to the programme which it says is a matter for the executive branch in other words it did not delegate any power to the executive branch with regard to how to fix the currency nor did it validate what was imposed by the imf in reality the value of the ccl contado con liquidación dollar depends essentially on the price of public foreign debt securities on the new york stock exchange which to a large extent is determined by the big investment funds such as black rock at the same time this has brought about an inflation caused by the price of parallel dollars which implied a sort of officialisation of the multiple exchange rates that coexist today in the argentine economy later validated by the government by taking it as a basis for comparison with the official dollar this ultimately demonstrates that inflation does not only come from the growth of the monetary base and issuance moreover in reality this leads to a fictitious inflation but if the dollar falls prices do not necessarily fall unconstitutional way of fixing the value of the argentine peso in view of the above the current way of fixing the exchange value of our currency with respect to the dollar violates the above mentioned constitutional norms art 31 of the national constitution it is necessary to overcome the messages of some political sectors that directly pretend to assume the us dollar as currency making us lose the total management of our economic future in short it is urgent that the national congress in accordance with the constitutional mandate determines the way to establish the value of the argentine monetary sign based on sovereign criteria addressed to the bcra with precise and objective instructions for determined periods of time cordoban

remestemcel l in the treatment of children with sr agvhd as guided by fda survival outcomes have not improved over the past two decades for children or adults with the most severe forms of sr agvhd 2

first elon musk revolutionized the automobile industry then he tackled space travel by taking control of twitter the eccentric billionaire now wields a nearly untold level of influence in using his fortune to grab hold of such an important platform experts say he has even inserted himself squarely in today s global political conversation he is not just expressing views on an instrument of communication he now owns it and sets the policy of how that instrument will be used jeffrey winters a specialist in elites and oligarchs at northwestern university told afp the question now is what he will do with that power starting with the topic on everyone s mind whether or not musk will allow former us president donald trump to return to the site without anyone to answer to musk is going to change the constellation of political voices that are going to be expressed through twitter winters said according to the professor musk represents a typical oligarch a person whose fortune lends them social and political power not available to an average citizen though musk does not have any governments or militaries under his control oracle in the business world musk s bona fides as an innovator are well established he goes into directions that people just never go in and he creates brand new products that proved to be highly effective and successful said nicholas colas co founder of datatrek research musk did not invent the electric car but with tesla he showed it was possible in a big scalable way colas explained with spacex musk introduced internet satellites and reusable rockets technologies that were something that s been promised but never really delivered until he came along colas added for colas musk can in some ways be compared with inventors as prolific as thomas edison or iconic apple founder steve jobs he has proven at least that he knows how to make money tesla is by far the highest valued car company on the stock market and spacex is worth more than 125 billion so when the richest man in the world gives his two cents on a business matter such as his opinion on a company or on cryptocurrency like an oracle his fans listen he can shake up the markets with just a few words in 2021 when musk edited his twitter bio to simply say bitcoin the price of the virtual currency temporarily soared 20 percent he could have stuck to his role as a businessman and adopted a low profile according to winters that s what most rich people do fearing hostile reactions to their wealth they employ lawyers and lobbyists to discreetly protect their interests sometimes financing political campaigns but elon musk is unafraid to be very rich and very visible winters said red line the creation of tesla as an iconic brand brought him to people s attention and great wealth said arizona state university communication and marketing specialist mark hass then he just was willing to put himself out there continually on social media on issues that other ceos would never publicly engage with the way he did he added he s not afraid to say what is on his mind regardless of who he insults regardless of which regulator he angers said hass when musk took to twitter to propose a peace deal between kyiv and moscow he probably viewed himself as just giving his opinion like anyone else winters said when you control the satellites that are important for ukrainians ability to communicate your opinion has massive ripple effects he explained but in washington musk still has less influence than other financial heavy hitters such as jp morgan s jamie dimon or goldman sachs david solomon who control the banking system colas said in buying twitter largely with his own money but also with significant backing from investors who expect a return on their own risk musk has taken on a huge potential liability he can t just flip a switch and make an anarchy there at twitter because every big advertiser will back away colas cautioned he likes to push things to the edge hass said and so far he s never self destructed but in controlling twitter musk has a more direct line to the public than ever before and i don t know where his red line is hass added

see their monthly loan repayments climb by another 90 tomorrow with the outside chance of a 180 increase borrowers have already been forced to contend with six consecutive monthly interest rate rises since may with a seventh straight increase in november regarded as a near certainty this is despite australian home owners enduring the steepest pace of rate rises in almost three decades all of the major banks and financial markets are forecasting an interest rate rise on tuesday with inflation in the year to september soaring by 7 3 per cent the fastest pace in 32 years australians paying off a typical mortgage are likely to see their monthly loan repayments climb by another 90 tomorrow with the outside chance of a 180 increase pictured are houses in melbourne the commonwealth bank nab and anz are forecasting a 0 25 percentage point increase on melbourne cup day that would take the reserve bank cash rate to a new nine year high of 2 85 per cent up from 2 6 per cent what a 0 25 percentage point rate rise would mean 500 000 up 75 to 2 621 600 000 up 90 to 3 145 700 000 up 105 to 3 669 800 000 up 120 to 4 193 900 000 up 135 to 4 717 1 000 000 up 150 to 5 241 monthly repayment increases based on a commonwealth bank variable loan rising to 4 79 per cent from 4 54 per cent to reflect reserve bank of australia cash rate rising to 2 85 per cent from 2 6 per cent advertisement for someone paying off an average 600 000 mortgage that will mean a 90 increase in their monthly mortgage repayments to 3 145 westpac however is predicting an even bigger 0 5 percentage point increase that would take the rba cash rate to a new 10 year high of 3 1 per cent this same borrower with a 600 000 variable mortgage would see their monthly repayments rise by another 181 to 3 236 that is based on a popular commonwealth bank variable rate rising to 5 04 per cent up from an existing level of 4 54 per cent should rates increase by 50 basis points a borrower with a 600 000 loan would have seen their mortgage repayments rise by 930 since early may when the rba cash rate was still at 0 1 per cent just six months ago commonwealth bank variable loans charged 2 29 per cent interest and monthly repayments were at 2 306 ratecity research director sally tindall said a bigger 0 5 percentage point rate rise in november would be more effective in tackling inflation but came with economic risks reverting back to half a percentage point hike would get the job done faster however it also has the capacity to tip more overindebted families into financial stress she said with such a precarious and uncertain path ahead the rba may need to change tack at any time scott solomon a baltimore based associate portfolio manager with american asset management group t rowe price associates said reserve bank governor philip lowe didn t want to jeopardise australia s near 48 year low unemployment rate with a bigger rate rise ratecity research director sally tindall pictured said a bigger 0 5 percentage point rate rise in november would be more effective in tackling inflation but came with economic risks we expect the reserve bank of australia to stick to the plan and hike 25 basis points at the november meeting he said what a 0 5 percentage point rate rise means 500 000 up 151 to 2 697 600 000 up 181 to 3 236 700 000 up 211 to 3 775 800 000 up 242 to 4 315 900 000 up 272 to 4

australia cash rate increasing to 3 1 per cent from 2 6 per cent advertisement furthermore he s quite proud of the levels of employment reached by the australian economy and has zero desire to prematurely destroy that many borrowers fixed their loans at a low 2 per cent rate in late 2020 and 2021 when the rba cash rate was still at a record low of 0 1 per cent mr solomon said dr lowe would be particularly concerned about these borrowers at their ultra low two year fixed rate periods expired he s acutely aware that many mortgages are due to reset over the next couple of months and doesn t want to unnecessarily burden the population he said the pace of reserve bank monetary policy tightening is already the most severe since 1994 with the central bank opting for 0 5 percentage point increases in june july august and september a seventh consecutive monthly rate rise on november 1 would be the most in a row since the rba began publishing a target cash rate in 1990 the 30 day interbank futures market is expecting a 0 25 percentage point rate rise on tuesday matching october s quarter of a percentage point increase westpac is the most worried about inflation with the bank s chief economist bill evans forecasting the rba cash rate peaking at an 11 year high of 3 85 per cent by march 2023 the 30 day interbank futures is expecting a 0 25 percentage point rate rise on tuesday matching october s quarter of a percentage point increase anz s head of australian economics david plank is also expecting a 3 85 per cent cash rate but in may the commonwealth bank s head of australian economics gareth aird is expecting a 3 1 per cent cash rate peak in december when the reserve bank raises rates by another quarter of a percentage point nab chief economist alan oster has updated his forecasts to have the reserve bank cash rate peaking at 3 6 per cent in march next year but regards a 0 5 percentage point increase in november as a outside chance with the 7 3 per cent headline inflation rate more than double the rba s 2 to 3 per cent target in these circumstances the rba will need to move monetary policy into more clearly restrictive territory to ensure inflation returns to target he said we see a 25 basis point move as likely but a 50 basis point rise in november is possible the treasury budget papers forecast inflation in the december quarter of 2022 hitting a new 32 year high of 7 75 per cent as a return to the old fuel excise rate of 44 2 cents a litre led to higher consumer prices the bank of canada last week raised its cash rate by 50 basis points to 3 75 per cent while the european central bank increased its equivalent rate by 75 basis points to 1 5 per cent the highest since 2009 but kpmg chief economist brendan rynne said despite those developments a 25 basis point rise was more likely on tuesday with an outside chance of a 50 basis point increase advertisement given those developments at home and abroad a double rate rise is certainly possible but kpmg maintains the view that a 25 basis point increase is likely at the november and december rba board meetings taking the cash rate to 3 1 per cent by the end of the year he said

photo 123rf a proposal to introduce a windfall tax on large corporate profits carries risks it could detract investment from new zealand and is unlikely to find support with businesses two industry figures say the green party has introduced a plan for for a special windfall tax on excessive corporate profits during periods when people struggle to make ends meet such as a scheme put in place after the world wars it published a discussion document laying out options it says could be used to improve the financial position of people struggling amid rising living costs the tax would target the top 20 companies operating in the supermarket banking construction energy and petroleum sectors which had benefited from external factors like global inflation and the government s pandemic response it said concerns about reduced business investment could be addressed using tax incentives to encourage investment in important emissions reducing infrastructure or public benefit research and technology green party finance spokesperson julie anne genter said other countries had windfall taxes and the party did not think it would affect foreign investment in new zealand companies when we put the corporate tax rate down to 28 percent direct foreign investment actually went down so i think there is some question about whether corporate tax rate is a big disincentive to investment genter said new zealand s corporate tax rate is 28 percent which is well down on 1987 when it was above 40 percent before being steadily reduced to 33 percent in the 1990s and 2000s and then to 30 percent in 2008 before dropping to the current level in 2010 that compared to australia s corporate tax rate of 30 percent 21 percent in the united states 17 percent in singapore and 12 5 percent in ireland businessnz chief executive kirk hope said windfall taxes were difficult to administer and did not raise much revenue i think would be more harmful than good hope said those taxes which were used in new zealand after the world wars weren t popular and they didn t make much revenue and the companies simply had to pass the costs on to consumers new zealand would need to be competitive with australia to continue to attract foreign investment he said chartered accountants australia and new zealand caanz tax leader for new zealand john cuthbertson said a piecemeal approach to tax policy was problematic you don t discount anything out of hand but i think you d want to work it up properly and we would favour certainly looking at it from a whole of tax system perspective rather than trying to single out a few taxpayers because it can be quite subjective quite ad hoc and i think fraught with some difficulties on occasion cuthbertson said businesses crave certainty and understanding both the tax system and also the system in terms of how we operate as a country i think once you start floating some of these ideas that has the potential to impact foreign investment because you know people do take notice of these things

laser1987 not all revolutions go up in a straight line and the generational shift from gas and diesel powered vehicles to evs is no different the inherent faltering of the revolution has come on the back of the total collapse of the poster boys of the pandemic era go public ev surge the year to date performance of the common shares for lucid group lcid fisker fsr and arrival arvl have all been torrid with market caps coming to trade at a small fraction of their previous highs against such a material and dramatic collapse it is easy to come to the conclusion that the whole transition was nothing but hype perhaps one built on an era of cheap money from low fed fund rates and government stimulus payments data by ycharts but it would be wrong to assess the collapse of sentiment on ev companies and related charging companies as an end to the ev revolution there has to be a separation of common shares and the underlying growth of ev sales the former had moved deep into bubble territory at previous highs and was unsustainable even under the most bullish scenarios for long run ev adoption indeed my inaugural coverage of blink nasdaq blnk described the company s valuation as egregious longs had too rapidly and non prudently bid up its common shares on a true but too pervasive narrative that evs were the future and critical enablers like blink and other charging infrastructure companies and battery manufacturers faced parabolic growth the demand for electric vehicles is skyrocketing the world demand for evs is growing fast and blink is making overtures to establish a global footprint ten years ago in 2012 just 120 000 evs were sold globally last year saw this sales figure realized on a weekly basis with 10 of all cars sold in 2021 being electric 4x the market share in 2019 with gas and diesel powered vehicle sales flatlining in several developed nations the shift towards evs is still in a relatively early stage in the united states with around just 1 of all vehicles on roads currently electric this number is set to materially change in the decade ahead globally evs are forecasted to grow to at least 26 8 million by 2030 up from 6 6 million in 2021 blink last reported earnings for its fiscal 2022 second quarter saw the company realize revenue of 11 5 million an increase of 163 5 from the year ago quarter and a beat of 1 78 million on consensus estimates this was driven by a 154 increase in service revenues to 2 2 million as 5 631 charging stations were contracted deployed or sold during the quarter this was an increase of 73 against the year ago quarter gross profit margin during the quarter at 22 6 was up sequentially by 321 basis points to help blink realize a gross profit of 2 6 million this was up versus 1 1 million in the year ago quarter data by ycharts however the company s command of confidence in its ability to scale is being directly challenged by rising net losses and operational cash burn the former grew by 67 4 year over year to reach 22 62 million whilst the latter grew by 58 to reach 19 6 million this meant cash and equivalents declined to reach 85 14 million exiting the quarter data by ycharts whilst i d expect blink to still be unprofitable due to expansion plans on the back of new partnerships from guam to jersey city the rising rate of burn in proportion to revenue growth provides a reason for pause the company s cash position is being eroded and the conditions to raise money are in their worst state in years with interest rates rising to new highs and stock market valuations languishing at lows ev charging companies might be a great way to gain exposure valuations at the previous highs had gotten far ahead of the adoption curve with pre revenue lucid at one point reaching a valuation larger than general motors gm and ford f hence rather than the fundamental ev revolution being stalled what we have seen year to date is a return to basic fundamental driven investing hype euphoria and buoyant animal spirit driven momentum have rightly given way to financials the secular shift to evs is now fully embedded in the post pandemic economic zeitgeist of most developed nations racing to combat anthropogenic climate change and with the ira aiming to create the conditions for 50 of all new vehicles sold to be evs or plug in hybrid electric models by 2030 the world ahead of blink is huge evs have moved on from their esoteric phase and are heading for mainstream adoption so whilst only around 1 of all cars on us roads are electric parabolic sales in the years ahead will see this number change quickly to expand blink s total addressable market and revenue ramp but with the company s price to forward sales ratio at an expensive 13 34x shares are still to be avoided
glacier national park in montana is a fisherman s paradise hundreds of snow fed lakes pepper the park home to over 20 species of fish including six kinds of trout and because it s federal land no license is required to cast a reel but in a warming world the national park service nps is hoping to transform one of glacier national park s coldest lakes into a refuge for a species of trout but it s not as simple as translocating this species into the park in order to create an environment for these fish nps first needs to get rid of the non native trout that currently inhabit that lake the plan proposed by the park which if approved would begin september 2023 recommends using a long used pesticide and rat poison called rotenone despite being a naturally derived compound it has been banned for use on rodents since 2005 while it is still a widely used fish toxin or piscicide as well as a widely used pesticide researchers have unearthed strong epidemiological links with parkinson s disease like many lakes in the western united states gunsight lake was historically fishless however in the early 1900s this picturesque body of water nestled between the towering peaks of fusillade jackson and gunsight mountains was artificially stocked with rainbow trout to improve recreational fishing opportunities since then according to the scoping document or the proposed plan released by the nps the rainbow trout established a self sustaining population in the lake through hybridization i e the mixing of gene pools they threaten the existence of native cutthroat trout within the same saint mary s waterways a listed species of concern for the state of montana in order to help establish their population the park is proposing to apply the fish toxicant via an inflatable boat and backpack sprayers with helicopters transporting materials while rotenone naturally breaks down due to sunlight to further limit potential contamination of the saint mary river and the rest of the saint mary water system a neutralizing agent likely potassium permanganate would be used downstream once the non native fish are eradicated the park would then translocate i e stock the river with the cutthroat trout this is all to say the park is proposing using poison to kill one fish in order to save another and it s not uncommon either in the grand canyon the nps is currently planning to use similar methods in order to save a native endangered fish species in the park while environmentalists support the action being taken at the grand canyon arguing that the case aims to protect a federally endangered species whose only habitat is that river they insist that in the case of glacier national park perhaps an alternative to poison should be considered a cutthroat trout rests on the bottom of the flathead river near glacier national park getty margaret townsend an attorney for the center for biological diversity a non profit focused on conservation urged the park to consider alternatives something their scoping document did not discuss because poison is indiscriminate because it d just kill everything in the lake we d prefer other options be explored in a situation like this one she said townsend suggested a few alternatives she cited the idea of electrofishing a method which uses electricity in order to more effectively harvest undesirable fish another option to be explored according to townsend is hosting a fishing derby a contest that encourages anglers to catch as many fish as possible she also suggested a hybrid model perhaps one which utilizes both electrofishing then tracking to ensure all of the fish are captured chris downs a fisheries biologist for the park argued that these methods take too long we ve tried many of these other methods in the past and they haven t been extremely effective he said they can take years and years and years rotenone takes a week however townsend argues that perhaps the poison should only be used in emergency situations the main difference with the case in the grand canyon is that the native species is listed as endangered and that lake is their only habitat in the world for the grand canyon time is of the essence townsend argued but for glacier national park i m not so sure beyond the issue of whether or not to poison these fish in order to protect another dana johnson a staff attorney for wilderness watch a non profit organization dedicated to protecting wilderness areas argues that the way in which the park is planning to deploy the poison is a problem the proposals run head on into the wilderness act s untrammeled mandate which says natural processes and conditions are supposed to dictate what type and how many species persist rather than intentional human control and manipulation johnson said in short johnson argues that because most of glacier national park is recommended wilderness it should be treated as such and human interference should be limited it s an ideology townsend shares and in her opinion points to larger issues around conservation that need to be addressed in her opinion while the park is attempting to create a cold water refuge for this species it is a band aid solution one that does not address that waters are warming all over the west and the world killing one species to save another is something we have to come to terms with townsend said we ve created these problems and then are trying to resolve them with a very quick fix but there is so much more we could do to save cold water habitat on the other hand one could see this as the park attempting to take action and do their part in protecting wilderness in the face of a warming world we can t control the changing climate downs said we re just trying to buy these

sign up for daily news updates from cleantechnica on email or follow us on google news this week general motors gm announced it was taking a break from advertising on twitter the move came as tesla ceo elon musk finalized his purchase of the social media platform most users expect editorial changes to reflect musk s previous pledges to reduce content moderation in what he has described as actions to promote free speech tesla is the foremost competitor for gm in the electric vehicle ev marketplace although gm has much ground to cover to achieve tesla s annual sales certainly gm s withdrawal is at least in part a shot at musk and tesla as a competitor in the ev space then again gm is working diligently to grab a diverse audience to purchase its line of evs any negative messaging out of its control on twitter could become a detriment to those sustainability goals automakers question advertising on twitter evs are the vehicles of the future and are on a trajectory for fast consumer adoption advertising on twitter is just one channel for dissemination of the all electric message albeit an efficacious one we are engaging with twitter to understand the direction of the platform under their new ownership the gm statement read as revealed on cnbc as is the normal course of business with a significant change in a media platform we have temporarily paused our paid advertising although only 1 of gm s us sales this year have been evs 1 8 for chevrolet it has ambitious ev growth plans and says it will stop selling petroleum fueled vehicles by 2035 gm will continue to interact with customers on twitter gm isn t the only automaker that is concerned about twitter s new direction ford is not currently advertising on twitter said spokesperson said deep we will continue to evaluate the direction of the platform under the new ownership like gm it will also keep engaging with ford customers on the site advertising on twitter certainly creates an unusual situation for other automakers now french automaker citroёn acknowledged as much in a cryptic tweet on friday hello to the social media platform owned by one of our competitors the company said fisker ceo and cofounder henrik fisker deleted his personal twitter account in april after the platform agreed to musk s purchase offer henrik fisker and elon musk have had several legal and professional disputes advertising on twitter show me the money advertising made up 92 of twitter s revenue in the second quarter twitter is dependent on advertisers for its continued profitability and note that it is currently losing hundreds of millions of dollars per quarter trends seemed to be improving though with advertising sales for twitter rising in the past several months according to a new york times analysis advertising on twitter totaled 2 18 billion in the first half of this year the top 5 advertisers this year on the platform are hbo mondelez amazon ibm and pepsico which together spent more than 155 million through this week the likely imminent departure of advertisers is pressing on musk who posted a letter to twitter advertisers to assuage their concerns in an inimitable musk stream of consciousness style he refuted claims that twitter will become a free for all hellscape where anything can be said with no consequences he explained that he bought the company because it is important to the future of civilization to have a common digital town square and because he feared that social media was in danger of splintering into echo chambers that generate more hate and divide our society the comment contradicted his previous stance that as twitter s owner he would revisit its content moderation policies and bolster free speech fundamentally twitter aspires to be the most respected advertising platform in the world that strengthens your brand and grows your enterprise musk said let us build something extraordinary together these comments were uttered by the same billionaire who once claimed i hate advertising renee hobbs director of the media education lab shared with cleantechnica another way to explain musk s contradictions every reader viewer and user should understand that media companies engage in editorial practices that make it possible for information entertainment and persuasion to thrive content moderation is a form of editorial decision making that is vital to the quality of user experience a decision to abandon content moderation in the name of free speech is a political act that celebrates division conflict and chaos how twisting discourse around free speech threatens the us tesla no longer has a press department that responds to media inquiries it does not engage in traditional print or mass media advertising instead tesla has relied on exposure through media days and musk s own unfiltered tweets which even prior to his purchase of twitter have been the cause of significant controversy now that he owns the social media platform speculation is rife that musk will follow through on his frequently stated ambition for twitter to become a forum for free speech where any person is welcome that wish is idealistic and a bit naiive as reputable communication channels assess harassment and other objectionable content to protect the larger social good yet musk has said he is opposed to any censorship that goes far beyond the law and wants to fix twitter s strong left wing bias yonty freisem associate director of the media education lab told cleantechnica that social media platforms today do not want to take responsibility for content claiming they are only a conduit of information such a lack of accepting responsibility becomes increasingly relevant with twitter s change of leadership as part of his 44 billion acquisition of the social media service musk is delisting the company s stock and taking it out of the hands of public shareholders freisem warns that changing it from a public company to a private money driven company is alarming with no regulation no responsibility no accountability about any content that anyone can post without requirements for quarterly public disclosures about performance and with less regulatory scrutiny twitter will be more tightly controlled by musk he can adjust the platform s content rules its finances and its priorities as the new york times notes without having to consider the worries of the investing public with a1 marketing already influencing digital content and discourse this free speech mantra according to wired may translate to an ethos of just about anything goes musk has indicated he plans to take twitter s new holding company public again in 3 to 5 years after the free speech dust has settled final thoughts about advertising on twitter in the era of musk as other advertisers pull their dollars from twitter it is clear that the exodus is not contained within the automotive world for example shonda rhimes the very successful television producer has announced that she is pulling her advertising from twitter rhimes has 1 9 million followers as fortune argues such advertisers have little appetite to appear near offensive content and there s been a sharp increase in hate speech since musk took control twitter trolls are flooding the platform with racial slurs and nazi memes as musk fulfills his promises to scale back content moderation users too may experience heightened privacy concerns twitter does not have a user subscription cost because it makes its money on advertising and access to data about its hundreds of millions of users newly concerned the washington post offers a detailed guide to protecting as much of your twitter data as possible each time we post on social media we make a choice we agree to relinquish our public personas to centralized advertising driven companies controlled by a few white men in sharing what seems to be free digital communication we have created an anti democratic space in which anyone can tweet anything from cute cat pictures to out and out lies we ve allowed billionaires to control communication channels and they care little for authentic free speech that kind of exchange of messages that s meant to illuminate and inform to make meaning among disparate groups and to invite justice can musk transcend the allure of making billions more and recognize he has within his grasp the capacity to extinguish anger hyperbole lies and systemic oppression we know he s brilliant can he also be an astute and influential thought leader who brings together a divided society with the collective goal of an equitable sustainable life for all featured image elon musk dreaming of a brighter future by jurvetson cc by 2 0 license have a tip for cleantechnica want to

tokyo japan japan is in the final stages of negotiations with the u s to purchase tomahawk cruise missiles which have a range of more than 620 miles placing china and the russian far east within striking range according to the yomiuri daily in response to beijing s rapid military modernization and increased activity in nearby waters tokyo is seeking its largest arms buildup since world war two chief cabinet secretary hirokazu matsuno has not commented on the reports but said he was aware of them the government is considering about counterattack capabilities but no specifics have been decided he added since russia invaded ukraine in february concerns about chinese military activity around taiwan and japan has intensified angered by the visit of u s house speaker nancy pelosi to taiwan in august china responded by firing missiles into waters less than 100 miles from japan
next chapter it wasn t that long ago when the idea of a performance suv seemed like an alien concept gmc s typhoon may have kicked this off back in the 1980s and for that car alone we re eternally grateful but it wasn t until the late 90s when the germans took this fast 4 4 platform and pushed it all the way to the mainstream think mercedes benz ml bmw x5 and porsche s cayenne fast forward to 2022 and this genre isn t so niche anymore in fact suvs represent some of the best selling models on the planet full stop so popular in fact that even ferrari who once swore they d never build an suv have now jumped on the bandwagon too love em or hate em suvs are here to stay to say performance suvs fit within the modern agenda of sustainability is a bit like saying the titanic sprung a small leak that s a completely different conversation so for the sake of speedhunters sanity we re going to focus on the positives about these cars performance lots of performance and not just petrol performance either remember the audi sq7 v12 tdi that used a 6 0l twin turbo diesel v12 to celebrate audi s dominance at le mans horsepower seemed quite modest by today s standards set at 500hp but torque had to be electronically limited to 1 000nm with a cheeky little ecu flash you d be closer to 600hp and 1 200nm then there was vw s v10 powered touareg and the bmw x5 with the same v12 found in mclaren s f1 gtr stuffed in its nose the more you dig into this class of oddities the more you realise that performance suvs have actually been some of the most interesting new vehicles in recent years and then you get to the ones which somehow manage to translate their straight line performance into cornering performance too models like the lamborghini urus which from some angles looks a bit like a huracán put its head in a wasp nest but mash the throttle and it ll do similar things to your own face credit to the engineers without a doubt but this lamborghini s very existence proves there s not only demand for a supercar priced suv but an audience out there wanting to modify them too and you can thank the model s twin turbo v8 for that a powerplant pinched straight out of the audi rs6 and tweaked to produce 649hp but if people will spend serious money on a stock urus it goes without saying they ll pay a big premium for the performante edition too right yes but perhaps only until they realise there s just a modest 16hp power increase so is it really worth forking out all that extra cash for a slightly tweaked lamborghini or can you get even more power for less dollar this is speedhunters so of course we re going to push for the latter thankfully csf radiators follows this same ethos whether it s for a civic type r or the latest italian super suv one company taking full advantage of csf s extensive product line is autowerks based in thailand thailand s modified car scene is absolutely blowing up right now and if a striking verde mantis lamborghini urus doesn t grab your attention nothing will but more importantly than that this is the first urus to be modified in the southeast asian country and with a whole host of world first parts fitted it s safe to say the autowerks team haven t held back first thing s first the performance being the same 4 0l twin turbo v8 as found in the c8 rs6 there s already plenty of knowledge floating around on the engine s capabilities with just under 650hp from the factory it s no slouch but throw the right hardware into the mix and that beast of an suv will be transformed into a total monster that s where csf radiators come into play it s one thing to increase boost and airflow with a turbo upgrade but utilise this without the correct cooling and your engine s potential is always going to be limited on the flipside of that simply cutting up a us 220 000 car to incorporate larger coolers isn t an option most owners are going to be too happy about time to engineer a solution csf first released their audi rs6 rs7 c8 intercoolers last year these units also fit the rsq8 as well the new porsche cayenne turbo gt so the initial design and core dimensions could be carried over in order to improve the engine s efficiency but with a completely different packaging right through to the bumper ducting and angle the coolers are mounted the tricky part would be ensuring they lined up with all the oem mounting points to create a true drop in design with physical space limited how else do you improve an intercooler s efficiency take a look at the black finish below that s not just for looks even though it is suitably badass it s actually a special thermal rejection ceramic coating which disperses the heat by an extra 15 compared to a non coated intercooler this coating can only be applied by an aerospace coating company in california where csf is based and is specifically used for these kinds of premium upgrades improved efficiency and capacity means even more power that s a win in itself but the biggest benefit from the csf x pwr urus intercooler kit is its ability to recover and fight off heat soak not only does it improve peak performance but the coolers help the 4 0l v8 maintain a consistent power level run after run even in hotter conditions by comparison the oem intercoolers and the rate they deteriorate with heat soak means that performance is compromised even during hard road use it all sounds very impressive but what does that translate to for the autowerks urus with cooling taken care of it means they were able to utilise a pair of tte833 turbos from the turbo engineers and once combined with a free flowing exhaust system and ecu tuning power is increased by almost 200hp over stock 836 1hp is the magic number but torque is also bumped up to 1 031nm trust us when we say this kind of power in a 2 tonne suv doesn t feel watered down in any way it is savage all the way into license losing speeds and the v8 soundtrack builds drama with every rpm the power jump only tells half the story with this build because there s nothing subtle about an 836hp verde mantis urus anyway why not raise the exterior to match too unsurprisingly there isn t really an off the shelf bodykit for the urus so autowerks turned to topcar in order to create a bespoke one off bodykit combined with a camo green carbon hood autowerks lowering links bring the ride height down to sit perfectly over a set of hre p111sc wheels for a truly menacing look ironically the autowerks urus not only blasts past the performante edition in horsepower but the topcar aero pushes the styling way beyond even what lamborghini can offer from their limited performante model whether performance suvs are your thing or not you do have to give credit to automakers like lamborghini for their ability to push not only what s acceptable with an suv but also for building a base that even as a 220 000 model still has room for tuning the fact there s demand for these cars to even exist in 2022 is a mind bending fact in itself and with tuners already taking the 4 0l v8 engine past 1 000hp in other applications it s something we ll only encourage more of so with that in mind what s your take on the performance suv industry let us know in the comments below rick muda instagram ardskellig csf race is an official speedhunters supplier
washington d c two u s lawmakers have urged the heads of major american banks to cancel their planned attendance at a hong kong financial summit this week stressing that their participation would help legitimize the chinese government s rights abuses the global financial leaders investment summit to be held on 2nd november is expected to be attended by the heads of some of the world s top banks and asset managers including goldman sachs group ceo david solomon morgan stanley boss james gorman and blackrock president rob kapito the event which hong kong officials hope will mark the city s re opening from its covid 19 border restrictions has angered hong kong activists amidst the introduction of a national security law that was used by authorities to stifle dissent u s senator jeff merkley and representative jim mcgovern both democrats said the executives should reconsider their attendance as it makes them complicit in human rights abuses by chinese and hong kong authorities as well as efforts to export an illiberal world order in a statement the lawmakers also said that the bankers attendance would give political cover to hong kong chief executive john lee who has been placed under u s sanctions and has refused to cooperate with u s sanctions on russian assets last year the u s state department warned american businesses about violating u s sanctions by engaging in certain transactions with sanctioned hong kong and chinese officials hoping to win control of congress in november midterm elections republicans have also criticized the bank executives for their plans to attend the hong kong event earlier this month representative chris smith said examining u s corporate complicity in china s repression will be a top oversight item in the next congress
in my entire lifetime global supplies of diesel fuel have never been tighter than they are right now and that is really bad news because the entire economy of the western world runs on diesel if we suddenly had no more diesel fuel virtually all of our trains trucks and ships would stop running needless to say just about everything that stocks our store shelves comes to us via trains trucks and ships so the fact that there is not enough diesel fuel to go around is a really big deal supplies have been declining for months and at this point diesel inventories have fallen so low that we only have a 25 day buffer remaining the u s is facing a diesel crunch just as demand is surging ahead of winter with only 25 days of supply left according to the energy information administration national economic council director brian deese told bloomberg tv that diesel inventories are unacceptably low and all options are on the table to bolster supply and reduce prices unfortunately this is not just a problem here in the united states globally supplies of diesel fuel have fallen to the lowest level that we have seen since 1982 the demand for diesel tends to rise as you get close to the winter because the molecule that makes up diesel is very similar to the molecule that you use for heating homes in the u s for winter fuels in europe tom kloza dean of u s oil analysts at oil price information service opis told newsweek the issue is global said kloza adding that diesel inventories around the world are the lowest as they ve been since 1982 and we ve added about 3 4 billion people in that time read that last line again the total population of the planet has nearly doubled since the early 1980s and so we truly are in unprecedented territory like i said earlier i have never seen global supplies of diesel fuel any tighter than they are at this moment of course that doesn t mean that we are about to totally run out of diesel fuel but as supplies get tighter we are likely to increasingly witness temporary shortages that have the potential to cause immense supply chain headaches a shortage of diesel fuel is spreading across the united states with one company launching an emergency delivery protocol requesting a 72 hour advance notice from clients to be able to make the delivery per a bloomberg report fuel supplier mansfield energy wrote in a note to its clients that conditions are rapidly devolving and at times carriers are having to visit multiple terminals to find supply which delays deliveries and strains local trucking capacity in a desperate attempt to alleviate the pressure two tankers that were loaded with diesel and jet fuel that were headed to europe have been turned back around meanwhile the scarcity of diesel has prompted traders to start diverting cargoes with the fuel that were originally bound for europe reuters reported earlier this month tanker tracking data showed that at least two tankers with some 90 000 tons of diesel and jet fuel that were initially bound for europe were diverted toward the u s east coast that may help us a bit but it is not good news at all for the europeans in fact some areas of europe have already started to experience very serious shortages of diesel fuel unfortunately things are not likely to improve much any time soon in recent years politicians in the united states and europe have made life really difficult for refiners as a result the number of refineries has actually been shrinking and nobody has really wanted to build any new ones now we get to experience the consequences of their very foolish policies at this point we are being told that the only way to reduce demand for diesel is to have a significant slowdown in freight movements and manufacturing activity stabilizing then rebuilding inventories to more comfortable levels will require a significant slowdown in freight movements and manufacturing activity there are early indications manufacturing and freight activity peaked in the third quarter of 2022 if confirmed that would take some of the pressure of distillate inventories but a deeper and more prolonged slowdown in the united states and or in europe and asia will be needed to boost inventories significantly rebalancing diesel supply will likely require a further rise in interest rates and tighter financial conditions in the united states and other major economies to reduce fuel consumption to more sustainable levels in other words it is going to take a recession and or a depression in order to fix this crisis ouch we should have never allowed things to get this bad over the past decade we should have been building a lot more refining capacity but our politicians didn t want that and so now we all get to pay the price and thanks to the war in ukraine supplies from russia that could help alleviate this nightmare are not going to be available so there will be shortages also it is likely that diesel prices will go a lot higher than they are right now needless to say that is going to add even more fuel to our ongoing inflation crisis because just about everything that we buy has to be transported this is yet another reason why our standard of living is going to continue to go down at a frightening pace in the months ahead we truly have got a colossal mess on our hands and it is going to be with us for quite some time to come it

t he relationship between the united states and saudi arabia is one of the most important on the planet and lately it s also been one of the most awkward angry officials in washington vowed consequences after saudi led opec sharply cut oil production earlier this month driving up pump prices just weeks before the midterm elections us lawmakers are threatening steps that were unthinkable not long ago including banning weapons sales to saudi arabia and unleashing the justice department to file a lawsuit against the country and other opec members for collusion riyadh has been caught off guard by the thirst for revenge from us politicians and saudi officials are hinting at payback including dumping us debt that could have huge ripple effects in financial markets and the real economy neither side is even trying to hide the tension after a top saudi official suggested the kingdom has decided to be the more mature party a top white house official responded by saying it s not like some high school romance here what happens next is critical if this decades old relationship devolves into a full blown break up there could be enormous consequences for the world economy not to mention international security this is a new low we have seen a degradation in the us saudi relationship for years but this is the worst it s been said clayton allen director at the eurasia group so much for that secret deal the spat is linked to one of the biggest sore spots among voters during the biden era inflation and high gas prices after trying and failing to persuade opec to ramp up oil production president joe biden reversed his 2020 campaign promise to make saudi arabia a pariah over its human rights record biden visited saudi arabia over the summer and even fist bumped crown prince mohammed bin salman us officials thought they reached a secret deal with saudi arabia to finally boost supply of oil through the end of the year the new york times reported this week they were wrong opec and its allies known as opec responded by increasing oil production by a measly 100 000 barrels per day the smallest increase in its history the move was widely viewed as a slap in the face of the biden administration what came next was worse in early october opec announced plans to slash oil production by 2 million barrels per day a move that briefly drove up oil and gasoline prices at a time of high inflation and infuriated us politicians neither side seems to understand each other allen said riyadh underestimated the severity of the us backlash and the us assumed we had an unspoken agreement fatih birol executive director of the international energy agency described the move as unprecedented and unfortunate in an interview with cnn international on thursday when the global economy was on the brink of a global recession they decided to push the prices up birol said saudi official accuses us of manipulating markets the tensions haven t eased and officials from both sides have sharpened their criticism of each other in recent days in one telling episode a top saudi minister went from defending biden s energy strategy to slamming it during the opec press conference in early october saudi energy minister prince abdulaziz bin salman seemed to praise biden s decision to release unprecedented amount of emergency oil reserves from the strategic petroleum reserve i wouldn t call it a distortion actually it was done in the right time prince abdulaziz told reporters if it didn t happen i m sure that things might be different than what it is today flash forward three weeks and that same saudi minister sang a very different tune people are depleting their emergency stocks had depleted it used it as a mechanism to manipulate markets while its profound purpose was to mitigate a shortage of supply prince abdulaziz said during a conference in saudi arabia this week however it is my profound duty to make it clear to the world that losing emergency stock may become painful in the months to come the criticism is noteworthy especially given that opec openly manipulates markets in many ways by withholding supply to support prices opec is unpopular the risk is that the tension devolves into a tit for tat cycle of retaliation that undermines globaleconomic stability or whatever economic stability there is at the moment lawmakers from both sides of the aisle have stepped up their calls to enact nopec no oil producing and exporting cartels legislation that would empower the justice department to go after opec nations on antitrust grounds although nopec isn t new it seems more possible now than at any point in recent memory eurasia group pegs a 30 chance of nopec enactment and a 45 chance of a watered down version of the bill you can t overstate how upset a huge number of lawmakers are said allen lawmakers aren t only upset they realize opec is not exactly endearing itself to voters this is popular american sentiment is anti saudi this now has domestic political utility for american politicians that s where we are now said karen young senior research scholar at columbia university s center on global energy policy nopec would be harder to veto than in the past could saudi arabia dump us debt saudi arabia could respond to penalties from washington with drastic steps of their own ratcheting up the conflict further saudi officials have privately warned that the kingdom could sell us treasury bonds if congress passes nopec the wall street journal reported this week citing people familiar with the matter at a minimum dumping us debt would create uncertainty in markets at an already perilous moment a fire sale would drive up treasury rates destabilizing markets and raising borrowing costs for families and businesses and of course saudi arabia s own holdings would be damaged in such a fire sale saudi arabia is sitting on roughly 119 billion of us debt according to treasury department data making it the world s 16th largest holder of treasuries another risk is that saudi arabia the de facto leader of opec could remove further supply from world oil markets or at least refuse to respond to future price spikes as the west continues to crack down on russia further curbs on opec supply would lift gasoline prices and worsen inflation raising already high recession risks all of this explains why a full blown breakdown in relations between the united states and saudi arabia may be the last thing the fragile economy needs right now

privilege dailymail com has asked twitter for comment on this story there are close to 400 000 verified users on twitter making them pay could help the platform stay afloat after reports that bots

prostitute he met during a boozy night out the tweet shared a link to an article suggesting the house speaker s husband left a san francisco gay bar with david depape prior to his assault but it no longer appears on the new twitter ceo s page just hours after it was posted he has now been accused of caving into the leftist mob musk had posted the theory in response to a tweet by former secretary of state hillary clinton in which she claimed that the attack on the 82 year old was the fault of republican mouthpieces spreading hate and deranged conspiracy theories there s a tiny possibility there may be more to this story than meets the eye the 51 year old billionaire responded sharing a link to a story published by an obscure outlet called the santa monica observer it seemed to have crashed since the story was first highlighted by musk with would be readers receiving an error page reading that the site s webserver cloudflare was returning an unknown error according to axios new

gay bar earlier that night and went to the home together greene offered no evidence to back up his claims and police have not shared any information which confirms any of the claims made pelosi was previously sentenced to five days in jail in august after he crashed his porsche while drunk this year but there s no suggestion that he s gay or an alcoholic musk s decision to share such an outlandish theory sparked fury on twitter just days after he bought the site and vowed to make it a paragon of free speech he had written in a message to advertisers on thursday that while he wants the social media giant to become a digital town square it obviously cannot become a free for all hellscape where anything can be said with no consequences

with a mighty yank the treble hook cut through the water stabbing itself firmly into the chinook salmon s muscular back the age old dance between man and fish had begun with his prize on the line fisherman larry dilulo who farms on the hi line began the delicate tango of landing a massive fish he started off slowly two stepping up and down the floating dock his calloused hands keeping the rod upright but the fish on the other end struggled to take the lead from dilulo and flee dilulo followed the fish s lead traversing the dock again his arched fishing rod held high keeping the salmon in front of him at all times when the time was right he reeled shortening the distance between him and the fish every so often he would pause readjust his rod and begin again just as it seemed one of them would give up a sharp movement would erupt either dilulo jerking up on the rod or the fish cutting through the water after more than six minutes dilulo emerged victorious pulling the 8 pound salmon from the frigid waters of fort peck reservoir and with a gleaming grin held his prize up to admire fort peck reservoir is the only place in montana where an angler can cha cha with a chinook the montana department of fish wildlife parks stocks the impounded body of water with hatchery raised salmon every year and monitors their health and progress since the fish are unable to breed naturally in the lake the hatchery must harvest some breeding age fish every year and do the spawning work themselves they do so by milking sperm and eggs manually from captured fish stunned and netted by fwp employees eggs are then fertilized at the hatchery near the reservoir come spring they release the new fish into the water for anglers to pursue and the process is repeated chinook or king salmon are a prize fish native to parts of the northwest but not eastern montana the majority of the population lives in the pacific ocean along the coast from the ventura river estuary north of los angeles all the way to the seward peninsula on the western edge of alaska during the spawn or salmon run they migrate inland up rivers such as the columbia in 1967 the michigan department of natural resources introduced the fish to lake michigan and lake huron to control the invasive nuisance fish alewife chinooks thrived feeding on the alewifes and were later introduced to the other great lakes the salmon are now found throughout the region and similar to fort peck are a prized catch the chinooks in fort peck wear a blue green hue they have silver sides black spots and dark tails in the reservoir they range from 5 pounds with behemoths sometimes weighing upwards of 30 pounds in other places such as the kenai river in alaska mature specimens average 37 pounds the current sport caught world record is just over 97 pounds from the kenai whereas the commercial caught world record is 126 pounds captured in british columbia anglers at fort peck reservoir can use deep water trolling gear to catch the fish during the spring and summer months but use snagging while the fish are spawning since they stop eating it requires the use of a snag hook a large weighted three prong hook which more resembles batman s grappling hook than a fishing lure the hook is weighted to aid the angler in casting to sink the setup quickly as well as to give the hook power as it pierces the fish s flesh once in the water the angler forcefully yanks and reels the hook back hoping along the way that it finds its target outside of salmon at fort peck snagging is also used to catch paddlefish on the yellowstone river in montana the reason anglers use snagging to catch the prehistoric paddlefish is because the species are filter feeders and as such are not attracted to lures or bait a debate has been ongoing within the fishing community over the ethics of snagging fish those against snagging argue piercing the animal s flesh reduces the sport and harms the resource those in support argue the fish are still able to fight and free themselves but in the case of salmon snagging the fish will die following the spawn anyway dilulo likes to bake or smoke his catch but there are many ways to cook a fish i didn t find any bad way to eat them he said i brine them overnight smoke them with hickory and can them said milton sausedo of forsyth local angler art widhalm recommends leaving the skin and bones on when canning to help add flavor to the fish regardless of your taste for the fish catching salmon is a popular sport on the lake eddie mindt who owns lakeridge lodging and bait shop estimated about a thousand people come through his shop each year specifically seeking salmon sausedo said around 20 people had been snagging around his spot on a warm october morning they re in here it s just a matter of getting lucky and hooking into something dilulo said you can go four or five hours and not get anything then you hook one and forget all about it

earlier this month flipkart backed indian payments service company phonepe announced that it had completed the move of its headquarters from singapore to india indian e commerce giant flipkart is a subsidiary of american supermarket behemoth walmart which bought a 77 per cent stake in the company in 2018 this is a rather unusual move as many indian startups are doing the reverse and prefer to be headquartered in singapore due to specific reasons market speculation is that the action is due to phonepe s preparation for a stock exchange listing in india phonepe s parent flipkart continued to have its head office on the southeast asian island nation flipkart incorporated its holding company in singapore in the early part of last sought foreign investments to that it could grow faster this was because it had problems with the indian bureaucracy which had then imposed various rules on certain industry sectors which made funding in its home country difficult it therefore conceived a corporate structure to site the main company in singapore so that it could receive funding more easily and made the indian companies subsidiaries of the singapore entity singapore is well known for being an easy place to do business singapore is number one in the world on the heritage foundation s index of economic freedom number one in the world economic forum global competitiveness report last published in 2019 and number two in the world bank ease of doing business ranking 2020 it is also ranked number two worldwide by the property rights alliance in its international property rights index 2022 furthermore it has low taxes both corporate tax and goods and services tax rates are lower than india s and there are no capital gains tax or tax on dividends for shareholders singapore has an extensive network of tax treaties which help singapore based companies that conduct international business avoid double taxation many savvy indian entrepreneurs have either immigrated to singapore or established strong economic ties with the country making it a key financial and investment hub for many indian businesses this is also helped by singapore s business friendly environment infrastructure connectivity and the presence of a sizeable indian community based on a report by india briefing over 8 000 indian companies have registered in singapore since 2000 many of them register their businesses online in singapore without even coming to the country most follow the flipkart company structure to enjoy the key benefits of incorporating a company in singapore and yet be able to access the indian market and its wide talent pool in recent years singapore has emerged as the silicon valley of asia it has a flourishing startup ecosystem where many venture capital firms are based other factors which have worked to create this are the ready availability of government funding favourable tax schemes for startups and abundant people with the requisite skills that tech firms need if a startup cannot find the talent it needs it is not difficult to obtain government support to import them there are also many similar firms which encourage collaboration and knowledge sharing singapore is ranked first in asia and seventh globally in startup blink s global startup ecosystem index 2022 singapore s startup ecosystem has a value of usd 25 billion far exceeding the global average of usd5 billion and early stage funding per startup totalling usd202 000 the startup output growth index of singapore scores 8 out of 10 which indicates significant growth in startup creation based on figures from enterprise singapore singapore logged 517 funding deals in the first nine months of this year amounting to usd 8 billion in total last year 11 singapore based startups achieved unicorn status usd 1 billion in valuation bringing the total number to 22 there is also strong trust in singapore s investment framework another appeal singapore has is its strategic location at the heart of asean which not only has a youthful middle class population of 660 million but as an economy it is the fifth largest in the world after the us eu china and japan indeed southeast asia with its interesting dynamic of a young and digitally savvy population has tremendous potential for startups and is a lucrative market for them to tap many startups that have established themselves in singapore are looking to serve this market which is in singapore s backyard ms grace sai the co founder of the sustainability focused startup unravel carbon said to singapore online newspaper today the market size of southeast asia or asia alone is big enough to create category winning companies so for some companies it s never their strategy to be global however regional countries are beginning to catch on on to singapore s success and looking to emulate it a world bank report last year noted that singapore s neighbouring countries have created their own startup ecosystems thereby increasing regional competition if investors start going directly into the countries where the startups are this may start eroding some of singapore s advantages as a startup hub likewise india appears to be taking steps to curb the startup exodus from the country two weeks ago finance minister nirmala sitharaman said that the government is ready to engage with startups to address issues facing the ecosystem so i would think continuous engagement with the startups is what is going to help them to one remain and second do better within india but if there are temptations for which they would want to go outside we need to understand how much we can entertain and serve on those courses not all of them are possible but equally we can try said sitharaman
now that elon musk has completed his 44 billion deal for twitter let s walk through the math of owning the social media company it s not just an academic exercise musk s ability to make the numbers work will have a direct impact on the health of a service called the world s town square determining what direction he takes the business and the platform if the financial case is grim any plans to invest in twitter may have to take a back seat to simply paying the bills the numbers are already daunting the 44 billion acquisition was the largest leveraged buyout of a technology company in history to do the deal musk the world s richest man loaded about 13 billion in debt on the company which had not turned a profit for eight of the past 10 years the deal was inked before the global economy looked to be headed toward a recession as interest rates surged higher and digital advertising which makes up 90 of twitter s revenue has been falling at social media companies technology companies should be left with enough flexibility to pay for new research and development and new levels of innovation said drew pascarella a senior lecturer of finance at cornell university who previously worked as a banker advising on acquisitions this buyout completely eliminates flexibility twitter and a representative for musk did not respond to requests for comment last year twitter s interest expense was about 50 million with the new debt taken on in the deal that will now balloon to about 1 billion a year yet the company s operations last year generated about 630 million in cash flow to meet its financial obligations that means that twitter is generating less money per year than what it owes its lenders the company also does not appear to have a lot of extra cash on hand while it had about 6 billion in cash before musk s buyout a large portion of that probably went into the cost of closing the acquisition that gives musk little wiggle room pascarella said they are essentially going to take all the financial resources of the company and just pour it into servicing the debt he said to make ends meet musk probably has to slash costs by a lot over the weekend he was said to be already moving to do so by ordering job cuts across twitter one investor who put less than 1 million in the buyout of the company said he was told by the head of musk s family office to expect that around 50 of twitter s 7 500 employees would be laid off musk could target many areas of twitter for layoffs the company has about 1 2 billion in annual sales and marketing expenses a large portion of which goes to employees salaries benefits and other compensation but by cutting those costs he risks getting rid of employees who have relationships with advertisers that would be hard to replace then there is the 1 2 billion that twitter spends annually on research and development which also goes mainly to employee compensation musk could cut jobs there too but he has said he has grand plans for the site like combating fake accounts and creating new ways to manage content which require people to develop those tools the kinds of engineers musk has said he wants to hire are expensive there are other paths to slashing costs like money spent on rent data centers and additional expenses which collectively cost the company more than 1 billion a year but may be harder to quickly shed unlike traditional targets of leveraged buyouts twitter does not clearly have specific businesses to shed or downsize like a struggling division this has always been the biggest challenge of this particular acquisition said eric talley a professor of corporate law at columbia law school the last thing you want to do is sell off some integral part of what you need to run twitter on a profitable basis and then you ve essentially tied your hands behind your back if even cost cuts do not help musk may need to raise more money from outside investors within a year talley said musk already has about 13 billion in debt from lenders while other investors like venture capital firms sequoia capital and andreessen horowitz chipped in about 7 1 billion in cash musk was personally responsible for the buyout s remaining roughly 25 billion and it remains unclear whether he gathered more investors to help lighten that load if twitter needs more money in a year finding new investors could be a lot to ask given the economics of the company even musk has conceded that his initial investors in the deal valuing twitter at 44 billion were obviously overpaying the stocks of many social media companies have tumbled this year as they navigate the same problems as the rest of the economy given his net worth of more than 200 billion musk himself could theoretically help cover twitter s extra cash needs he could also try to buy out some of twitter s lenders and reduce its debt load but most of his wealth is tied up in shares of his electric vehicle company tesla and its stock has plunged about 40 this year at one point musk tried backing away from buying twitter and he may opt not to funnel more money into what would be at least his fifth company putting more money into a leveraged slow growth company like twitter is also not the same as investing in a rapidly growing venture backed startup like his rocket making company spacex the risks are greater at twitter because the banks doing the lending care only about getting paid their interest on the day it is owed unlike say a real estate company twitter does not have a large amount of assets to offer lenders as collateral to keep them at bay still billionaires have sought to prop up beleaguered deals before hedge fund manager eddie lampert sought to rethink the retail industry and spent billions of his own fortune keeping sears alive after its failed merger with kmart in the 2000s sears filed for bankruptcy in 2018 and musk has gone into businesses before that naysayers had said were doomed and proved them wrong like manufacturing electric cars twitter has suffered years of mismanagement and it may benefit from fixing its business out of the glare of the public markets musk could bring new product ideas and hire engineering experts who might not have wanted to work for twitter before musk is a phenomenal capital allocator and i think he ll make a lot of money in twitter said chamath palihapitiya a venture capitalist who was an early facebook executive it doesn t fit my risk profile but i think he s going to be very successful others caution against the ebullience that initially drove investors to musk s deal warning that the lure of tech visionaries can fade with market fortunes especially as global economic fears have mushroomed in recent months at the height of a market boom those appeals work more easily than they do in times like we are presently entering said robert bruner a professor at the darden school of business at the university of virginia and author of the book deals from hell bruner said the worst deals are typically struck at the peak of a market as with musk s purchase of twitter he offered what he thought could be a worst case scenario for the company in that future musk would not be able to get the expenses down to the level necessary to cover the debt burden that would slowly erode the company s equity and he s unable to find more equity investors the final outcome slowly twitter implodes bruner said this article originally appeared in the new york times

the following remarks were delivered by keith jones to the sixth national congress of the socialist equality party australia held from september 24 to 27 2022 jones is the national secretary of the socialist equality party canada the canadian section of the international committee of the fourth international keith jones national secretary of the socialist equality party canada it is a privilege to extend the fraternal revolutionary greetings of the socialist equality party parti d égalite socialiste canada to your sixth national congress i have read your resolutions and want to take this opportunity to lend them my emphatic support as they must they examine the cascade of intersecting crises that are roiling world and australian capitalism of especial importance are the analysis they provide of the pandemic as a trigger event akin to world war one that has dramatically accelerated the global capitalist breakdown of the us nato war as what the covid 19 pandemic has triggered and of how the same processes that are fuelling the imperialist drive to world war are also propelling social revolution all of the resolutions and it is this above all that imparts to them their great significance are animated by the recognition that the icfi is now called upon to provide revolutionary leadership to an emerging global counter offensive of the working class based on a continuous reworking of the century long struggle of the trotskyist movement to defend and develop the program of world socialist revolution we must provide the socialist political conceptions and strategic and tactical initiatives to mobilize the working class ever more systematically as an independent and international political force in the struggle for workers power canada and australia are on opposite sides of the planet but there are many parallels in their evolution as capitalist societies beginning with the brutal displacement and subjugation of the aboriginal peoples as rulers of third rank imperialist powers their capitalist elites have shared a common destiny serving as the junior partners in exploitation brigandage and world wars of first british and then us imperialism the parallels and similarities are not just historical canadian and australian imperialism have responded in a like manner to the crisis in reality death agony of us imperialism in pursuit of their own imperialist interests and ambitions they have integrated themselves ever more deeply into the us drive for global hegemony participating in washington s never ending wars of the last three decades today they play major roles in us imperialism s strategic conflicts with russia and china conflicts that without the revolutionary intervention of the international working class will rapidly spiral into world war iii canada considers itself a pacific power whose strategic interests include the malacca straits and now routinely joins the pentagon in its provocative freedom of navigation exercises through the taiwan strait in so far as any of this is criticized within the capitalist establishment it is from the standpoint that canadian imperialism should be doing more and demonstratively more to prepare for and help provoke war with china why was canada not invited to join aukus scream the military strategic think tanks but the calculating predatory and anti democratic character of the canadian ruling class and its state are best illustrated by the role canadian imperialism is playing in the us nato war on russia working in tandem with washington canada played a major role in preparing and instigating the nato war with russia and now in its prosecution along with the us and british militaries canada s armed forces helped train and reorganize the ukrainian military during the seven years between the 2014 coup and the russian invasion including through the integration of the azov battalion and other fascist militia since january it has funnelled 625 million in weapons to ukraine and as the new york times recently revealed canadian special forces are deployed in ukraine canadian imperialism played an important role in preparing and instigating the us nato war on russia over ukraine above a ukrainian soldier undergoing training in urban warfare as part of the canadian armed forces now seven year long military training mission in ukraine operation unifier as in washington london and berlin so in ottawa russia s warnings of a dramatic escalation of the war including the potential use of nuclear weapons following the recent rout of its forces in north east ukraine are being cavalierly dismissed maintaining the canada us military strategic alliance with washington and advancing canadian imperialist interests in the arctic where canada and russia are in direct competition for resources and control over sea lanes are madly seen by the ruling class as interests for which triggering nuclear war is an acceptable indeed necessary risk canada s role in the russia war long predates even 2014 as we documented in the five part wsws series published in may canadian imperialism s fascist friends its especially provocative and belligerent role in the war with russia is bound up with its seven decades long alliance with the ukrainian far right canada provided a safe haven to tens of thousands of ukrainian fascists who had collaborated with the nazis during world war two in the holocaust and in their war of extermination against the soviet union the canadian ruling class helped whitewash the monstrous crimes they had committed as members of the fascist organization of ukrainian nationalists or the waffen ss using them as instruments of its cold war policy both at home and abroad with the stalinist bureaucracy s dissolution of the soviet union these forces were redeployed to press for ukraine to be harnessed to nato and the european union the political ideological spearhead of this was the reinjection and promotion of a fascist ukrainian nationalism based on vehement anti communism extreme hostility to russia and glorification of the nazi collaborator and fascist stepan bandera the reactionary alliance between the ukrainian far right and canadian imperialism is embodied in the person of chrystia freeland the leading anti russia war hawk in canada s government its deputy prime and finance minister and the favourite to succeed justin trudeau as liberal leader and canada s prime minister freeland s maternal grandfather michael chomiak who she publicly lionizes for schooling her in ukrainian nationalism and culture was a prominent nazi collaborator the exposure of canada imperialism s alliance with the ukrainian fascists is a crucial element in the sep canada s fight to mobilize the working class against the war and more generally to destroy the fraudulent lies promoted by the social democrats and pseudo left about canadian capitalism s supposed democratic and pacific character when i spoke at your last congress in 2020 i reported that more than a quarter of canada s active armed forces personnel had been assigned to a covid 19 deployment in anticipation of possible mass social unrest and that as part of this deployment the military had developed and activated plans to shape opinion and deter opposition based on tactics that it had developed while waging counter insurgency war in afghanistan at that time we did not know that australia s prime minister scott morrison had with the governor general s assent and connivance assumed quasi dictatorial powers nor that canada s liberal government was in the midst of adopting a battery of secret laws laws whose subject let alone stipulations remain known by only a tiny cabal of government officials democracy is incompatible with the decades long rampant growth of social inequality and the ruling class s agenda of militarism war and ever more brutal worker exploitation everywhere the bourgeoisie is turning to authoritarian forms of rule and resuscitating and emboldening the far right earlier this month canada s official opposition conservatives elected pierre poilievre as their leader a veteran conservative mp poilievre made the defining issue of his leadership campaign his strident support for the far right freedom convoy which menacingly occupied the nation s capital for more than three weeks last winter and its call for a permanent end to all anti covid public health measures protestors show their support for the freedom convoy on thursday jan 27 2022 in vaughan canada the convoy or to be more precise the readiness of significant sections of the ruling class to whip up and instrumentalize a far right movement with the aim of imposing a let it rip pandemic policy destabilizing the minority trudeau government and if possible forcing it from office represented a nodal point in the breakdown of canadian democracy poilievre claims to be a spokesperson for the aggrieved and ignored working joes making demagogic appeals to social grievances such as skyrocketing inflation that mimic those of trump defrocked british prime minister boris johnson and other vicious far right opponents of the working class and are just as fraudulent in canada as around the world reaction seeks to exploit the confusion disorientation and despair produced by the unions and official left s decades long suppression of the class struggle and connivance in the imposition of sweeping attacks on working people s social and democratic rights like the unions in australia canada s unions and the social democratic ndp responded to the pandemic by doubling down on their corporatist partnership with big business and the state they helped organize the bailout of the financial markets then policed the ruling class profits before lives pandemic policy that has resulted in seven waves of mass infection and death that have killed 45 000 people or more than all the canadian deaths in world war ii the so called freedom convoy benefited from powerful ruling class support to say nothing of the encouragement given it by trump and his republican and fascist allies but if a movement whose social darwinist and anti democratic views are anathema to the vast majority of working people could dominate canadian political life for the better part of a month this was above all because the unions and ndp kept the working class muzzled and on the political sidelines they then supported the trudeau government when it invoked the never before used emergencies act to end the occupation of ottawa setting a precedent for the suspension of basic democratic rights that can and will be used against the working class and in its immediate aftermath the unions and ndp staunchly supported the trudeau government as it greenlighted the provinces scrapping of all remaining covid 19 mitigation measures that is the implementation of the homicidal pandemic program of big business and the far right trotsky notes in the transitional program that in times of acute crisis like war trade union leaders become cabinet ministers less than four weeks after the eruption of the ukraine war the ndp with the full throated backing of the trade unions entered into a formal governmental alliance with the minority liberals in the name of stability that is the suppression of the class struggle on behalf of the bourgeoisie they have pledged to keep the liberal government in office through may 2025 as it wages war massively boosts military spending pivots to austerity in a new supposed post pandemic era and enforces huge inflation driven real wage cuts but as the work of the icfi theoretically anticipated and prepared for above all in the founding of the seps and the wsws s quarter century of political work and has been positively demonstrated in the initial initiatives undertaken by the international workers alliance of rank and file committees the relationship between the working class and the counter revolutionary bureaucratic apparatuses on the one hand and the fourth international on the other has been fundamentally transformed workers in canada as around the world are being propelled into struggle since the second half of 2021 there has been a wave of strikes that have impacted virtually every economic sector from mining railways construction and food processing to education and government administration in these struggles we have increasingly emerged as the pole of opposition to the labour bureaucracy on the basis of the fight for rank and file committees as part of the iwa rfc through the work of the cross canada educators rank and file safety committee and more recently the ontario education workers rank and file committee we have given concrete expression to the fight for the independent mobilization of the working class to enforce a science based zero covid strategy in opposition to the unions underscoring the nervousness with which the bureaucracy views these developments leading union officials including the head of the 50 000 member ontario school board council of unions have repeatedly denounced and or sought to intervene in the work of our education and cp rail worker rank and file committees important as these initiatives are we are acutely aware that outside of the strengthening of the sep canada s trotskyist foundation these gains will prove fleeting the formal founding of the sep canada as a section of the icfi must serve as a critical step in strengthening its trotskyist identity by reasserting and defining still more clearly our attitude to the struggles of the fourth international led by the icfi to uphold and develop the program of world socialist revolution an element in this is drawing a balance sheet of the roots and consequences of the liquidation of the first canadian section of the icfi which in 1963 joined the american socialist workers party in reuniting with the pabloites especially important will be to demonstrate how the struggle the icfi waged against the national opportunist wrp and subsequently to draw the lessons of the 1985 86 split found expression in and drove the programmatic clarification of the canadian supporters of the icfi to key questions of political perspective that remain to this day at the center of the struggle to win the canadian working class to the program of world socialist revolution in particular these involve the fight against left canadian and quebec nationalism canadian imperialism and the program of quebec indépendentiste nationalism and for the unity of the north american working class against the alliance between canadian and us imperialism and their junior partner mexico in conclusion your congress because it is rooted in the icfi s historically developed marxist analysis of the rapidly maturing objective prerequisites for social revolution and its understanding of the decisive significance of revolutionary leadership strategy and action represents a major step forward for the fourth international and the global working class thank you comrades

to benefit cancer patients worldwide about claudin 18 2 claudin18 2 is a member of the claudin protein family which is a highly tissue specific protein expressed only in differentiated epithelial cells on the gastric mucosa under normal physiological conditions previous studies have revealed that claudin18 2 is highly expressed in multiple types of cancer such as gastric cancer pancreatic cancer esophageal adenocarcinoma and colorectal cancer the unique feature of limited expression in normal tissues and highly specific expression in cancer makes claudin18 2 an ideal target for developing the immunotherapeutic for solid tumors globally there are many candidate therapies in clinical development the drug modalities under development include monoclonal antibodies bispecific antibodies antibody conjugated drugs and car t cell products however currently no drug targeting claudin18 2 has been approved about ibi343 ibi343 is a recombinant human anti claudin 18 2 monoclonal antibody drug conjugate adc developed by innovent biologics ibi343 binds to the claudin 18 2 expressing tumor cells the claudin 18 2 dependent adc internalization will occurr and the drug is released resulting in dna damage and eventually apoptosis of the tumor cells the freed drug can also diffuse across the plasma membrane to reach and kill the neighboring cells resulting in bystander killing

earlier this month flipkart backed indian payments service company phonepe announced that it had completed the move of its headquarters from singapore to india indian e commerce giant flipkart is a subsidiary of american supermarket behemoth walmart which bought a 77 per cent stake in the company in 2018 this is a rather unusual move as many indian startups are doing the reverse and prefer to be headquartered in singapore due to specific reasons market speculation is that the action is due to phonepe s preparation for a stock exchange listing in india phonepe s parent flipkart continued to have its head office on the southeast asian island nation flipkart incorporated its holding company in singapore in the early part of last sought foreign investments to that it could grow faster this was because it had problems with the indian bureaucracy which had then imposed various rules on certain industry sectors which made funding in its home country difficult it therefore conceived a corporate structure to site the main company in singapore so that it could receive funding more easily and made the indian companies subsidiaries of the singapore entity singapore is well known for being an easy place to do business singapore is number one in the world on the heritage foundation s index of economic freedom number one in the world economic forum global competitiveness report last published in 2019 and number two in the world bank ease of doing business ranking 2020 it is also ranked number two worldwide by the property rights alliance in its international property rights index 2022 furthermore it has low taxes both corporate tax and goods and services tax rates are lower than india s and there are no capital gains tax or tax on dividends for shareholders singapore has an extensive network of tax treaties which help singapore based companies that conduct international business avoid double taxation many savvy indian entrepreneurs have either immigrated to singapore or established strong economic ties with the country making it a key financial and investment hub for many indian businesses this is also helped by singapore s business friendly environment infrastructure connectivity and the presence of a sizeable indian community based on a report by india briefing over 8 000 indian companies have registered in singapore since 2000 many of them register their businesses online in singapore without even coming to the country most follow the flipkart company structure to enjoy the key benefits of incorporating a company in singapore and yet be able to access the indian market and its wide talent pool in recent years singapore has emerged as the silicon valley of asia it has a flourishing startup ecosystem where many venture capital firms are based other factors which have worked to create this are the ready availability of government funding favourable tax schemes for startups and abundant people with the requisite skills that tech firms need if a startup cannot find the talent it needs it is not difficult to obtain government support to import them there are also many similar firms which encourage collaboration and knowledge sharing singapore is ranked first in asia and seventh globally in startup blink s global startup ecosystem index 2022 singapore s startup ecosystem has a value of usd 25 billion far exceeding the global average of usd5 billion and early stage funding per startup totalling usd202 000 the startup output growth index of singapore scores 8 out of 10 which indicates significant growth in startup creation based on figures from enterprise singapore singapore logged 517 funding deals in the first nine months of this year amounting to usd 8 billion in total last year 11 singapore based startups achieved unicorn status usd 1 billion in valuation bringing the total number to 22 there is also strong trust in singapore s investment framework another appeal singapore has is its strategic location at the heart of asean which not only has a youthful middle class population of 660 million but as an economy it is the fifth largest in the world after the us eu china and japan indeed southeast asia with its interesting dynamic of a young and digitally savvy population has tremendous potential for startups and is a lucrative market for them to tap many startups that have established themselves in singapore are looking to serve this market which is in singapore s backyard ms grace sai the co founder of the sustainability focused startup unravel carbon said to singapore online newspaper today the market size of southeast asia or asia alone is big enough to create category winning companies so for some companies it s never their strategy to be global however regional countries are beginning to catch on on to singapore s success and looking to emulate it a world bank report last year noted that singapore s neighbouring countries have created their own startup ecosystems thereby increasing regional competition if investors start going directly into the countries where the startups are this may start eroding some of singapore s advantages as a startup hub likewise india appears to be taking steps to curb the startup exodus from the country two weeks ago finance minister nirmala sitharaman said that the government is ready to engage with startups to address issues facing the ecosystem so i would think continuous engagement with the startups is what is going to help them to one remain and second do better within india but if there are temptations for which they would want to go outside we need to understand how much we can entertain and serve on those courses not all of them are possible but equally we can try said sitharaman ani

washington d c two u s lawmakers have urged the heads of major american banks to cancel their planned attendance at a hong kong financial summit this week stressing that their participation would help legitimize the chinese government s rights abuses the global financial leaders investment summit to be held on 2nd november is expected to be attended by the heads of some of the world s top banks and asset managers including goldman sachs group ceo david solomon morgan stanley boss james gorman and blackrock president rob kapito the event which hong kong officials hope will mark the city s re opening from its covid 19 border restrictions has angered hong kong activists amidst the introduction of a national security law that was used by authorities to stifle dissent u s senator jeff merkley and representative jim mcgovern both democrats said the executives should reconsider their attendance as it makes them complicit in human rights abuses by chinese and hong kong authorities as well as efforts to export an illiberal world order in a statement the lawmakers also said that the bankers attendance would give political cover to hong kong chief executive john lee who has been placed under u s sanctions and has refused to cooperate with u s sanctions on russian assets last year the u s state department warned american businesses about violating u s sanctions by engaging in certain transactions with sanctioned hong kong and chinese officials hoping to win control of congress in november midterm elections republicans have also criticized the bank executives for their plans to attend the hong kong event earlier this month representative chris smith said examining u s corporate complicity in china s repression will be a top oversight item in the next congress
by lee kah whyesingapore october 31 ani earlier this month flipkart backed indian payments service company phonepe announced that it had completed the move of its headquarters from singapore to india indian e commerce giant flipkart is a subsidiary of american supermarket behemoth walmart which bought a 77 per cent stake in the company in 2018 this is a rather unusual move as many indian startups are doing the reverse and prefer to be headquartered in singapore due to specific reasons market speculation is that the action is due to phonepe s preparation for a stock exchange listing in india phonepe s parent flipkart continued to have its head office on the southeast asian island nation flipkart incorporated its holding company in singapore in the early part of last sought foreign investments to that it could grow faster this was because it had problems with the indian bureaucracy which had then imposed various rules on certain industry sectors which made funding in its home country difficult it therefore conceived a corporate structure to site the main company in singapore so that it could receive funding more easily and made the indian companies subsidiaries of the singapore entity singapore is well known for being an easy place to do business singapore is number one in the world on the heritage foundation s index of economic freedom number one in the world economic forum global competitiveness report last published in 2019 and number two in the world bank ease of doing business ranking 2020 it is also ranked number two worldwide by the property rights alliance in its international property rights index 2022 furthermore it has low taxes both corporate tax and goods and services tax rates are lower than india s and there are no capital gains tax or tax on dividends for shareholders singapore has an extensive network of tax treaties which help singapore based companies that conduct international business avoid double taxation many savvy indian entrepreneurs have either immigrated to singapore or established strong economic ties with the country making it a key financial and investment hub for many indian businesses this is also helped by singapore s business friendly environment infrastructure connectivity and the presence of a sizeable indian community based on a report by india briefing over 8 000 indian companies have registered in singapore since 2000 many of them register their businesses online in singapore without even coming to the country most follow the flipkart company structure to enjoy the key benefits of incorporating a company in singapore and yet be able to access the indian market and its wide talent pool in recent years singapore has emerged as the silicon valley of asia it has a flourishing startup ecosystem where many venture capital firms are based other factors which have worked to create this are the ready availability of government funding favourable tax schemes for startups and abundant people with the requisite skills that tech firms need if a startup cannot find the talent it needs it is not difficult to obtain government support to import them there are also many similar firms which encourage collaboration and knowledge sharing singapore is ranked first in asia and seventh globally in startup blink s global startup ecosystem index 2022 singapore s startup ecosystem has a value of usd 25 billion far exceeding the global average of usd5 billion and early stage funding per startup totalling usd202 000 the startup output growth index of singapore scores 8 out of 10 which indicates significant growth in startup creation based on figures from enterprise singapore singapore logged 517 funding deals in the first nine months of this year amounting to usd 8 billion in total last year 11 singapore based startups achieved unicorn status usd 1 billion in valuation bringing the total number to 22 there is also strong trust in singapore s investment framework another appeal singapore has is its strategic location at the heart of asean which not only has a youthful middle class population of 660 million but as an economy it is the fifth largest in the world after the us eu china and japan indeed southeast asia with its interesting dynamic of a young and digitally savvy population has tremendous potential for startups and is a lucrative market for them to tap many startups that have established themselves in singapore are looking to serve this market which is in singapore s backyard ms grace sai the co founder of the sustainability focused startup unravel carbon said to singapore online newspaper today the market size of southeast asia or asia alone is big enough to create category winning companies so for some companies it s never their strategy to be global however regional countries are beginning to catch on on to singapore s success and looking to emulate it a world bank report last year noted that singapore s neighbouring countries have created their own startup ecosystems thereby increasing regional competition if investors start going directly into the countries where the startups are this may start eroding some of singapore s advantages as a startup hub likewise india appears to be taking steps to curb the startup exodus from the country two weeks ago finance minister nirmala sitharaman said that the government is ready to engage with startups to address issues facing the ecosystem so i would think continuous engagement with the startups is what is going to help them to one remain and second do better within india but if there are temptations for which they would want to go outside we need to understand how much we can entertain and serve on those courses not all of them are possible but equally we can try said sitharaman ani
