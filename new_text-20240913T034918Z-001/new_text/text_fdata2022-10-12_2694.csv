the stock prices of uber lyft and doordash slid on tuesday after the department of labor announced proposed changes to how workers should be classified the prospective guidance is intended to combat employee misclassification the federal agency said in a statement soon after uber s share price dropped by more than 10 to 24 61 while lyft s tanked more than 12 to 11 22 and doordash s fell more than 5 to 44 98 at the time of writing the rule could make it easier for contractors to gain full employment status if they are economically dependent on a company however the scope of the proposal itself would be limited to areas such as minimum wage enforcement uber lyft and doordash depend extensively upon gig workers who haul people and meals around on their behalf but do not receive many hard won benefits of employment such as employer contributions toward their social security and medicare taxes despite pressure from labor organizers and some lawmakers some tech firms have fought to continue classifying their workers as independent contractors arguing the status benefits their businesses other local businesses and workers themselves ride hail and meal delivery companies say that changing how gig workers are classified would threaten their businesses yet these firms uber lyft and doordash have also posted hefty net losses under the status quo attempts to alter gig worker classification in the u s include a recently rejected ballot measure in massachusetts which could have explicitly defined such workers as independent contractors in california an effort to secure benefits for gig workers ab 5 passed in 2019 a year later app based gig workers in california were excluded from the law via proposition 22 which itself was deemed unconstitutional in the state in 2021 however app based gig companies have appealed that ruling and continue to operate in california under the guidance of prop 22 every day is a winding road in a statement lyft said the new labor department proposal had no immediate or direct impact on the lyft business at this time the firm reiterated its argument that classifying gig workers as employees could deny those workers independence and flexibility doordash published a similar statement on its blog today uber also mentioned flexibility in an email to techcrunch and said the proposed rule takes a measured approach essentially returning us to the obama era during which our industry grew exponentially in stark contrast groups such as gig workers rising assert that independent classification denies gig workers basic worker protections and rights such as unionization living wages paid time off and other benefits the department of labor remains committed to addressing the issue of misclassification said labor secretary marty walsh misclassification deprives workers of their federal labor protections including their right to be paid their full legally earned wages the labor department s proposal is subject to a public comment period which runs from from october 13 to november 28

i ve got some breaking news to share interest rates are going to keep going up but don t take my word for it most fed watchers are expecting another 75 basis point hike out of the federal open market committee in november another 50 point hike in december and yet another 25 point jump in february 2023 whether all of that comes to pass is of course uncertain and the specific timing of the fomc s premeditated murder of inflation matters less than its solemn oath to end it no matter the cost and those costs may well be severe jpmorgan chase ceo jamie dimon this week said that the u s could be headed into a recession in the coming year because of a combination of factors not least of which is the increased cost of borrowing wrought by the fomc i will leave it to others to determine whether the fomc s plan of attack is ideal or whether it could have done things differently to achieve a better result the fed is like the college dorm residential assistant that breaks up the party it is empowered to make necessary decisions that by definition make it unpopular in the short term in the name of achieving a long term objective but the fed s role as the steward of monetary policy is rapidly approaching a point where it will be in conflict with its role as a regulator of banks and the sooner both sides of the house are singing from the same sheet music the better off we all will be the federal reserve and other bank regulators should decide now whether they want banks to dip into their capital and liquidity reserves if the economy heads into a recession or whether those reserves should be left intact bloomberg news we don t always appreciate just how much bank regulation has changed in the last 15 years before 2008 there were no stress tests there was no supplemental leverage ratio there were no global systemically important banks and there was no basel iii once the global economy was stabilized with zillions in bailout money from governments all over the world regulators turned to the important work of engineering a set of banking rules that would ensure that nothing like that ever happened again what they came up with was an elaborate system that created offramps for failed banks controls for the over the counter swaps market prudential rules for financial market utilities and lots of other neat stuff but the first lines of defense were dramatically increased capital requirements and greatly increased liquidity and if banks were found to not be holding sufficient capital and or liquidity they would face supervisory actions including but not limited to a freeze on dividend payouts in good times that makes sense if the coast guard boards your boat and finds that the fire extinguisher is empty it makes you get a new one but if your boat is on fire and you re using your fire extinguisher to put it out it doesn t make sense for authorities to board your boat and give you a ticket for not having a full fire extinguisher fed s john williams says rates could hit 4 5 over time i don t want to make too much out of the irony that the fed is imposing this problem on itself if the fed weren t fighting inflation some other organ of government would hopefully be doing more or less the same thing but as it is the fed needs to come up with a unified theory of what capital and liquidity are for if they are for helping banks weather unexpected losses and preventing insolvency then there needs to be a permission structure for banks to draw down their capital reserves when those losses are realized and for markets to understand that those drawdowns are normal acceptable and temporary if capital and liquidity are for creating the appearance of stability if they are meant merely to exist and check a box then the fed needs to come up with some more operational way for banks to keep lending through the business cycle one tool that would actually be helpful here is the countercyclical capital buffer which is meant to be raised in good times and lowered in bad times as it is the time for raising that buffer was probably several years ago and at least part of the reason it has remained dormant is because the buffer itself could create a market signal that the fed thinks a bear market is approaching

with per capita fish consumption having doubled in the past six decades aquaculture is becoming more important in combatting food insecurity recent innovations seek to improve sustainability and productivity while assuaging quality concerns venture capitalists invested 39bn in food tech start ups in 2021 double the amount seen in 2020 while over half of this amount went to digital grocers and online marketplaces a number of companies developing innovative aquaculture technologies stand to benefit from investor interest one such company vertical oceans collected 3 5m in a seed round last year from us based vc fund khosla ventures in what might be the first time a major silicon valley fund has invested in an aquaculture start up vertical oceans is currently raising shrimp in tanks the size of school buses in a proof of concept facility in singapore these modular tanks could conceivably be stacked in urban settings and recirculate water producing little waste and addressing both supply chain and contamination concerns similarly a number of companies farming atlantic salmon have taken the drastic step of moving inland to become more sustainable from its land based facility near miami atlantic sapphire hopes to eventually produce 20 of the salmon consumed in the us powered by renewable energy and sourcing water from the same aquifer that provides miami s drinking water the company has also cut emissions by shipping fish to distributors by road global aquaculture activity aquaculture provided 56 of the aquatic food available for human consumption worldwide in 2020 asia accounted for 90 of global aquaculture production in 2018 thanks in part to china which produced 66 1m tonnes indonesia was the next largest producer with 14 7m tonnes followed by india 7m tonnes and vietnam 4m tonnes the key aquaculture products in asia include seaweed and oysters as well as freshwater carp known as low trophic these species mostly consume plankton making them cheaper and more environmentally friendly to farm than carnivorous or high trophic fish species shrimp farming which is worth an estimated 45bn globally is responsible for 30 of the deforestation of mangroves in southeast asia according to a 2020 report from planet tracker the lack of mangroves which act as a vital carbon sink and the flow of waste chemicals and antibiotics from farms increases the environmental risks associated with conventional shrimp aquaculture the americas account for approximately 3 of global aquaculture production with demand primarily focused on whiteleg shrimp and atlantic salmon these high trophic species pose environmental risks when farmed at industrial scale because they produce more hazardous waste and are primarily fed small fish or fish by products from capture fisheries egypt dominates aquaculture in africa accounting for 73 8 of the continent s aquaculture production as of 2018 while the continent is only responsible for some 2 of global output the sector in sub saharan africa has grown by 11 per year since 2000 nearly double the global rate of 6 obg has previously noted that the high consumption of fish and the stress on local capture fisheries has made aquaculture an important tool for poverty reduction and fighting food insecurity in sub saharan africa tilapia and catfish both low trophic species account for 70 of the continent s production with the majority of aquaculture activity centred around lakes addressing sustainability as obg noted last year with climate change overfishing and ocean acidification threatening wild fisheries many governments have outlined blue economy strategies to protect marine resources and drive economic recovery following the covid 19 pandemic aquaculture is set to play a central role in many of these strategies with its expansion providing for economic growth poverty reduction and increased food security while also contributing to un sustainable developmental goal 14 conserve and sustainably use the oceans seas and marine resources for sustainable development in emerging markets government support remains essential to expanding aquaculture activity to keep pace with demand shifting subsidies from sea fishing to aquaculture could help encourage sustainable growth while discouraging overfishing in norway water leases are more expensive than land leases encouraging salmon aquaculture enterprises to move to more sustainable inland facilities related sweden boots russia from nord stream investigation efforts at disease prevention have focused on strains of fish such as genetically improved farmed tilapia which boasts increased disease resistance and is responsible for an 18 58 jump in productivity in farms in bangladesh and china ghana kenya malawi and zambia have all begun breeding programmes to develop local fish strains that can withstand outbreaks increased urbanisation and an expanding global middle class have driven demand for high trophic species such as salmon and shrimp although they produce more waste and are fed trash fish from capture fisheries putting further stress on wild fish stocks some farms are testing to see if salmon raised on a diet of insects still produce omega 3 fatty acids while atlantic sapphire aims to remove fish from their feed by 2025 in smaller scale enterprises both green water pond and nutritious pond models utilise food waste or underused ingredients to increase the carbon content of ponds thereby increasing productivity whereas companies like vertical oceans that operate recirculating tanks use macroalgae to help filter water modular tanks such as those employed by vertical oceans could shorten supply routes and reduce the emissions associated with the transport of aquaculture products farms could conceivably be built close to or within cities providing a sustainable food source to support growing urban populations us based forever oceans has constructed floating cages that allow fish farming further out in the ocean preventing the potentially toxic accumulation of waste associated with shallow water fish farms though the logistics of managing a farm far from the coast creates additional challenges

by jamie mcgeever orlando fla reuters an apparent rundown of global foreign exchange reserves this year is just a mirage related to u s dollar strength but the real thing may yet materialize and pack another punch for the ailing u s bond market the narrative around a reserves rundown has gained traction but doesn t bear closer scrutiny reserve managers overall have been net buyers of treasuries this year for example it is true that an increasing number of central banks are intervening in the currency market to sell dollars and the nominal value of their fx reserves and u s treasury holdings has declined but the aggregate fall has been mostly driven by valuation effects in the case of treasuries it has been entirely due to plummeting prices the latest available treasury international capital tic data show that the nominal value of overseas official holdings of treasuries stood at 3 709 trillion in july down from 3 913 trillion last december that nominal fall of 204 billion is on course to be the biggest annual decline since 2016 and second largest ever but research by fed economists carol bertaut and ruth judson who help compile and present the tic data is instructive their models published earlier this year estimate monthly flows net of valuation effects their analysis shows that valuation effects account for a near 270 billion decline in total holdings this year and that central banks actually purchased almost 65 billion of u s treasuries in the first seven months of this year they were net buyers in five months and sellers in april and may official holdings are falling but not because central banks are selling so far this year it has been down to valuation effects said frank warnock professor at the university of virginia and senior research advisor to the fed but we don t know what s going to happen in the coming months he added intervention tension central banks across asia and latin america most notably the bank of japan have recently intervened directly in the fx market selling dollars for local currency this may have involved selling u s treasuries but bertaut and judson s calculations call into question some of the more frenzied market chatter in recent weeks that the soar away dollar could force central banks to bump u s bonds for fx intervention purposes they are as accurate an interpretation as any of the ebb and flow of central bank demand for treasuries the estimated 270 billion valuation change reflects a 7 fall from end 2021 holdings which is broadly in line with the 7 5 slide in bank of america s aggregate u s treasuries index over the period central banks bought into that downturn but it is unclear whether that continued through august and september when the bofa treasuries index lost another 6 and central banks fx intervention picked up pace partial custodial data from the new york fed suggests there was net selling in august and september the fear is that fx intervention involves selling treasuries opening up a potentially serious doom loop yields rise making the dollar more attractive pushing the dollar higher forcing central banks to intervene again and in greater size we re not at that stage yet however only a handful of countries appear to be actually intervening in the foreign exchange market by selling treasuries says marc chandler head of fx strategy at bannockburn global and a veteran fx reserves watcher until the next few tic reports are released august data is out on oct 18 we can only speculate china and japan the world s biggest holders of fx reserves have released september reserves data but neither give a breakdown of currency or asset composition the nominal value of china s fx reserves stood at 3 029 trillion in september the lowest since march 2017 since july the last month of official tic data they dipped 75 billion or 2 4 japan s reserves fell to 1 238 trillion in september also the lowest in five and a half years they were down some 85 billion or 6 4 since july in nominal terms it must be noted however that the dollar s broad value rose 6 over those two months while the bofa treasuries index fell 6 these are two powerful valuation shifts that could distort the figures in a big way steve barrow head of g10 strategy at standard bank in london warns that official sector sales of treasuries could ultimately necessitate counter action from the fed and others there is a growing danger that dollar strength and substantial currency intervention will serve to make global monetary conditions too tight he wrote on monday the opinions expressed here are those of the author a columnist for reuters related columns in reverse currency war there s only one winner sept 23 dazed and confused enough to buy bonds sept 21 rip great moderation hello great volatility aug 30 by jamie mcgeever editing by andrea ricci

melbourne australia oct 11 2022 globe newswire spryker the leading platform for enterprise marketplaces thing commerce and unified commerce has today launched its australian online grocery report 2022 the research of 2 500 australian consumers finds almost half 48 of australians buy least some of their groceries online with 10 now ordering most or all of their groceries via the internet in total 23 of australian household food budgets is now spent ordering online the research conducted by spryker in partnership with market research firm appinio surveyed consumers from across australia on their experiences and opinions of grocery shopping with the australian grocery market there is substantial opportunity for retailers offering services in online grocery shopping in fact almost one in five respondents 18 said they see themselves buying most or all of their groceries online within two years currently shoppers in the 25 44 age group are most likely to order online and spend the highest percentage of their grocery budget online compared to other age groups however those in older age groups 45 65 match the younger groups in terms of the total amount spent online despite this being a lower overall percentage of their grocery budgets respondents in the 55 65 age bracket were most likely to cite the desire to avoid crowded supermarkets and thus minimize the risk of contracting coronavirus as a motivation for shopping online a pleasant in store experience despite the market expanding online retailers face one key hurdle 75 of respondents grocery budgets are being spent offline and 88 of shoppers see in store supermarket shopping as something pleasant this is significantly more positive than us sentiment an equivalent found only 55 of us shoppers thought in store shopping was a pleasant experience even in the mature online grocery market of germany 73 of shoppers said they found shopping in store pleasant according to from july 2022 our latest research has shown that australian shoppers are most focused on lower costs and better product selection when it comes to buying online given that the in store shopping experience is a positive one for the majority of shoppers tempting them to buy more groceries online will pose a challenge for many retailers but it s also a huge opportunity commented boris lokschin co founder and ceo at spryker retailers that are working with composable commerce solutions will be best prepared to grab market share in this sophisticated and dynamic grocery market their focus must be on delivering a seamless online shopping experience that exceeds consumers expectations and with a best of breed approach retailers can have the flexibility to adjust to changing customer needs whether offering wider product choices flexible delivery and collection options or uniting with on demand delivery partners the australian online grocery market has significant growth potential for organizations willing to provide a top digital commerce experience the online winners and offline losers looking at who misses out when shoppers made more online purchases 22 of respondents reported heavy cuts to their spending in health food stores while a further 15 reduced spending at local farm shops and open air markets surprisingly only 4 reported spending less at supermarkets drilling into this the duopoly between coles and woolworths both of whom have significantly invested in their unified commerce experiences enabling them to offer flexible in store online curb side pick up and home delivery easily accounts for the minimal reduction in spending at supermarkets over any channel meanwhile 10 of shoppers also said they bought markedly less at discount retailers therefore an opportunity exists for these discount retailers with 87 of respondents saying they would do more food shopping online if prices were lower given that only 4 4 of the australian population lives more than 20 minutes from a supermarket lower pricing could help to grow online buying for discount retailers and tempt people away from supermarkets within their 20 minute radius beyond price consumers can potentially be lured away from mainstream supermarkets by a wide range of service factors including easier user interfaces 75 likely or very likely wider product ranges 77 better availability nearby 78 and faster delivery 76 another category that could benefit from improved digital commerce experiences are local retailers many consumers would like to see their local suppliers offering online options a full 40 want to order from local markets and farmers online in addition 25 of respondents think that organic shops should be online when asked which specific provider they would like to see online 12 of respondents mentioned perth located farmer jack s making this western australia based provider of regional local and organic food the fifth most frequent answer given a strong showing particularly given that only 11 of australians live in the state amazon unable to stand out despite amazon s significant investment in the online grocery market both globally and in australia only 42 of australian consumers cited amazon when given a list of online food delivery operators and asked which ones they recognized meanwhile 84 of survey respondents recognized uber eats and 77 recognized menulog doordash followed in

new york october 12 ani fifty four developing economies accounting for more than half of the world s poorest people need urgent debt relief as a result of cascading global crises according to the united nations development programme undp the risks of inaction are dire if these countries do not get access to effective debt restructuring poverty will rise and desperately needed investments in climate adaptation and mitigation will not happen particularly since countries affected are among the most climate vulnerable in the world according to a new paper published today by the undp the paper avoiding too little too late on international debt relief highlights the ripple effects of government responses to the recent economic crisis and warns of the potential impacts against this bleak backdrop the paper lays out a number of policy actions for debt restructuring that could help stop the debt crisis in its tracks market conditions are shifting rapidly as a synchronized fiscal and monetary contraction and low growth are fuelling volatility around the globe 19 developing economies are now paying more than 10 percentage points over us treasury bonds to borrow money on capital markets effectively shutting them out of the market holders of many developing economy bonds are seeing them trade at deep discounts of between 40 to 60 cents on the dollar the 54 countries with severe debt problems are home to more than half of the world s poorest people yet they represent little more than 3 per cent of the global economy debt relief would be a small pill for wealthy countries to swallow yet the cost of inaction is brutal for the world s poorest we cannot afford to repeat the mistake of providing too little relief too late in managing the developing economy debt burden said achim steiner the undp s administrator a debt deal might now be on the horizon these market conditions encourage private creditors to negotiate debt relief under the g20 s common framework for debt treatments higher interest rates a strong dollar and a looming global recession could change their bargaining position rich countries have the resources to end the debt crisis which has deteriorated rapidly in part as a consequence of their own domestic policies the undp said according to the report these policies have sent interest rates in developing economies skyrocketing and investors fleeing this is happening while developing economies have large financing shortfalls for fighting climate change the 54 most debt vulnerable countries include 28 of the world s top 50 most climate vulnerable nations the report adds this week g20 finance ministers will meet in washington just before the world bank imf annual meetings conditions are ripe for creditors and debtors to kickstart debt restructuring talks under the g20 s common framework and avert a developing country debt crisis that could otherwise spill over to a long term development crisis the paper proposes a way forward for the common framework on debt restructuring focusing on key areas debt sustainability analysis official creditor coordination private creditor participation and the use of state contingent debt clauses that target future economic and fiscal resilience undp proposesthat the common framework shifts focus to comprehensive restructurings that will allow countries a faster return to growth financial markets and development progress when emerging market bonds trade at 40 cents on the dollar private creditors suddenly become more open to negotiation the missing ingredient at this moment are financial assurances from major creditor governments to clinch a deal brady bonds provided sufficient reason for creditors to stay at the table in the 1980s we are approaching a similar moment in 2022 said george gray molina senior economist at undp effective debt restructuring is only one vital element of ensuring that developing economies have the finances they need to make progress on sustainable development new sources of funding are urgently needed for developing countries to undertake investments in climate adaptation and mitigation the report concludes ani

tories have returned to westminster in a restive mood following the break for the party conferences with their ratings tanking in opinion polls and economists questioning whether mr kwarteng s plans are sustainable there was further turmoil on tuesday after the bank of england announced that its emergency support operation to protect pension funds would end this week earlier the bank intervened for the second time in as many days to buy up government bonds warning of a material risk to uk financial stability with fire sales of assets if did not act governor andrew bailey said the bank s support will end on friday stefan rousseau pa but speaking in washington the bank governor andrew bailey said there could be no further support beyond friday and it was up to the funds concerned to rebalance their holdings my message to the funds involved you ve got three days left now you have got to get this done he said his comments saw sterling fall back again against the dollar meanwhile mr kwarteng had to endure a further dose of criticism from the international monetary fund imf which warned his package of unfunded tax cuts was making it harder for the bank to get soaring inflation rates under control with the institute for fiscal studies warning he will have to find 60 billion in public spending cuts if he persists with his tax plans tory mps fear the government s reputation on the economy is suffering grievous damage among voters and markets alike chancellor kwasi kwarteng has faced questions over his tax giveaway aaron chown pa after ministers refused to commit to uprating benefits in line with earnings as rishi sunak had promised when he was chancellor there are concerns also among conservatives that it is the least well off who will end up paying the highest price in the commons on tuesday former cabinet minister julian smith warned mr kwarteng that the government must not balance tax cuts on the back of the poorest people in our country ms truss and mr kwarteng have already been forced to abandon plans to scrap the top 45p rate of tax in the face of a threatened revolt during the tory party conference last week in birmingham there are questions as to whether they will have to make further retreats with some mps deeply sceptical of their ability to make the numbers add up while both prime minister and chancellor are sticking to the line that cutting taxes is the only way to get the economy growing again there has been a noticeably more emollient tone in recent days ms truss who will address tory mps at westminster after facing sir keir starmer in the commons for prime minister s questions is promising to bring smaller groups of backbenchers into no 10 on a regular basis to discuss their concerns she has also blocked plans to replace the former top civil servant at the treasury sir tom scholar who was abruptly sacked by mr kwarteng on his first day in office with an outsider appointing an old treasury hand instead mr kwarteng meanwhile has brought forward the date of his medium term fiscal plan when he will explain how he intends to get the public finances back on track to october 31 along with the office for budget responsibility s obr latest economic forecasts in an attempt to reassure the markets the absence of any independent assessment of mr kwarteng s tax plans by the obr is seen as one of the reasons the markets reacted so badly to last month s mini budget while ms truss attempts to hold the line in westminster the chancellor is in washington for the annual meetings of the imf and world bank ahead of his visit the imf s chief economist pierre olivier gourinchas said his fiscal policy was pulling in the opposite direction to the bank which is expected to further hike interest rates to curb rising prices imagine a car with two drivers at the front and each of them has a steering wheel and one wants to go left and the other wants to go right he told the bbc one is the central bank trying to cool off the economy so that price pressures will ease and the other one wants to spend more to support families it s probably not going to work very well
next article ghana can lose out on serving wider african market under afcfta agi imf cuts global growth forecast for 2023 warns worst is yet to come cnbc com business news oct 11 2022 22 14 the international monetary fund predicts global growth will slow to 2 7 next year 0 2 percentage point lower than its july forecast and anticipates 2023 will feel like a recession for millions around the world aside from the global financial crisis and the peak of the covid 19 pandemic this is the weakest growth profile since 2001 the imf said in its world economic outlook published tuesday its gdp estimate for this year remained steady at 3 2 which was down from the 6 seen in 2021 advertisement the worst is yet to come and for many people 2023 will feel like a recession the report said echoing warnings from the united nations the world bank and many global ceos more than a third of the global economy will see two consecutive quarters of negative growth while the three largest economies the united states the european union and china will continue to slow the report said next year is going to feel painful pierre olivier gourinchas the imf s chief economist told cnbc on tuesday on the back of the report there s going to be a lot of slowdown and economic pain he said volatile conditions in its report the imf laid out three major events currently hindering growth russia s invasion of ukraine the cost of living crisis and china s economic slowdown together they create a volatile period economically geopolitically and ecologically the war in ukraine continues to powerfully destabilize the global economy according to the report with its impacts causing a severe energy crisis in europe along with destruction in ukraine itself the price of natural gas has more than quadrupled since 2021 as russia now delivers less than 20 of 2021 levels food prices have also been pushed up as a result of the conflict the imf anticipates that global inflation will peak in late 2022 increasing from 4 7 in 2021 to 8 8 and that it will remain elevated for longer than previously expected global inflation will likely decrease to 6 5 in 2023 and to 4 1 by 2024 according to the imf forecast the agency noted the tightening of monetary policy across the world to combat inflation and the powerful appreciation of the u s dollar against other currencies china s zero covid policy and its resulting lockdowns continue to hamper its economy property makes up around one fifth of china s economy and as the market struggles the ramifications continue to be felt globally for emerging markets and developing economies the shocks of 2022 will re open economic wounds that were only partially healed following the pandemic the report said the imf also spoke of a deteriorated economic outlook in its global financial stability report released tuesday just after its world economic outlook the global environment is fragile with storm clouds on the horizon the report said policymakers around the world are facing an unusually challenging financial stability environment where further shocks may trigger market illiquidity disorderly sell offs or distress the report added speaking at the 2022 annual meetings of the international monetary fund and the world bank group axel van trotsenburg the world bank s managing director of operations echoed the sentiment in both reports we see extreme poverty again increasing the number of people living on 7 that s 47 of the world population in poverty so this is very clear people are hurting van trotsenburg told cnbc s geoff cutmore on tuesday world economy is historically fragile the imf also highlighted that the risk of monetary fiscal or financial policy miscalibration had risen sharply while the world economy remains historically fragile and financial markets are showing signs of stress the report comes as analysts debate whether the federal reserve acted fast enough on inflation in the u s the european central bank meanwhile has recently entered positive rate territory for the first time since 2014 and the bank of england has had to announce additional measures this week to stabilize the british economy and a unwanted surge in bond yields the report tuesday suggested front loaded and aggressive monetary tightening is needed but that a large downturn is not inevitable citing tight labor markets in the u s and u k the organization also highlighted that fiscal policy should not work at cross purposes with monetary authorities efforts to quell inflation those comments reflect the rare statement issued late last month by the imf after u k prime minister liz truss laid out a series of tax cuts the imf suggested truss should re evaluate the fiscal package when asked if the u k was a poster child for economic illiteracy gourinchas said certainly not we ve welcomed the recent development the fact that the government has announced a fiscal event at the end of the month and the obr is going to be involved in evaluating the proposals he said i think all of this is going in the direction of let s have a 360 on fiscal plans and make sure we re all pointing in the right direction gourinchas told cnbc winter 2022 will be challenging but 2023 will likely be worse the energy crisis is also weighing heavily on the world s economies particularly in europe and it is not a transitory shock according to the report the geopolitical re alignment of energy supplies in the wake of russia s war against ukraine is broad and permanent the report added winter 2022 will be challenging for europe but winter

it disregard any claims that it has a built in battery it still needs power from your wall socket and you need to pay some bills for it the difference is that it offers portable heating small cheaper and faster heating principle hulk heater reviews hulk heater works using the principle of electric heating just like ceramic heating systems do simply it passes current through ceramic plates high resistance conductors as the current tries to pass through the conductor more heat is generated it falls under convective heaters and it uses a fan to increase air circulation in the room hulk heaters have ceramic plates attached to coils of metal that conduct heat aluminum fins as in the case of hulk heater these ceramic plates are in contact with the aluminum fins thereby heating the fins a fan blowing across the fins heats the air the process continues until your entire space is heated up heating time varies from place to place as it is a function of ambient temperature power ratings and specifications hulk heater has a maximum power rating of 800w watts in 120vac supply voltage its specifications include voltage rating 120vac 60 hz capacity 800 w dimensions 5 6 in w x 5 6 in d x 3 5 in h weight 1 25 lbs heating system advanced ceramic technology digital led thermostat quiet operation almost zero decibel 270 rotating outlet plug science behind the hulk heater joule heating which is the process whereby electric current is converted to heat is generally the principle of all heating elements this process is independent of the direction of the current and the process is the same in all space heaters all materials that have some resistance must dissipate some heat in the form of power loss hulk heat uses high resistance ceramic plates to convert electrical energy into heat energy why hulk heater is recommended saying that a hulk heater is one of the best space heaters might look like another exaggeration which is not a lot of reviews suggest that almost every buyer is

last time the assembly voted on a condemnation resolution just 10 days after russia s initial invasion of ukraine in february the vote is nonbinding but is seen by its u s sponsor and western allies as an important test of global rejection of russia china and india whose leaders have publicly taken issue with moscow s actions will be carefully watched although there is little indication that either will take a firm stand so will countries such as the united arab emirates which has vacillated between approving and abstaining during previous votes condemning russia advertisement u a e president mohamed bin zayed al nahyan visited moscow on tuesday where putin told him that his country could play a significant role in efforts to reach a solution in ukraine mohamed considered a close defense partner of the united states later posted to twitter photos of himself with putin along with a message saying they had discussed several issues of mutual concern including the ukraine crisis and the importance of engaging in dialogue to reduce tensions and arrive at a diplomatic solution at an international meeting last week valentina matviyenko speaker of russia s federation council or upper house called for talks between the russian and ukrainian parliaments in a theatrical show of russia s willingness to discuss peace but the proposal had little credibility coming after putin s demand that ukraine accept moscow s illegal annexation of the ukrainian territories of crimea in 2014 and now zaporizhzhia donetsk luhansk and kherson ukraine maintains that there is no point in dialogue or negotiations until russia ends the war and withdraws its troops from all areas within ukraine s internationally recognized territorial boundaries we must admit the obvious fact zelensky said to the g 7 leaders there can be no dialogue with this leader of russia who has no future he himself rejected the dialogue in a communique after their meeting the g 7 leaders welcomed zelensky s readiness for a just peace which they said included the complete restoration of ukraine s territorial integrity safeguarding its future ability to defend itself ensuring its recovery and reconstruction including using russian funds and pursuing accountability for russian war crimes advertisement after his meeting with mohamed putin hosted rafael grossi director general of the international atomic energy agency grossi who met last week with zelensky and expects to return to ukraine has been engaged in intense efforts to establish a protection zone around the russian occupied zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant the immediate vicinity of the reactors has been shelled in the past several months with both sides blaming the other share this article share putin who has threatened to use nuclear weapons in ukraine as his forces have lost ground criticized elements of excessive dangerous politicization of everything to do with nuclear activity during his meeting with grossi according to russia s interfax news agency he said it will be our pleasure to discuss all our issues of mutual interest and perhaps concern including the zaporizhzhia facility meanwhile energoatom the ukrainian energy agency on tuesday accused russia of kidnapping a second senior official from the plant which is being operated by ukrainian staff while under russian control they keep holding him at an unknown location and probably using methods of torture and intimidation the agency said on its telegram channel late last month the russians detained and then released the ukrainian director of the facility advertisement much of the g 7 discussion held privately among leaders following zelensky s address concerned ukraine s urgent request for air defense systems but the leaders pledged their continued support to ukraine rather than any significant expansion of it said an official with direct knowledge of the conversation who spoke on the condition of anonymity about the closed door meeting president biden the official said emphasized the importance of the systems but there was little indication that the united states was prepared to move beyond commitments it has already made to furnish them the administration is working hard to deliver to ukraine the first two units of a promised midrange air defense system the nasams national security council coordinator john kirby told reporters in washington defense officials have said the system is scheduled for delivery between now and december an additional six units are also destined for ukraine but manufacturing them is likely to take a year or more advertisement kirby noted that ukraine already has elements of a layered air defense in its arsenal including short range stingers sent early in the conflict and longer range russian made s 300 systems from the soviet era ukraine has said it shot down about half of approximately 80 missiles russia fired at cities far from the front lines monday most of them air launched cruise missiles there is no one silver bullet weapons system that is best used against cruise missiles kirby said adding that variables include how soon after launch they are detected and their flight path there s not one system that somehow is going to solve that problem i m not going to get ahead of where we are in the decision process of what weapons to send and when he added we have provided air defense systems to ukraine and we plan to continue when there is something to announce in that regard we will do that in germany der spiegel magazine said the first of four german iris t vehicle mounted air defense systems had arrived in ukraine a day after defense minister christine lambrecht said that shipment of the long promised systems was being accelerated advertisement in brussels where a gathering of the ukraine contact group of more than 40 nations contributing supplies to ukraine is scheduled this week along with a meeting of nato defense ministers nato secretary general jens stoltenberg told reporters that they would discuss how to ramp up production of defense equipment both to send it to ukraine and to replenish their own stocks the german systems he said were something that germany was expecting to order for itself i expect ministers to make decisions on how to use the nato planning process to agree on production targets and provide industry with long term orders he said energy prices were also a major theme of the g 7 discussions with leaders saying that while there had been good progress on cutting energy use there was concern on prices and a broad agreement that more needs to be done through mechanisms like oil and gas price caps the official with direct knowledge of the talks said biden the official said spoke about the united states willingness to support the energy market with liquefied natural gas deliveries and expressed concern about announced production cuts by the opec plus cartel of which both russia and saudi arabia are members kirby later told reporters that the administration was reviewing the u s relationship with saudi arabia

it disregard any claims that it has a built in battery it still needs power from your wall socket and you need to pay some bills for it the difference is that it offers portable heating small cheaper and faster heating principle hulk heater reviews hulk heater works using the principle of electric heating just like ceramic heating systems do simply it passes current through ceramic plates high resistance conductors as the current tries to pass through the conductor more heat is generated it falls under convective heaters and it uses a fan to increase air circulation in the room hulk heaters have ceramic plates attached to coils of metal that conduct heat aluminum fins as in the case of hulk heater these ceramic plates are in contact with the aluminum fins thereby heating the fins a fan blowing across the fins heats the air the process continues until your entire space is heated up heating time varies from place to place as it is a function of ambient temperature power ratings and specifications hulk heater has a maximum power rating of 800w watts in 120vac supply voltage its specifications include voltage rating 120vac 60 hz capacity 800 w dimensions 5 6 in w x 5 6 in d x 3 5 in h weight 1 25 lbs heating system advanced ceramic technology digital led thermostat quiet operation almost zero decibel 270 rotating outlet plug science behind the hulk heater joule heating which is the process whereby electric current is converted to heat is generally the principle of all heating elements this process is independent of the direction of the current and the process is the same in all space heaters all materials that have some resistance must dissipate some heat in the form of power loss hulk heat uses high resistance ceramic plates to convert electrical energy into heat energy why hulk heater is recommended saying that a hulk heater is one of the best space heaters might look like another exaggeration which is not a lot of reviews suggest that almost every buyer is

governor of the bank of england andrew bailey you ve got three days left now you ve got to get this done yui mok via pa wire pa images the governor of the bank of england made clear its emergency support programme for the county s fragile bond market will end on friday sparking another sell off of the pound andrew bailey warned pension fund managers you ve got three days left to balance the books as the central banker made clear efforts to shore up the financial markets had to be temporary advertisement it s almost two weeks since the bank launched a massive programme to help pension funds cope with a slump in bond prices triggered by the announcement of unfunded tax cuts by the new liz truss government earlier on tuesday it made a fresh attempt to soothe market chaos enacting another round of emergency bond buying after a renewed bout of market turbulence investors have been selling off government bonds also known as gilts as investor concerns about the state of the british economy has failed to subside advertisement following the announcement by the governor the pound plunged against the dollar to below 1 10 a fall of more than a cent to its lowest rate since september 29 spooked by the biggest raft of tax cuts for half a century the pound fell to its lowest point ever against the dollar following the mini budget dropping to just over 1 03 but has rebounded since in no small part thanks to the bank s efforts gosh just look at what happened to the pound when bankofengland governor andrew bailey told investors its emergency support will definitely end on friday you ve got three days left now he said you ve got to get this done pic twitter com ij9verfbbw ed conway edconwaysky october 11 2022 advertisement at an event organised by the institute of international finance in washington on tuesday bailey said we have announced that we will be out by the end of this week we think the rebalancing must be done and my message to the funds involved and all the firms involved managing those funds you ve got three days left now you ve got to get this done earlier on tuesday the pensions and lifetime savings association an industry body urged the boe to extend the bond buying programme until october 31 and possibly beyond advertisement why has the bank stepped in with more emergency action on tuesday the bank said it needed to broaden the emergency programme to buy uk government bonds to calm markets as it warned over a material risk to uk financial stability advertisement it came after a further sell off in the gilt market which saw the yields on long dated government bonds rise back up close to levels seen in the immediate aftermath of the mini budget what are gilts and gilt yields uk government bonds are a way for the government to raise money a gilt is essentially an iou that the treasury writes to its lenders promising to pay the money back plus interest within a time frame for example over two 10 or 30 years the yield on a gilt is the amount of money an investor receives for owning the debt and is represented as a percentage of its price when a bond price falls its yield rises yields rise when investors are less willing to own the debt meaning they will pay a lower price for the bonds advertisement why are bond yields rising concerns over the chancellor s plans for unfunded tax cuts sent gilt yields soaring as markets fretted over the government s economic policies at one stage the yield on 30 year gilts hit levels not seen since 2002 in the chaos that followed the mini budget statement while the pound also plunged to record lows against the us dollar what do gilt prices have to do with pension funds pension funds invest huge amounts of money in gilts which are seen as safe investments in usual times in order to protect themselves against sharp rises in government borrowing costs funds have been investing in products that act as a kind of insurance so called liability driven investment ldi funds advertisement but due to the sudden rise in government borrowing costs after the mini budget investment banks called on these ldis to put up assets or cash as securities for loans which in turn called on pension funds forcing them into a fire sale of gilts driving prices still lower and yields higher and creating a downward spiral how bad is the latest crisis in financial markets the bank warned last week that it had been been forced to step in to avoid market meltdown when some pension funds were left close to collapse and there was a risk of a knock on impact elsewhere in the financial system its measures initially eased pressure on gilt yields but they spiked higher again and there are signs the woes may be spreading elsewhere to index linked gilts as well as corporate bonds and even in niche debt markets in the us will my pension be affected experts say the gilt rout which is largely affecting final salary and defined benefit pensions schemes will not impact policyholders advertisement the pensions and lifetime savings association plsa said although there has been a great deal of commentary over the last few weeks members of defined benefit pension schemes should be reassured that their pension benefits are safe scheme funding is strong and despite the operational challenges funding will have been strengthened further by rising yields why are mortgage rates rising higher gilt yields and the prospect of rising interest rates as the bank looks to cool rampant inflation have a significant impact on mortgage lenders rates on two and five fixed year deals have gone past 6 for the first time in many years due to the market turmoil while lenders have also been pulling hundreds of products will the latest action be enough there are concerns

the show m a s h was about saving people now fort myers beach has its own mash unit and it s about saving the island saving the community repumping life into its battered soul with town hall hammered by hurricane ian an encampment is becoming the government hub on the beach for awhile the center of activity mayor ray murphy said city hall is shot it s ruined like everywhere else murphy said what we have is we ve got a whole city hall complex command center being set up right next door he said the fire district owns the piece of the property of the former topps grocery store property that s one huge slab so all these assets have been coming in the contractors have set up all kinds of housing over there for people showers bathrooms offices trailers biden visits joe biden brings rebuilding help to hurricane ravaged swfl picking up the pieces amid rising death toll more glimmers of light in the ian aftermath for swfl fpl update most in swfl should have power back by weekend but not others murphy compares the setup to the popular cbs program that ran for 11 seasons and featured the most watched tv episode in the history of television you ve watched the show m a s h temporary camp that s what it s like people feeding everybody down there there s people bringing in supplies there s people bringing in water there s a lot going on it s like feeding an army it s like taking care of an army murphy said of the 24 hour operation it just goes on and on and on the crushing magnitude of last week s catastrophe can be measured by the level of expertise that president biden has sent to fort myers beach they were at katrina they were at oklahoma city they were at the world trade center in new york city murphy said not to mention the urban search rescue us r task force established under fema s authority the us r teams alone are hundreds of guys there s a lot of assets down on the beach when you start talking about law enforcement from all over the state that comes in from the various counties from the various sheriffs various persons that are assisting you re talking about fire units from all over the state the search and rescue guys i guess it could very well be in the thousands and in a meeting with biden during wednesday afternoon s visit the president told him help would keep coming he assured us he would be there for us and wouldn t leave us that was music to our ears yes indeed murphy said when you have the president reassuring and that he s got your back it doesn t get any better than that the biggest message i got out of it is reassurance that he was going to stay with us and if that meant that fema would have to be extended for longer periods of time that they certainly were going to do that federal officials say fort myers beach damaged much worse than mexico beach was by hurricane michael the assistance is key for a rebuilding fort myers beach which had 7 000 full time residents before hurricane ian that s huge to a small community like ours murphy said just the trash removal and the stuff could gut our budget it s a monumental undertaking that we re looking at and he s reassured us that he ll be there for us the scale of the damage is so immense so widespread that federal experts quantified it for him what they re calling us mexico beach times eight or mexico beach times seven murphy said we re kind of that devastation that many times more in the panhandle s mexico beach 1 584 of 1 692 buildings were damaged by a category 5 storm in 2018 and 809 of those were destroyed according to the national hurricane center fort myers beach fire marshal jennifer campbell put it this way when it comes to her island of 10 400 housing units absolute devastation there s barely anything left i got an aerial tour of fort myers beach said jared moskowitz former director of the state division of emergency management most of it will need to be completely rebuilt this one is off the charts murphy said just like mexico beach during hurricane michael when they took those aerials all those hundreds and hundreds of buildings that were knocked down every once in awhile you d see one structure standing why because it was made of concrete block reinforced concrete murphy said the same thing happened in this storm on fort myers beach all the newer constructed buildings they did exactly what they were supposed to do the surge came in it blew out the bottom the bottom of the building that s enclosed but there s nothing down there and the rest of the building stood fine on the pilings and the house above that s the beauty of the newer construction that s what happened anything that was made out of sticks and two by fours all that they re gone why can t fort myers beach residents return yet murphy wouldn t speculate on how many of the 54 official southwest florida deaths as of thursday afternoon occurred on the island from ian and the state s data is incomplete it s brutal it s brutal murphy said it s been a tough little stretch here it is all about dignity dignity for the deceased dignity for the families and that s a main reason residents haven t been allowed on the island yet by the authority of fema and the beach fire department murphy said they closed the island until they re done with the search they are completing the work they have to do and at this point that s recovering the bodies he said i do talk to these guys see them daily and it s a few more days a few more days a few more days you know i can t nail them down but on the other hand as much as i want to know to be able to tell people it s their call it s their schedule they re getting closer and closer from what i understand as soon as they give us the word that they re done we can go in there with our equipment and start removing things then we can start letting our people back on the island until we get that word from them it s their call and leaders are considering concepts to try for a smooth transition along the roughed up two lane lifeline of estero boulevard i m hoping that we can set up some sort of trolley system whereby we d have maybe two three four of those running up and down the island murphy said they can go back into their homes take pictures pull stuff out do whatever they want to do and then get them back out there are some logistics that have to be worked out in that respect because if we just open it up willy nilly to everybody and their brother to come down there it ll be as bad as the boulevard during the peak hours there s just so many people down there working i ve never seen anything like this before and that s where that patience business comes in again you just have to remain patient he knows that isn t easy for pained residents who have lost everything or nearly all i m constantly reassuring people do hang in there be patient it is going to get better that s our job that s my job to keep people s spirits up keep people engaged i don t want despair to set in it could easily fall into despair in this situation the devastation that we ve encountered out there you could easily fall into that i m trying to keep people s spirits up i m trying to keep them patient be patient with the process it s all going to work out it s just keep moving keep moving forward keep moving forward power still out in fort myers beach but lee county slowly coming back successes and milestones will be measured differently for the beach than the less damaged areas of southwest florida you have to take them where you get them murphy said biden s visit was one of them i m sure this whole recovery process will be marked by days like this but this was huge even though there is no power on the island he is encouraged that more in the rest of the region are getting electricity back as of thursday afternoon collier was down to 2 7 in the dark while lee was at 28 however it s only 6 of florida power light s lee customers and murphy said a lot of those are on the island the next thing i can see is fpl trucks down here there will be an army of them down here said murphy who was scheduled to meet with fpl ceo eric silagy on the island thursday that grid they ll be working on that that was encouraging fpl s outages from across the state due to ian are down to 2 allowing the utility to focus its 21 000 member team on areas such as fort myers beach as we continue to collapse resources in from all the counties we have restored we re moving people and moving equipment across the state and collapsing them into southwest florida opening up these staging sites and putting more resources to bear on rebuilding that system said silagy who has conceded it could be months before all have power there are pockets that need our help for a long period of time the owners of margaritaville which by comparison didn t receive as much damage have vowed to move forward in construction others were not as fortunate everybody from cottages of paradise point is safe but cottages of paradise point is no more it has been destroyed said dennis greenspon who ran the rental community on the beach s north side with his wife lisa we will miss all the close friendships that we have formed over the past 20 years we will not be rebuilding cottages of paradise point is now a beautiful cherished memory fort myers beach mayor optimistic about rebuilding we re getting through it one day at a time murphy remains optimistic remembering when he first ran for office some 25 years ago and was asked whether there was one thing he could change about the beach if he could turn back the clock we all love it the way it is but there is one thing that i would do differently i said i would try to bring the building stock up from the 1930s and 1940s and 50s up to the 1990s and that was back then he recalled all the old stuff the existing stuff that was still standing was vulnerable and that was never more demonstrated than it was eight days ago punta gorda was able to rebuild its community into more of a destination after hurricane charley s 2004 destruction but fort myers beach faces a larger redo we re getting through it one day at a time said murphy who like four of the five town council members lost their homes or close to it as you say it s an opportunity it s an opportunity to start off with a fresh palette and recreate the beach the way everybody wants it it could be fantastic and i look forward to it based at the naples daily news phil fernandez pfernandez gannett com writes the in the know column as part of the usa today network which supplemented this report
