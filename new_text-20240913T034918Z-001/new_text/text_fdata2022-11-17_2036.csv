nasa s first artemis mission launched on wednesday a landmark trial run for expeditions that the space agency hopes will ultimately establish a sustainable base on the moon s surface such a base would serve as a preparation hub for future missions to mars according to the artemis mission statement the agency hasn t specified what sustainability means in the context of establishing a base camp on the inhospitable lunar landscape space com reported in july but for a lunar base sustainability issues revolve more around the cost of continued supply than on the problems of finding usable resources apollo 17 astronaut jack schmitt told space com the geological understanding of lunar resources and the technological foundations for sustained settlement of the moon are either in hand or well understood schmitt said but the major remaining challenge consists of building rockets inexpensive enough to put economical cost and achievable risk management within reach of private or national entities schmitt added that is still out of reach the project s high cost made it an unsustainable means of establishing a permanent presence nasa s inspector general paul martin told congress in march with launches costing 4 1 billion each in addition to extensive and expensive research and development costs total artemis costs could ultimately hit 93 billion by the time u s astronauts land

musk appeared in a delaware courtroom on wednesday to defend his record breaking pay at the electric carmaker he was there to answer charges on an often neglected characteristic of environmental social and governance esg investing the g which focuses on how companies are managed his appearance coincides with ongoing troubles at twitter which he recently purchased according to the washington post it also comes on the heels of tesla s low ranking on tuesday in a consumer reports study on the most reliable vehicles too much for musk a lawsuit before the delaware court of chancery charges that musk received the largest compensation package in history by deceptive means the new york times reported richard tornetta the shareholder charges that tesla gave investors materially misleading information about a 2018 pay package that included the option to buy 50 billion in shares of tesla stock his suit argues that tesla s board which approved the package was not independent of musk money for mars the chair of tesla s board told the court on tuesday that musk told her needed the money for space colonization cnbc reported musk said he needed the money for inter planetary travel robyn denholm the chair of tesla s board testified on tuesday he received the additional money because his prior compensation package wasn t enough to keep him at tesla she said my view is that tesla would not be the company it is today without mr musk denholm added according to the times tesla lapped by toyota on reliability consumer reports tesla s electric vehicles evs were among the least reliable new cars of any major automaker consumer reports found in a review released on tuesday while none of tesla s offerings made the bottom 10 list of least reliable cars the nonprofit magazine ranked

s newly elected president lula da silva said on wednesday there s no explanation why the winners of world war ii should be in charge and the directors of the u n security council da silva said in remarks at the u n climate change conference cop27 on wednesday according to the guardian the world needs new global governance on the climate issue otherwise time goes by we die and things do not change he added calling out rich countries da silva also criticized rich countries for their failure to deliver promised money to poorer nations for climate adaptation according to the guardian transcript he noted that these amounted to reparation for a disaster that the richest countries had caused but which would affect poorest countries most wealthy countries had not kept a promise made in 2009 to provide 100 billion annually by 2020 to help the less developed countries to face climate change da silva said we need financial mechanisms to remedy loss and damage caused by climate change we cannot postpone this debate he added negotiations ongoing international delegates at cop27 are currently negotiating how to increase support for developing countries on the front lines of the climate crisis if approved by all nations a draft agreement would establish funds for loss and damages to pay reparations to such nations as our colleague zack budryk reported avoiding the issue the u s eu and u k have all been unwilling to commit to anything more than a nonbinding framework to keep discussing loss and damage as climate reparations are generally called negotiators told cnn with just two days left in the conference that means the window is rapidly closing for such a deal axios reported un launches cool cities challenge the united nations environment program unep on wednesday launched a new initiative that encourages cities to maximize the cooling potential of nature urban populations at risk the agency announced the nature for cool cities challenge at cop27 which ends in just a few days with global cities on track to warm by about 4 degrees celsius 7 2 degrees fahrenheit by 2100 urbanites will be exposed to conditions that threaten human health unep warned but there is hope despite these sizzling projections the agency stressed that solutions exist to cool the world s cities sustainably cities can integrate the powers of nature to reduce temperatures and boost the resilience of their residents some such solutions include forests green belts and parks in and around cities the unique role of cities we have come to cop27 at a time of global crisis but these crises are a reason to increase our climate ambition not reduce it manuel pulgar vidal global lead for climate and energy at the world wildlife fund said in a statement cities play a key role in avoiding the most severe impacts of global warming pulgar vidal added his organization is a member of the unep led cool coalition which also includes sustainable energy for all mission innovation the rocky mountain institute the world resources institute the university of oxford and durham university quantifiable goals participating cities must pledge to increase the proportion of high quality nature based cooling solutions in their jurisdictions by 2030 according to the challenge however they will already need to show demonstrable progress by 2025 participants will set a quantitative target such as an area or percent increase as well as funding goals and implementation plans who can participate the challenge can include municipalities and state provincial or county governments according to the program financial and technical assistance will be available to an initial cohort of nine participants three lower middle income cities two upper middle income cities and one high income city in the global south the focus is on cities with populations up to 3 million that have not yet received substantial aid for cooling solutions keeping pace with nature to make peace with nature we need to rebuild our cities with nature in mind sheila aggarwal khan director of unep s economy division said in a statement electricity critical to fight global poverty scientists access to electricity may play a much more significant role in improving economic livelihoods than previously assumed a new study has found double the yield stanford university scientists harnessed the power of satellite imagery and artificial intelligence to quantify the impacts such a shift can make publishing their findings on wednesday in nature the researchers focused on the country of uganda and its expanding electricity grid they saw that livelihoods for populations that gained access to electricity roughly doubled in comparison to those that lacked power tangible growth in uganda the electricity grid covered 41 percent of the nation s land mass as of 2019 up from 12 percent in 2010 according to the study but the scientists found that communities granted electricity access witnessed significant changes evident in the appearance of home construction appliances and other tangible assets at first a daunting task lead author nathan ratledge said that when he first began probing electrification in africa five years ago he couldn t find grid maps anywhere on the continent it s hard in many low income countries to get any reliable data and especially repeated data over time ratledge a phd candidate at stanford s doerr school of sustainability said in a statement but ratledge and his co authors were able to use a deep learning technique previously developed by stanford professors marshall burke david lobell and stefano ermon the tool harnesses artificial intelligence to detect patterns and extract information from imagery data that can then be applied to satellite records going back over time ratledge used the technique to zoom in on uganda s grid expansion in 2011 and 2012 combined with newly digitized maps and satellite based estimates of wealth a new frontier this technique opens up a whole new and dramatically different frontier for assessing economic growth among emerging countries ratledge said to learn more about the new tool

bank of america says a recession is not fully priced into risk assets a range of mixed signals are leading some on wall street to conclude the federal reserve will manage a soft landing for the economy however bank of america does not agree with this sentiment we don t share this ambivalence absent a surprisingly fast drop in underlying inflation we think the fed will very likely push the economy into a recession that is likely a bit bigger than what other recession forecasters assume according to a thursday note from ethan harris global economist at bank of america the latest raft of economic data indicate a stronger consumer and labor market while other releases point to faster than expected weakness in the housing sector according to harris the divergent data is contributing to on going hopes that the economy will avoid a recession as lags from fed monetary policy tightening will be longer and more variable than normal we suspect that this high probability bad outcome is not

wilmington tesla tycoon elon musk took the stand on wednesday as part of a trial over his 50 billion pay package as ceo of the electric car giant the arrival was discreet with the world s richest person arriving in a black tesla which parked at the back of the courthouse in a tent set up for the occasion a few minutes later wearing a black suit and tie he quietly passed through security to enter the courtroom musk began testifying in the same delaware court where he faced a lawsuit by twitter to ensure he went through with his buyout of the social platform the 44 billion purchase of twitter has put the south african billionaire under intense scrutiny after he conducted massive layoffs scared advertisers and opened the platform to fake accounts the unrelated tesla case is based on a complaint by shareholder richard tornetta who accused musk and the company s board of directors of failing in their duties when they authorised the pay plan tornetta alleges that musk dictated his terms to directors who were not sufficiently independent from their star ceo to object to a package worth around 51 billion at recent share prices the tesla shareholder accuses musk of unjustified enrichment and asked for the annulment of a pay programme that helped make the entrepreneur the richest man in the world according to a legal filing musk earned the equivalent of 52 4 billion in tesla stock options over four and a half years after virtually all of the company s targets were met when the plan was adopted it was valued at 56 billion the non jury trial began on monday with testimony from ira ehrenpreis head of the compensation committee on tesla s board of directors who said the targets set were extraordinarily ambitious and difficult ehrenpreis argued that the board wanted to spur musk to focus on tesla at a time when the company was still struggling to gain traction highly unusual the trial will run through friday and is being presided over by judge kathaleen mccormick the same judge who was to preside over the twitter case there is no deadline for her decision which could take months it s highly unusual for this kind of case to be brought to trial jill fisch a law professor at the university of pennsylvania told afp there aren t all that many successful challenges to executive compensation the courts have typically treated this as a business decision she added but the court found in this case that musk s ownership of about 22 per cent of tesla and his role as ceo could have an undue impact on the board and other shareholders she noted musk cancelled an in person appearance on sunday at an event on the sidelines of the g 20 in bali to be in court asked why he had not traveled to the tropical indonesian island the new twitter boss joked that his workload has recently increased quite a lot after his takeover of the social media giant

this resolution was adopted at the sixth national congress of the socialist equality party uk held from october 22 to october 25 2022 read the full report on the congress here 1 in january 2023 the covid 19 pandemic will enter its fourth year officially over 627 million people have been infected with covid globally and more than 6 5 million have died with no mitigations in place however billions of people are being infected and reinfected with covid with no records kept according to reliable estimates around 21 5 million have been killed by covid internationally 2 in britain over 207 000 have died from the disease and hundreds are still dying each week with the return to schools and universities fuelling a surge in cases scientists are predicting a larger than ever winter outbreak combining with flu to produce a twindemic that will plunge the national health service nhs into deeper crisis on june 1 2021 the bmj formerly the british medical journal accused the british government of having unleashed a maelstrom of avoidable harm including up to 150 000 people who died earlier than they might have due to its response to the covid 19 pandemic the journal s editorial of february 4 2021 wrote at the very least covid 19 might be classified as social murder 3 the social murder committed by the johnson government was the outcome of a eugenicist agenda widely supported in ruling circles the policy of herd immunity the mass infection of the population with a deadly disease adopted by the government at the pandemic s outset was linked to a revival and embrace of malthusianism johnson had previously written in support of thomas malthus a capitalist ideologue of the late 18th and early 19th century who argued that the inevitability of overpopulation made poverty and early death necessary for the poor 4 britain s chief science adviser sir patrick vallance declared that herd immunity required the infection of about 60 percent of the uk s 66 million population 40 million people the herd immunity strategy was advanced by the government in the face of numerous scientific studies showing that immunity through mass infection of the population was in fact not possible a fact proven by the continuation of the pandemic involving repeated mutations the omicron ba 5 subvariant is now dominant throughout the world with real rates of transmission near or above the all time peaks reached last winter during the surge of omicron ba 1 several mutations are competing for dominance in britain with the danger that future mutations could be more infectious and deadly than their predecessors 5 the socialist equality party uk endorses the resolution of congress passed in august 2022 by our sister party in the united states the covid 19 pandemic and the fight for socialism it states the tragic experience of the last two and a half years has demonstrated that the fight to end the pandemic depends upon and is inseparable from the struggle against capitalism and for socialism this requires the building of a mass movement of the international working class grounded in science and a political historical understanding of the forces responsible for this massive social crime the socialist equality party us and its sister parties in the international committee of the fourth international icfi must continue to provide leadership in this struggle alongside the fight against imperialist war for social equality and in defence of democratic rights the fight for global elimination is today one of the central components of the class struggle in each country 6 britain has spearheaded the homicidal pandemic policy of the capitalist class globally in decrying lockdowns and insisting the economy remain open to keep profits flowing to the corporations then uk prime minister boris johnson spoke for the world s ruling elite with his crude and sociopathic outburst in october 2020 that there must be no more f king lockdowns it anticipated the wholesale abandonment of all containment measures the government had been forced to implement at the start of the pandemic due to mass public outrage it resulted in even more deaths in the second wave of the pandemic 56 735 fatalities compared with 44 235 over the same timeframe during the first wave 7 the last remaining mitigation measures in britain were torn up in the first months of 2022 in january johnson announced in parliament that mask wearing in secondary schools in england would be ended within 24 hours in an april 19 letter to health service leaders nhs england declared that it was adapting the way that the nhs operates with covid 19 in general circulation and with the virus likely to remain endemic for some time to come after declaring that society had to learn to live with the virus the government proclaimed freedom day in july 2021 this has been the narrative of britain s ruling elite ever since with liz truss and rishi sunak declaring during the conservative leadership campaign that lockdown measures to suppress covid should never have been introduced and would never be imposed again living with the virus means dying from the virus the results of three years of mass infection 8 the covid crisis is measured not just in millions of preventable deaths but in the hundreds of millions of people who have been inflicted with long lasting symptoms studies show that roughly 10 30 percent of covid 19 patients go on to develop long covid which can affect nearly every organ in the body infection is linked to an increased risk of heart attack stroke neurological disorders kidney disease diabetes immune dysregulation and other life altering or lethal after effects the chances of developing long covid are compounded with each reinfection and only slightly reduced by vaccination there are likely over 400 million people worldwide suffering from long covid for which there remains no viable treatment 9 the situation in britain with a population of under 70 million is horrific according to a study published in the bmj in september in mid 2022 approximately 70 of the uk adult population had been infected with sars cov 2 of these almost 2 million report covid 19 symptoms persisting for more than four weeks 807 000 41 of all people with long covid for more than a year and 403 000 19 for more than two years based on workforce data from the british medical association a full time equivalent general practitioner with an average list size approximately 2000 has around 65 patients with long covid 27 of whom will have been unwell for more than a year and 12 for more than two years 10 the most brutal policies were reserved for the disabled and elderly the uk s 20 000 care homes housing over 400 000 elderly and vulnerable people were transformed into killing fields due to the enormous pressure placed on the national health service by the pandemic a march 17 2020 directive from nhs england instructed that 25 000 elderly patients should be cleared out of hospital beds without being tested for covid 19 many were transferred into care homes according to office for national statistics data by february this year 45 632 care home residents had perished with covid listed on their death certificates as a cause of death accounting for 16 7 percent of all care home resident deaths during the first wave of the pandemic hundreds of do not resuscitate dnr orders were authorised illegally and without consent in care homes and for the mentally and physically disabled 119 social care providers reported that blanket dnr notices had affected people in their care 11 as a result of the pandemic life expectancy worldwide has dropped by 1 6 years the first global decline since the end of world war ii the combined impacts of mass death and debilitation lowered life expectancy in the uk according to public health england by 1 3 years for males and 0 9 years for females this social retrogression long advocated by a significant group of eugenicists among britain s ruling elite is seen as a positive good for reducing pension obligations and other social welfare spending these considerations were summed up by telegraph columnist jeremy warner who wrote at the pandemic s outset not to put too fine a point on it from an entirely disinterested economic perspective the covid 19 might even prove mildly beneficial in the long term by disproportionately culling elderly dependents a trigger event in world history 12 the socialist equality party in britain notes with pride the record of the world socialist web site and the icfi on the pandemic which is unparalleled and a triumph of the marxist movement the resolution of the socialist equality party in the us notes since january 2020 we have published over 5 000 articles on the pandemic continuously alerting the international working class to the mounting global catastrophe and advocating for policies to eliminate covid 19 globally from the beginning the icfi insisted that the pandemic was not simply a medical issue but primarily a political social and economic crisis arising from the broader world capitalist crisis the response to the pandemic would be determined by pre existing social conditions in the us decades of unending war financial parasitism deindustrialization the corporatist degeneration of the unions the evisceration of democratic rights and the cultivation of far right politics embodied in the presidency of donald trump were the determining forces at the start of 2020 in march 2020 the icfi first characterized the pandemic as a trigger event akin to the assassination of austrian archduke franz ferdinand which set into motion the outbreak of world war i and later the russian revolution as with the assassination the pandemic profoundly exacerbated the already far advanced crisis of world capitalism and accelerated the processes leading to both war and revolution two years later with the outbreak of the us nato war against russia and the growth of increasingly militant struggles of the international working class the trigger has been pulled 13 the sep uk 2020 congress resolution noted the warning by financial times europe editor tony barber that the pandemic would function as the trigger event for revolution as predicted by the icfi it is in the nature of cataclysmic events such as the pandemic to accelerate and refashion historical developments that would have happened anyway the first world war intensified turmoil in russia leading to the revolutions of 1917 and drove forward the emergence of the us as the 20th century s leading global power the pandemic and its economic fallout unless brought under a measure of control is sure to have similar large scale consequences labour party and the unions join johnson government in a de facto coalition 14 the october 2020 sep uk congress resolution documented the opening months of the pandemic during which the johnson government organised its 410 billion bailout of the banks and corporations and ended the march 23 first lockdown after just three months in furtherance of a brutal back to work campaign to make the working class pay for the vast sums handed over to the corporations these crimes were carried out with the collusion of the labour party and the trade unions the pandemic broke out while labour was still under the left leadership of jeremy corbyn corbyn immediately pledged to work with johnson declaring in a parliamentary debate on the pandemic on march 25 2020 the immediate task of the opposition is to support the public health efforts that are being made while being constructively critical where necessary to ensure that there is an improved official response sir keir starmer on becoming party leader in april 2020 only deepened corbyn s constructive partnership with the tories proclaiming our willingness to come together like this as a nation has been lying dormant for too long 15 the trade unions have played decisive role in backing the tories seizing on the covid emergency to bolster their corporatist collusion with the government and the employers the trades union congress tuc and its constituent unions closed down all actions by the working class including wildcat strikes by postal workers over coronavirus safety and official strikes by 50 000 lecturers drivers on the london underground and numerous strike threats by rail workers and others while facing off demands by hundreds of thousands of parents for the closure of schools 16 the unions signed off on the government s gigantic bailout of the corporations and banks which was formulated in numerous meetings these included then chancellor sunak hosting in the treasury even before the first lockdown was in place a march 19 2020 business groups and unions roundtable attended by tuc general secretary frances o grady and confederation of british industry cbi head carolyn fairbairn once the bailout was in place and strikes suppressed the de facto conservative labour tuc coalition moved rapidly to organise the end of the first lockdown and force millions back into unsafe workplaces as early as april 3 2020 just 10 days after the first lockdown was put in place the tuc issued a joint statement with the cbi and the health and safety executive which insisted firms that can safely stay open and support livelihoods should not be forced to close by misunderstandings about the government guidance 17 the extent of corporatist collusion during the pandemic was unprecedented the rail maritime and transport workers union rmt joined the government s rail industry coronavirus joint forum with the aim of ensuring close co operation and collaboration between the trade unions and employers o grady published an open letter in the times proposing a big generous offer to government bring us into the room give us an equal voice listen to our ideas in return we will roll up our sleeves and get stuck into the job of rebuilding our country so that it works for everyone just as we did after the second world war the government responded by organising seven sector by sector meetings chaired by business secretary alok sharma with trade union and business leaders out of which the tuc produced a policy document declaring that it does not take a position on the science of how to manage a pandemic or the speed or nature of any return to work 18 the corbynites played a central role in keeping all opposition to the government s pandemic policies within the safe channels of the labour and trade union bureaucracy their misnamed and now dormant zero covid uk campaign existed solely to provide an apologia for the refusal of labour and the unions to do anything to genuinely prevent the virus from ripping through workplaces and schools leading corbynite diane abbott even declared it s always been the case that some people that support our organisation don t necessarily believe in absolutely zero covid this allowed zero covid uk to act as a platform for numerous labourites and trade union bureaucrats to posture as concerned critics of the tories even as they actively sabotaged opposition among educators and parents to the shared policy of the tories and labour 19 the socialist equality party alongside our sister parties internationally fought for an end to the criminal back to work drive and school reopenings the repudiation of the corporate bailouts and the establishment of workers ownership and democratic control of the major banks and corporations we insisted that governments provide a living income to all those impacted by the pandemic to fund containment measures and expand healthcare and social protections these demands were based as the sep uk congress resolution stated on the fundamental premise that the response to the pandemic must be determined by what workers and society as a whole need not what the capitalist system and the financial oligarchs are prepared to give 20 the criminal response of the ruling class to the pandemic was epitomised by its policy of keeping schools open almost continually throughout the pandemic this resulted in the deaths of 570 educators and school staff and 211 children by february this year more than 4 6 million children had been infected in britain with over 3 million child cases occurring since the end of all covid safety measures on july 19 2021 this policy met with the most determined opposition from educators and parents and could only be implemented thanks to the backing extended to the tories by labour and the education unions starmer infamously stated in august 2020 i don t just want all children back at school next month i expect them back at school no ifs no buts no equivocation the national education union declared that there could be no education disruption by january 2021 with millions of parents refusing to send children into covid infested schools and teachers withdrawing their labour citing section 44 of the workplace employment rights act the government was forced to impose another lockdown but once again the government could rely on the unions to reopen schools prematurely from march 2021 21 the labour party and the unions are seeking to ensure that those guilty of heinous crimes are shielded through their backing of the conservative government s uk covid 19 inquiry as with all the independent public inquiries organised by the ruling elite including the ongoing grenfell fire inquiry it can never bring justice it is being held under the blair labour government s inquiries act 2005 which ensures that no matter what evidence is presented those guilty will be shielded from civil or criminal liability relatives are forbidden from giving evidence at the public hearings that will begin in 2023 they can only submit pen portraits to be read by others the programme of the international committee of the fourth international 22 the international committee of the fourth international bases its policies on the recognition that the international working class is the only social force that can successfully oppose the ruling class s policy of mass infection illness and death and implement a scientific programme to end the pandemic globally in the interests of humanity the record of the icfi is detailed in the sep us congress resolution 23 on august 20 2021 the wsws published a critical statement clearly explaining the scientific and political distinctions between the three strategies towards the pandemic herd immunity mitigation and elimination eradication its central significance was the clarification of the reformist character of the mitigationist strategy and the need for workers and scientists to adopt the revolutionary strategy of elimination eradication summarized in this passage mitigation is to epidemiology what reformism is to capitalist politics just as the reformist harbours the hope that gradual and piecemeal reforms will over time lessen and ameliorate the evils of the profit system the mitigationists nourish the delusion that covid 19 will eventually evolve into something no more harmful than the common cold this is a pipe dream totally divorced from the science of the pandemic in reality as long as the virus spreads it will continue to mutate into new more infectious lethal and vaccine resistant variants that threaten all of humanity unless it is eradicated on a world scale the embers of covid 19 will continue to burn and create the conditions for the virus to flare up anew 24 on august 22 and october 24 2021 the wsws and the international workers alliance of rank and file committees iwa rfc hosted two powerful webinars on the pandemic with some of the leading scientists and workers fighting for the global elimination of covid 19 which were viewed by many thousands of people from over 100 countries throughout the world throughout this period the iwa rfc expanded in a wide range of industries internationally and helped organize a series of global school strikes initiated by british parent lisa diaz 25 with covid ripping through schools and schoolstrike2021 the main hashtag for the event trending online parents educators and students held their first school strike on october 1 summarising the significance of the global event world socialist web site international editorial board chairman david north stated october 1 2021 is a date that will live in history the thousands of workers who have responded to lisa diaz s call to action and joined today s global online picket line are acting on behalf of countless millions across the globe while governments and the rich are concerned only with the impact of the pandemic on the stock markets and corporate profits the working class is concerned with the cost to human life covid 19 cannot be lived with it must be eradicated today s action is a great step forward in the fight against the pandemic but it is the beginning not the end of the struggle we must build on today s achievement and increase our efforts to mobilize the working class on a global scale in action 26 the intersection of the icfi s struggle with growing sections of the working class prompted attempts to separate the icfi from scientists including through attacks on our position on the metoo campaign but since then we have only deepened our connections with the most principled scientists the icfi initiated the global workers inquest into the covid 19 pandemic on november 21 2021 this was just four days before news broke of the omicron variant announcing the inquest a wsws statement noted the pandemic is an event of historic magnitude its impact on the course of the twenty first century may well prove to be as far reaching as that of the two world wars on the twentieth century therefore the origins causes and consequences of the pandemic must be thoroughly investigated and understood this disaster was neither an act of god nor the result of a malevolent conspiracy in a chinese laboratory the time has come to decisively refute the lies in which the pandemic narrative has been enshrouded by governments and the corporate media this inquest is necessary to break through the cover up falsifications and misinformation that have been deployed to justify policies responsible for the avoidable deaths of millions since the initial detection of sars cov 2 the inquest will gather and make available to the public the ample evidence of socially malign and even criminal indifference to human life 27 the inquest has received vital testimony and will present its initial findings later this year among those testifying are scientists and anti covid activists on topics including the zero covid strategy in china airborne transmission masking policies long covid the role of schools in viral transmission and the impact of covid 19 on children experts have testified on the criminal policies of governments and corporations in the us canada brazil sweden germany australia new zealand sri lanka and india workers from a range of industries including autoworkers educators health care workers and musicians have testified about their experiences in britain the inquiry has taken testimony from several parents including sarah paxman who are being persecuted by the authorities for refusing to send their children into schools which have no mitigation measures in place this particularly perverse policy of the british bourgeoisie has only been opposed by the educators rank and file committee initiated by the sep the tasks of the socialist equality party in the fight against the pandemic 28 the two alternatives posed before mankind are either unending mass infection debilitation and death or the revolutionary overthrow of capitalism and implementation of a policy of global elimination to end all human to human transmission of covid 19 the strategy of elimination fought for only by the icfi requires the universal deployment of every weapon in the arsenal of measures to combat the virus this includes mass vaccination available to all universal testing isolation and contact tracing along with the temporary shutdown of schools and non essential production with full income to workers and support for small businesses in china the deployment of a zero covid elimination strategy backed by popular support has allowed the authorities to repeatedly suppress outbreaks it demonstrates in practice that elimination is possible and that it must be expanded worldwide 29 the revolutionary socialist response to the covid 19 pandemic other infectious diseases and climate change will be successful to the extent that it is bound up with the building of a mass movement of the international working class fighting for world socialism the sep pledges to fight for the following demands a the fight for global elimination the fight to end the pandemic requires the organisation and coordination of the struggles of the working class on a world scale which will only develop through the building of the iwa rfc a central aim of the sep uk in fostering the growth of the iwa rfc must be to popularize the strategy of global elimination the party must also develop our correspondence and collaboration with the most principled scientists and anti covid activists who agree with and are fighting for the strategy of global elimination b the expansion of the global workers inquest the inquest is a powerful mechanism to politically educate workers on what has taken place during the pandemic and who is responsible for this monumental social crime the sep must deepen the investigation with an emphasis on bringing forward the experiences of workers in every industry c the fight for socialist public health and the internationalisation of the pharmaceutical and healthcare industries during the pandemic there has been a qualitative deepening of the decades long assault on public health and the health care industry the health care and pharmaceutical industries must be placed under public and global control to ensure the equitable distribution of treatment and life saving resources access research and treatment must be globalised as these are universal rights in a modern society only through the building of a world socialist society can public health and health care among the most critical fields of human activity be developed under socialism there will be a profound expansion of life expectancy and quality of life for every person on the planet
biontech se new york and mainz germany november 16 2022 pfizer inc nyse pfe and biontech se nasdaq bntx today announced that the companies have initiated a phase 1 study to evaluate the safety tolerability and immunogenicity of a next generation covid 19 vaccine candidate that aims to enhance sars cov 2 t cell responses and potentially broaden protection against covid 19 this candidate bnt162b4 is composed of a t cell antigen mrna encoding for sars cov 2 non spike proteins that are highly conserved across a broad range of sars cov 2 variants and will be evaluated in combination with the companies omicron ba 4 ba 5 adapted bivalent covid 19 vaccine these non spike proteins have been chosen based on biontech s proprietary target prioritization platform and were designed into a vaccine candidate with the purpose of enhancing and broadening t cell immunity and potentially extending durability of protection against covid 19 bnt162b4 will be evaluated in a u s based study nct05541861 enrolling approximately 180 healthy individuals between 18 and 55 years of age who have received at least three doses of an mrna based covid 19 vaccine the trial will explore different dose levels of bnt162b4 administered in combination with a 30 µg dose of the companies omicron ba 4 ba 5 adapted bivalent covid 19 vaccine and will be compared to the administration of a 30 µg dose of the omicron ba 4 ba 5 adapted bivalent covid 19 vaccine as a booster this study is part of the companies long term and multi pronged scientific strategy to generate more robust longer lasting and broader immune responses against sars cov 2 infections and associated covid 19 as part of this approach the companies are developing multiple vaccine candidates with the aim of delivering a potential

by christie debernardis with the breeders cup returning to lexington for the third time headlined by the mighty flightline tapit the buzz in lexington was electric from late october all the way through the nearly two weeks of breeding stock sales that followed the world championships combine that with a deep and diverse buying bench and high demand and the result was gains in both gross and average for the 10 day keeneland november breeding stock sale which ran from nov 7 16 with the close of the november breeding stock sale keeneland is nearing the end of a remarkable fall season and we send a sincere thank you to everyone who supported our september and november sales fall meet and breeders cup keeneland president and ceo shannon arvin said since september we have been hard at work to showcase the best in thoroughbred racing and sales and we are privileged to have had the opportunity to share keeneland with a global audience our november sale benefitted from the excitement of the breeders cup the sale of the flightline interest and the fireworks of book 1 creating positive experiences from start to finish with the horses of racing age sale being separated into its own one day auction to be held nov 17 this year 2 245 horses went through the ring over the last 10 days for gross receipts of 210 027 700 the 2022 november sale eclipsed the gross 2 470 horses achieved during 2021 of 203 585 500 on its eighth day the cumulative average of 93 554 was up 13 5 from last year s average of 82 423 but the median was down a tick 5 41 from 37 000 to 35 000 the rna percentage also rose from 17 36 last year to 21 75 for 2022 the november sale was topped by champion midnight bisou midnight lute who summoned 5 5 million from northern farm s katsumi yoshida carrying her second foal by tapit she led a total of 12 seven figure sellers compared to seven in 2021 including three in book 2 which previously had not seen a million dollar horse since 2017 we really put an effort into building up the front end of the catalogue to make sure we have quality forward and the buyers were presented with the horses they expected to see and are here for said keeneland vice president of sales tony lacy i think everybody responded to that we appreciate our consignors and breeders for supporting us in that endeavor i think the buyers really responded it allows us more confidence to do the things we feel are important to do and develop we are only getting started without making major changes at any point we want to make sure the tweaks we do make work i think overall we are on the right track we have a responsibility to the industry keenelandsales november breeding stock sale hip 235 champion midnight bisou in foal to tapit brings the hammer down at 5 5 million consigned by hillndalefarm pic twitter com ybah5c5rmv tdn thetdn november 7 2022 flying into the future keeneland kicked off the november sale with a first of its kind offering a 2 5 interest in unbeaten superstar flightline who scored a breathtaking victory in the gi longines breeders cup classic two days before the auction and was retired to the lane s end stallion barn about 16 hours later keeneland and lane s end employed virtual reality and the metaverse for this unique offering and buyers responded enthusiastically auctioned 30 minutes prior to the start of book 1 in a jam packed pavilion the flightline share summoned 4 6 million from brookdale s freddy seitz acting on behalf of an undisclosed seattle based owner and client with interests in the coffee business sid fernando reported in his taking stock column nov 9 coolmore was the immediate underbidder we are trying to push boundaries all of the time lacy said this is a situation where the stars aligned bill farish mentioned that it might be a possibility and we were looking at virtual reality and the metaverse to bring a new customer base or at least a new fan base in when flightline won the pacific classic things got real coming into the breeders cup the whole industry was absolutely in awe of what he was and what his future would be as a stallion to be able to pull something together like that was a mammoth effort on the legal side as well as the logistics side it was exciting for us all to be involved in lane s end s allaire ryan expressed similar sentiments it was a really unique way to start out the sale and the energy that it brought to the pavilion that afternoon was really fantastic it had a domino effect on the subsequent purchases made in the sale when you factor in the number of mares that were purchased specifically to be bred to flightline there were a few out of our consignment alone like shamrock rose edgeway bayerness even though he is retired from racing he is already impacting the industry from a commercial breeder standpoint that has been an exciting wave to ride for sure as ryan stated the retirement of flightline made quite the impact on the november market the partners on the no doubt horse of the year were busy scooping up mares to breed to their once in a lifetime horse as were several other breeders for example flightline s breeder and part owner jane lyon of summer wind farm was third leading buyer for the sale acquiring four mares for her new stallion for 4 625 million with an average of 1 156 250 her purchases were topped by the aforementioned mgsw and gi breeders cup filly mare sprint runner up edgeway competitive edge for 1 7 million flightline wasn t the only new stallion impacting the november market however the partners on mgisw rising star life is good into mischief who gave flightline all he had through swift fractions for the first mile of the classic were also actively acquiring mares for winstar s new addition for instance the china horse club bought five mares for a total of 1 75 million for an average of 350 000 lane s end leads all consignors even without the 4 6 million boost provided by flightline lane s end took the title of leading consignor for this year s november sale the farish family s operation sold a total of 129 head including flightline s fractional interest for 23 460 400 with an average of 181 864 even excepting the share lane s end was still the november sale s top seller their top selling mare was champion female sprinter shamrock rose first dude who brought 3 million from japan s ki farm carrying a foal by curlin and is set to meet flightline next year keenelandsales november breeding stock sale hip 170 champion shamrock rose in foal to curlin brings the hammer down at 3 million consigned by lanesendfarms pic twitter com setusauevl tdn thetdn november 7 2022 it is super gratifying for us to be leading consignor even without the big sale of the flightline share which was a really fun way to start out the sale ryan said we had some really quality offerings in book 1 and book 2 which set us out on the right foot where there is quality there is plenty of depth in the market people that did bring good horses were rewarded for it which was great to see we had some nice broodmare prospects we had some lovely in foal mare and a couple of standout weanlings it had a trickle down effect from there bisou on top again an eclipse winner in 2019 and fasig tipton november topper in 2020 mgisw midnight bisou was at the head of the class again at this year s keeneland november sale purchased by chuck and lori allen for 5 million at the aforementioned fasig sale she is headed to japan after bringing 5 5 million from katsumi yoshida with a tapit filly in utero midnight bisou was offered by john sikura s hill n dale at xalapa which also sold the 7 million fasig tipton november topper champion gamine into mischief who went to coolmore s m v magnier in foal to quality road it was a great thrill said sikura we topped both the fasig tipton and keeneland sales all the credit to our team and the people who supplied us with a great draft of horses it is all about quality and we were fortunate enough to have had a fantastic sale at both sales companies this is the second consecutive year we topped fasig tipton and it was nice to do it at keeneland as well credit to the horses we had a good strong market people can t get enough of quality he continued everyone is very specific about what they like there are different categories of mares but if you are going to sell a 100 000 mare you want it to be an early cover and in foal to the right horse if you want to sell sale toppers you need to have pedigree and good race records with those early covers and the right sire i thought everybody who brought quality was well rewarded this trend has continued for the last many years and it looks like it is here to stay weanlings in high demand john sikura keeneland after a record setting keeneland september yearling sale the weanling market was very strong and competitive at the november sale producing north america s top priced weanling for the fourth consecutive year that youngster was a medaglia d oro filly out of sw serena s cat storm cat dam of champion honor code a p indy who was purchased for 1 5 million by magnier in book 1 we grossed 45 more for weanlings than we did last year said keeneland s directory of sales operations cormac breathnach we really appreciate the support of the breeders and consignors we depend on them heavily your sale is only as good as the catalogue it s been a terrific collaboration the market has been bullish we are enjoying a good time in the industry that trickled down into the later books creating a stronger middle market for weanlings with varying pedigrees it is quite hard to sell a mare that is 12 15 even if they had a stakes placed horse and a few winners sikura said if they are good foal it doesn t matter who they are by how old the mare is or what their up close pedigree is obviously the more you have of all of that criteria the more they make of it i ve seen foals walk through and bring 180 000 and you look at the sire and think who is this the pendulum has swung now so much toward the physical horse i think that is the determining factor at the yearling sales and also at the foal sales they have to vet they have to have the smooth physical and great walk those kinds they chase them hard where you have quality you had plenty of people interested said ryan if for some reason a mare or weanling didn t tick all the boxes it felt thinner it didn t take long for that feeling to set in i think there was still plenty of good competition in the weanling market especially for good physicals people were rewarded at the yearling sales this year and they were looking to reinvest but they weren t willing to take a lot of risk if it didn t have a top physical or had some vet issues the leading sire of weanlings for the 10 day auction was mgisw tdn rising star and new gainesway sire mckinzie street sense with 23 members of his first crop bringing 3 162 million with an average of 137 478 tapit into mischief rule keeneland buoyed by the sale of the 2 5 fractional interest in his star son flightline tapit led all sires with a gross of 9 507 000 and average of 365 654 taking the flightline share out of the equation puts super sire into mischief on top with 31 head bringing 6 961 500 with an average of 224 565 hill n dale s new addition mgisw rising star charlatan speightstown was the sale s leading covering sire by gross with 27 mares carrying his first foals bringing 8 472 million and averaging 313 778 lane s end stalwart quality road was second with 11 mares carrying his offspring summoning 7 675 million with an average of 697 727 easily tops among sires with five or more in foal mares sold curlin and tapit each averaged seven figures for their limited in foal mares charlatan covered a great book of mares sikura said the most elite mares did not go to public auction i think the momentum is building and we are looking forward to his first foals he bred outstanding mares 1 million even for proud emma a graded stakes winner in foal to charlatan consigned by bedouin bloodstock purchased by moresummerwind pic twitter com rf7lswffbp keeneland sales keenelandsales november 9 2022 foreign buyers boost november market a treasure trove of foreign buyers led by japan gave the november market a significant boost creating even more depth and diversity in the buying bench japan s katsumi yoshida led all buyers by gross at 9 7 million and average at 3 233 333 each of the three mares purchased by his bloodstock agent shingo hashimoto fetched seven figures highlighted by sale topping midnight bisou the international market was a critical part of the outcome of this sale lacy said japanese buyers were extremely active especially at the top despite the swing in the exchange rate which is not in their favor that was extremely gratifying to see we had buyers from 29 countries participate at the sale that is on the high end of what we would expect with the dollar being so strong it is great to get that international support it s a global marketplace and we work on that very heavily we ve seen 60 or 70 australians here which we haven t seen in years we ve seen europeans here that have not been in here in six or seven years and they were back and were active they are energized by what they see that is very encouraging for us the top 20 horses including the flightline share were purchased by 15 individual buyers three of which were from japan domestic buyers also remained active at the november sale in addition to the aforementioned coolmore and summer wind farm one of the most active american buyers was pin oak stud recently purchased by jim and dana bernhard they scooped up 15 mares for their new farm for a total of 4 354 million bloodstock agent chad schumer bought the most horses during the 10 day auction taking home 51 head for 3 385 500 with an average of 66 382 final session stats wednesday s 10th and final session of the keeneland november sale which was the third session of book 5 was topped by a pair of 45 000 weanlings upper mill stable took home a filly from the first crop of honor a p hip 3514 and j t vill purchased a colt by kantharos hip 3545 a total of 154 horses sold wednesday for 1 148 600 with an average of 7 458 and median of 3 600 thirty three horses failed to meet their reserves for an rna rate of 17 65 racehorses moved to a separate sale horses of racing age have been a traditional part of the keeneland november sale typically being sold in the middle of auction except for last year when it they were offered during the final session this year keeneland separated that popular section out and made it its own single day sale to be held thursday after the conclusion of breeding stock sale for the first year it is its own sale for several reasons breathnach said one is the later entry deadline it is a more dynamic catalogue we can give it a greater online presence with more form figures and data associated with each offering that is something that is a little difficult to do when you have an aug 1 deadline like we do with the breeding stock sale we are also confined by the number of horses in each session those horses were catalogued in the second half during book 3 or book 4 which took up spots breeders wanted their mares or foals to be in he continued it is its own sale so it can have its own identity and own dynamic and build a stronger catalogue it allows it to go forward the horses in training market is very strong our position in the calendar year is when people are transitioning to new locations for the winter so they got a chance to buy or sell stock that will fit where they are going or be better off elsewhere the hora sale which begins at noon has a catalogue of 356 racehorses of varying ages including several promising juveniles and an array of black type competitors last year s hora portion which was part of a mixed final of 10 sessions was topped by the 2 year old colt strava into mischief who brought 825 000

elon musk s takeover has been a hilarious disaster if you re anything like me then you hate billionaires in fact more than that you also really really hate the corporations that dominate our day to day life the ongoing controversy surrounding social media platform twitter particularly its now defunct blue paid verification scheme is embarrassing the world s richest man and causing large multinationals to lose tens of billions in market capitalization at the end of october billionaire tesla ceo elon musk completed a 44 million deal to take over twitter he immediately cut thousands of jobs including many in the communications department and from high ranking positions in charge of trust and safety then twitter blue a service that provides official verification for an 8 per month fee was rolled out chaos ensued after that and the service was suspended to be specific tons of impersonators posed as prominent public figures we saw the fake accounts of george w bush and tony blair lament that they miss killing iraqis meanwhile someone pretending to be oj simpson admitted to murder but what was more consequential was the fact that large brands were impersonated for instance an account claiming to be pharmaceutical company eli lilly co said the company was giving away free insulin and immediately plunged its stocks an account supposedly representing lockheed martin also said it was halting weapons sales to saudi arabia israel and the us pending human rights investigations the weapons contractor also saw its stocks crater in response to these tweets the list goes on companies like chiquita american girl roblox bp and tesla as well as the american israel public affairs committee aipac were impersonated by twitter users and made controversial statements these ranged from praising apartheid in israel to saying that a fruit company had overthrown brazil s government for its part twitter is in hot water over this situation that s obviously why it suspended its verification system and at the same time elon musk has said the company could face bankruptcy in the near future there s no doubt that the social media platform has lost significant value since the tesla ceo s takeover probably to the tune of several billion the roll out of twitter blue was a predictable disaster that posed serious challenges to advertisers clearly which is why they ve bounced from the social media platform but even though it s true that this was a very ill advised decision on musk s part he has inadvertently created the most formidable anti capitalist weapon in modern history all at the cost of 8 anyone with a few bucks in their pocket could until just days ago shave off billions in value from an evil company that is destroying the planet threatening global security or engaged in war crimes that s a remarkable thing at least it would have been remarkable if it would have been left alone and not shut down still there were enough accounts that got through with at the same time a skimped down trust and safety network that means impersonators are still common and misinformation is everywhere if you load your timeline you re sure to see countless examples of fake news from verified accounts that you would otherwise be inclined to trust at first glance prior to twitter blue s roll out the public square as we knew it is no more and that might push people to new better platforms twitter s advantages are numerous it allows you to read the news which could be replaceable by just reading news outlets directly you can also read people s thoughts unfiltered which could boost the number of newsletter subscriptions down the road you could also just use a messaging platform like whatsapp or telegram to message people in case that s what you use the bird for or you could just take your connections to the real world and ditch social media altogether at any rate the social media platform s meteoric rise and immediate tanking when elon musk took power are hilarious the richest man in the world has been left with egg on his face after going forward with buying twitter which is something no one seriously thought he wanted to do in the first place but now he s stuck with a broken application and accumulating debt to the point that as stated before the company could just flat out go bankrupt and the only casualties in this entire scandal besides musk s reputation have been the stock valuation of some dastardly companies that are frankly evil again if you re anything like me then word of twitter s implosion is good news to you that s probably because you recognize how unforgivably unequal our society is and believe in some form of poetic justice for the people and entities perpetuating the system
after months of record revenue growth oregon economists now expect the state to enter a mild recession next summer state economists told a legislative panel on wednesday that economic forecasters in oregon and around the country anticipate a recession within the next year because inflation remains higher than the federal reserve wants it to be with the fed expected to continue raising interest rates in a quarterly report released wednesday officials from oregon s office of economic analysis likened the interest rate hikes to slamming on a car s brakes slamming on the brakes of a speeding car will cause it to skid and even fishtail the report said the question is whether the driver is able to pull out of it or end up in the ditch most economists today believe a recession is likely even if the exact path of the economy is uncertain the forecasted recession envisions losing about 24 000 jobs primarily in construction manufacturing and related industries including finance and transportation it would likely be rougher in the portland suburbs and central oregon where rapid population growth means a significant portion of the local economy is tied to construction state economist mark mcmullen told lawmakers the signs of an upcoming recession are different this year than they have been in the past it will be driven by a decline in housing and business investment due to high interest rates he said the current forecast calls for employment rates which have risen quickly and steadily since plummeting in the early days of the pandemic to dip in late 2023 and begin rising again the following year it s rather mild at least from a historical perspective mcmullen said there are three reasons to expect a mild recession he said first businesses financial markets and people expect inflation to slow second the labor market has been so tight that employers aren t likely to let go of workers even if their sales slow and finally many people still have higher savings from wage growth stimulus payments and limited spending during the pandemic though those savings are concentrated in higher income households some of the state s urban areas are most at risk forecasters said clackamas columbia deschutes jackson and washington counties along with rural crook and gilliam counties are at highest risk because much of their economies depend on construction manufacturing or transportation and warehousing the portland suburbs bend and prineville are growing quickly with many jobs in housing construction while 10 of gilliam county jobs are in transportation or warehousing that county s largest employers are landfills other rural counties used to have more volatile economies when they relied on the timber industry and mills would regularly shut down and reopen mcmullen said now those rural counties don t experience the same economic booms as the rest of the state but they also don t see the same downswings in bad economic times meanwhile oregon lawmakers will begin drafting the state s next two year budget in a couple of months and they ll have about 3 billion less to work with than they did during the current two year budget cycle that s because many wealthy oregonians cashed out capital gains in 2021 and federal stimulus checks increased the amount of money collected in state income taxes record kicker credit the state will also pay out in 2024 a record kicker tax credit which is triggered when the state collects more in personal income taxes than it budgeted oregonians who paid taxes in 2022 and 2023 will receive credits totalling 3 7 billion when they file their tax returns in 2024 with larger credits for those who paid more in taxes we ve never seen kickers like this mcmullen said lawmakers can reduce or eliminate the tax credit with a two thirds vote 20 senators and 40 representatives they did so in the early 1990s when the nation faced a recession tied to the gulf war and progressive groups have long pushed for legislators to reduce or reform the kicker but such a vote seems unlikely next year democrats will still have a majority in the oregon house and senate though they lost their supermajorities in both chambers getting enough votes to suspend the kicker would require not just every democrat but multiple republicans in the house and senate to vote for it and gop legislative leaders have consistently pledged to protect the kicker as is before we all run away thinking we can quickly spend that kicker on something else or hold it that s a high bar and a pretty big lift and there s probably better things to spend your time on sen lynn findley r vale warned his colleagues rep nancy nathanson d eugene asked whether pandemic induced changes to consumer spending will affect how oregonians spend their extra money from the kicker more people purchased goods online than from local brick and mortar stores and it s unclear how much of the money returned to taxpayers will make it to oregon businesses mcmullen said much of the tax rebate already goes to people who may not spend it people who pay more in taxes receive higher kickers and while people living paycheck to paycheck spend nearly every dollar they have people with more money might save their rebates oregon s lack of a retail sales tax has also made it hard to track spending trends mcmullen said but the state will have more data because of the corporate activity tax passed in 2019 the tax applies to businesses gross receipts and effectively functions as a hidden sales tax because businesses pass the costs on to consumers one place that s pretty darn clear is that when we give out a big kicker video lottery sales go through the roof mcmullen said legislative leaders respond legislative democrats and gov kate brown responded to the forecast by saying oregon is well positioned to weather economic challenges in a statement from ho chi minh city vietnam where she is traveling on a trade mission brown praised the state s continued fiscally responsible decisions because we have made prudent financial decisions the state has the ability if needed to invest in resources to help oregonians who may feel its impacts she said with this forecast the legislature should also be prepared as they enter the upcoming session to respond to economic challenges and take meaningful action to benefit oregon s working families house speaker dan rayfield d corvallis agreed that oregon s almost 1 8 billion in cash reserves leaves the state in a good position it still would take a three fifths majority 18 senators and 36 representatives to tap into the reserves the state has historic cash reserves and is set up better than ever to handle any potential economic downturn thanks to years of responsible budget management by democratic leadership rayfield said we are poised to take advantage of the upcoming 2023 legislative session soften the impacts of any potential downturn make our communities safer and focus investments on working families and communities of color and senate majority leader rob wagner d lake oswego pledged that democrats will continue recent spending on health care housing and other sectors we will continue to build on our recent historic investments in health care housing jobs and education wagner said due to the fiscally responsible leadership of oregon democrats our state s budget reserves are currently the strongest they ve ever been in oregon s history his counterpart in the house rep julie fahey of west eugene said spending by the oregon legislature and recent federal money from the biden harris administration made the state s economy strong she called for continued spending to address the state s ongoing affordable housing crisis provide support for mental and behavioral health and drive down the cost of living we also know that should a global recession hit oregon is prepared to mitigate its impact because of the work democrats have done to set aside historic levels of reserves fahey said this work will allow us to continue supporting our most vulnerable communities legislative republican leaders meanwhile issued a joint statement saying it was a time to be cautious and prepared hard working oregonians continue to pay the price of high inflation and take the brunt of the current recession said senate minority leader tim knopp r bend the upcoming legislative budget and policy decisions made around the economy must be focused on relieving their burden not adding to it rep vikki breese iverson r prineville and the house minority leader added that legislative republicans will oppose any new taxes oregonians spoke in the recent election by breaking the supermajority in the legislature she said republicans will respond in the upcoming legislative session by holding strong against growing government or taxes
facing growing pension costs and stiff inflation new york city officials on tuesday projected that the city s budget deficit would shrink to 2 9 billion next year after recent belt tightening efforts before ballooning again in subsequent years the grim forecast was not unexpected for months mayor eric adams s administration has been tracking various economic indicators that suggest the city s economic underpinnings are shaky officials have predicted a drop off in business and personal income tax revenue they have warned that reaching new labor settlements with the city s unionized work force could add yet substantial new stress to the budget even as an underperforming stock market requires the city to contribute more to its pension funds with that in mind the mayor in september demanded that his agencies cut city funded expenses by 3 percent this year and 4 75 percent the next the effort reduced the current fiscal year s budget gap by nearly 1 billion and will cut future deficits even further

mr musk denied that he dictated terms of the compensation package or attended any meetings at which the plan was discussed by the board its compensation committee or a working group that helped develop it i was entirely focused on the execution of the company he said plaintiff s lawyer greg varallo spent much of his early cross examination trying to draw mr musk into admitting that he controls tesla to such an extent that he can sway the board to do his bidding in this courtroom sketch tesla chief executive elon musk left gives evidence before chancellor kathaleen mccormick in a courtroom in wilmington delaware elizabeth williams via ap among other things mr varallo questioned mr musk about his title of technoking a role that mr musk has previously noted comes with panache and great dance moves i think comedy is legal mr musk told mr varallo who had questioned whether mr musk was stone cold sober when he came up with the title mr varallo also suggested that one of the reasons that mr musk developed a master plan for tesla was to let people know he was in charge he also noted that mr musk makes recommendations regarding compensation for senior executives and that he unilaterally made the decision to pause tesla s policy of accepting bitcoin from vehicle purchasers you re asking complex questions that can t be answered yes or no mr musk said when mr varallo asked whether he came up with the vision for tesla mr musk said he never intended to be chief executive of tesla and that he did not want to be chief executive of any other companies either preferring to see himself as an engineer instead he also said he expects an organisational restructuring of twitter to be completed in the next week or so are we in the tesla trial or the twitter trial mr musk wondered at one point casting a quick glance at chancellor kathaleen st jude mccormick the leonard l williams justice centre in wilmington delaware matt rourke ap ms mccormick also presided over a lawsuit that twitter filed against mr musk earlier this year to force him to carry through with his agreement to acquire the social media giant ms mccormick dismissed that suit this week after mr musk completed the deal subsequently declaring himself to be chief twit mr musk also downplayed the notion that his friendships with certain tesla board members including sometimes holidaying together mean that they were likely to do his bidding he said holiday was perhaps too strong a word for such time he spent with directors for me it was email with a view he said the tesla lawsuit alleges that the performance based stock option grant was negotiated by the compensation committee and approved by tesla board members who had conflicts of interest due to personal and professional ties to mr musk including investments in his companies it also alleges the shareholder vote approving the compensation plan was based on a misleading proxy statement the shareholder plaintiff alleges that the proxy wrongly described members of the compensation committee as independent and characterised all of the milestones that triggered vesting in the stock options as stretch goals meant to be difficult to achieve even though internal projections indicated that three operational milestones were likely to be achieved within 18 months of the stockholder vote elon musk seated in the rear of the car arrives at the leonard l williams justice centre in wilmington delaware matt rourke ap lawyers for the defendants have noted that two institutional proxy advising firms that urged shareholders to reject the plan nevertheless noted that it would require significant and perhaps historic achievements and require growth that appear stretching by any benchmark the plan called for mr musk to reap billions if tesla hit certain market capitalisation and operational milestones for each incidence of simultaneously meeting a market cap milestone and an operational milestone mr musk who owned about 22 of tesla when the plan was approved would get stock equal to 1 of outstanding shares at the time of the grant his interest in the company would grow to about 28 if the company s market capitalisation grew by 600 billion dollars 505 billion each milestone in the plan includes growing tesla s market capitalisation by 50 billion dollars 42 billion and meeting aggressive revenue and pre tax profit growth targets mr musk would receive the full benefit of the pay plan 55 8 billion dollars 46 7 billion only if tesla hit a market capitalisation of 650 billion dollars 547 billion and unprecedented revenue and earnings within a decade to date tesla has achieved all 12 of the market capitalisation milestones and 11 operational milestones resulting in the vesting of 11 of the grant s 12 tranches and providing mr musk with more than 52 4 billion dollars 44 1 billion in stock option gains according to the lawsuit since the grant was awarded tesla s market capitalisation has increased from 59 billion dollars 49 7 billion to more than 613 billion dollars 516 billion now having briefly hit one trillion dollars early this year document boxes including some with elon musk s name printed on them are taken into the leonard l williams justice centre in wilmington delaware matt rourke ap mr musk has sold tesla stock to finance the twitter purchase adding downward pressure on the shares shares of tesla and other carmakers have been battered this year but the austin texas company earned 5 5 billion dollars 4 6 billion in 2021 blowing away the previous year s profit of 721 million dollars 607 million it also produced a record 936 000 vehicles nearly double vehicle production in 2020 lawyers for the plaintiff have suggested that incentivising mr musk to remain at tesla s helm by offering a huge compensation package was unnecessary because he has never suggested that he might leave they have also suggested that mr musk s true motive in negotiating the package was to fund his dream to colonise mars in a november 2017 email to former tesla general counsel todd maron mr musk expressed optimism that the compensation package would be seen in a favourable light given that this will all go to causes that at least aspirationally maximise the probability of a good future for humanity plus all tesla shareholders will be super happy i think this will be received well he wrote adding that it should come across as an ultra bullish view of the future while in the witness box mr musk also said that he does not want to be the chief executive of any company i expect to reduce my time at twitter and find somebody else to run twitter over time mr musk said according to multiple media reports

share from operating revenues of 550 million for the quarter ended june 30 2022 the net income per diluted share for the fourth and third quarters of fiscal year 2022 include 0 03 and 0 11 of after tax losses respectively comprised of select items 2 for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2022 select items 2 were comprised of for fiscal year 2022 the company reported net income of 7 million or 0 05 per diluted share from operating revenues of 2 1 billion the net income per diluted share includes 0 05 of after tax losses comprised of select items 2 net cash provided by operating activities was 234 million in fiscal year 2022 compared to 136 million in fiscal year 2021 president and ceo john lindsay commented supportive market conditions and our adherence to our business and capital allocation strategy have led to sequentially improving quarterly results in fiscal 2022 we are beginning to recognize economic returns at levels that we have not experienced since 2014 as such we believe there is significant momentum heading into fiscal 2023 and we plan to continue a posture of fiscal discipline move forward with our supplemental shareholder return plan and further implement our strategic initiative to expand internationally these actions align with the company s history of financial stewardship by increasing the company s financial returns through long term investment in the business and increasing cash returns to shareholders through the augmentation of our long standing dividend commitment customer demand during the fourth fiscal quarter was satisfied by contractual churn and by reactivating one rig out of stack early in the quarter as expected our financial results improved substantially quarter over quarter as pricing increases and better contract economics took hold across more of our flexrig fleet we anticipate a modest 16 rig uplift in our nas rig count in fiscal 2023 of which roughly two thirds are already committed and to attain a maximum of 192 active rigs for fiscal 2023 sometime during the second fiscal quarter of 2023 as in prior years we expect our 2023 rig adds to be weighted toward the front half of the fiscal year and do anticipate experiencing additional contractual churn throughout the year we expect our financial results for the first fiscal quarter of 2023 to follow the improving trend of the past two fiscal quarters where strong demand from customers coupled with rollovers of term contracts should continue to drive higher average levels of pricing across the active fleet for our international solutions segment the company plans to deploy capital in preparation for more substantive growth in the future we are seeing opportunities to bid in areas of existing operations as well as in countries that would be new to h p most of these tenders are taking place where unconventional drilling is in its nascent stages such as in the middle east and where we believe our proven drilling solutions can provide a lot of value to customers we believe our international business is an important avenue of growth for the future and serves as a potential outlet for some of our currently idle super spec rigs in the u s this initiative also adds more diversification to the company s revenue streams over the long term and this current allocation of investment capital plays an important part in executing on this strategy senior vice president and cfo mark smith also commented maintaining economic discipline in our capital intensive business remains paramount and has resulted in increased capital efficiency and a positive impact on our financial returns the company will continue to allocate capital with this mindset our north america solutions direct margins continue to improve led by our fiscal discipline and robust pricing despite the current inflationary and supply chain challenges which have been more apparent as of late with a labor related cost increase just at the end of the fiscal fourth quarter and in our recently announced fiscal 2023 capex budget reflecting higher levels of maintenance expenditures looking out to fiscal 2023 we expect to see increased profitability for the company propelling us forward to execute on other strategic capital allocation priorities such as the recently announced 2023 supplemental shareholder return plan and diversification through further investment in our international operations we believe both provide incremental returns one that is more near term and one that will develop over time even beyond these planned capital commitments the company should have flexibility to be positioned to take advantage of additional investment opportunities and or further augment shareholder returns through additional supplemental dividends and or share repurchases essentially in fiscal 2023 we plan to allocate roughly two thirds of our cash flow generation after capex commitments to shareholders in the form of base and supplemental dividends which would currently represent an approximate dividend yield of 4 very competitive for our industry the remaining one third we believe should give us an adequate amount of flexibility this is further testament to the company s strong cash flow generation and financial position john lindsay concluded we enter fiscal 2023 with momentum and increased confidence that our initiatives in our north america solutions segment have gained traction and are delivering positive financial results we are also excited by the prospects and opportunities before us particularly in our international solutions segment the successes the company has achieved and plans to achieve would not be possible without our devoted and hard working employee base which i am proud to say continues to set the standard for our industry operating segment results for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2022 north america solutions this segment had operating income of 92 1 million compared to operating income of 57 4 million during the previous quarter the increase in operating income was primarily due to improving contract economics as market pricing continued to increase coupled with term contracts rolling onto market rates direct margins 3 increased by 35 9 million to 203 5 million as both revenues and expenses increased sequentially quarterly operating results were impacted by the costs associated with reactivating rigs 7 5 million in the fourth fiscal quarter compared to 6 5 million in the previous quarter international solutions this segment had an operating loss of 0 8 million compared to an operating loss of 6 6 million during the previous quarter the decrease in operating loss is primarily attributable to increased activity in latin america particularly with operations in argentina

operating income loss for all segments is a non gaap financial measure of the company s performance as it excludes gain on sale of assets corporate selling general and administrative expenses corporate restructuring charges and corporate depreciation the company considers segment operating income loss to be an important supplemental measure of operating performance for presenting trends in the company s core businesses this measure is used by the company to facilitate period to period comparisons in operating performance of the company s reportable segments in the aggregate by eliminating items that affect comparability between periods the company believes that segment operating income loss is useful to investors because it provides a means to evaluate the operating performance of the segments and the company on an ongoing basis using criteria that are used by our internal decision makers additionally it highlights operating trends and aids analytical comparisons however segment operating income has limitations and should not be used as an alternative to operating income or loss a performance measure determined in accordance with gaap as it excludes certain costs that may affect the company s operating performance in future periods the following table reconciles operating income loss per the information above to income loss from continuing operations

information at the end of this press release press release 16 november 2022 23 15 sdiptech ab publ completes a directed share issue and raises proceeds of sek 506 million sdiptech ab publ sdiptech or the company has completed a directed share issue of 2 2 million b shares at a price of sek 230 per share the directed share issue through the directed share issue the company will receive gross proceeds of sek 506 million the subscription price has been determined through an accelerated book building procedure performed by abg sundal collier ab and joh berenberg gossler co kg the joint global coordinators and joint bookrunners the directed share issue was heavily oversubscribed a number of swedish and international institutional investors participated including skandia handelsbanken fonder swedbank robur fonder and cliens kapitalförvaltning the directed share issue of 2 2 million b shares was carried out with deviation from the existing shareholders preferential right after a resolution by the board of directors based on the authorisation granted by the annual general meeting held on 18 may 2022 the directed share issue was subscribed by swedish and international investors which included among others skandia handelsbanken fonder swedbank robur fonder and cliens kapitalförvaltning the subscription price in the directed share issue was determined through an accelerated book building procedure lead by the joint global coordinators and joint bookrunners the subscription price corresponds to a discount of 6 9 versus the issue day s closing price of sek 247 00 through the directed share issue sdiptech will receive gross proceeds of sek 506 million the company intends to use the proceeds to provide sdiptech with greater flexibility to execute on its strong near and medium term m a pipeline the m a pipeline currently includes 12 potential acquisitions in late stage discussions with a total revenue on a yearly basis of approximately sek 1 billion and an ebita margin of at least 15 sdiptech has acquired six companies so far in 2022 adding sek 135 million in ebita for 2022 and sek 185 million since 1 october 2021 compared to sdiptech s financial target of acquired sek 120 150 million in ebita per year with the recent acquisitions of patol ltd and linesense fire detection ltd building on the company s strong track record the board of directors believes there is a clear opportunity for sdiptech to continue to leverage its position in the market with its acquisition strategy targeting high quality businesses that increase the company s scale service offerings and capabilities and can accelerate growth after the directed share issue the total number of shares in sdiptech will increase by 2 200 000 to 39 551 348 divided between 1 750 000 preference shares 2 000 000 a shares and 35 801 348 b shares and the share capital will increase by sek 55 000 to sek 988 783 70 the directed share issue entails a dilution of 5 6 of the total number of shares and 3 8 of the total number of votes for existing shareholders based on the total number of shares in the company after the directed share issue the board of directors is of the opinion that the proceeds contribute to a good balance of different financing sources and that the directed share issue is positive for sdiptech s capital structure and general risk level prior to the directed share issue sdiptech has also considered the possibility to raise the required equity through a rights issue the board of directors of the company has thereby concluded that a rights issue would be significantly more time consuming and entail significantly higher costs and increased exposure to potential market volatility compared to the directed share issue unlike a rights issue the directed share issue has also broadened the shareholder base and provided the company with new reputable institutional owners which the board of directors considers to be of benefit to sdiptech and the general liquidity in the share in the light of the above the board of directors has made the assessment that a directed share issue with deviation from the shareholders preferential rights was the most favorable alternative for sdiptech and in the best interest of the company s shareholders as the subscription price in the directed share issue was determined through a bookbuilding procedure the board of directors assesses that the subscription price reflects current market conditions and demand in connection with the directed share issue the company has undertaken with customary exceptions not to issue additional shares for a period of 180 calendar days after closing of the directed share issue board members and persons of the management holding shares and or warrants have undertaken not to sell any shares in the company for a period of 60 calendar days after closing of the directed share issue with customary exceptions advisors abg sundal collier ab and joh berenberg gossler co

western new yorkers are finding out the hard way that we should have prepared a little earlier for the winter storm coming our way get our free mobile app get our free mobile app stores all over the buffalo area are either completely out of rock salt or have very little of it left in stock rock salt also called road salt is just halite the mineral form of sodium chloride and it s been a go to here in western new york for years for keeping our highways streets and sidewalks less slippery during bad winter weather according to the epa rock salt is inexpensive and effective at melting snow and ice but the downside of rock salt can be substantial even though it s relatively harmless to us when rock salt is used in large quantities it can have corrosive effects that can damage cars trucks bridges and roads over time resulting in approximately 5 billion dollars in annual repairs just in the united states alone yikes so maybe it s not such a bad thing if your store is out of rock salt but it can still be a pain if you need to de ice your driveways and sidewalks what can you use instead to make the outside of your home less slippery calcium chloride youtube canva calcium chloride is a great alternative to rock salt if you can get your hands on it it is more effective at melting ice due to it absorbing water so quickly and it won t harm your pets plants driveway or sidewalk that being said you have to store it with an incredibly tight seal so it doesn t dry out and it can leave a residue also it may be tough to find here in western new york this close to a snowstorm kitty litter or sand canva your cat s bathroom or your kid s summertime sandpit can provide some decent traction to make your driveway and sidewalk less slippery but it won t actually melt the ice also you ll most likely track it inside your house with your shoes and you ll need to sweep it up once the weather gets nicer to keep it from making a mess that being said it can be an alternative to use in a pinch to make the area around your house safer for your neighbors and family coffee grounds canva coffee grounds can also provide some traction to help you not slip on your concrete surfaces and their dark color can help attract the sun to melt more ice however you ll need a lot of coffee grounds to make it effective which can be expensive and really messy to clean up afterward it will probably smell great though beet juice canva we re sure this is the ice melting method that dwight schrute uses beet juice or beet brine can lower the freezing point of water to 20 degrees helping to keep spots slick free it also won t harm any plants or wildlife it will make a stained red mess however and the salt in beet brine can damage cars and roads in large quantities heated mats amazon canva if you ve only got a small area you need to keep ice free now might be the time to invest in a heated mat like this one from amazon it plugs into an outdoor outlet doesn t make a mess and can be used on different surfaces like concrete asphalt stone and wood decks this western new york snowstorm is sure to create a big mess for many buffalo area homeowners but if you re scrambling to find the things you need to stay safe and combat the ice hopefully one of these alternatives can work for you
bremerton at any given moment around a dozen atom splitting nuclear reactors abut the kitsap peninsula nuclear energy gives limitless range to aircraft carriers like the bremerton based uss nimitz to traverse the world s oceans it also gives the 13 submarines homeported here the ability to perpetually stay under the waves on their own deployments but that nuclear power stays at sea while it s unlikely that power will ever come to shore in kitsap many of the sailors who operate those reactors go on to jobs in the nuclear industry and navy nukes as they re known are a valuable commodity as nuclear power is increasingly eyed as a renewable energy source amid a climate crisis we ve been very happy with the candidates the navy is continuing to send us says russ long operations manager of the columbia generating station washington state s lone nuclear power plant of the plant s 900 or so workers 30 are former military and many of those are retired navy nukes long said that includes the plant s ceo and long himself it s a familiar story across the country at the 55 nuclear power plants that operate across 28 states long who grew up in tennessee spent six years in the navy including being stationed at naval base kitsap and helping decommission the uss tunny a sturgeon class fast attack submarine at the puget sound naval shipyard some friends told him about the energy northwest nuclear power plant which was recruiting for entry level equipment operators he hopped the cascade mountains and has been there ever since rising through the ranks to become the plant s operations manager his navy experience with know how of nuclear reactors was invaluable when i showed up i thought like a submariner he said roots of the nuclear navy navy deployments on nuclear powered subs and aircraft carriers are routine but that fact belies just how audacious it was when pioneered under hyman g rickover the father of the nuclear navy rickover and his team provided the navy with a new seemingly limitless power source first with the launch of the uss nautilus in 1954 the first nuclear powered aircraft carrier the uss enterprise followed in 1960 with its own commissioning in the time since the naval nuclear propulsion program has safely steamed more than 166 million miles on board dozens of vessels overseen by more than 142 000 nuclear propulsion plant operators many like larry sloan have gone on to jobs at nuclear power plants you just cannot beat the training said sloan a navy veteran who has worked at a nuclear power plant in pennsylvania for 35 years there s just no organization no university that can provide you the experience the nuclear reactor can the licensed reactor operator was one of the first sailors to serve on the bangor based uss ohio ballistic missile submarine when he went to work in the civilian nuclear industry he found himself surrounded by fellow navy nukes in his orientation class region unlikely to host a plant anytime soon as the nation steers toward a clean energy economy nuclear power has become a flashpoint of the climate crisis atomically produced energy to some is a perilous and costly risk that resurrects nightmares from the fukushima daiichi nuclear power plant in japan or the chernobyl nuclear power plant in soviet russia to others it is a power savior that produces no greenhouse gas emissions though they do make some radioactive waste but in terms of human health there s no comparison fossil fuel power plants caused more than one million deaths in a year according to a scientific study released in 2021 by nature communications nuclear by contrast caused almost no deaths including to those working in the industry itself its workplace is more than a thousand times safer than any other fossil fuel according to forbes using data from the u s department of labor there was a time when washington s utilities banded together to go nuclear in a big way the washington legislature created the washington public power supply system in the late 1950s in an effort to build nuclear plants in hanford and at satsop in grays harbor county colossal cost overruns and concerns about nuclear power slowly eroded the plan leading to a 2 25 billion bankruptcy the largest default in the history of the municipal bond market the entity became known colloquially as whoops but the more recently renamed energy northwest did complete one power plant the columbia generating station joel myer a longtime washington energy industry observer who served for decades as spokesman of the mason county pud 3 said one benefit that came out of the whoops debacle was the relationship between power utilities and customers grew closer utilities had to find ways of conserving power rather than producing more and began educating customers to limit use myer thinks it s unlikely nuclear power will ever come to western washington but he sees its potential use growing in places where it s already been established including in eastern washington in other parts of the country people are used to it he said they re also far more dependent on fossil fuels and are looking to alternatives that don t produce greenhouse gases more navy news gull poop was piling up at a u s submarine homeport so the navy unleashed hawks to help safe predictable and reliable power today energy northwest s plant 10 miles north of richland attempts to provide balance in its hiring a bond with the local community including columbia basin college ensures a stream of locally grown talent but there s no denying the navy s ongoing impact on the workforce not every nuclear reactor is the same and there is a learning curve even for navy nukes the navy uses what are called pressurized water reactors or pwrs whereas energy northwest s is a boiling water reactor or bwr within the eastern washington land based power plant the energy released by splitting uranium atoms heats up water turning it to directly generate steam that drives a turbine the submarines of the navy by contrast have reactors whose pressurized water travels past those splitting atoms and the subsequent heat generated is transported to a secondary system cycle of lower pressure water the result though is the same that heat is used to boil water and turn a steam turbine the plant is committed to hiring a mix of experiences operations manager long noted but because of their skillset veterans of the nuclear navy have an opportunity to emerge as leaders from the get go the reason there s a shock and awe period for those who ve never worked supporting a nuclear reactor long said our military hires who get to demonstrate leadership by teaching the others who haven t that s tremendously valuable to us he said the nuclear plant can churn out a safe predictable and reliable source of power long said even more critical is the consistency of the supply wind doesn t always blow to turn windmills and the sun doesn t always shine to generate solar electricity other than hydropower nuclear is thus far the only consistent power source that doesn t produce greenhouse gas emissions the plant is capable of churning out 1 200 megawatts of power roughly a tenth of all generation produced in the state it s the only nuclear power plant in washington and one of the few in the american west and it will continue to provide power in the state for decades to come this story has been changed since it was first published to correct the percentage of energy northwest s workers that are former military read more from the powering the

up to 47 0 million the standard chartered 47 0 million facility the facility will be available in two tranches and will be used to refinance the outstanding amounts under the loan agreements of each of the star marisa and the star laetitia the two tranches are expected to be drawn by the end of the fourth quarter of 2022 and will mature 5 years after the drawdown the standard chartered 47 0 million facility will be secured by first priority mortgages on the two vessels the financing arrangements discussed here contain financial and other covenants substantially similar to those covenants described in item 5 of the 2021 annual report for our credit facilities following the completion of the 402 6 million refinancings that we have performed during 2022 we will have 13 unlevered vessels we have extended the average maturity of our outstanding facilities from 3 6 to 4 5 years and we expect to save approximately 4 9 million per year in interest costs from more competitive margins as of today following a number of interest rates swaps we have entered into we have an outstanding total notional amount of 754 7 million under our financing agreements with average fixed rate of 46 bps and with average maturity of 1 4 years as of october 31 2022 the mark to market of our outstanding interest rate swaps stood at 37 2 million the above interest rate swaps are designated and qualify for hedge accounting vessel employment overview time charter equivalent rate tce rate is a non gaap measure please see exhibit i at the end of this release for a reconciliation to voyage revenues which is the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with u s gaap for the third quarter of 2022 our tce rate was capesize newcastlemax vessels 25 418 per day post panamax kamsarmax panamax vessels 21 932 per day ultramax supramax vessels 26 155 per day for the first nine months of 2022 our tce rate was capesize newcastlemax vessels 27 294 per day post panamax kamsarmax panamax vessels 26 249 per day ultramax supramax vessels 28 533 per day amounts shown throughout the press release and variations in period on period comparisons are derived from the actual unaudited numbers in our books and records reference to per share figures below are based on 102 541 314 and 102 525 065 weighted average diluted shares for the third quarter of 2022 and 2021 respectively third quarter 2022 and 2021 results for the third quarter of 2022 we had a net income of 109 7 million or 1 07 earnings per share compared to a net income for the third quarter of 2021 of 220 4 million or 2 15 earnings per share adjusted net income which excludes certain non cash items was 136 3 million or 1 33 earnings per share for the third quarter of 2022 compared to an adjusted net income of 224 7 million for the third quarter of 2021 or 2 19 earnings per share net cash provided by operating activities for the third quarter of 2022 was 184 5 million compared to 251 0 million for the third quarter of 2021 adjusted ebitda which excludes certain non cash items was 189 9 million for the third quarter of 2022 compared to 277 8 million for the third quarter of 2021 voyage revenues for the third quarter of 2022 decreased to 364 1 million from 415 7 million in the third quarter of 2021 and time charter equivalent revenues tce revenues 1 were 266 7 million for the third quarter of 2022 compared to 349 3 million for the third quarter of 2021 tce rate for the third quarter of 2022 was 24 365 compared to 30 626 for the third quarter of 2021 which is indicative of the weaker market conditions prevailing during the recent quarter our results for the third quarter of 2022 include a loss on write down of inventories of 14 9 million resulting from the valuation of the bunkers remaining on board our vessels following the substantial decrease of bunkers net realizable value compared to their historical cost for the third quarters of 2022 and 2021 vessel operating expenses were 60 1 million and 54 1 million respectively vessel operating expenses for the third quarter of 2022 included additional crew expenses related to the increased number and cost of crew changes performed during the period as a result of covid 19 related restrictions estimated to be 1 9 million in addition during the third quarter of 2022 we incurred 2 1 million of additional operating expenses due to change of management of certain vessels from third party to in house vessel operating expenses for the third quarter of 2021 included covid 19 related expenses of 2 8 million and pre delivery and pre joining expenses of 0 6 million excluding non recurring expenses such as increased costs due to the covid 19 pandemic exceptional operating expenses due to change of management and pre delivery and pre joining expenses our daily operating expenses per vessel for the third quarters of 2022 and 2021 were 4 769 and 4 304 respectively this increase was driven by the higher repair and maintenance costs incurred due to the preventive maintenance program of our fleet ensuring quality service to our clients and minimizing off hire time as well as inflationary pressure on the cost of materials and services worldwide drydocking expenses for the third quarter of 2022 and 2021 were 9 8 million and 5 1 million respectively during the third quarter of 2022 8 vessels mainly newcatlemaxes and capesizes completed their periodic dry docking surveys while during the corresponding period in 2021 6 vessels mainly supramaxes completed their periodic dry docking surveys general and administrative expenses for the third quarters of 2022 and 2021 were 18 4 million and 12 8 million respectively primarily due to the increase in the stock based compensation expense to 11 9 million from 6 1 million vessel management fees for the third quarters of 2022 and 2021 were 4 9 million our daily net cash general and administrative expenses per vessel including management fees and excluding share based compensation and other non cash charges for the third quarters of 2022 and 2021 were 950 and 987 respectively interest and finance costs for the third quarters of 2022 and 2021 were 13 4 million and 13 8 million respectively the driving factor for this variation is the decrease of the weighted average outstanding indebtedness which was partly offset by the increase in libor rates we incurred interest and other income of 0 2 million in the third quarter of 2022 and interest and other loss of 1 0 million in the third quarter of 2021 this variation is mainly due to higher interest earned from fixed deposits during the third quarter of 2022 compared to that earned in the corresponding period in 2021 counterbalanced by the higher exchange losses in the third quarter of 2022 ______________________________1 please see the table at the end of this release for the calculation of the tce revenues unaudited consolidated income statements expressed

our owned fleet during the period divided by the number of calendar days in that period 2 as of the last day of the periods reported 3 average age of our operational fleet is calculated as of the end of each period 4 ownership days are the total calendar days each vessel in the fleet was owned by us for the relevant period including vessels subject to sale and leaseback transactions and finance leases 5 available days for the fleet are the ownership days after subtracting off hire days for major repairs dry docking or special or intermediate surveys change of management days and for vessels improvements and upgrades the available days for each period presented were also decreased by off hire days relating to disruptions in connection with crew changes as a result of the covid 19 pandemic our method of computing available days may not necessarily be comparable to available days of other companies 6 charter in days are the total days that we charter in vessels not owned by us 7 time charter equivalent rate represents the weighted average daily tce rates of our operating fleet including owned fleet and fleet under charter in arrangements tce rate is a measure of the average daily net revenue performance of our vessels our method of calculating tce rate is determined by dividing a tce revenues which consists of voyage revenues net of voyage expenses charter in hire expense amortization of fair value of above below market acquired time charter agreements if any as well as adjusted for the impact of realized gain loss on forward freight agreements ffas and bunker swaps by b available days for the relevant time period available days do not include the charter in days as per the relevant definitions provided above voyage expenses primarily consist of port canal and fuel costs that are unique to a particular voyage which would otherwise be paid by the charterer under a time charter contract as well as commissions in the calculation of tce revenues we also include the realized gain loss on ffas and bunker swaps as we believe that this method better reflects the chartering result of our fleet and is more comparable to the method used by our peers tce revenues and tce rate which are non gaap measures provide additional meaningful information in conjunction with voyage revenues the most directly comparable gaap measure because they assist our management in making decisions regarding the deployment and use of our vessels and because we believe that they provide useful information to investors regarding our financial performance tce rate is a standard shipping industry performance measure used primarily to compare period to period changes in a shipping company s performance despite changes in the mix of charter types i e voyage charters time charters bareboat charters and pool arrangements under which its vessels may be employed between the periods our method of computing tce revenues and tce rate may not necessarily be comparable to those of other companies for a detailed calculation please see exhibit i at the end of this release with the reconciliation of voyage revenues to tce 8 daily opex per vessel is calculated by dividing vessel operating expenses by ownership days daily opex per vessel excluding non recurring expenses is calculated by dividing vessel operating expenses minus any non recurring expenses or other additional expenses due to conditions outside of the company s control such as pre delivery expenses for each vessel at acquisition or at change of management or increased costs due to the covid 19 pandemic if any by ownership days we exclude non recurring expenses that may occur occasionally from our daily opex per vessel since these generally represent items that we would not anticipate occurring as part of our normal business on a regular basis we believe that daily opex per vessel excluding non recurring expenses is a useful measure for our management and investors for period to period comparison with respect to our operating cost performance since such measure eliminates the effects of non recurring items which may vary from period to period are not part of our daily business and derive from reasons unrelated to overall operating performance in the future we may incur expenses that are the same as or similar to certain non recurring expenses that were previously excluded vessel operating expenses for the nine month period ended september 30 2022 and 2021 included additional crew expenses related to the increased number of crew changes performed during the period as a result of covid 19 restrictions imposed in 2020 estimated to be 7 5 million and 5 8 million respectively while vessel operating expenses for the nine month period ended september 30 2021 included pre delivery and pre joining expenses of 3 0 million nil in 2022 lastly during the nine month period of 2022 we incurred 3 2 million of additional operating expenses due to change of management of certain vessels from third party to in house 9 please see exhibit i at the end of this release for the reconciliation to general and administrative expenses the most directly comparable gaap measure we believe that daily net cash g a expenses per vessel is a useful measure for our management and investors for period to period comparison with respect to our financial performance since such measure eliminates the effects of non cash items which may vary from period to period are not part of our daily business and derive from reasons unrelated to overall operating performance exhibit i non gaap financial measures ebitda and adjusted ebitda reconciliation we include ebitda herein since it is a basis upon which we assess our liquidity position it is also used by our lenders as a measure of our compliance with certain loan covenants and we believe that it presents useful information to investors regarding our ability to service and or incur indebtedness to derive adjusted ebitda from ebitda we exclude non cash gains losses such as those related to sale of vessels share based compensation expense impairment loss loss from bad debt change in fair value of forward freight agreements and bunker swaps and the equity in income loss of investee and other non cash charges if any which may vary from period to period and for different companies and because these items do not reflect operational cash inflows and outflows of our fleet ebitda and adjusted ebitda do not represent and should not be considered as alternatives to cash flow from operating activities or net income

in early october yan xiaonan and mackenzie dern two prized ufc fighters entered the 25 foot octagon ring at the las vegas apex arena to pummel each other for the women s strawweight match but unlike the countless previous fights that have taken place in the arena which is often filled with hundreds of raucous fans this time the 130 000 square foot space was eerily quiet as cameras panned around the arena almost all of the seats sat empty with the exception of a select few right at the edge of the octagon were mark zuckerberg and his wife priscilla chan it seems that at some point during the pandemic zuckerberg had been drawn into ufc fighting and the multibillionaire founder of facebook wanted to experience one of these fights in person but rather than just buy two tickets to see a fight like most normal people would even normal ultrarich people zuckerberg apparently afraid of other human beings rented out the entire arena according to dern a claim ufc chief dana white denied being exorbitantly rich powerful and famous affects people differently in hollywood celebrities get implants and abdominoplasty surgeries and ribs removed so they can stay beautiful forever in the fashion world the more money and accolades a famed designer receives the more their own sense of style resembles a clown at the circus just look at rick owens who now dresses like a bat but the folks in technoland do something entirely different the more money and fame they get the more they retreat into an insular world where they don t interact with us commoners they fly on their private jets away from the normals they live in homes worth hundreds of millions of dollars and in zuckerberg s case reportedly buy nearby homes so they don t have to interact with neighbors and perhaps strangest of all they surround themselves with sycophants in their own work environment and even live in their own form of digital feudalism online rarely interacting with people outside their immediate bubble for zuckerberg the decision to keep himself insulated from the rest of the world has cost him dearly his troubles really started a year ago when he decided it was time to rebrand facebook which was approaching 18 years old and he announced that he was now renaming the company meta along with the name change zuckerberg said the company s direction was going to morph too from now on we will be metaverse first not facebook first zuckerberg said during a nearly 75 minute presentation at the time as he wandered through his offices facebook is one of the most used products in the world but increasingly it doesn t encompass everything that we do the metaverse he believed was the future the problem is as everyone surmised at the time and still does today no one wants to live in the metaverse they don t want to go to meetings in a virtual coffee shop on the moon they don t want to go on dates dressed as a digital porcupine on a virtual beach with a pink ocean and they don t want to exercise in a virtual outdoor space with their friends who live down the block if the pandemic taught us anything it was that technology enables us to connect when we have no other way to reach people but in reality in person connections are way more impactful and important than a digital genus people want to experience real things now more than ever and most importantly they want to experience real people zuckerberg as his trip to the apex arena in las vegas illustrates so perfectly doesn t seem to want to be around real people in fact it appears that he s kind of afraid of them i m sure if meta had released the metaverse in the height of the pandemic it would have been a more important advancement than zoom but as the packed restaurants and full to the brim hotels and overbooked flights illustrate we are no longer in the height of a pandemic since that announcement it s honestly staggering to see the impact this decision has had on the company in september of 2021 a few weeks before zuckerberg announced the name and direction change of facebook the company was worth just over 1 trillion dollars a little over a year later the company s value had fallen to a vertiginous low of 236 billion that s a fall of more than 840 billion in value in a single year to put that into perspective the company s worth fell by about the equivalent of today s combined value of ibm cvs goldman sachs charles schwab netflix twitter and at t all in a single year in october the wall street journal citing internal documents noted that meta s metaverse called horizon worlds has seen paltry adoption by users meta initially set a goal of reaching 500 000 monthly active users for horizon worlds by the end of this year the journal wrote but in recent weeks revised that figure to 280 000 the current tally is less than 200 000 most visitors it turns out go into horizon worlds and then don t return to the app after the first month according to the journal

flow and capital allocation hillenbrand generated cash flow from operations of 191 million in the year a decrease of 337 million year over year primarily due to the unfavorable timing of working capital related to large plastics projects and an increase in inventory due to higher customer demand and supply chain disruptions during the year the company repurchased approximately 4 8 million

term loan facility including the debt incurred for acquiring linxis shortly after year end liquidity would be approximately 555 million acquisitions update as previously announced we completed the

division of illinois tool works inc for a purchase price of 59 million subject to customary post closing adjustments peerless a premier supplier of industrial food processing equipment is highly complementary to certain linxis brands and has expected cy2022 revenue of approximately 30 million with adjusted ebitda margin in line with that of our advanced process solutions segment the

impacts from the uncertain global macroeconomic environment and continued headwinds from supply chain disruption inflation and foreign currency exchange we are not assuming any impact from potential

financial statements on form 10 k are filed jointly with this release and will be made available on the company s website in addition to the financial measures prepared in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles gaap this earnings release also contains non gaap operating performance measures these non gaap measures are referred to as adjusted measures and exclude the following items business acquisition disposition and integration costs restructuring and restructuring related charges intangible asset amortization certain debt financing activities gains and losses on divestitures other individually immaterial one time costs the related income tax impact for all of these items and certain tax items related to the acquisition of milacron and divestitures of terrasource abel red valve and cimcool the revaluation of deferred tax balances in connection with enacted statutory tax rate reductions in certain foreign jurisdictions foreign income inclusion tax provisions including the impact the milacron loss carryforward attributes have on tax provisions related to the imposition of tax on global intangible low taxed income gilti earned by certain foreign subsidiaries the foreign derived intangible income deduction fdii and the base erosion and anti abuse tax beat refer to the reconciliation of non gaap measures for further information on these adjustments non gaap information is provided as a supplement to not as a substitute for or as superior to measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with gaap hillenbrand uses this non gaap information internally to measure operating segment performance and make operating decisions and believes it is helpful to investors because it allows more meaningful period to period comparisons of ongoing operating results the information can also be used to perform trend analysis and to better identify operating trends that may otherwise be masked or distorted by items such as the above excluded items hillenbrand believes this information provides a higher degree of transparency one important non gaap measure hillenbrand uses is adjusted earnings before interest income tax depreciation and amortization adjusted ebitda a part of our strategy is to pursue acquisitions that strengthen or establish leadership positions in key markets given that strategy it is a natural consequence to incur related expenses such as amortization from acquired intangible assets and additional interest expense from debt funded acquisitions accordingly we use adjusted ebitda among other measures to monitor our business performance we also use adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share eps which are defined as net income and earnings per share respectively each excluding items described in connection with adjusted ebitda adjusted ebitda adjusted net income and adjusted diluted eps are not recognized terms under gaap and therefore do not purport to be alternatives to net income or to diluted eps as applicable further hillenbrand s measures of adjusted ebitda adjusted net income and adjusted diluted eps may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies pro forma revenue and pro forma adjusted ebitda are defined respectively as net revenue and adjusted ebitda excluding net revenue and adjusted ebitda directly attributable to red valve which was divested on december 31 2020 abel which was divested on march 10 2021 and terrasource which was divested on october 22 2021 hillenbrand uses pro forma measures to assess performance of its reportable operating segments and the company in total without the impact of recent acquisitions and divestitures hillenbrand calculates the foreign currency impact on net revenue in order to better measure the comparability of results between periods we calculate the foreign currency impact by translating current year results at prior year foreign exchange rates this information is provided because exchange rates can distort the underlying change in sales either positively or negatively another important operational measure used is backlog backlog is not a term recognized under gaap however it is a common measurement used in industries with extended lead times for order fulfillment long term contracts like those in which the advanced process solutions and molding technology solutions reportable operating segments compete backlog represents the amount of consolidated net revenue that we expect to realize on contracts awarded to the advanced process solutions and molding technology solutions reportable operating segments for purposes of calculating backlog 100 of estimated net revenue attributable to consolidated subsidiaries is included backlog includes expected net revenue from large systems and equipment as well as aftermarket parts components and service the length of time that projects remain in backlog can span from days for aftermarket parts or service to approximately 18 to 24 months for larger system sales within the advanced process solutions reportable operating segment the majority of the backlog within the molding technology solutions reportable operating segment is expected to be fulfilled within the next twelve months backlog includes expected net revenue from the remaining portion of firm orders not yet completed as well as net revenue from change orders to the extent that they are reasonably expected to be realized we include in backlog the full contract award including awards subject to further customer approvals which we expect to result in revenue in future periods in accordance with industry practice our contracts may include provisions for cancellation termination or suspension at the discretion of the customer hillenbrand expects that future net revenue associated with the advanced process solutions and molding technology solutions reportable operating segments will be influenced by order backlog because of the lead time involved in fulfilling engineered to order equipment for customers although backlog can be an indicator of future net revenue it does not include projects and parts orders that are booked and shipped within the same quarter the timing of order placement size extent of customization and customer delivery dates can create fluctuations in backlog and net revenue net revenue attributable to backlog may also be affected by foreign exchange fluctuations for orders denominated in currencies other than u s dollars in addition expected calendar year 2022 figures are projections for peerless s fiscal year ending december 31 2022 based on unaudited prospective financial information prepared and provided to the company by peerless peerless s actual results could differ materially from these projections see below for a reconciliation from gaap operating performance measures to the most directly comparable non gaap adjusted performance measures given that backlog is an operational measure and that the company s methodology for calculating backlog does not meet the definition of a non gaap measure as that term is defined by the sec a quantitative reconciliation is not required or provided in addition forward looking adjusted earnings per share for fiscal 2023 excludes potential charges or gains that may be recorded during the fiscal year including among other things expected 2023 results and other items described above in connection with other adjusted measures hillenbrand thus also does not attempt to provide reconciliations of such forward looking non gaap earnings guidance to the comparable gaap measure as permitted by item 10 e 1 i b of regulation s k because the impact and timing of these potential charges or gains is inherently uncertain and difficult to predict and is unavailable without unreasonable efforts in addition the company believes such reconciliations would imply a degree of precision and certainty that could be confusing to investors such items could have a substantial impact on gaap measures of hillenbrand s financial performance hillenbrand inc consolidated statements of operations in millions

financial officer of grindrod shipping commented our results for the third quarter of 2022 were quite strong overall though lower sequentially relative to the second quarter of 2022 as charter rates

continuing operations handysize and supramax ultramax tce per day were 23 257 and 25 645 respectively for the third quarter of 2022 while supply fundamentals have remained intact with a low orderbook persisting due to uncertainty surrounding new engine technology and emissions controls trade demand appears to have softened so far this year in the first half of the year minor bulks were the only major category of drybulk cargoes to remain positive from a cargo growth perspective but they too contracted in the third quarter our vessels continued to outperform the larger drybulk vessel classes during the quarter and year to date periods and have delivered robust free cash flows for the company further strengthening our balance sheet unaudited results for the three months ended september 30 2022 and 2021 continuing operations revenue was 107 2 million for the three months ended september 30 2022 and 135 1 million for the three months ended september 30 2021 vessel revenue was 107 0 million for the three months ended september 30 2022 and 135 0 million for the three months ended september 30 2021 revenue decreased due to weakening market conditions in the drybulk business and a reduction in short term operating days due to the redelivery of the short term vessels that were chartered in during a weaker market and were not extended due to reduced demand for drybulk tonnage brought about by global recession high interest rates and continued shutdowns in china our handysize total revenue and supramax ultramax total revenue was 43 6 million and 63 6 million respectively for the three months ended september 30 2022 and 46 6 million and 87 3 million respectively for the three months ended september 30 2021 handysize vessel revenue and supramax ultramax vessel revenue was 43 5 million and 63 5 million respectively for the three months ended september 30 2022 and 46 5 million and 87 3 million respectively for the three months ended september 30 2021 the results for the three months ended september 30 2022 were negatively impacted by lower tce per day rates achieved in our handysize and supramax ultramax drybulk carrier segments reflecting the weaker spot markets in these segments which was additionally impacted by a reduction in short term operating days handysize tce per day was 23 257 per day for the three months ended september 30 2022 and 25 919 per day for the three months ended september 30 2021 supramax ultramax tce per day was 25 645 per day for the three months ended september 30 2022 and 29 934 per day for the three months ended september 30 2021 cost of sales was 68 7 million for the three months ended september 30 2022 and 73 2 million for the three months ended september 30 2021 the decrease was primarily due to the decrease in short term operating days for supramax ultramax resulting in decreased voyage expenses and short term charter hire expenses our handysize segment and supramax ultramax segment cost of sales was 25 9 million and 43 7 million respectively for the three months ended september 30 2022 and 21 4 million and 52 1 million respectively for the three months ended september 30 2021 handysize voyage expenses and

ended september 30 2022 in comparison to the three months ended september 30 2021 due to crew repatriation that was timed differently to the previous year supramax ultramax vessel operating costs per day were 5 105 per day for the three months ended september 30 2022 and 5 306 per day for the three months ended september 30 2021 vessel operating costs per day decreased for the three months ended september 30 2022 in comparison to the three months ended september 30 2021 due to crew repatriation that was timed differently to the previous year the long term charter in cost per day for our supramax ultramax fleet was 15 039 per day during the three months ended september 30 2022 and 12 858 per day for the three months ended september 30 2021 the increase is due to the extension of a charter agreement at a higher rate in may 2022 during the three months ended september 30 2022 out of 1 861 operating days in the supramax ultramax segment 74 5 were fulfilled with owned long term chartered in vessels and the remaining 25 5 with short term chartered in vessels compared to 2 258 operating days in the supramax ultramax segment 61 6 were fulfilled with owned long term chartered in

administrative expense was 12 5 million for the three months ended september 30 2022 and 10 6 million for the three months ended september 30 2021 the increase was due to the fees associated with the

revenue increased due to improved market conditions in the drybulk business mainly in the first half of the year which was slightly offset by a reduction in short term supramax ultramax operating days

was 235 3 million for the nine months ended september 30 2022 and 203 2 million for the nine months ended september 30 2021 the increase was primarily due to the cost of a ship sold in the first half

is used by management for forecasting making operational and strategic decisions and evaluating current company performance it is also one of the inputs used to calculate the variable amount that will be returned to shareholders in the form of quarterly dividends and or share repurchases adjusted net income is not recognized by ifrs and should not be considered in isolation or used as alternatives to profit for the period or any other indicator of our operating performance our presentation of adjusted net income is intended to supplement investors understanding of our operating performance by providing information regarding our ongoing performance that exclude items we believe do not directly affect our core operations and enhancing the comparability of our ongoing performance across periods we consider adjusted net income to be useful to management and investors because it eliminates items that are unrelated to the overall operating performance and that may vary significantly from period to period identifying these elements will facilitate comparison of our operating performance to the operating performance of our peers the definitions of adjusted net income used by us may not be comparable to similar measures used by other companies the table below presents the reconciliation between adjusted net income for continuing operations to profit for the period attributable to

listen to this article listen to this article wilmington del tesla ceo elon musk took the witness stand wednesday to defend himself in a shareholder lawsuit challenging a compensation package he was awarded by the company s board of directors that is potentially worth more than 55 billion musk denied that he dictated terms of the compensation package or attended any meetings at which the plan was discussed by the board its compensation committee or a working group that helped develop it i was entirely focused on the execution of the company he said plaintiff s attorney greg varallo spent much of his cross examination trying to draw musk into admitting that he controls tesla to such an extent that he can sway the board to do his bidding among other things varallo questioned musk about his title of technoking a role that musk has previously noted comes with panache and great dance moves i think comedy is legal musk told varallo who had questioned whether musk was stone cold sober when he came up with the title varallo also suggested that one of the reasons that musk developed a master plan for tesla was to let people know he was in charge he also noted that musk makes recommendations regarding compensation for senior executives and that he unilaterally made the decision to pause tesla s policy of accepting bitcoin from vehicle purchasers you re asking complex questions that can t be answered yes or no musk said when varallo asked whether he came up with the vision for tesla varallo also questioned musk about how he splits his time among tesla and his other companies including spacex and twitter musk said he never intended to be ceo of tesla and that he didn t want to be chief executive of any other companies either preferring to see himself as an engineer instead musk also said he expects an organizational restructuring of twitter to be completed in the next week or so are we in the tesla trial or the twitter trial musk wondered at one point casting a quick glance at chancellor kathaleen st jude mccormick mccormick also presided over a lawsuit that twitter filed against musk earlier this year to force him to carry through with his agreement to acquire the social media giant mccormick dismissed that lawsuit this week after musk completed the deal subsequently declaring himself to be chief twit musk also downplayed the notion that his friendships with certain tesla board members including sometimes vacationing together mean that they were likely to do his bidding he said vacation was perhaps too strong a word for such time he spent with directors for me it was email with a view he said the tesla lawsuit alleges that the performance based stock option grant was negotiated by the compensation committee and approved by tesla board members who had conflicts interest due to personal and professional ties to musk including investments in his companies it also alleges the shareholder vote approving the compensation plan was based on a misleading proxy statement the shareholder plaintiff alleges that the proxy wrongly described members of the compensation committee as independent and characterized all of the milestones that triggered vesting in the stock options as stretch goals meant to be difficult to achieve even though internal projections indicated that three operational milestones were likely to be achieved within 18 months of the stockholder vote attorneys for the defendants have noted that two institutional proxy advising firms that urged shareholders to reject the plan nevertheless noted that it would require significant and perhaps historic achievements and require growth that appear stretching by any benchmark the plan called for musk to reap billions if tesla hit certain market capitalization and operational milestones for each incidence of simultaneously meeting a market cap milestone and an operational milestone musk who owned about 22 of tesla when the plan was approved would get stock equal to 1 of outstanding shares at the time of the grant his interest in the company would grow to about 28 if the company s market capitalization grew by 600 billion each milestone in the plan includes growing tesla s market capitalization by 50 billion and meeting aggressive revenue and pretax profit growth targets musk would receive the full benefit of the pay plan 55 8 billion only if tesla hit a market capitalization of 650 billion and unprecedented revenue and earnings within a decade to date tesla has achieved all 12 of the market capitalization milestones and 11 operational milestones resulting in the vesting of 11 of the grant s 12 tranches and providing musk over 52 4 billion in stock option gains according to the lawsuit since the grant was awarded tesla s market capitalization has increased from 59 billion to more than 613 billion now having briefly hit 1 trillion early this year musk has sold tesla stock to finance the twitter purchase adding downward pressure on the shares shares of tesla and other automakers have been battered this year but the austin texas company earned 5 5 billion in 2021 blowing away the previous year s profit of 721 million it also produced a record 936 000 vehicles nearly double vehicle production in 2020 attorneys for the plaintiff have suggested that incentivizing musk to remain at tesla s helm by offering a huge compensation package was unnecessary because he s never suggested that he might leave they ve also suggested that musk s true motive in negotiating the package was to fund his dream to colonize mars in a november 2017 email to former tesla general counsel todd maron musk expressed optimism that the compensation package would be seen in a favorable light given that this will all go to causes that at least aspirationally maximize the probability of a good future for humanity plus all tesla shareholders will be super happy i think this will be received well he wrote adding that it should come across as an ultra bullish view of the future while on the stand musk also said that he does not want to be the ceo of any company i expect to reduce my time at twitter and find somebody else to run twitter over time musk said according to multiple media reports
