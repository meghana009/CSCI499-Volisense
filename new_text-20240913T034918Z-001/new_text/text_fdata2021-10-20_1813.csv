houston based johnson development corp is moving ahead with plans to build a 1 620 acre master planned community near hockley about 37 miles northwest of downtown houston jubilee as the community will be called is expected to bring about 4 800 new homes to the market pre sales are scheduled to begin in 2023 the company said in a news release we want to raise the bar for how a community can better the lives of the individuals that live in it said larry johnson chairman and ceo of johnson development every aspect of this new community is being intentionally designed to promote positivity allowing residents to decompress from the everyday grind and connect with nature and each other johnson development is taking what it describes as a holistic approach to the community s design targeting everything from the layout of streets and placement of parks to amenity architecture the aim the company said is to surround residents with positivity jubilee has multiple positive interpretations said trey reichert general manager of the community it represents joy is energetic and has nuances of community these concepts will be well represented in the mindful spaces we are designing for residents while the company provided few details about the community it did say that it wants to provide spaces that help to improve residents physical and mental well being johnson development acquired the land where jubilee will be built in 2017 the site is southwest of u s highway 290 and katy hockley road in northwest harris county a few miles west of the grand parkway the parcel was previously owned by houston based rockspring which marketed it as ideal for the next major master planned community in the northwest corridor at the time rockspring was seeking nearly 43 5 million according to previous houston business journal reporting when the deal closed rockspring described it as the largest in its history harris county appraisal district records say the property had a market value of 18 5 million as of jan 1 rockspring began assembling the land tract in 2006 and finished acquiring all the parcels in 2008 the private real estate investor did some entitlement work including creating four municipal utility districts on the tract to prepare the former ranch land for development rockspring first took the property to market in 2009 but the property failed to move as the great recession took hold in houston as hbj previously reported rockspring began getting calls from developers and homebuilders once the financial markets began to harden again though most were interested in purchasing smaller parcels of about 300 acres at most after purchasing the property from rockspring johnson development sat on the it for about three years before filing a general plan with city officials in october 2020 documents filed with the houston department of planning and development said little more than the company planned to build a massive master planned community at the location however the documents said the application was filed by houston based lja engineering and listed an affiliate of johnson development corp as the developer it now appears the company is ready to move forward with the project johnson development corp is the developer behind the local fall creek grand central park harmony harvest green imperial jordan ranch riverstone and sienna master planned communities among others the company s latest master planned community comes at a time when demand for homes in amenitized communities has reached a fevered pitch as bethesda maryland based rclco real estate consulting recently reported texas ranked behind only florida in the number of homes sold in master planned communities during the first half of 2021 florida accounted for 34 of homes sold while texas accounted for 30 add in nevada and the three states represent 75 of all homes sold in master planned communities nationally the nation s largest master planned communities are poised to see continued success throughout the rest of 2021 as well according to rclco home sales in the top 50 master planned communities in the country exceeded expectations in the first half of 2021 with a pace that indicates the potential for a 12 increase at year s end compared to 2020 as the hbj previously reported demand for homes across the state is so high that developers are struggling to keep up texas realtors reported that the single family housing inventory across the lone star state fell to just 1 3 months last quarter down from a three month inventory a year ago closer to home the houston association of realtors reported earlier this months that single family home sales totaled 9 226 in september up 1 5 year over year however last month s figure is down

nick hanna knows a thing or two about catching allegedly misbehaving politicians in los angeles as the former u s attorney for the central district of california hanna launched a sprawling investigation into pay to play corruption at los angeles city hall indicting former los angeles city councilmember jose huizar on 34 corruption and fraud charges and reeling in huizar s associates including another ex councilman mitch englanger along the way now 16 months after he announced the findings of the fbi s so called operation casino royale hanna is seeing common threads between his la city corruption case and the new federal probe against current city councilmember and former la county supervisor mark ridley thomas you have two men with very broad powers and the allegations are that they steered money and benefits to their relatives hanna tells kcrw in mr in huizar s case the allegation was that he leveraged his position to get developers to donate money to a relative s political campaign and of course in the case of mr ridley thomas the allegation is that he directed government contracts to a university in exchange for the university giving his relatives a full scholarship and paid professorship as the university acted as a conduit essentially to funnel campaign cash to a nonprofit that the relative ran despite the detailed indictment councilmember ridley thomas is maintaining his innocence in his letter to his colleagues he said he has no plans to resign from his city council post although he would immediately step back from council and committee meetings the councilmember s refusal to bow out is no surprise to hanna who says a public claim of innocence is the common playbook for elected officials facing serious charges it s pretty typical in my experience for not to want to step down when you step down it does signal that maybe you think there s some validity to the charges hanna also says for elected officials facing corruption charges holding on to their seats is often their bargaining chip suggesting ridley thomas would not resign until a deal is reached with the federal authorities i suspect behind the scenes there have been ongoing discussions about how to resolve the case as part of any kind of resolution the government would always demand that the public official step down from the public office in the end taxpayers and constituents would suffer as hanna predicts the federal investigation would keep councilmember ridley thomas busy it s pretty hard to carry on your job when you re under indictment in a case like this just from a public messaging perception it would be good to step down it s also good for the defendant to spend his time focusing on his defense the former prosecutor believes the local political system gives too much power and influence to a selected few and discourages citizens from challenging them potentially creating a breeding ground for corruption i think members of the city council and the county board of supervisors are very powerful people they control the purse strings and they ve got a lot of influence on what happens in their districts maybe the people were just afraid to challenge those politicians or fear losing their job as a city employee or a city agency it s pretty hard to go up against someone who controls your funding hanna who is no longer in public service says he is troubled that despite the indictment of former city councilmember huizar the city council has not put additional safeguards in place to prevent further corruption at city hall even after all these prosecutions it seems to me to be business as usual at city hall obviously the city s current ethics laws didn t prevent what happened and certainly didn t detect what happened and yet not much has changed hanna also believes the local government needs serious ethics reforms including greater transparency and stricter rules of the road when i was u s attorney i had to publicly disclose my finances every year including what stocks i own how much money i had in the bank i couldn t take a cup of coffee from anyone and that s the way it should be you re supposed to be serving the public you re not supposed to be serving yourself hanna says if los angeles doesn t police itself the u s attorney s office and the fbi are going to continue to do that job for it people should be on notice that if they engage in public corruption they ll go to federal prison kcrw has reached out to los angeles city council president nury martinez and los angeles county board chairwoman hilda solis in response to hanna s comments

this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below candeloro last year s investment pariah is this year s darling article content crude oil prices have more than doubled over the past year rising from below 40 per barrel to more than 80 advertisement 2 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content it s a far cry from the absurdly low prices reached in the spring of last year we apologize but this video has failed to load tap here to see other videos from our team try refreshing your browser or candeloro last year s investment pariah is this year s darling back to video not surprisingly there has been a recovery in demand as the world s economies have been reopening to varying degrees and levels of mobility and activity are returning closer to normal article content meanwhile some countries in the northern hemisphere are expected to switch from natural gas to oil in order to fuel their power needs as they enter the winter months that s largely because natural gas prices in some jurisdictions are even higher than oil on a per barrel equivalent basis that could add another tailwind to oil demand a stronger demand backdrop is partly responsible for some of the oil price gains but the bigger driver has been supply advertisement 3 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content there has been notable under investment over the past decade one could argue that oil is simply following a typical path of a commodity cycle high prices encourage growth in exploration development and production this eventually leads to oversupply weaker prices and cutbacks to capital expenditures years later the under investment leads to a lack of supply that eventually drives prices higher yet again and so on this classic cycle may indeed be playing itself out yet again there are some attributes that make every cycle unique however most noteworthy this time around has been the focus on climate and sustainability in the public and private sectors that has made access to capital harder to come by across the fossil fuel industry advertisement 4 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content it is hard to imagine this changing much going forward given political pressure and the long term nature of the commitments that entities have been making this hurdle along with demands from various stakeholders has forced many north american oil producers to focus on efficient capital allocation and the prioritization of shareholder friendly initiatives over recent years as opposed to their previous strategy of maximizing oil production and while the u s industry was regarded over the past decade as being the world s swing producer able to turn its oil taps on and off relatively easily there are reasons to believe it may be more disciplined going forward there has been a similar shift among the 13 members of the opec cartel including saudi arabia the cartel has been cooperating with russia and appears to be prioritizing oil price stability and strength and only marginal increases in supply advertisement 5 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content this approach has helped many cartel members improve their fiscal situations versus their prior strategy of simply maximizing global market share at any price it is hard to predict whether this level of restraint will persist for the foreseeable future as there have been many unexpected twists and turns in the past with respect to opec and russia who collectively control more than half of the world s oil production and so this is likely to remain a source of uncertainty that investors will have to account for in the management of portfolios the prevailing oil prices will inevitably lure more supply into the market as is typical in an upcycle but the rate of supply growth may fall short of prior episodes given some of the constraints mentioned above advertisement 6 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content that suggests the supply and demand dynamics have the potential to remain supportive of more elevated prices than what we ve been accustomed to over the past decade and we believe the global economy should have the capacity to handle higher oil prices up to a certain extent given the elevated savings of consumers and further economic reopening that still lies ahead naturally the oil sector should benefit from a more robust oil price backdrop some of this is likely already reflected given how well the energy sector has performed year to date despite this the sector is not very widely owned by global investors because of the weak prices and meager investment returns from the past decade moreover some investors have incorporated an esg framework environmental social and governance into their investment decision making process advertisement 7 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content this has led some to minimize if not entirely eliminate their allocations to the fossil fuel industry ultimately at the margin some investors will return to the sector as they try to capitalize on the improving environment and this could help support existing stock prices but other investors may remain steadfast in their approach to sustainability and resist the temptation to revisit the sector in other words there should be stronger demand for energy stocks relative to the past few years but perhaps not to the extent we have seen in past cycles the evolution to a more sustainable future that involves more sources of renewable energy is very much underway but it will take years to unfold in the meantime the world s economy still depends on oil and the lack of supply combined with recovering demand suggests an upcycle may already be underway the oil industry should continue to see some better days ahead even if the longer term challenges

the corporation s role in society today during the past several years public companies have come under increasing pressure from investors and society at large to use their resources and influence for broad and meaningful social impact millennials and generation z are particularly focused on the role that corporations play in advancing social issues but their interest is shared by many in other age demographics as well this trend is not new and many large public companies have responded in 2015 for example apple facebook google microsoft coca cola and johnson johnson were among 397 companies that filed an amicus brief asking the supreme court to overturn a lower court ruling against same sex marriage in obergefell v hodges corporations are also actively tackling issues of racial diversity on their boards after the murder of george floyd in 2020 among the new directors joining fortune 500 company boards 28 of new board seats were filled by blacks up from 10 the prior year and almost three quarters of the appointments occurred in the months after mr floyd s death corporations are also leading the charge to combat the uptick in hate crimes against asian americans and pacific islanders aapi since the covid 19 global pandemic corporations such as apple peloton airbnb and nike donated money to nonprofits tasked with combatting aapi hate crimes and created popular social media campaigns denouncing racism corporations and institutional investors also spoke out firmly and swiftly against the january 6 2021 insurrection at the u s capitol building beyond just issuing statements companies acted to show their disproval for example amazon suspended pac contributions to u s lawmakers who voted against the certification of the election this action of suspending political donations was followed by dozens of other high profile corporations including airbnb american airlines american express boston scientific dow chemical company and walmart from an esg perspective the implication of these actions is clear corporations are getting the message that they must view themselves not simply as business enterprises but as entities firmly intertwined with the broader society and it is crucial they understand that both society and their investors expect them to act as leaders in areas of social justice and environmental stability one indication of the growing importance of esg issues to corporations is that ceos have become more outspoken on divisive political issues such as voting rights thus in the wake of last year s general election and the ensuing efforts in many states to restrict voting rights the ceos of corporations like delta air lines and coca cola have spoken out against such legislation esg issues also matter deeply to institutional investors institutional investors are requesting that companies become leaders in social issues a new ideology aimed at expanding the corporation s role in solving issues of social injustice larry fink the ceo of blackrock stated in his 2021 letter to ceos that the united states is at a historic crossroads on the path to racial justice an issue that cannot be solved without leadership from companies clearly the philosophy that a corporation s sole responsibility is to pursue profits and enhance shareholder value while remaining silent on social issues is no longer the prevailing ideology institutional investors are demanding that corporations play a major role in addressing social injustices corporations as citizens and esg as a tool to act as declared in shakespeare s the tempest what s past is prologue and if that holds true the u s movement for corporations to exercise greater social responsibility has roots dating back over one hundred years thus in considering how best to contextualize and appreciate the esg movement today it is helpful to understand some of the legal milestones that have defined corporations transforming role in society one such milestone was the u s supreme court s opinion in santa clara county v southern pacific railroad 118 u s 394 1886 in that case the theme of corporate personhood was enunciated by the supreme court which stated that the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment grants constitutional protections to corporations over a century later in burwell v hobby lobby stores inc the supreme court in a landmark decision allowed for privately held for profit corporations to be exempt from a contraceptive mandate under the affordable care act to which their owners objected on religious grounds in reaching this decision the court held that for profit corporations could be considered persons under the religious freedom restoration act of 1993 this ruling regarding corporate personhood was in some respects an extension of the supreme court s ruling in citizens united v fec 558 u s 310 2010 in which the supreme court granted first amendment protections to corporations allowing them to fundraise for political campaigns the court held in that decision that corporations as associations of individuals have free speech rights under the first amendment and therefore could not be barred from political expenditures as an expression of free speech these judicial opinions as well as others have established a foundation for treating corporations as entities within u s society that have certain rights akin to natural persons and as personal rights come with personal responsibilities applying this same logic to corporations demonstrates how corporations also could be expected over time to assume greater social responsibilities this has led to a new and still evolving paradigm in how investors analyze and invest in companies and what our broader culture expects from corporations that evolving paradigm leads us to esg esg is a popular acronym that means environmental social and governance as an important element of the esg movement many institutional investors ratings agencies and proxy advisory firms have developed their own proprietary scorecards to determine how various companies handle environmental social and governance issues if companies score low on those esg scorecards institutional investors will vote against the reelection of board members vote in favor of shareholder proposals that align with their expectations and potentially decide to withdraw their investments in such companies actions speak louder than words asset managers institutional investors and proxy advisors are using their voting power to effect change with climate change and environmental stability being a priority for many investors it is important to understand how environmental risks are perceived as investment risks mindful of the growing social focus on climate change regulators now view climate risk as a potentially destabilizing factor in the global financial system one recent dramatic example of the financial risks imposed by climate change is the bankruptcy of pacific gas electric pg e in the first climate change related bankruptcy pg e filed for bankruptcy protection in 2019 after being deluged by lawsuits stemming from california wildfires allegedly caused by its power lines the wildfires damaged hundreds of miles of california land and led pg e to cite 30 billion in liabilities investors are changing their investing habits to reward companies that have strong esg characteristics in fact blackrock reported that from january through november 2020 investors in mutual funds and etfs invested 288 billion globally in sustainable assets a 96 increase over the whole of 2019 climate change however is only one of the areas of focus in the burgeoning push for greater esg sensitivity and compliance as an example state street global advisors ssga has been very aggressive in its proxy voting to effect esg change in a letter from the ceo detailing its 2021 proxy voting agenda ssga stated that companies with strong esg characteristics experienced less negative stock returns during the market collapse compared to their competitors including industries most affected by covid 19 among other priorities ssga is proactively addressing racial ethnic and gender diversity this is one of the areas where companies knowledge of esg disclosure related issues is most significant ssga has made the following proclamations in 2021 ssga will vote against the chair of the nominating governance committee at companies in the s p 500 and ftse 100 that do not disclose racial and ethnic composition of their boards in 2022 ssga will vote against the chair of the compensation committee at companies in the s p 500 and ftse 100 that do not disclose their eeo 1 survey responses and in 2022 ssga will vote against the chair of the nominating governance committee at companies in the s p 500 and ftse 100 that do not have at least one director from an underrepresented community on their board ssga has provided a voting framework for diversity related shareholder proposals below is a table outlining ssga s expectations and practical examples of best practices ssga expectations examples of best practices does the company articulate the role diversity of race and gender at a minimum plays in the firm s broader human capital management practices and long term strategy a pharmaceuticals company articulates the role of diversity and inclusion in advancing its long term business strategy does the company describe what diversity goals related to race and gender at minimum exist how these goals contribute to the firm s overall strategy and how these goals are managed and progressing a semiconductor company discloses its progress against time bound goals that are tied to its overall strategy these goals specifically address gender and race does the company provide measures of the diversity of its global employee base and board including 1 eeo 1 report data on gender and race for us companies and 2 diversity characteristics including gender and racial and ethnic makeup of the board of directors a financial services firm discloses its eeo 1 report on race and gender and also offers a snapshot of the data aligned with the sustainability accounting standards board sasb in another example an insurance company discloses the overall racial and gender composition of its board if a company does not disclose that it has a diverse representation on its board does the company articulate goals and strategy related to racial and ethnic representation at the board level including how the board reflects the diversity of the company s workforce community customers and other key stakeholders a communication services company has publicly committed to adding at least one black director to its board within a year does the company describe how the board executes its oversight role in diversity and inclusion an it services company discloses the committee responsible for diversity and inclusion and includes d i in the committee s charter whether a company meets the above expectations will directly impact ssga s approach to voting if the company is aligned with at least four of the expectations ssga will most likely vote against any diversity related shareholder proposal if the company is aligned with three or fewer of ssga s expectations ssga will most likely engage with the company to seek further alignment with ssga s expectations perhaps most importantly ssga has stated that if a company does not commit to align with four or five of its expectations and if engagement is not productive ssga will most likely support proposals that would meaningfully advance diversity related disclosures ssga has also provided proxy voting guidelines for environmental and social issues starting in 2022 ssga will vote against independent directors at companies in the s p 500 that are underperformers based on their r factor score which is ssga s proprietary esg scorecard that determines which companies are meeting ssga s esg expectations climate change and why esg commitments matter to boards blackrock in its 2021 proxy voting guidelines for u s securities provided guidance on their proxy voting with respect to environmental sustainability it is asking companies in which it invests to explain how they may be impacted by climate related risks and opportunities and how these risks are considered within the company s strategy specifically blackrock expects companies in which it invests to articulate how they are aligned with the goal of limiting global warming to well below 2 consistent with a global aspiration to reach net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 blackrock is underscoring this expectation by examining the disclosures of carbon intensive companies regarding their greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets blackrock will consider supporting shareholder proposals that ask companies to disclose climate plans aligned with blackrock s goals one of the most noteworthy esg related developments occurred in may 2021 when exxon mobil corp lost two board seats to a small activist hedge fund that asserted exxon mobil s board was not pursuing an aggressive enough climate change agenda the hedge fund engine no 1 had only a 50 million stake in exxon an oil behemoth with a market value of 250 billion the dissident shareholders were able to win the support of major institutional shareholders such as blackrock which supported their shareholder proposal this marked a monumental shift where an industry leading company lost board seats because of climate change institutional shareholders were clear in their beliefs that failing to address growing investor concerns about the impact of climate change can directly lead to the loss of board seats and changes to corporate leadership this is a quintessential modern example of how investors are wielding their voting power to effectuate change on corporate boards in order to ensure that corporations are more aligned with their goals of environmental sustainability it is more important than ever for corporate boards to understand the expectations of institutional investors proxy advisors society and asset managers to be esg compliant corporations must be proactive and diligent in providing appropriate disclosures and making appropriate changes to satisfy those expectations etf trends millennials are a driving factor in growth behind esg investments lauren mandaro usa today facebook apple among 379 to file gay marriage court brief heidrick

the first bitcoin linked exchange traded fund listed in the u s debuted as the second most heavily traded fund on record in a watershed moment for the crypto industry the proshares bitcoin strategy etf trading under the ticker bito rose about 4 9 to 41 94 more than 24 million shares changed hands tuesday according to data compiled by bloomberg because of the way the fund settles trades net flows into or out of the product probably won t be known until overnight on wednesday advertisement with turnover of almost 1 billion bito s debut ranked only behind a blackrock carbon fund for a first day of trading the latter of which ranks higher due to pre seed investments said athanasios psarofagis at bloomberg intelligence bloomberg also reported that options on bito will begin trading on the nyse arca options and nyse american options exchanges on wednesday meanwhile bitcoin made a run at its record high of just under 65 000 world nation how a california surfer helped bring bitcoin to el salvador critics of the plan to make bitcoin legal tender in el salvador say the cryptocurrency s extreme volatility could bring devastation to one of the poorest countries in the hemisphere from our conversations with market participants i think it s related to the growing belief as the trading day goes on that this is going to be considered a successful launch said stephane ouellette chief executive and co founder of frnt financial inc a crypto focused capital markets platform given the amount of avenues retail investors already have to participate in btc clearly the u s based etfs are nonetheless satisfying some kind of latent even if niche demand a bitcoin etf has been long awaited by both the crypto community and investors on wall street many of whom have argued for years that approval by regulators would open digital currencies to more mainstream investors the proshares fund is based on futures contracts and was filed under mutual fund rules that securities and exchange commission chairman gary gensler has said provide significant investor protections advertisement we are really excited to bring bito the first bitcoin linked etf to investors as an important opportunity for them conveniently to invest in bitcoin in their regular brokerage account simeon hyman global investment strategist at proshares said on bloomberg tv this is going to allow many people who have been waiting for an easy way to do this and a robust way to do this to now be involved and have it in their portfolios retail investors rushed to buy the etf on tuesday bito was one of the most bought assets on fidelity s platform with more than 8 800 buy orders coming from customers as of 2 55 p m eastern time it s an incredibly bullish week there s been really positive sentiment around the etf in particular said sam bankman fried chief executive of ftx one of the largest crypto exchanges advertisement it s long been assumed that whoever received approval first could stand to reap the greatest benefits including industry recognition as well as potentially attracting huge amounts of cash some analysts are already bullish on bito s prospects the futures based bitcoin etf could attract more than 50 billion in inflows in its first year given the hype around it said noted bitcoin bull tom lee co founder of fundstrat global advisors there are other applications for futures based bitcoin etfs in the queue analysts are anticipating launches from issuers such as valkyrie whose bitcoin strategy exchange traded fund could trade under the ticker btfd meanwhile grayscale investments and the new york stock exchange filed to convert the world s biggest bitcoin fund ticker gbtc into an etf appealing to regulators for approval just as its wildly popular vehicle is beset with competition advertisement market watchers have a few measuring sticks with which to gauge bito s initial reception the spdr gold shares fund ticker gld had the fastest ever climb to 1 billion in assets under management reaching the landmark in just three days according to bloomberg intelligence more recently the vaneck social sentiment fund ticker buzz saw more than 400 million worth of shares traded on its debut earlier this year one of the highest amounts ever for an etf on its first day this is likely going to be the biggest launch of all time said james seyffart at bloomberg intelligence bito is bound to pass vaneck s buzz launch he said seyffart added that the top launch and all launches above buzz s had backing from pre seeded institutions which had been lined up to invest in the funds it s likely not going to pass some of these funds that traded over a billion in the first day due to hundreds of millions from an institution or two that was lined up prior to launch but it should pass buzz for what we tend to refer to as an organic launch he said advertisement bloomberg news reported last week that the sec wasn t going to stand in the way of the launch of a futures backed bitcoin fund gensler has been viewed as being more open minded toward cryptocurrencies than was his predecessor jay clayton observers cite gensler s previous interest in the crypto world he once taught a class at mit s sloan school of management called blockchain and money and the chairman had over the summer signaled that regulators may be more open to a bitcoin etf if it were based on futures rather than the cryptocurrency itself with assistance from katie greifeld bailey lipschultz and crystal kim

afternoon and thank you for joining us for our third quarter 2021 earnings call once again thomas is on the call but asked me to present his comments on the business he will handle the q a as a reminder today s may include forward looking statements which represent the company s belief regarding future events which by their nature are not certain and are outside of the company s control our actual results and financial condition may differ possibly materially from what is indicated in these forward looking statements we ask that you refer to the disclaimers in our press release you should also review a description of risk factors contained in our financial reports filed with the sec in the third quarter we once again reached a record number of accounts 1 536 000 our year over year account growth of 57 was nearly equal in all three of our geographic regions the markets continue to be constructive for us but more normalized than they were last year driving commissions to 311 million the second highest we have ever reported only exceeded by this year s hyperactive first quarter while our gaap reported net revenues were 464 million our adjusted net revenues of 650 million were also our second highest on record again surpassed only by the first quarter the 186 million adjustment to net revenues was virtually all due to the depreciation of tiger brokers stock price we invested in tiger at a blended price of less than 3 a share in 2018 and 2019 to help them gather enough capital to enter into the brokerage business on the large scale they wanted using our platform as an introducing broker since that time the stock has traded as high as 38 and as low as 3 and at quarter end our gain on this investment was about 80 million even though this started out with a relatively minor investment it certainly has provided a lot of unintended distraction to our investors who look at our financials with the new focus on the part of the chinese government on data security we now expect the stock to keep swinging for a while until they come to a clear understanding with the regulator of what is required and how to get there our financial performance underscores the strength of our platform and of our focus on automating as much of the brokerage business as possible this gives us the ability to maximize our product offer product and service offering while minimizing our costs automation to us means that our million and a half customers from all over the world can interact and trade securities commodities and currencies with each other across 141 trading venues in many jurisdictions under different rules seemingly from one account this is not easy and it is the reason that not all products on our platform are available for all users such as crypto which is not yet available to many of our non u s customers but we are working hard on that we just yesterday enabled registered investment advisors to add small crypto positions to the investment portfolios of clients who requested and which we are told happens ever more often automation can also enables us to generate upon request a single nicely compiled investment report that not only summarizes your holdings and returns and the risk you have been taking but does so across continents and products and currencies and you can even custom tailor it for yourself or for your customers column by column we ve even added the capability to include assets that are custodied elsewhere and incorporate them into this report no matter what country or major currency they are in we continue to see active trading among our client base to give a sense of this in the third quarter of 2019 our equity volume was 41 billion shares in the third quarter of 2020 it was 86 billion shares this quarter it reached 172 billion shares third quarter total darts of 2 3 million were the third highest in company history following the first two quarters of this year as existing clients continue their activity and new clients begin to participate client investing confidence can also be seen in our customer margin loans which reached a record 50 2 billion up 67 from last year we continue to see our clients putting their available funds to work 50 billion of margin loans represents about 6 of all outstanding industry margin loans even though we only hold less than a fraction of 1 of all investable assets this is also remarkable because our margin lending policies are comparatively conservative and we automatically liquidate positions and accounts that come into violation of these policies the reason for our high margin balance is that we only charge 0 75 to 1 56 to ibkr pro customers for margin loans this policy is a major draw for sophisticated traders to trade often and use leverage the more our clients participate the stronger we become our reported pre tax profit margin was 50 and adjusted for non core items was 65 we know of no other broker who can claim profit margins close to this our new account growth remains quite positive ahead of both prior year and prior quarter adds investor confidence and activity are strong across the globe in all regions as we emerge from the pandemic this activity continues to be led more by individual investors who tend to stay with us especially internationally because we offer a broad product range in the lowest cost to those investors and there are many who wish to invest globally this breadth is one of our strategic advantages one that is extremely difficult to offer for any broker providing market access can be expensive and complex to do so globally with compliance legal currency and tax and reporting requirements that vary by market is even more so having all this automated is our competitive advantage three quarters of our accounts are international in rapidly growing markets even as we come through this period of covid global interest in the markets that began early last year continues people have grown comfortable doing more and more of their financial business electronically they have grown more connected to financial markets institutions and each other online which in turn drives even more people to participate this along with our continuing dedication to add more products and services to our platform is why we believe year over year growth in total accounts can be at least 30 going forward indefinitely once again all client segments and geographies showed strong account adds with all regions showing greater than 55 year on year account growth now i will go over our 5 client segments individual customers who made up 60 of our accounts 37 of our client equity and 54 of our commissions continue the remarkable run of growth with 12 month account growth of 79 client equity growth of 57 and commissions of 35 all geographic regions we serve saw growth in individual accounts of over 70 with european accounts topping all regions with over 90 growth this underscores what we always say it is important to provide a reliable platform that is global because people around the world want to maximize their opportunities to invest in the variety of ways they prefer hedge fund customers also continue to grow for the 12 months ended september 30th we saw 4 hedge fund account growth 41 customer equity growth and 4 commission growth we continue to add growing and larger hedge funds which can be seen in the particularly robust growth in client equity in this segment hedge funds represent 1 of our accounts 7 of our client equity and 6 of our commissions according to preqin we moved from 8th to 7th place as the prime broker servicing the most single manager hedge funds we are in first place as the prime broker servicing the most hedge funds under 50 million in aum and for the second year in a row we are the fastest growing prime broker proprietary trading firms are 2 of our accounts 9 of our client equity and 12 of commissions for the quarter this group grew by 36 in accounts for the 12 month period 44 in client equity and 19 in commissions all regions saw strong growth we are seeing particular success in this segment in europe as more prop trading firms open and new and existing firms move to us due to our unusually diverse international product base to capitalize on our reputation for seamless efficient and favorable trade executions and as investors seek to counterbalance negative interest rates in the eu financial advisors are 9 of our accounts 17 of our customer equity and 10 of our commissions this group grew accounts by 19 for the 12 month period customer equity by 41 and commissions by 7 account and client equity growth in this segment tends to be higher than commission growth as advisors typically tend to trade more conservatively more larger advisor firms are beginning to try interactive brokers for our adaptable account structures where you can manage hedge funds smas and regular client accounts under one master and invest across the world in a wide variety of products that now includes crypto an ria can use a rich set of tools and capabilities and with our dedicated client service desk for advisors we continue to get better and capture more business globally our final segment is introducing brokers these represent 25 of our accounts 30 of our client equity and 17 of our commissions i broker segment account growth was 31 for the latest 12 months with client equity up 59 and commissions up 97 offering the ticket of global access to their customers is critical for brokers looking to grow their business worldwide new brokers starting up and existing brokers looking to extend the breadth and depth of their offerings turn to our platform for its global trading and seamless back office functionality with the worldwide growth in investors who want global access introducing brokers know that their best opportunity to succeed is to partner with us to provide it much was done to enhance and improve our platform this quarter we eliminated monthly inactivity fees part of our ongoing commitment to provide low cost training solutions we introduced bitcoin early last month in response to client demand over the next few months we will be broadening both the regions and types of customers and coins available on our platform we are very proud of the great advances we have made in building out our compliance systems and staff in a group that now numbers 350 across the many regional brokerage subsidiaries we have around the world each with its own unique rules and regulations we ve increased the yield on our advertising dollars to a point at which it is becoming profitable to spend more we have grown our sales force and they are gaining stride as interactive brokers becomes better known for the sophistication and diverse capabilities of our platform along with our industry low pricing it is easier and easier for them to attract new and larger customers the growing controversy and focus on payment for order flow is to our advantage due to our unique position in the pfof space where we provide either zero commissions or executions at a small commission by crossing at usually better prices in our ats we have a great opportunity to attract more institutional flow they love to trade against our often overseas retail flow in between the nbbo where both sides benefit all in all it is a thrill for us to keep building new things and adding more and more products and capabilities and to offer it to an ever growing audience at the same time it feels like our opportunities are for the moment unlimited but we must hurry because the empty unserved product space is filling in quickly with that i will turn the call over to our cfo paul brody who will go through the numbers for the quarter paul paul j brody chief financial officer treasurer secretary and director thank you nancy thanks everyone for joining the call i ll review the third quarter results and then we ll open it up for questions please first note we have reordered our earnings release a bit to more closely align with many readers expectations so i ll start with our revenue items on page 3 of the release commissions continue to be strong returning our second highest ever quarterly revenues of 311 million this reflects higher trading volumes especially in stocks and options from active customers and a ground swell of new customers on our platform net interest income generated 274 million in revenues margin lending was particularly strong this quarter with customers producing 141 million in margin interest reflecting their confidence in the market securities lending also continued its strong run as investor demand for a broad range of securities borrow was met with a growing supply of inventory held by our customers we generated 49 million in revenues from other fees and services even while discontinuing account inactivity fees strong client activity drove revenues higher in market data fees and risk exposure fees and income from options exchange liquidity payment was driven higher by options volume market data fees were 20 million up 21 risk exposure fees more than doubled to 8 million and exchange liquidity payments were 10 million up 51 we eliminated account inactivity fees on july 1st to further improve account retention we believe the trade off will be worth it for the long term growth of the business other income includes gains and losses on our investments our currency diversification strategy and principal transactions many of these are excluded in our adjusted earnings outside of the other income was up to 16 million turning to expenses execution clearing and distribution costs were down 18 despite the higher trading volume capturing exchange liquidity rebates through our state of the art order routing system drove this performance and regulatory transaction fees were substantially lower on reduced rate we have gotten better and better at reducing these costs for our clients as a percent of commission execution and clearing costs declined from 36 in the third quarter of 2019 to 27 in the third quarter of 20 and now to 20 in the third quarter of this year with client trading volumes rising while we continuously improve our routing technology more commission revenue goes to the bottom line our ratio of compensation and benefits expense to adjusted net revenues was 15 unchanged from last year despite a 28 increase in head count this reflects our expense discipline and our strong top line our quarter end headcount was 2471 g a expenses were up 19 on the prior year reflecting legal expenses on litigation and prior period bank fees neither of which we would expect to continue at this pace our adjusted pre tax margin was a robust 65 by practicing expense control while also hiring and investing in the business for accelerated growth we are maintaining the operating leverage in our business finally on the income tax the income taxes line of the 28 million shown the operating company s portion was 19 million and the public company s portion was 9 million moving to our balance sheet on page 5 of the release the total assets ended the quarter at 106 billion with growth driven by margin lending to customers our consolidated equity capital reached 10 billion for the first time and we have no long term debt we continue to deploy our balance sheet to support our growing client business in particular more and larger customers want to access the margin lending which on our capital base gives us the ability to provide we opened offices in ireland and hungary in response to brexit for those and our other rapidly growing international locations our capital base provides the foundation needed for today s operations and for future growth our capital is also used for numerous other growth and investment opportunities we see worldwide and finally an ample capital base helps us win business by showing the strength and depth of our balance sheet to current and prospective clients and partners let s look briefly at our operating data on page 6 and 7 of the release page 6 shows contract and share volumes for all customers rose 34 in options and 100 in stocks well above industry growth activity is strong across client types and geographies in most securities products our volumes are still above the very high activity levels of 2020 turning to page 7 account growth remains robust with 555 000 account adds for the year and 122 000 for the latest quarter on top of record performance in the first half of this year total accounts reached 1 5 million 57 over the prior year and 9 over the prior quarter customer equity growth reflected strength in new accounts solid additions to existing accounts and a generally supportive market environment total customer darts reached their third highest quarterly level ever at 2 3 million trades per day this reflected investor confidence in rising markets the ongoing global search for yield in zero and negative interest rate environments and more customers on our trading platform commission for our cleared commissionable order shows our success in capturing rebates paid by exchanges we route ibkr pro orders directly to exchanges realizing these exchange rebates and passing the savings onto our clients by lowering their commission our cleared ibkr pro customers paid an average of 2 46 per order 9 less than they did last year as our order routing system found opportunities to maximize rebates while achieving best priced execution our clients benefit with lower commission costs as we pass our lower execution and clearing costs on to them profitability per order to us remains the same next we break down our net interest margin on page 8 of release total gaap net interest income 274 million significantly higher than a year ago reflecting increases in margin lending and securities lending average margin loan balances and margin interest income were up 64 and 70 respectively from last year investors were comfortable this quarter taking on leverage in a fairly benign market environment securities lending net interest was up 43 from last year driven by strong client participation in the market as we grow our client our customer base our opportunities to lend customers shares to other customers who short these stock also grows together with increasing our profitable securities lending to other broker dealers the model generates expanding revenues we believe our proprietary system developed in house for securities lending and operated by our team of specialists is proficient in identifying and lending out securities in high demand which drives our revenue from this activity moving to net interest from segregated cash and from customer credit balances this shows the impact of negative benchmark rates in certain countries when benchmark rates are very low as they are in the u s we pay no interest to customers on their cash but in currencies where rates are negative we earn interest by passing through these negative rates to customers we earned 8 million on this when benchmark rates are positive we earn interest on depositing and investing our segregated cash balances but because of negative rates in some currencies we had a net cost of 4 million on these balances taken together the net interest income from these balances is 4 million for the quarter now our estimate of the impact of the next 25 basis point increase in the u s benchmark rates we expect the next 25 basis point rise in rates to produce an additional 107 million annually this does not take into account any change in how we may adjust our strategy to take advantage of newly higher rates about 24 of our customer cash balances are not in u s dollars so estimates of the impact of u s rate changes exclude those currencies in conclusion this was a strong quarter that reflects our ability to grow our customer base and that shows the attractiveness of our strategy to automate for growth expanding what we offer while minimizing what we charge given our progress and performance we are confident in our ability to grow accounts thomas has indicated maintain our expense discipline and to capture future opportunities as they arise and with that we ll now open up the line for questions questions and answers operator our first question comes from the line of rich repetto with piper sandler your line is now open richard repetto piper sandler analyst yes good evening thomas and paul and nancy just a follow up question on the china situation i know the accounts have been drawn down at futu and tiger i guess thomas can you explain just about other operations what i understand your servers aren t in china but other any other impacts on client growth again it s clear what s going on with futu and tiger but just that region is that going to have any other follow on impacts thomas peterffy chairman of the board of directors well i m glad that it s so clear to you it may not be so clear to everybody else so but any day so while ibkr does not process client data in china to the extend we keep data on customers who reside in china we must keep that data on their procedures that satisfy you know the criteria that they have public this criteria we find is very similar to the one imposed by the european union under the so called gdpr rules since we have built those procedures at the time the gdpr rules came into effect we will modify and reuse them for chinese customers now these are direct customers from mainland china as you know we have the two introducing brokers futu and tiger brokers you mentioned these two firms will have to work with the regulator to make sure that they are compliant with the new rules while we do not think that these accounts are that the accounts their accounts with us i mean in a danger of having to close it is well known that futu has been planning to go on their own in the u s we think if anything the new rules may slow down that process but anyway the investors who want to know our exposure to these two brokers our expected net revenue no gross revenue sorry our expected gross revenue derived from servicing futu and tiger by the end of the year we expect it to be 75 million most of these accounts operate on an omnibus basis but they still have about 64 000 individual accounts which we have indications that they will convert to omnibus and so in that case it will result in a 64 000 account diminution in our number of customer accounts so that s what i have to say about that richard repetto piper sandler analyst it was a little bit more complicated than what i thought but that s helpful thomas thomas peterffy chairman of the board of directors thank you richard repetto piper sandler analyst okay another question just trying to understand a little bit about the crypto offering i know it s the pricing of it is you know in interactive brokers style highly highly competitive and i guess what you re seeing early on because your customers don t go for you know haven t gone a lot for the zero commission so i m just trying to see whether that s any whether they are real crypto traders as well thomas peterffy chairman of the board of directors all right so we have invited so far as you know we cannot make this available everywhere right at the start because we haven t verbed out the licensing situation so at this moment this is only available in the united states we have so far invited i think around 350 000 accounts of which 17 000 requests permission to trade it and that s what we have so far now as of yesterday we have enabled registered investment advisors because we often heard that people whose accounts are managed by registered investment advisors would like to have some crypto and so that creates a situation where we are the only broker at this time where an investment manager can trade crypto along with stocks and bonds for her clients and manage all positions on one screen and shows them in one account richard repetto piper sandler analyst got it very helpful last question is the meme stock report or gamestop sec report came out yesterday i just was wondering whether you had any big takeaways from the information that was provided or the conclusions that they reached anyway i didn t quite see all the connections but maybe you did thomas thomas peterffy chairman of the board of directors i was extremely surprised to find that they did not mention the pre opening activity on those two days when their stock doubled or tripled because pre opening trading usually is on a very very strong run up is usually indicating that the broker has to cover fails because the broker on the first day has to cover the fails prior to the open no matter what the price so i think that s what most have done when the price in those two days prior to the open richard repetto piper sandler analyst got it thank you tom i ll get back in the queue since i already asked three questions but anyway thanks thomas operator thank you our next question comes from the line of will nance with goldman sachs your line is open william nance goldman sachs analyst hi everyone good afternoon thomas peterffy chairman of the board of directors hi william nance goldman sachs analyst thomas maybe i could start on some of the comments in the prepared remarks around growth if i think back a couple of years ago i think you talked about 20 growth now we re talking about 30 growth and it s on a larger account side so i think it seems like you guys have gotten more confident in the growth outlook and i m just curious if there s anything particularly you d point to or what you re kind of seeing in the market that you think is helping the brand resonate a little bit more with customers thomas peterffy chairman of the board of directors yes so number one we are experiencing that stronger growth and number two we have a clear plan of how to go forward nurturing the growth so i m very confident about being about 30 going forward for indefinitely william nance goldman sachs analyst that s helpful maybe just a ticky tack one for paul on the expenses i think you mentioned there were some elevated legal expenses and i think a handful of other things in g a this quarter any sense of the magnitude there paul j brody chief financial officer treasurer secretary and director so it s probably relatively safe to say that the run rate that we had been running previously is a bit more realistic to return to to put it maybe an overall number on it that s probably 3 million to 4 million extra in the quarter something like that william nance goldman sachs analyst got it that s helpful appreciate it and then just lastly i was wondering if you can maybe address some of the news flow in the quarter around the bsa aml issues i realize there may not be much you can say but just curious if there s any light you can shed on that thomas peterffy chairman of the board of directors what do you exactly mean william nance goldman sachs analyst i think around the article as i had i think around you guys and morgan stanley around some investigation thomas peterffy chairman of the board of directors oh yes yes well i tell you honestly that was the first time i heard of that customer and you are right i haven t even moved into the situation i mean i m sure our compliance people are handling it but i would think that if it where a serious issue they would have brought to my attention by now william nance goldman sachs analyst got it i appreciate the color i appreciate you taking my questions this afternoon have a good one operator our next question comes from dan fannon with jefferies your line is open daniel fannon jefferies company inc analyst thanks i wanted to follow up just on the account growth and you ve obviously very positive across all regions channels can you talk about the profile of the new customers coming on board how that compares to your existing kind of customer is there anything specific or regions i know that you said broadly very strong everywhere but any specific areas to call out where you re having outsized success thomas peterffy chairman of the board of directors i no it s just great across the board it s similar growth every year daniel fannon jefferies company inc analyst and the profile of the customer is similar or thomas peterffy chairman of the board of directors yes it is similar yes i mean look i mean let s say is at the very beginning when we started interactive brokers we were of course going after the people the traders the floor traders that had to lead the floor so if you look back to our early years we had very few customers at very high rates of trading so that is gradually coming down as we go forward so every year basically the number of trades per account is slowly dropping but we still have around about 400 trades a year or something like that per account daniel fannon jefferies company inc analyst okay and then just you mentioned an increased yield on your advertising dollars which is something that i think you said or alluded to allow you to spend more can you talk about that in terms of obviously that i assume that ties to the account growth but how we should think about that in terms of spending and are there certain channels or regions that you think your that advertising dollars going further thomas peterffy chairman of the board of directors yes because our advertising dollars are certainly tied to certain aspects of our platform and when we introduce something new we do that now with a lot of advertising so when we introduce crypto we had a crypto advertising campaign that is going to continue for quite some time now very very shortly on november 1st we are introducing the new capability that we are going to start with a huge ad campaign so and this part of reason why i feel so confident about the account growth daniel fannon jefferies company inc analyst understood thank you operator our next question comes from the line of kyle voigt with kbw your line is open kyle voigt kbw analyst hey good evening if i could just follow up actually on the question dan s question on advertising thomas i know there you just mentioned new product rollouts and maybe that s different but i know historically there has been some frustration about not getting that adequate return on marketing investment and clearly that s changed i m just wondering if you could speak to like has there been a strategy shift in terms like where which channels those marketing dollars are being spent in or thomas peterffy chairman of the board of directors yes but this is a very sensitive competitive issue because you know everybody is trying to advertise and gain more accounts so yes we have gotten into it very deeply and we now understand better where you get your money s worth and where you do not kyle voigt kbw analyst got it and so as we re looking out to 2022 and beyond do you think that s going to be kind of over the medium term not just near term but over the medium term do you think advertising is going to be a bigger part of that medium term kind of growth story to continuously drive the account growth is that what you re saying thomas peterffy chairman of the board of directors i certainly hope so i do not have definite proof that for our plans but we have the plans and we are going to go forward with them and i think that we have every indication that they are going to work kyle voigt kbw analyst got it fair enough thank you and then i guess another question in terms of the paxos relationship just wondering can you help us better understand the contract structure is there just a set revenue share on the trading revenue that s generated and so that s shared with paxos thomas peterffy chairman of the board of directors so we are the customer to paxos the customers earlier to paxos and paxos charge the commission and then gives us a share of it not a share of it it gives us a fee kyle voigt kbw analyst understood thanks and then just my last one is just in terms of if i look at the individual account size if i m doing my math correctly from the prepared remarks it looks like the average account size is getting smaller despite the increase in the equity markets so i think you commented earlier that the average client that s being acquired looks relatively similar but is it fair to say that they re generally smaller sized accounts is that fair to say thomas thomas peterffy chairman of the board of directors well introducing broker accounts are smaller and yes individual accounts are on the average smaller yes kyle voigt kbw analyst okay all right thank you for taking my questions thomas peterffy chairman of the board of directors yes sure operator our next question comes from the line of chris allen with compass point your line is open christopher allen compass point research trading llc analyst good evening everyone just wanted to follow up on a couple of things one thomas on the crypto launch i think you said you re going to broad the number of coins any color just in terms of where do you think you may get to on that what s the timing around that thomas peterffy chairman of the board of directors i think well you know it s not up to us it s up to paxos and i understand that they are working on adding five more coins in the near future christopher allen compass point research trading llc analyst understood and then i just want to follow up on rich s question on your spot in some future targets i just want to make sure i understood it correctly you expect the gross revenues from those ib relationships to get to 75 million at year end do you expect it to be maintained even if they continue to migrate some of the u s customers to sub clearing or is that going to decline over time just want to be clear on that thomas peterffy chairman of the board of directors so no the 75 million is just simple i looked at the year to date growth and i expanded it to the end of the year so that i mean i m not expecting it to go up or down i guess if i have to quantify so that it s easily understandable right 75 million a year is understandable right now some of our i mean everybody has known and we have been talking about that for some time that futu wants to become separate in the united states and they put up a company and they ve applied i think they ve applied for registration finra and occ etc so we are expecting them to eventually leave us and so as i think this new rule if anything may slow that down a little bit otherwise as i mentioned yes we have 64 000 individual accounts still that come from mostly from tiger and i think that those accounts will go into an omnibus account and as a result we ll lose those accounts as our number of accounts so our number of accounts would seemingly shrink but simultaneously the average account size will increase christopher allen compass point research trading llc analyst got it that was it from me thank you operator our next question comes from the line of macrae sykes with gabelli your line is open macrae sykes gabelli equity trust analyst hi good evening and congratulations on the quarter thomas peterffy chairman of the board of directors hi macrae macrae sykes gabelli equity trust analyst hi thomas how are you thomas peterffy chairman of the board of directors i haven t spoken to you in years macrae sykes gabelli equity trust analyst i ve been hiding just going back to this cryptocurrency i think if interactive is being a pretty competitive platform and obviously this is a huge business for coinbase and some of the other competitors but it sounds like given how you re rolling out things you re viewing it more as a complementary product to your accounts i mean is this something that you could think could be a significant growth driver in the future once you get settled on the operations your relationship etc or should we always kind of think of this as not being a major focus for you thomas peterffy chairman of the board of directors well no i wouldn t think that because i believe that there are 10s of millions of investors in the united states and i will think of crypto as just one product among the many they invest in right so i think it s a pain in the neck for them to have to have a different account when they want to buy some crypto versus when they want to buy a stock or sell an option or by a future right i mean it s so much nicer for for a person like that to have all the assets on in one account and see it on one screen and trade it from one screen right that s had that s what has always been our competitive strengths right enabling people to trade product all over the world from one screen in any currency and from one account right macrae sykes gabelli equity trust analyst okay i appreciate that and i just wanted to just switching subjects a little bit i wanted to get your thoughts on gamification and obviously providing education to clients to get them to understand the markets better but i wanted to get your views on sort of where are the gray areas between some of these gimmicks and some of these other platforms are doing in terms of increase engagement but perhaps crossing the rules or sort of good ethics around engaging the customer thomas peterffy chairman of the board of directors so as i have indicated previously we are focusing on providing more education to our clients and so we will reveal certain graphics that may be helpful in that effort and i myself do not know about gamification because to tell you frankly i ve never been on another brokers platform and i also never played any computer games so i don t know the similarities i m an old man to ask about that macrae sykes gabelli equity trust analyst well thank you i appreciate operator our next question comes from rich repetto with piper sandler your line is open richard repetto piper sandler analyst yes i just want to follow up one question with paul and you mentioned that 24 of your cash balances are non u s and i assume that s 24 of the 23 billion of segregated cash and could you also tell us is there a way to quantify customers that don t have the 100 000 to fully get any increase in rates if short term rates went up to quantify that other part we don t pay interest to your clients the incremental interest paul j brody chief financial officer treasurer secretary and director right so a couple of things i can give you a minor correction that 24 is of customer credits not a segregated cash that cash is a little bit different because in certain areas under sec rules we have to bring foreign currencies back into u s dollars in order to protect them for the customers that s about 26 it makes the foreign currency about 26 so to your i m sorry your second question was about the interest rate changes on where we re currently paying no interest on credit it boils down to what is our spread so in u s dollars are advertised right there on our website the spread is the benchmark minus 50 basis points so when fed funds goes over 50 basis points we will start paying interest again and similarly in other currencies and i think you asked about on negative rate currencies or maybe i ll just give you a little more information that our negative rate currencies as those rates go up something similar will happen except that we do pass through on the majority of balances we now pass through negative rate to at least the larger customers customers with less than 50 000 equivalent in those negative rate currencies kind of get a free pass they get zero interest because we want to treat them well and keep those customers around and it doesn t cost us a lot thomas peterffy chairman of the board of directors yes and to respond to the 100 000 question so if you remember say interest rates go to 1 that we are going to pay half a percent to accounts with a 100 000 and above and gradually less as the amount of funds in the account the amount of the value of the account decreases so for example if somebody has an account worth 50 000 he s going to get 25 on the cash part of his asset in the account richard repetto piper sandler analyst understood got it last question is thomas we ve had a quarter now since we since i last asked you about this but any views or thoughts on regulation regards to payment for order flow coming after reading either the report or or any interactions you might have had during the quarter but your thoughts on whether there will actually be any regulatory changes to payment forward thomas peterffy chairman of the board of directors well i think that very very much like to do something and is that to us as much that he would really love to do something and he is looking for ways to do it i don t know if he will find one because there is going to be wish back about whether the people that price or not so and he s very smart when he comes out with this information flow because indeed i mean that is hard to put a dollar figure on but while the internalizers get the information flow i m not sure we ve being damaged by them having the information flow it s certainly not the person that send the order but the person with the next order right and that person may be through a different broker through a different high frequency trader right richard repetto piper sandler analyst yes okay that s helpful just wanted to hear your latest thoughts on it thank you thomas peterffy chairman of the board of directors all right operator i m showing no further questions at this time i would now like to turn the conference back to nancy stuebe nancy stuebe director of investor relations thank you everyone for participating today as a reminder this call will be available for replay on our website and we will also be posting a clean version of our transcript on our site tomorrow thanks again and we will talk to you next quarter end operator duration 53 minutes call participants nancy stuebe director of investor

the company s legal action against tesla will go forward after all what happened shares of specialty electric vehicle ev and alt fuel auto maker nikola nkla 26 73 accelerated by 4 7 on wednesday blasting past both major stock indexes and many other ev titles this followed some intriguing news on the legal front for the manufacturer of next generation trucks so what judge james donato of the united states district court for the northern district of california issued a fresh order in a lawsuit nikola filed in 2018 against fellow ev maker tesla tsla 1 65 the judge is allowing the case to go forward after nikola responded to an earlier ruling that the company show cause as to why it should continue the company did so and as a result donato s new order stipulates that the case will not be dismissed the judge has also set dates for a technology tutorial jan 13 2022 and a claim construction hearing jan 27 of the same year for the suit nikola originally filed its lawsuit in 2018 alleging that tesla had infringed its patents on a hydrogen powered semi truck for its own semi model by doing this it is allegedly generating confusion in the market and effectively costing nikola over 2 billion in lost sales when news of the lawsuit originally broke in an apparent play on words tesla said it was patently obvious there is no merit to the allegations now what neither nikola nor tesla has yet commented on the latest developments in the suit enmeshed in scandals seemingly of its own making nikola has not pursued the case vigorously since filing it and it doesn t seem like a priority while investors in both companies should watch how the nikola tesla legal proceedings unfold they shouldn t take action in their investment solely because of them

the furniture maker learned from the all digital by necessity model and has been supported by oracle netsuite on every step of its journey to a billion dollar company it started as a beanbag company in the basement of shawn nelson s childhood home more than 25 years later lovesac is now a publicly traded high end furniture retailer with 123 showrooms in malls across america and a valuation of more than a billion dollars lovesac s trip from scrappy startup to the nasdaq was paved with struggles and successes while navigating the challenges of the 2008 great recession lovesac closed unprofitable stores to control costs it then embarked on a more measured growth strategy eventually expanding its product portfolio and pushing into new markets lovesac s ipo in 2018 raised over 50 million and helped it further refine its business model and enhance its in store and online sales operations after years of steady growth lovesac ended fiscal 2021 with net sales of 320 7 million a strong customer retention rate and more than 100 000 new customers of its cushy sacs and sectionals as part of the pandemic fueled boom in the home goods category sales shot up 37 from the previous year but even as its business continued to thrive lovesac encountered shortcomings in its processes and technology in the years preceding its ipo lovesac was reliant on several disconnected legacy accounting and financial systems and processes that hampered growth this was particularly true with its approach to bookkeeping and the return merchandise authorization rma processes to modernize each of these core processes lovesac turned to oracle netsuite a unified cloud based business applications suite that encompasses financials inventory management customer management and omnichannel commerce used by more than 27 000 organizations globally early on lovesac s financial planning and bookkeeping efforts were tied to spreadsheets and manual data entry this approach couldn t scale and eventually lovesac s growth and ipo ambitions outpaced the capabilities of its software including intuit quickbooks which required an integrated business platform that was flexible and scalable enough to support its next chapter lovesac before netsuite was never a bastion of executional excellence on systems for sure said shawn nelson lovesac s ceo we came up transacting on quickbooks and we ve been through a lot of systems over the years but nothing that s tied our data together as seamlessly as netsuite and nothing as robust for certain lovesac also credits netsuite with helping it win over investors during its ipo roadshow with netsuite lovesac had confidence in the quality and transparency of its financials and could prove to investment bankers that its figures were rock solid we could demonstrate our sales record and our earnings and expense records and we could bring hard evidence that was very trustworthy said david jensen lovesac s cio and i think netsuite being in place was the core of that lovesac supporting the customer love team lovesac s growth over the years has been driven by its dedication to 100 customer satisfaction its customer service team is known as the customer love team and its focus is on ensuring customers are happy not only through the entire purchase process but during the returns process as well for its rma process lovesac wanted a system that could differentiate return types yet also provide a framework that was cohesive and easy for its customer love team to follow since implementing netsuite lovesac has improved and streamlined the entire return process without the complexities of software customization the company also gained the ability to sync return data with accounting to track whether returns were due to carrier damage vendor defects engineering issues or more typical customer dissatisfaction today lovesac says its customer satisfaction score in the post purchase arena has increased nearly 20 our bookkeeping for return activity is also far superior to where it was a year ago which helps us focus attention on resolving carrier issues and vendor issues said jensen responding amid covid 19 the covid 19 pandemic drove a fast and significant change in lovesac s digital strategy as physical stores were forced to close temporarily and furniture retailing moved online lovesac needed to quickly adapt its showrooms and have its front line sales associates work in new ways to keep inventory moving traditionally lovesac s showrooms supported a high touch sales experience with associates working closely with customers to personalize furniture items to their individual tastes with all of its showrooms closed lovesac turned its field sales team showroom sales associates and managers into remote consultants who could help customers shop on the website and better understand the products those teams worked from home fielding calls and online text chats having the cloud based netsuite system helped lovesac make this change and capture consolidate and process sales whether they were made in store online or through its shop in shop partnerships with best buy and costco looking back on the challenges the retail industry has faced throughout the pandemic lovesac considers itself one of the lucky ones it continues to grow at 30 to 40 a year and intends to leverage the lessons learned during the pandemic to provide digital customer service and sales in the years ahead a year and a half ago we were a third of the size we are today said nelson and i believe that with netsuite as the centerpiece of our entire business operations we have a system that is flexible enough just like our furniture to stick with us and grow with us and give us all the capabilities we re ever going to need learn how oracle

madison lawmakers listened to hours of testimony tuesday facing criticism on a host of bills they say are supposed to make hunting fishing and trapping more accessible to wisconsinites a bill seeking to establish a sandhill crane hunting season was one of a dozen discussed tuesday during a meeting of the senate committee on sporting heritage small business and rural issues the bills were a part of the sporting freedom package introduced by republicans and hunting advocacy group hunter nation earlier this month the package of 13 bills ranges in topics from stocking more pheasants and brook trout to simplifying turkey hunting seasons to reducing department of natural resources regulations for hunting trapping and fishing the bills also aim to establish a season for hunting sandhill cranes and to allow wisconsinites to carry concealed firearms without licenses though concealed carry was not addressed during tuesday s hearings republican lawmakers who introduced the bills earlier this month said the measures are meant to address policies gov tony evers and the dnr haven t listened to from outdoorsmen and women republicans last week held a press conference in support of the bills alongside hunter nation and spokesperson ted nugent who said hunting should have less regulations and more transparency the proposals drew criticisms tuesday afternoon especially for the lack of consultation with hunting and conservation groups such as the wisconsin conservation congress the wisconsin wildlife federation and other organizations such as trout unlimited or the national wild turkey federation the dnr expressed concerns over how being required to stock thousands more pheasants than they already do could raise costs for the agency and would require new infrastructure to facilitate the raising of two and a half times the number of birds currently being raised and stocked said eric lobnar the director of wildlife management for the dnr we re not capable of raising that many birds we would have to expand the hatchery and would need to significantly increase the budget he said tony blattler the chair of the wisconsin conservation congress said the group needs more time to look over the pieces of legislation and ask its members for their thoughts having not been consulted we have questions he said mike kuhr the chair of the trout unlimited wisconsin council asked lawmakers to reconsider their legislation requiring the dnr to stock brook trout in lake michigan every year he said members of the organization are concerned about the lack of funding for the dnr fisheries program already and adding 100 000 brook trout to the already stretched management plan might take money away from other species of fish such as salmon brook trout are cold water fish and typically thrive along the shore of lake michigan and in the streams and rivers that pour out into the great lake i m not sure our rivers are clean enough at this point to support this he said of the legislation todd kalish the deputy director of the dnr s fisheries program said stocking that many brook trout in the lake hasn t been evaluated and that the state already has a study going on that involves placing 50 000 of the fish into the lake each year the number of trout will be evaluated after the stocking last year this year and next year to see if the program is successful and worth continuing we need to know that it is a good return on investment he said sandhill crane debate takes center stage a number of people waited through the hours long hearing to testify on the proposed sandhill crane hunt this isn t the first time the legislature has approached the idea of a hunt a 2011 bill to allow sandhill hunting was introduced by former rep joel kleefisch r oconomowoc but didn t make it out of committee no similar bill has been introduced since but the idea of hunting the ribeye of the sky as nugent referred to the birds hasn t died one of the biggest concerns raised during the hearing was that sandhill cranes have taken a liking to corn and other seeds planted each spring across the state several farmers spoke about the devastation flocks of sandhill cranes can cause after seeds are planted in the spring damage that can cost thousands of dollars for farmers already stretched thin kelly wilfert whose family owns wilfert farms in two rivers said that without a hunt the birds could ruin the family s livelihood growing produce both for canning and for fresh sales she said her family experiences losses of up to 20 000 a year through destruction of crops by sandhill cranes deer and other animals we don t have a choice anymore she said if we don t do something about the significant damage sandhill cranes are causing we re going to be out of business before long rich beilfuss the president and ceo of the international crane foundation highlighted how the u s almost hunted the birds to extinction in the 1800s requiring the birds to be protected since the early 1900s hunting is not a solution for crop damage he said but there are solutions crop damage is absolutely a problem not only in wisconsin but worldwide and we re trying to find non lethal solutions beilfuss suggested more farmers use avipel a repellent made to keep sandhill cranes away from crops it s bitter for the bird it will eat a few seeds and react to it and then eat other things he said they re omnivorous birds they ll switch to other foods bruce ross the executive director of the wisconsin waterfowl association said science has shown that a sustainable and safe sandhill crane harvest would be possible in wisconsin as long as wildlife biologists from the dnr were brought in wisconsin is a breeding ground for the cranes he said which means special considerations should be taken but otherwise the state should be able to come up with a plan to safely harvest the birds he said the current legislation simply needs to be amended with input from the groups who have studied the birds and their populations there is no reason we can t have a sustainable sandhill crane hunt he said laura schulte can be reached at leschulte jrn com and on twitter at

united nations ap thirty top business leaders are seeking to encourage private investment to help the u n achieve development goals for 2030 including tackling climate change preserving the environment ending poverty promoting economic growth and improving health care and education u n secretary general antonio guterres who launched the global investors for sustainable development alliance two years ago said at a virtual meeting tuesday that he is counting on the group to catalyze greater investment for developing countries and make net zero carbon emissions and sustainability the core of everyone s policies and business models since its inception the alliance of business leaders says it has worked with the u n and other partners to develop standards tools and products to draw long term investment into sustainable development the u n s chief economist elliott harris said at a news conference after tuesday s virtual meeting that there has long been a perception that traditional investments will generate more of a financial return than a sustainable investment increasingly that is no longer true he argued sustainable investments do generate very healthy financial returns and have the advantage of the longer term contribution to enhance greater sustainability harris said one of the important aspects of the work the alliance is doing is the fact that we re not asking people to go off and do something that is against their own interest but rather persuading them that there is no financial disadvantage and that such investments contribute to a more sustainable future what is also important he said is that stock exchanges are putting out evidence that the return on sustainable investments is comparable the co chair of the group leila fourie who is group ceo of the johannesburg stock exchange said the group s underlying goal is to address the obstacles to shifting much larger sums of money to achieving the u n goals we are seeing tremendous interest by investors in products that adequately channel finance explicitly either to green blue or social ends she said referring to green investments to preserve the environment and address global warming blue investments to preserve the world s waterways and save the oceans and social investments to fund social initiatives to tackle a host of issues including responding to the covid 19 pandemic fourie said she is launching blue green and social bonds and we are also about to launch a transition bond to enable companies that are fossil fuel intensive to transition to a more green environment on the johannesburg exchange our social bond index has beaten our benchmark indices in returns that it offers the last three years she said new data has also shown that sustainable companies are less subject to sharp shocks and dislocations as a result for example of oil spills or regulatory fines fourie said over the past two years the alliance said it established a web based platform to enable investors to identify opportunities in developing markets that support sustainable development and a navigator to enable users to align their business activities with the u n goals it has also issued more than 60 recommendations for scaling up investment in the goals alliance co chair oliver bate ceo of germany s allianz se said that with the upcoming launch of a net zero climate exchange traded fund and a blended finance fund to invest in sustainable infrastructure we are moving towards creating real life opportunities to finance the u n goals the business leaders in the alliance come from about 24 countries around the world and include corporations big institutional investors stock exchanges and commercial banks and technology energy and manufacturing among them are the ceos of citigroup and bank of america in the u s ubs group in switzerland aware super in australia cimb in malaysia infosys in india and pal pensions in nigeria as well as the chairs of the agricultural bank of china emirates environmental group and sulamerica in brazil and the presidents of the government pension investment fund of japan and mexico s consejo mexicano de negocios

on october 23 and for the first time in indianapolis 500 history cars will race in a special 20 lap race minus drivers autonomous vehicles are controlled by numerous computer systems cameras and lidar similar to radar sensors teams will program the cars to run laps around ims using artificial intelligence indianapolis motor speedway is the most legendary race track in the world known for sheer speed and unadulterated horsepower advertisement advertisement saturday nearly a dozen modified dallara ii 15 indy lights chassis will take to the 2 5 mile oval and reach three digit speeds in a special 20 lap race but with one exception make that one major exception for the first time in ims history the cars will be missing one of the most vital components any type of motorsport event must have namely drivers that s right there will be no humans behind the wheel in fact none of the vehicles even have a driver s seat as ims plays host to the first ever indy autonomous challenge presented by indianapolis based non profit energy systems network esn after nearly two years of development and testing 10 teams made up of students from 21 universities and from nine different countries will match wits and technological expertise in the challenge for a 1 million top prize photo credit indy autonomous challenge in many ways saturday is about showcasing the culmination of two years of work by dozens of universities that have been advancing the state of the art in software to pilot autonomous vehicles and then validating that over a period of months in the real world with 60 plus days of track practices at nearby lucas oil raceway and ims esn president ceo paul mitchell told autoweek what you re going to see is high speed autonomous race cars circling the indianapolis motor speedway at speeds in excess of 100 miles an hour and that in and of itself is going to be both a record in the sense that no one s done it before but also there is this extra level of shock and awe that there s nobody driving the car advertisement advertisement while the cars will look and feel like race cars the technology being used will likely be seen much sooner on regular cars we drive on the streets but at the same time that s not to say some of the technology on display saturday won t find its way into indycar nascar stock cars and other motorsports vehicles sometime in the future we are interested in it because of the city and state s benefits because of the opportunity to remind people that this is a place where innovation has occurred historically and maybe we ll learn something from this technology development which could be helpful and relevant to indycar drivers in the future said mark miles president and ceo of penske entertainment which owns ims the indycar series and other entities but miles emphatically pointed out no matter how far advanced the technology goes forward in coming years one thing is for certain this has nothing to do with taking drivers out of cars miles said it s very easy for people to not understand or to not know how to juxtapose an autonomous racing vehicle being on the ims track on the one hand it s our absolute commitment to driving drivers and cars advertisement advertisement store twitter url for regexes set twitterurl amp twitter only supports status urls set supported twitterurl matches status if supported endif so we re not talking about taking drivers out of cars and we re not interested in some kind of ongoing autonomous racing again every time i explain that i m careful to make sure people understand that that s a way to assist drivers it s not to replace them for the layman autonomous vehicles are controlled by numerous computer systems cameras and lidar similar to radar sensors teams will program the cars to run laps around ims using artificial intelligence advertisement advertisement the challenge will be more than just a race or test countless indiana politicians and celebrities including gov eric holcomb u s senator todd young indianapolis mayor joe hogsett as well as officials from major original equipment manufacturers and over 400 high school students from across the state of indiana will all be on hand to view the proceedings parts of the challenge most notably the actual race itself are open to the public tickets are 10 apiece but must be purchased online by friday covid 19 protocols will also be in place for spectators there are also a number of well known advisors for the challenge including former race car driver lyn st james mythbusters host jamie hyneman sema vice president of technology john waraniak google self driving team founder sebastian thrun and several others juncos hollinger racing which competes in indycar indy lights and indy pro 2000 is also heavily involved providing assembly service and maintenance of the vehicles advertisement advertisement the challenge is only the second time such a large scale event of its type has been held back in 2004 the forerunner of today s autonomous vehicles the defense advanced research projects agency darpa grand challenge was held in the california desert in a sense this weekend s challenge is designed to take ai and autonomous vehicles to the next level with race cars as the platform to be utilized what makes things even more challenging for teams taking part is they only have one car to utilize unlike indycar or nascar teams cannot go to a back up car if a mishap occurs photo credit indy autonomous challenge i think if we would have done it without a venue like the indianapolis motor speedway we might have gotten some universities participate but we wouldn t have gotten 41 universities from 11 countries to answer that call mitchell said there s something about the compelling idea of developing technology and showcasing it at the most prestigious venue in that industry in the motorsports industry that s important advertisement advertisement the level of technology the kind of supercomputers the 360 degree perception systems the data that is coming off of these vehicles and then the robust ai and machine learning algorithms that are making decisions on these vehicles is far beyond what you have in today s traditional motorsports app competitions so there s a lot of interest because frankly some of this technology it s not just about making a driverless car or going around the indianapolis motor speedway it s about making commercial vehicles that we drive and perhaps vehicles that are in motorsports competitions like indy cars safer at faster speeds if you re going to get a future where indycar drivers can go 250 or 300 miles an hour they may need some help from a 360 degree perception humans can only perceive things that they can see or sense right you don t have eyes in the back your head how many times have racecar drivers said over the years boy i wish i had eyes in the back of my head well our cars do that they can see and perceive everything around them another reason for holding the challenge is especially noteworthy in today s world particularly with the emphasis on reducing global carbon emissions and climate change according to the challenge organizers the efficiency gains of automation could reduce overall vehicular energy consumption by 60 percent another key element is potentially reducing deaths and injuries from crashes particularly in the united states with 94 percent of the more than 40 000 annual automotive deaths in the u s caused by human factors advancements in vehicle automation have the potential to save tens of thousands of lives material from organizers states advertisement advertisement the one day challenge includes several symposiums and meetings prior to the main event a 20 lap race which will wrap up the day s eight plus hours of activities granted ims is known for having some of the racing world s most spectacular crashes over the years mitchell was asked how the teams will essentially keep their vehicles off ims s unforgiving walls photo credit indy autonomous challenge our approach to it really is not that different than the approach that that the indycar series or indy lights series takes in the sense that these cars really don t wreck all that differently mitchell said if they go into the wall they go into the wall advertisement advertisement one thing i will say is we re not yet pushing 230 miles an hour like indycar so you get a little bit of a benefit that if they get the wall at 100 mph or even 120 mph it s a little different than 230 mph i mean if you re not getting some level of accidents you re not pushing the envelope of what s possible and the teams aren t progressing luckily we haven t had a lot of these things happen maybe less than a handful and so on race day we ve got race control first of all if there s something that they re not seeing that s not looking correct if the cars starts wobbling in weird ways the team can communicate with race control they re seeing something we basically have a red button if you will that we can press that will shut the vehicle down and bring it to what we call safety stop the car s ability to follow race control commands we tried to approach it very much similar to a race control interaction with a human driven vehicle the nice thing is if there is an accident there s really no risk of a human being injured or certainly no risk of loss of life and those kinds of things holding the challenge at this point in time is also important because several racing organizations are adapting various technological improvements in their own race vehicles nascar will debut its state of the art generation 7 car next season indycar debuts its hybrid race car in 2023 nhra drag racing is also developing its own version of hybrid vehicles particularly those that may someday operate solely on electric battery power advertisement advertisement miles has long had an interest in autonomous vehicles and potential application of that technology to motorsports he was speaking at a symposium at stanford university a couple of years ago when the idea of the challenge came up miles quickly offered up ims as the host facility and has been significantly involved in the planning of the challenge i love the idea because i really do relish the fact of history that indianapolis motor speedway was founded and created to be a place where innovations could be developed miles said it s not about me but we ve all been involved here and things which brought different sectors of the community together not for profit economic development state city to advance the economy of the region while it s unlikely the challenge will become a yearly event at ims it will serve as a stepping off point to potentially have additional smaller competitions either in the u s or globally as the development of technology and ai continues to evolve first and foremost we want to get through the 23rd and see what happens mitchell said what i can say is that these are 1 million dollar plus race cars if you look at the amount of money that s invested in each one of them and the teams have put two years into the development of their autonomous technology so i don t think it s a one and done type of thing i don t think you run these vehicles one time at ims and then put them in a museum somewhere on the college campuses i think there s a lot of desire from our teams our sponsors the industry frankly to find ways to showcase these vehicles into the future whether that s in other venues whether that s back at ims it s all to be determined but it s definitely something that we re going to put some thought to on october 24 the day after this competition no one s really looking at hey let s do an autonomous racing series that s not what we re looking to do coming out of this it s about validating this technology in a motorsports platform and perhaps transitioning it to human driven cars because really where some of these technologies are the most beneficial is when they re combined with human capabilities on top of robotic capabilities follow autoweek contributor jerry bonkowski on

beijing china three astronauts from china have arrived at the country s new space station a major achievement for a national space program that is becoming one of the world s most advanced the three person crew zhai zhigang wang yaping and ye guanfu lifted off on a shenzhou 13 spacecraft launched by a long march 2f rocket from the jiuquan satellite launch center in the gobi desert inner mongolia according to the china manned space agency the spacecraft docked at tiangong space station about six and a half hours after launch the team will live and work at the station for 183 days or just about six months testing the station s technology and conducting spacewalks the mission will be a key opportunity for chinese astronauts to become familiar with long term space missions and enable them to help prepare future astronauts in the first place any crewed mission is significant if only because space travel by humans remains a risky endeavor said dean cheng senior research fellow at the davis institute for national security and foreign policy as reported by cnn for the chinese this is still early in their human spaceflight effort as they have been doing this for less than 20 years and for fewer than 10 missions if the chinese maintain this pace it reflects a major shift in the mission tempo for their human spaceflight efforts he added u s political objections and legislative restrictions have prohibited chinese astronauts from going to the international space station leading china to establish a long term goal of building its own station some countries such as russia have reached out to collaborate with china but it is not clear whether the european union will cooperate a reason space research cannot be separated from politics and why the issue is so complicated is because the chinese space program is heavily influenced and its human and lunar programs are overseen by the chinese military cheng stressed however david burbach associate professor of national security affairs at the u s naval war college said many american allies are willing to engage with china on space exploration and the u s probably does not gain much from taking such a hard line as quoted by cnn american assistance might no longer be needed by china which is significantly ahead of europe and catching up fast with the u s he added the development of china s manned spaceflight is based on our own plan we have our strategy and our plan said lin xiqiang deputy director general of the china manned space agency according to cnn

for nearly fifty years the town of craco in southern italy has stood uninhabited here dark windows look out at potential travelers like empty eye sockets and the streets and buildings of this medieval town seem to have literally been vacated overnight left to crumble in decay craco was once a monastic center a feudal town and center of education with a university castle church and plazas today thanks to the dramatic landscape and unique atmosphere craco has been the set of many movies including saving grace james bond quantum of solace and the hanging of judas scene in mel gibson s the passion of the christ craco a medieval village with ties to the bronze age craco is a former medieval village located in the earthquake prone basilicata region of italy about 40 km 27 miles inland from the gulf of taranto at the instep of the boot of italy the settlement occupies a rock formation above the surrounding hills with its architecture neatly built into the landscape perched strategically on top of a 400 meter 1 300 ft high cliff overlooking the arid countryside of southern italy this ghost town once provided panoramic views and warnings of potential attackers the city was founded around 540 ad by greeks who had moved inland from the coast of basilicata back then craco was called montedoro tombs have been found here dating to the 8th century which suggests that the original settlement dates back to the iron age the first written account mentioning craco dates back to 1060 ad when the land was owned by archbishop arnaldo bishop of tricarico he called the area grachium which means from the little plowed field the oldest building of craco the norman tower was built in 1040 and many of craco s buildings date back to medieval times norman tower craco itlay michela r cc by nc nd 2 0 from 1154 to 1168 the control of the village passed to eberto who established the first feudal control over the town in 1179 roberto di pietrapertos became the ruler of craco and in 1276 a university was established it was during this period that the landmark castle tower was built under the direction of attendolo sforza and in 1293 under federico ii it became a prison by the 15th century four large plazas had developed in the town including the palazzo maronna palazzo grossi palazzo carbone and palazzo simonetti the rise and fall of craco the population of craco grew from 450 in 1277 to 2 590 in 1561 and averaged around 1 500 in succeeding centuries the construction of the monastery of st peter in 1630 helped establish a permanent monastic order in an agricultural community built largely on the production of grain oil vegetables wine and cotton the monastery helped drive the economy through the introduction of science and religion however in 1656 a plague struck craco killing hundreds and reducing the population significantly towards the end of the 19th century the city reached its maximum expansion limits a severe famine due to poor agricultural conditions caused a mass migration of craco s population about 1 300 inhabitants to north america between the years 1892 and 1922 since craco was built on a hill composed of clay rich soil of various types of red green and dark grey clay with different levels of drainage the terrain was highly unstable this caused craco to be affected by many landslides of natural origin in 1600 1805 1857 and 1933 surviving for over a thousand years the town survived the plagues and its share of thieves and bandits but finally succumbed to natural disaster when landslides occurred during the 1950s up through the early 1970s despite the precarious living conditions many of the crachesi inhabitants of craco were still very much attached to their beautiful medieval town and refused to leave in the 1950 s the

as the world s stock markets prepare for a winter of uncertainty one sector in particular might be about to feel the chill after a stunning year in 2020 technology stocks have just endured their worst month since the covid crash with tech heavy american index the nasdaq 100 falling 5 91 per cent in september amazon apple and alphabet previously known as google have lost 3 2 per cent 7 28 per cent and 2 24 per cent since mid september and social media giant facebook has been left nursing a 100 million loss in value after a barrage of bad headlines meanwhile wall street s best known tech fund ark innovation has fallen 26 per cent since february as big investors fear a wider change in fortune tech slump amazon apple and alphabet previously known as google have lost 3 2 per cent 7 28 per cent and 2 24 per cent since mid september legendary investor michael burry whose bet against the u s sub prime mortgage market was immortalised in the 2015 blockbuster the big short is now betting against the fund so is big tech facing a squeeze and will it affect your portfolio first it s worth noting that a slowing of momentum for tech stocks wasn t unexpected thanks to worldwide lockdowns 2020 became a boom year for internet firms with the nasdaq 100 growing by nearly 47 per cent in one year whether these dizzying valuations can hold up has been a topic of hot debate with many predicting that a rebalancing towards offline stocks is inevitable a wall of cash hit the stock market when markets fell 18 months ago and a lot of it has been directed at fashionable areas says rob morgan chief analyst with the investment platform charles stanley we have already seen a big slide in many clean energy stocks for instance simply because valuations got detached from reality indeed such a realisation seems to have already arrived for certain tech companies at its high point in october 2020 video conferencing platform zoom was up 722 per cent in ten months its share price has fallen by more than 22 per cent this year and 51 per cent since its peak meanwhile the ftse listed cryptocurrency miner argo blockchain whose stratospheric rise briefly made it a popular pick for diy investors has plummeted by 55 per cent since february beyond these examples the tech sector is particularly exposed to the now omnipresent threat of inflation when inflation rises investors want higher returns on their money which brings asset prices down says mr morgan on top of that the valuations of tech companies are often based on expectations of their future profits and the belief that they can continue to borrow cheaply should central banks hike rates to keep inflation in check it could hit profit forecasts making tech firms less attractive thanks to worldwide lockdowns 2020 became a boom year for internet companies with the nasdaq 100 growing by nearly 47 per cent in one year but mr morgan says that investors should be cautious about drawing sweeping conclusions about the whole tech sector he points out that the valuations of some of the largest tech companies such as microsoft and alphabet are only slightly higher than the u s average the sector as a whole still enjoys big tailwinds such as more businesses looking to store their data on cloud services he says and of course the most dramatic moves in prices are typically down to factors affecting that company in particular as the facebook example shows the social media firm s stock price has dropped by almost 13 per cent since september 1 following a series of damaging leaks around its safety practices then came a huge server outage however facebook remains highly profitable and has shaken off similar slumps in the past including a 20 per cent plunge at the height of a data sharing scandal in 2018 some tech investors also consider short term volatility to be part of the price for the high returns the industry can provide edinburgh based baillie gifford one of the uk s best known tech advocates defines its philosophy as seeking out those superstar companies who can outperform the market when that works as happened with the company s early stakes in tesla and facebook it pays off handsomely that should be more than enough the theory goes to cover the failed bets so how have its funds fared this month its super popular scottish mortgage investment trust has risen by 4 37 per cent over the past month even as the nasdaq fell the trust had already reduced its holdings in tesla and facebook pivoting towards biotech companies including vaccine maker moderna longer term investors have been well rewarded with 10 000 invested five years ago worth 43 000 now this is money podcast beware fixed rate savings trap and secrets from an isa millionaire the baillie gifford american fund has fared less well falling 7 9 per cent in a month like scottish mortgage though its longer term record is enviable turning 10 000 into 42 000 in five years whether they hold their value will depend in part on whether september s tech slump turns into a full on correction but the events of the last few weeks have already provided a useful refresher course on some of the basic laws of investing those are always diversify your portfolio only invest in companies or funds you understand and invest for the long term while the u s tech industry has performed well and remains a vital part of any retail portfolio it s risky to have more than 15 per cent of your money in one market many investors may be more exposed to the tech sector than they realise as its runaway performance has made it popular with fund managers if you find you have several funds backing the usual suspects amazon tesla microsoft it may be worth investing some profits elsewhere and finally as the zoom boom demonstrates be extremely cautious about chasing last week s winners you might end up on the wrong side of the peak moneymail dailymail co uk

the 27 year old refrigerator freezer in our garage started leaking given it s an extra appliance we re fortunate to have and we don t want to fork over a lot of money to buy a new one we called our repair man he said it can be fixed it needs freon which is a lot cheaper than buying a new refrigerator upon further inspection he says it also needs new door hinges which is why the freezer door kept opening turning our frozen food into mush the sticker price to fix this antique was getting higher and higher so we decided to look for a new one easier said than done for starters thanks to supply chain shortages very little is available take your pick costco lowes home depot walmart best buy and private dealers are all out unless of course you want to spend a large mortgage payment those products seem to be more available when i finally did find a reasonably priced refrigerator that was actually in stock it turns out it doesn t come with handles what that s what i exclaimed we re not talking about recessed handles the manufacturer literally charges you extra for door handles i wondered it if came with shelves it did but when you add the cost of handles shipping taxes and few other extras you d be better off to spend a mortgage payment and get one that comes with everything this supply chain mess is a real headache for consumers most of us have felt it one way or another my girlfriend has been waiting nine months for a new dishwasher in the heat of the summer when people s air conditioners broke they couldn t find parts to repair them much less get new ones the long awaited new apple iphones are delayed thanks to a global chip shortage like when the pandemic started my husband and i couldn t find paper towels at the supermarket this week perhaps in some cases some luxuries can wait but diapers baby formula medical supplies and lifesaving medications cannot an article in economy reports 60 of u s adults say they haven t been able to get a product they wanted in the past two months and nearly the same number of consumers say they ve experienced significant delays in receiving products so what s going on there have been endless stories explaining how the pandemic has impacted supply chains around the world some of these stories are very well done many however are overly complicated diving into too much detail and industry jargon for the average person to fully understand they use words like shifting bottlenecks multi tiered chains and scales and scopes as a former journalist who now helps companies and spokespeople make sense of information for others i decided to give it a crack when covid first forced us indoors we had no idea how long we d be stuck at home many of us panicked and stocked up on multiple supplies companies also stockpiled which depleted inventories and caused shortages now 19 months later truckers farmers and manufacturers are struggling to keep up with the demand but it s more complicated than that think of it this way if you order a new television the parts to make that television may come from multiple countries if the countries don t have what they need to put those televisions together production slows or even stops and everything backs up it s like standing in line at the store if you re in line and three of five cashiers walk out you re going to be lined up much longer than you anticipated as explained in forbes sometimes it s humans that are missing like i just described over 4 million people reportedly walked off their jobs this past august other times it s a physical problem steve wolf a distribution consumer products expert told me it s a domino effect involving multiple factors a decrease in the supply of available cargo ships early on during the pandemic when consumer demand dropped caused shipping lines to cancel many of their routes between asia and north america that means goods weren t being transported and empty containers weren t being picked up that led to a shortage of equipment specifically shipping containers because these empty containers weren t being picked up they couldn t be taken where needed to fill with products that have to be shipped compounding the problem is the price of a 40 foot container increased nearly sixfold covid and its effect on labor in china caused a shortage of truckers and trucks there as well additionally when china started moving again other countries still faced lockdowns and restrictions this resulted in a backlog of vessels at american ports exacerbated by a shortage of port workers and truckers here simply put all of this has led to a shipping slowdown which has held up our appliances electronics raw materials and foods lumber needed to build houses is in short supply and wood used to make paper products like toilet paper and paper towels was scarce for a while prompting hoarding and price gauging because supply and demand are a bit out of whack in some cases manufacturers are now paying higher prices to get what they need and they re passing those costs onto us how long this crunch will last is uncertain some say we ll be dealing with it for another six months steve wolf doesn t see a resolution for at least a year in a world that has become so politically divided where many of us can t see eye to eye one thing seems certain from computer chips to coffee to cell phones to some of our basic everyday needs we ve all been cast in the same play if one of us can t perform the play is in jeopardy yet like cogs in a wheel when we communicate like a well rehearsed troupe we re like a fine tuned production that performs well together and everything falls into place karen friedman is a professional communication coach speaker and chief improvement officer at karen friedman
