updated february 24 2022 at 1 57 pm et the long feared invasion of ukraine by russia jolted markets sent energy prices higher and prompted promises of a new round of consequences for russia signals that even people out of immediate harm s way will be affected by what threatens to become the biggest war in europe since world war ii here s how the invasion will have ripple effects far outside the borders of the conflict there could be collateral damage from sanctions on russia this week president biden announced a first tranche of economic sanctions on two russian banks with about 80 billion in assets and five russian oligarchs and their families and prohibited u s entities from purchasing russian sovereign debt more sanctions are expected to follow in response to what biden said is a needless act of aggression against ukraine and global peace and security brendan smialowski afp via getty images afp via getty images president biden speaks about russia and ukraine in the east room of the white house on tuesday the forthcoming sanctions could include restrictions on major russian banks that would dramatically affect russia s ability to conduct international business severe u s sanctions could drive up prices for everyday russians or cause russia s currency or markets to crash because the u s does not rely much on trade with russia it is somewhat insulated from direct consequences europe is more directly affected but certain sectors of the u s economy rely on highly specific russian exports primarily raw commodities the premise of sanctions is to hurt the other guy more than you hurt your own interests but that does not mean there will not be some collateral damage said doug rediker a partner at international capital strategies energy prices could rise in the early hours following russia s invasion brent crude oil was trading at more than 100 per barrel for the first time since 2014 and another benchmark west texas intermediate rose nearly 5 to more than 96 per barrel russia is a major exporter of oil and natural gas especially to europe as a result officials have reportedly shied away from severe sanctions on russian energy exports but there are other ways the energy market could be disrupted michael sohn ap ap nearly 40 of the natural gas used by the european union comes from russia president biden said prior to russia s invasion of ukraine that the not yet operational nord stream 2 pipeline would not move ahead in the event of an invasion for one russia could choose to cut off or limit oil and gas exports to europe as retaliation for sanctions nearly 40 of the natural gas used by the european union comes from russia and no european country imports more than germany a key ally of the united states even if russia chooses not to limit exports supplies could still be affected by the conflict in ukraine because multiple pipelines run through the country carrying gas from russia to europe they could simply be casualties of a military invasion rediker said either way if europe s natural gas supply is pinched that could cause energy prices which have already been climbing to rise even further and even though the u s imports relatively little oil from russia oil prices are set by the global market meaning local prices could rise anyway there s a geopolitical premium or call it a fear premium in the price of oil daniel yergin vice chairman of ihs markit told morning edition an expectation that as this crisis spirals worse that supplies of oil from russia are going to be disrupted other industries from food to cars might also be hurt russia is a major exporter of rare earth minerals and heavy metals such as titanium used in airplanes russia supplies about a third of the world s palladium a rare metal used in catalytic converters and its price has soared in recent weeks over fears of a conflict ukrainian economic output and industry will likely be significantly disrupted the country is a major source of neon which is used in manufacturing semiconductors as a result u s officials have warned various sectors including the semiconductor and aerospace industries to brace for supply chain disruptions fertilizer is produced in major quantities in both ukraine and russia disruptions to those exports would mostly affect agriculture in europe but food prices around the world could rise as a result global markets could drop the invasion rattled investors wednesday with dow futures down more than 2 before the markets opened in the united states markets across asia also dropped the invasion sent the prices of traditional investment safe havens higher with gold up more than 1 5 overnight markets are fundamentally not prepared for a land war in europe in the 21st century rediker said it s something people just have not contemplated the u s stock market has already been unusually volatile in recent weeks churning over inflation moves by the federal reserve to curb its stimulus programs and the looming conflict in ukraine historically the market has bounced back relatively quickly after geopolitical events that s what s most likely today too analysts say so the effect on people with 401 k accounts may be short term but if the conflict causes long lasting disruption of energy markets and other exports investors could rethink that conventional wisdom you re potentially at a point where not only are we looking at russia potentially invading ukraine and sanctions and countermeasures but you are also looking at a rise of china that doesn t necessarily agree with the american perspective on the world anyway rediker said last week before the invasion are we looking at a point in which some of the major premises that people take for granted have to be reassessed russia could launch disruptive cyberattacks another way russia could respond to u s sanctions is through cyberattacks and influence campaigns various federal agencies including the treasury and the department of homeland security have warned of possible cyberattacks on targets like big banks and power grid operators they have been warning everyone about russia s very specific tactics about the possibility of attacks on critical infrastructure katerina sedova a researcher at georgetown university s center for security and emerging technology told npr russian cyberattacks have targeted ukraine relentlessly in recent years including attacks on the capital city of kyiv s power grid in 2015 and 2016 but a major escalation could shift focus to u s targets sedova pointed to the russian state backed attack on the it software company solarwinds and a ransomware attack that shut down the colonial pipeline for six days as examples of how major russian cyberattacks could disrupt u s operations the biden administration said it does not believe the russian government was involved in the pipeline attack power grids hospitals and local governments could all be targets she said for now sedova said she is more worried about subtler attacks like influence campaigns that aim to sow discord between us and our allies in our resolve to act jointly against russia oftentimes cyber operations go hand in hand with influence she said they re targeting a change of decision making a change in policy in that direction a change in public opinion a major invasion would likely spark a refugee crisis anatolii stepanov afp via getty images afp via getty images a serviceman with ukraine s military forces walks along a trench on the front line with russia backed separatists not far from novoluhanske in ukraine s donetsk region on feb 16 the invasion could send 1 million to 5 million refugees fleeing ukraine u s officials and humanitarian agencies have warned it will be a continent wide humanitarian disaster with millions of refugees seeking protection in neighbouring european countries agnès callamard secretary general of amnesty international said last month in statement poland which shares a border with ukraine and is already home to more than a million ukrainians would likely see the most refugees polish interior minister mariusz kaminski said his country was preparing for an influx of refugees from ukraine the u s military says that the thousands of soldiers deployed to poland this month are prepared to assist with a large scale evacuation assistance with evacuation flow is something they could do and could do quite well they are going to be working with polish authorities on what that looks like and how they would handle that defense department spokesperson john kirby said last week at the largest scale a refugee crisis would not be contained to europe the u s would likely see refugees seeking asylum too copyright 2022 npr to see more visit

discussion and analysis in particular for more detail on the company s financial results dividend policy newcrest looks to pay ordinary dividends that are sustainable over time having regard to its cash flow generation its reinvestment options in the business and external growth opportunities its financial policy metrics and its balance sheet strength newcrest targets a total annual dividend payout of 30 60 of free cash flow generated for the financial year with the annual total dividends being at least us15 cents per share on a full year basis having regard to the abovementioned considerations the newcrest board has determined that an interim fully franked dividend of us 7 5 cents per share will be paid on thursday 31 march 2022 the record date for entitlement is monday 28 february 2022 the financial impact of the interim dividend amounting to 61 million based on newcrest s existing issued capital at 31 december 2021 has not been recognised in the consolidated financial statements for the half year the company s dividend reinvestment plan remains in place the declaration of any future dividend remains at the discretion of the newcrest board having regard to circumstances prevailing at that time covid 19 update to date newcrest has not experienced any material covid 19 related disruptions to production or to the supply of goods and services some project activities have experienced a level of disruption with efforts being made to minimise their impact on the overall cost and schedule the operating cost of managing covid 19 risks in the current period was approximately 32 million of which 27 million was related to lihir which included additional costs related to flights transport rosters leave screening and testing newcrest now expects that the total cost of managing covid 19 for the 2022 financial year will be in the order of 50 60 million up from the 35 45 million estimated at the start of the financial year the increase in covid related costs is driven by lihir and reflects the impacts of government restrictions on travel absenteeism isolation requirements and logistical challenges there remains a risk of covid 19 disruptions across all operations and this continues to be closely managed all of newcrest s operations have business continuity plans and contingencies in place which seek to minimise disruptions to the operations in the event that a significant number of operational employees and or contractors contract the virus it is expected that these plans will enable operations to effectively manage the covid 19 risk to production schedules and if there are any material impacts newcrest will inform the market in line with its continuous disclosure obligations summary of half year financial results statutory profit and underlying profit were both 298 million in the current period underlying profit of 298 million was lower than the prior period primarily due to the planned replacement and upgrade of the cadia sag mill motor completed in november 2021 and lower production at lihir due to the expected decline in grade as the mine plan transitioned into phase 15 heavy rainfall limiting access to high grade ore additional pumping has been installed and major maintenance activity the current period reflected lower gold and copper sales volumes driven by lower production a lower realised gold price higher concentrate freight costs due to the global tightness and challenges in the sea freight market and the unfavourable impact on operating costs from the strengthening of the australian dollar against the us dollar operating costs were also impacted by labour and consumable cost pressures due to rising demand constrained supply and underlying commodity price increases newcrest continues to collaborate with its suppliers to identify ways to manage these cost pressures this was partially offset by a higher realised copper price lower income tax expense as a result of the company s decreased profitability in the current period lower overall operating costs due to the lower sales volumes lower gold price and volume linked costs such as royalties a lower depreciation expense and

period primarily due to the lower earnings ebitda unfavourable net working capital movements and increased investment in major capital projects at cadia red chris havieron and lihir that underpin the

pre feasibility studies pfs to the feasibility stage with works advancing on all projects the projections generated by each of the pfs studies indicate compelling rates of return a material improvement in newcrest s operating margin and cash flow and a significant reduction in newcrest s aisc per ounce newcrest intends to fund all four projects through its internal cash flow generation and prudent use of its strong balance sheet in addition the newcrest board approved total expenditure of 182 million22 for the west dome stage 5 cutback at telfer in august 2021 red chris red chris is a joint venture between newcrest 70 and imperial metals corporation 30 newcrest acquired its interest in and operatorship of red chris on 15 august 2019 in october 2021 the newcrest board endorsed the red chris block cave pfs and approved its progression to the feasibility stage the study confirms newcrest s original investment thesis of unlocking the underground portion of this tier 1 deposit by leveraging newcrest s industry leading block caving expertise and developing the asset to become a mainstay of newcrest s portfolio for decades to come the feasibility study is expected to be completed in the second half of fy2323 as noted in the study there are significant opportunities to enhance these results including but not limited to the early mining of the high grade pods in the east zone and the emerging opportunity associated with the discovery of the east ridge zone which is outside of newcrest s initial mineral resource estimate and other exploration results24 newcrest continued its significant drilling campaign at red chris during the period with eight rigs currently operational the development of the exploration decline and support infrastructure also advanced during the period with the decline having progressed to 765 metres as at 25 january 2022 havieron project the havieron project is located 45km east of newcrest s telfer operation and is operated by newcrest under a joint venture agreement jva with greatland gold plc greatland the findings of the havieron pfs stage 1 were released in october 2021 and the newcrest board approved the progression of the study to the feasibility stage following delivery of the pfs newcrest is entitled to a 70 joint venture interest in the havieron project newcrest has an option to acquire an additional 5 joint venture interest for fair value exercisable during the 12 months from 12 december 2021 in december 2021 newcrest provided notice to greatland to begin the process under the jva to seek to agree the option price for the additional 5 as noted in the study significant upside opportunities are being evaluated the deposit is still open in multiple directions with the potential to increase the scale and life of the project as well as presenting the opportunity to adopt alternative lower cost mining methods24 the feasibility study is expected to be completed in the december 2022 quarter23 newcrest continued to progress its extensive drilling program at havieron during the period with eight drill rigs in operation growth drilling continues to extend the high grade mineralisation outside of the initial inferred mineral resource estimate including high grade extensions to the south east crescent zone at depth as well as high grade crescent style mineralisation within extensions of the eastern breccia the development of the exploration decline also continued during the period with 277 metres complete as at 25 january 2022 with progress impacted by highly variable and more challenging ground conditions than expected recent additional geotechnical investigation has also highlighted the potential for ground conditions to have an impact on development going forward work is currently ongoing to understand the impact on project schedule as well as to assess options to recover some of these delays first ore continues to be expected in fy2423 and further updates will be provided once this work is complete opportunities continue to be pursued for mine life extensions in both the open pit and underground at telfer with the objective of continued utilisation of the telfer plant as havieron and other potential feed sources are introduced in the future24 blind boring of the first ventilation shaft has commenced key contracts for the feasibility study have been awarded and works to progress the necessary approvals and permits that are required to commence the development of an operating underground mine and associated infrastructure at the project are ongoing25 lihir phase 14a pre feasibility study in october 2021 the newcrest board approved the lihir phase 14a pfs enabling the commencement of the feasibility study and early works program phase 14a accelerates the realisation of newcrest s aspiration for lihir to be a 1 million ounce plus per annum producer from fy2426 which will also benefit landowners all lihirians and papua new guinea phase 14a has increased lihir s ore reserves and will bring forward higher grades to improve gold production and operational flexibility by establishing an additional independent ore source23 significant activities completed in the december 2021 quarter included trial ground support anchor drilling and installation completion of access to commence drainage works and the procurement of mobile fleet equipment results from the ground support trials have been positive and have been incorporated into civil engineering designs the feasibility study is expected to be completed in the fourth quarter of fy2223 cadia pc1 2 pre feasibility study in august 2021 the newcrest board approved the cadia pc1 2 pfs enabling the commencement of the feasibility study and early works program the pfs updates and defines a significant portion of cadia s future mine plan with the development of pc1 2 accounting for 20 of cadia s current ore reserves the study delivers attractive returns with an optimised mine design expected to deliver higher gold and copper grades and enable the deferral of capital expenditure in the medium term cadia processing capacity approval in december 2021 newcrest received approval from the new south wales department of planning industry environment for a modification to increase the permitted processing capacity of cadia from 32mtpa to 35mtpa11 the expansion to a plant capacity of 35mtpa is

vaccinations and boosters but even as public health efforts end patients can take their own steps to protect themselves hutch clinical researcher and infectious disease expert dr catherine liu said first and foremost individuals who are vulnerable should make sure they get all necessary vaccinations â some of the patients in our cancer center havenâ t gotten their boosters â she said in a recent science says event â for immunocompromised individuals weâ re recommending three doses of the primary series and a fourth dose as a booster â this advice echoes the centers for disease control and prevention which revised their guidelines in early february according to new guidance â people who are moderately or severely immunocompromised should receive a booster dose at least three months after the last third dose of an mrna covid 19 vaccine â previous guidelines called for a five month break between the last dose and the booster â iâ ve taken every shot â said ben young a 67 year old prostate cancer survivor and liver transplant recipient who takes immunosuppressing drugs each day to ensure his body doesnâ t reject the organ â i had my third and now iâ m getting ready to do my fourth it was recommended by the transplant clinic â young who lives in everett wash and works as the director of marketing and grants for the communities of color coalition said when it comes to people being considerate of his compromised health â some are and others arenâ t â â is he bothered by the very vocal anti maskers anti vaxxers or others who believe their freedoms are being trampled by state or federal mandates â i donâ t want to get caught up in that exceptionalism â he said â i want others to treat me as if theyâ re treating themselves if they do that then iâ m good iâ m going to protect myself and if i see itâ s a bad situationâ â or close to a bad situationâ â iâ m going to stay away â preventive therapies for the vulnerable in addition to vaccines and boosters new options are becoming available â new york educator edie miller diagnosed with a slow growing lymphoma in 2012 went through months of chemotherapy when her disease became aggressive last summer â iâ ve barely left my house except for hospital visits â she said â the covid death rate for people like me is about 15 â fortunately millerâ s fragile health qualified her for a prophylactic long acting monoclonal antibody combo called evusheld specifically designed for moderate or severely immunocompromised people â i got a call from my oncologist s office on a sunday evening that they had 120 doses and i happily got the injections â said the 61 year old who is fully vaccinated â â one in each cheek i go for a follow up dose in 6 months they told me it boosts my covid immunity by up to 77 â infectious disease expert liu encouraged other vulnerable patients to ask about the drug which is intended for those who have not been exposed to or have covid 19 â it reduces the risk of developing symptomatic covid by 80 â liu said â itâ s not a replacement for vaccination but it supplements it offering another layer of protection if people can access it â the challenge is the supply is limited a familiar refrain in a time of shortages and supply chain issues boonyaratanakornkit reiterated the drugâ s effectivenessâ â and its short supplyâ â adding other important caveats â you have to be extremely high risk and even then you may need to be put on a wait list â he said â and patients with heart disease may have a slightly higher rate of heart complications after evusheld as compared to placebo but it is an option to provide protection against covid 19 â additional anti covid 19 drugs are under study in clinical trials including the monoclonal antibody sotrovimab approved for treatment in an emergency use authorization by the food and drug administration boonyaratanakornkit is one of the principal investigators on a phase 1 fred hutch seattle cancer care alliance trial testing sotrovimabâ s effectiveness as a covid 19 preventive in blood stem cell transplant patients new treatments and preventive therapies are still sorely needed he said because the virus continues to mutate rendering some treatmentsâ â like the monoclonal antibody made by regeneronâ â unusable â the fda revoked the eua for â regeneron as treatment â he said â if the virus is resistant to it as treatment it will be resistant for prevention as a result we had to close a study using the regeneron antibodies for prevention and have started a new one with sotrovimab which is thought to still be effective for the main omicron variant â but the field he stressed is changing very quickly â the research team which includes hutch scientists drs alpana waghmare and michael boeckh is giving sotrovimab as an infusion to transplant patients before their â conditioning â rigorous chemotherapy and or radiation to eliminate a patientâ s immune system before transplanting a new healthy one the trial dubbed covidmab is now open and currently enrolling patients will be followed for six months to determine the drugâ s efficacy read more about covid 19 clinical trials here â after a transplant it can take months for our immune systems to recover â boonyaratanakornkit said â the hope is a single dose provides months of protection thatâ s the purpose of the studyâ â to see how long the antibodies last â a larger additional trial of the same drug may be in the works as well he said something he welcomes â our patients are at greater risk because they donâ t respond to a vaccine as robustly â he said â so having another preventative measure to tide them through the pandemic especially when there are surges of variants and this pattern of waxing and waning outbreaks like weâ re seeing now is crucial â

updated february 24 2022 at 1 57 pm et the long feared invasion of ukraine by russia jolted markets sent energy prices higher and prompted promises of a new round of consequences for russia signals that even people out of immediate harm s way will be affected by what threatens to become the biggest war in europe since world war ii here s how the invasion will have ripple effects far outside the borders of the conflict there could be collateral damage from sanctions on russia this week president biden announced a first tranche of economic sanctions on two russian banks with about 80 billion in assets and five russian oligarchs and their families and prohibited u s entities from purchasing russian sovereign debt more sanctions are expected to follow in response to what biden said is a needless act of aggression against ukraine and global peace and security brendan smialowski afp via getty images afp via getty images president biden speaks about russia and ukraine in the east room of the white house on tuesday the forthcoming sanctions could include restrictions on major russian banks that would dramatically affect russia s ability to conduct international business severe u s sanctions could drive up prices for everyday russians or cause russia s currency or markets to crash because the u s does not rely much on trade with russia it is somewhat insulated from direct consequences europe is more directly affected but certain sectors of the u s economy rely on highly specific russian exports primarily raw commodities the premise of sanctions is to hurt the other guy more than you hurt your own interests but that does not mean there will not be some collateral damage said doug rediker a partner at international capital strategies energy prices could rise in the early hours following russia s invasion brent crude oil was trading at more than 100 per barrel for the first time since 2014 and another benchmark west texas intermediate rose nearly 5 to more than 96 per barrel russia is a major exporter of oil and natural gas especially to europe as a result officials have reportedly shied away from severe sanctions on russian energy exports but there are other ways the energy market could be disrupted michael sohn ap ap nearly 40 of the natural gas used by the european union comes from russia president biden said prior to russia s invasion of ukraine that the not yet operational nord stream 2 pipeline would not move ahead in the event of an invasion for one russia could choose to cut off or limit oil and gas exports to europe as retaliation for sanctions nearly 40 of the natural gas used by the european union comes from russia and no european country imports more than germany a key ally of the united states even if russia chooses not to limit exports supplies could still be affected by the conflict in ukraine because multiple pipelines run through the country carrying gas from russia to europe they could simply be casualties of a military invasion rediker said either way if europe s natural gas supply is pinched that could cause energy prices which have already been climbing to rise even further and even though the u s imports relatively little oil from russia oil prices are set by the global market meaning local prices could rise anyway there s a geopolitical premium or call it a fear premium in the price of oil daniel yergin vice chairman of ihs markit told morning edition an expectation that as this crisis spirals worse that supplies of oil from russia are going to be disrupted other industries from food to cars might also be hurt russia is a major exporter of rare earth minerals and heavy metals such as titanium used in airplanes russia supplies about a third of the world s palladium a rare metal used in catalytic converters and its price has soared in recent weeks over fears of a conflict ukrainian economic output and industry will likely be significantly disrupted the country is a major source of neon which is used in manufacturing semiconductors as a result u s officials have warned various sectors including the semiconductor and aerospace industries to brace for supply chain disruptions fertilizer is produced in major quantities in both ukraine and russia disruptions to those exports would mostly affect agriculture in europe but food prices around the world could rise as a result global markets could drop the invasion rattled investors wednesday with dow futures down more than 2 before the markets opened in the united states markets across asia also dropped the invasion sent the prices of traditional investment safe havens higher with gold up more than 1 5 overnight markets are fundamentally not prepared for a land war in europe in the 21st century rediker said it s something people just have not contemplated the u s stock market has already been unusually volatile in recent weeks churning over inflation moves by the federal reserve to curb its stimulus programs and the looming conflict in ukraine historically the market has bounced back relatively quickly after geopolitical events that s what s most likely today too analysts say so the effect on people with 401 k accounts may be short term but if the conflict causes long lasting disruption of energy markets and other exports investors could rethink that conventional wisdom you re potentially at a point where not only are we looking at russia potentially invading ukraine and sanctions and countermeasures but you are also looking at a rise of china that doesn t necessarily agree with the american perspective on the world anyway rediker said last week before the invasion are we looking at a point in which some of the major premises that people take for granted have to be reassessed russia could launch disruptive cyberattacks another way russia could respond to u s sanctions is through cyberattacks and influence campaigns various federal agencies including the treasury and the department of homeland security have warned of possible cyberattacks on targets like big banks and power grid operators they have been warning everyone about russia s very specific tactics about the possibility of attacks on critical infrastructure katerina sedova a researcher at georgetown university s center for security and emerging technology told npr russian cyberattacks have targeted ukraine relentlessly in recent years including attacks on the capital city of kyiv s power grid in 2015 and 2016 but a major escalation could shift focus to u s targets sedova pointed to the russian state backed attack on the it software company solarwinds and a ransomware attack that shut down the colonial pipeline for six days as examples of how major russian cyberattacks could disrupt u s operations the biden administration said it does not believe the russian government was involved in the pipeline attack power grids hospitals and local governments could all be targets she said for now sedova said she is more worried about subtler attacks like influence campaigns that aim to sow discord between us and our allies in our resolve to act jointly against russia oftentimes cyber operations go hand in hand with influence she said they re targeting a change of decision making a change in policy in that direction a change in public opinion a major invasion would likely spark a refugee crisis anatolii stepanov afp via getty images afp via getty images a serviceman with ukraine s military forces walks along a trench on the front line with russia backed separatists not far from novoluhanske in ukraine s donetsk region on feb 16 the invasion could send 1 million to 5 million refugees fleeing ukraine u s officials and humanitarian agencies have warned it will be a continent wide humanitarian disaster with millions of refugees seeking protection in neighbouring european countries agnès callamard secretary general of amnesty international said last month in statement poland which shares a border with ukraine and is already home to more than a million ukrainians would likely see the most refugees polish interior minister mariusz kaminski said his country was preparing for an influx of refugees from ukraine the u s military says that the thousands of soldiers deployed to poland this month are prepared to assist with a large scale evacuation assistance with evacuation flow is something they could do and could do quite well they are going to be working with polish authorities on what that looks like and how they would handle that defense department spokesperson john kirby said last week at the largest scale a refugee crisis would not be contained to europe the u s would likely see refugees seeking asylum too copyright 2022 npr to see more visit

the world at large has seen more change more upheaval over the past two years than at any time since perhaps the 1940s two years ago no one could have anticipated the enormous world wide tragedy of the pandemic and resulting pivot in priorities with real estate marked by both new trends and an acceleration of existing ones after four major waves of the virus and some fundamental changes to how agents and brokers approach their craft looking back on the world as it was in early 2020 is almost a surreal experience contrasting these two different worlds the most pertinent question for those with an eye on the future is how to identify the signs of real change compared to the violent and temporary fluctuations of a global crisis knowing the difference will be vital for anyone who hopes to stay ahead of the curve in their real estate ventures going forward real change consumer behavior in early 2020 a luxury real estate report by coldwell banker found two of the top needs for buyers were home office flex rooms in a home and outdoor amenities or living space two things many pundits have attributed to the pandemic but this like many other apparent shifts in what homebuyers and sellers are reacting to and looking for clearly was accelerated by the pandemic not caused by it and promises to continue long after covid stops being the main disruption in people s lives according to the most recent national association of realtors nar profile of homebuyers and sellers 85 of buyers purchased single family detached homes that number has been steadily increasing from 79 in 2013 to 83 in 2017 as even before the pandemic buyers preferred the larger traditional single family lot for homeownership as opposed to sharing a duplex or townhome the need for more space was actually more commonly cited as a reason for moving a decade ago 19 of buyers in 2009 were upsizing compared to 2021 when only 14 cited too little space as their impetus rob dietz chief economist for the national association of home builders nahb says that recent data examining preferences in remodels indicates more space will be a longer term trend however i think that lasts and that it s going to boost home size he says danielle hale realtor com s chief economist agrees and says that so called flex space that can be used for home office home gyms or other less traditional purposes will remain a permanent expectation for buyers people might be a little bit more focused on getting that and making that one of their must haves versus areas that they will compromise on she says anyone who already owned a home during the pandemic will be especially set on those spaces she projects understanding their importance as far as other trends associated with the pandemic relocating to be nearer to friends and family increased in importance for buyers but that has fluctuated over the years as well listed as a primary reason for moving by 37 of people in 2009 rising to 43 in 2015 before falling to 41 in 2019 according to nar data other preferences most notably convenience to job had been on similar tracks with that cited by 52 of people in an nar survey in 2015 but only 46 in 2019 meaning other factors have pushed buyers to care less about their commute besides the pandemic on the seller side jobs have also slowly been losing their importance in 2009 21 of sellers were moving for a job relocation while only 11 cited this reason a decade later in 2019 a number that held steady in 2021 hale says these trends are not dependent on the pandemic either and will continue in the same direction though some of the more dramatic projections some have attached to this a collapse of big metro markets or a sudden shift to rural living are not realistic in our data it seems to have created some flexibility she says commutes are a bit less of a concern the majority of the time that s going to mean moving from the big city downtown urban area to the suburbs fluctuation inventory one of the biggest crises of the real estate market over the last 12 24 months is the severe shortage of housing inventory which drove prices up at a dizzying speed and sidelined many potential buyers this is also a trend that predated the pandemic according to the national association of home builders nahb existing home inventory hit an all time low in december of 2019 new housing starts had somewhat flatlined after clawing back from the great recession increasing by about 100 000 units every year between 2011 and 2014 but only by about 29 000 on average between 2016 and 2019 overall active home listings also fell steadily in the years preceding the pandemic according to data from realtor com from about 1 55 million in june of 2016 to about 1 35 million in june of 2019 a lack of inventory was already one of the leading concerns for the real estate market before the pandemic with an estimated 2 5 million additional homes needed back at the beginning of 2020 to meet the much lower demand according to freddie mac report simply going back to the way things were will not be enough though recent data has been encouraging with 2021 seeing a staggering 15 6 increase in new housing starts but though this is also another trend that was only accelerated and not created by covid it is not likely to continue in the long term as buyer demand wanes existing homes start to enter the market and technology allows fast and cheaper home construction exactly how long that takes is unclear but the seller s market of today is not a new normal in the medium term redfin s homebuyer demand index which measures homebuyer activity like requests for home tours and other inquiries reached an all time high in november of 2021 the number of homes sold within two weeks rose from just over 40 in may of 2019 to 55 the same month in 2021 in july of 2021 55 of homes sold for above asking price compared to just 25 in july 2019 before the pandemic this kind of reckless demand characterized by bidding wars and increased competition from institutional investors is simply not sustainable and eventually as the supply chain normalizes more homes will come onto the market though whether this will actually result in real balance after years of under building remains uncertain despite recent positive signs from the building sector there are signs demand is leveling off as fannie mae s measure of homebuying optimism called the home purchase sentiment index fell to its lowest level since may of 2020 this month with only 25 of people surveyed saying it is currently a good time to buy a home many buyers will simply miss out on homeownership as interest rates have already begun ticking up dietz says and while that is unfortunate it will likely push demand down in the near term hale adds there is definitely a longer tale here based on the tremendous lack of inventory and that new construction alone won t alleviate the imbalance but as the pandemic winds down she posits that existing homeowners will start to cash in and sell their homes which is likely to alleviate some of the pressure that has been such a headache for buyers according to dietz about 33 of homes on the market today are new construction versus around 10 pre pandemic that means there is a lot of room for existing stock to fill the demand especially as that demand slows somewhat in the longer term the market may not even need what was traditionally seen as a healthy supply of inventory he posits six months as the wisdom has been four to five months of inventory might be plenty because homes can be built faster with new technology and the entire buying and selling process has also accelerated we re going to have greater and more rapid turnover he says real change affordability with home prices soaring by almost 20 across the board as housing became the hottest commodity of the pandemic it is hard not to see a silver lining in the unprecedented pandemic real estate market but at the same time nar and other experts warn that the current path for affordable housing is unsustainable and that spiraling price appreciation has many dangers if housing becomes unaffordable this trend is not new at all going all the way back to 1960 home prices have risen 121 while incomes have only gone up 29 according to the economic policy institute the number of households that are cost burdened spending at least 30 of income on direct housing costs increased steadily from 2001 to 2016 with renters bearing the brunt that has made it harder for many particularly low and middle income rental households to rise to the dream of homeownership the situation is even worse for historically disadvantaged groups with black homeownership rates up only fractionally since landmark civil rights victories of the late 1960s who also continue to face significant disctimination in the homebuying process there is unlikely to be any single or simple solution to affordability federal legislation to address affordable housing has stalled in congress different regions also have their own disparate challenges from land cost to environmental concerns the short answer to the affordability crisis is that there is no short answer and very likely the pandemic has pushed that even further nadia evangelou senior economist for nar recently led a study that connected inventory to the crisis in affordability showing that middle income families have increasingly fallen out of homeownership opportunities she adds that without the right kind of focus buying a home will become more and more inaccessible to the average consumer there are fewer entry level homes entering the market if we don t see more entry level homes homeownership for these income groups will be more difficult she says but entry level homes are not being built and likely won t be built under the current market conditions according to dietz as interest rates rise people at those marginal income levels households somewhere in the range of 50 000 to 100 000 will be unable to afford a home and construction targeted at that group becomes an untenable risk for builders from a builder perspective that s the market that not only is the most challenging from a construction cost side to add supply but now it has the most demand side risk as well in a higher mortgage interest rate environment he warns hale says there needs to be a dramatic shift in everything from labor costs to zoning to the overall regulatory environment in order to reverse this trend simply building slightly more densely through an increased reliance on townhomes or accessory dwelling units adus could help to some degree but will not be enough it s still difficult to do in most areas she says the consequences of long term unaffordability cannot be overstated evangelou points out that as rents also rise even more people will be pushed off the margins of homeownership unable to save for down payments and will also be unable to pass on wealth to their children further shrinking the market for homes jordan levine chief economist and vice president for the california association of realtors says that a smaller basket of real estate supply limited to upper income levels or stratified regionally makes any downturn or shock a much bigger problem for the whole economy when a smaller and smaller slice of the population is the one supporting the housing market that creates inherent challenges and should be a big motivator for us to address our big challenges he says fluctuation migration people fleeing coastal markets and big cities because suddenly they were able to work from anywhere is another one of the enduring images coming out of the pandemic remote work has often been portrayed as a seismic shift that will forever alter how people choose to live making geography essentially a non factor in real estate that is not true now and will likely become even less true in the long term according to dietz and hale in fact according to census data less people fled cities in 2020 than on average and there was no significant uptick in people migrating to suburban areas the proportion of people moving to a different state did go up slightly however by one tenth of a percent in 2021 and the percentage of people staying in the same county dropped from 5 9 to 4 9 between 2019 and 2021 the distance people have moved has increased marginally with a median move of 11 miles in 2013 compared to 15 miles in 2021 also defying perception the median age of sellers remained roughly the same between 2019 and 2021 meaning boomers who typically move further when they buy a new home were still well represented in pandemic era moves the types of markets that people have been moving to smaller cities in the midwest and south did see a marked increase in people moving there according to nar data but evagenlou says that context is important and that these in migration patterns are strongly correlated with local job opportunities and were almost all hot markets before the pandemic meaning most people are not actually just picking up and moving wherever they feel like dietz says nahb has projected that around 40 of workers will end up in a 3 2 2 work model three days in the office two from home and two days off the more important trend to look at is the broader regional movements with decades of growth in southern cities like dallas and houston in texas and places in the midwest like des moines iowa and columbus ohio these cities have relatively better housing affordability and maybe a higher quality of life he says it s not going to be as strong as 2020 i do think the data suggests that we saw a shift in people s willingness to move further away says hale if not long term then at least temporarily i think sometimes margin cases can attract an outsized share of media attention inter state moves are happening and will happen according to hale but simply not to the degree many thought and not enough to upend the industry more flexibility can help stabilize the overall real estate market though it s not clear how large the impact of that will be it can rebalance population and population growth so it can create inventory in markets that have been extraordinarily tight hale explains the reverse can be true we can see prices bid up and time on market drop in some of these markets that have been relief markets from high cost areas evangelou says a motivating factor for recent migrations has been the so called great resignation and she attributes some of the migration patterns to people moving for new jobs which may be remote hybrid or fully in person but still have caused the individual or family to pick up and live in a new place people moved during the pandemic they were working remotely she says now they are going back to the big city because they found a job when the labor market normalizes so will migration patterns all other factors being equal this is likely to hold true generally for other migration related pandemic disruptions according to hale and trends that will last are the ones that were already well understood before the pandemic if you look at the overall population of movers people who are moving aren t moving very far hale says

updated february 24 2022 at 1 57 pm et the long feared invasion of ukraine by russia jolted markets sent energy prices higher and prompted promises of a new round of consequences for russia signals that even people out of immediate harm s way will be affected by what threatens to become the biggest war in europe since world war ii here s how the invasion will have ripple effects far outside the borders of the conflict there could be collateral damage from sanctions on russia this week president biden announced a first tranche of economic sanctions on two russian banks with about 80 billion in assets and five russian oligarchs and their families and prohibited u s entities from purchasing russian sovereign debt more sanctions are expected to follow in response to what biden said is a needless act of aggression against ukraine and global peace and security brendan smialowski afp via getty images afp via getty images president biden speaks about russia and ukraine in the east room of the white house on tuesday the forthcoming sanctions could include restrictions on major russian banks that would dramatically affect russia s ability to conduct international business severe u s sanctions could drive up prices for everyday russians or cause russia s currency or markets to crash because the u s does not rely much on trade with russia it is somewhat insulated from direct consequences europe is more directly affected but certain sectors of the u s economy rely on highly specific russian exports primarily raw commodities the premise of sanctions is to hurt the other guy more than you hurt your own interests but that does not mean there will not be some collateral damage said doug rediker a partner at international capital strategies energy prices could rise in the early hours following russia s invasion brent crude oil was trading at more than 100 per barrel for the first time since 2014 and another benchmark west texas intermediate rose nearly 5 to more than 96 per barrel russia is a major exporter of oil and natural gas especially to europe as a result officials have reportedly shied away from severe sanctions on russian energy exports but there are other ways the energy market could be disrupted michael sohn ap ap nearly 40 of the natural gas used by the european union comes from russia president biden said prior to russia s invasion of ukraine that the not yet operational nord stream 2 pipeline would not move ahead in the event of an invasion for one russia could choose to cut off or limit oil and gas exports to europe as retaliation for sanctions nearly 40 of the natural gas used by the european union comes from russia and no european country imports more than germany a key ally of the united states even if russia chooses not to limit exports supplies could still be affected by the conflict in ukraine because multiple pipelines run through the country carrying gas from russia to europe they could simply be casualties of a military invasion rediker said either way if europe s natural gas supply is pinched that could cause energy prices which have already been climbing to rise even further and even though the u s imports relatively little oil from russia oil prices are set by the global market meaning local prices could rise anyway there s a geopolitical premium or call it a fear premium in the price of oil daniel yergin vice chairman of ihs markit told morning edition an expectation that as this crisis spirals worse that supplies of oil from russia are going to be disrupted other industries from food to cars might also be hurt russia is a major exporter of rare earth minerals and heavy metals such as titanium used in airplanes russia supplies about a third of the world s palladium a rare metal used in catalytic converters and its price has soared in recent weeks over fears of a conflict ukrainian economic output and industry will likely be significantly disrupted the country is a major source of

something people just have not contemplated the u s stock market has already been unusually volatile in recent weeks churning over inflation moves by the federal reserve to curb its stimulus programs and the looming conflict in ukraine historically the market has bounced back relatively quickly after geopolitical events that s what s most likely today too analysts say so the effect on people with 401 k accounts may be short term but if the conflict causes long lasting disruption of energy markets and other exports investors could rethink that conventional wisdom you re potentially at a point where not only are we looking at russia potentially invading ukraine and sanctions and countermeasures but you are also looking at a rise of china that doesn t necessarily agree with the american perspective on the world anyway rediker said last week before the invasion are we looking at a point in which some of the major premises that people take for granted have to be reassessed russia could launch disruptive cyberattacks another way russia could respond to u s sanctions is through cyberattacks and influence campaigns various federal agencies including the treasury and the department of homeland security have warned of possible cyberattacks on targets like big banks and power grid operators they have been warning everyone about russia s very specific tactics about the possibility of attacks on critical infrastructure katerina sedova a researcher at georgetown university s center for security and emerging technology told npr russian cyberattacks have targeted ukraine relentlessly in recent years including attacks on the capital city of kyiv s power grid in 2015 and 2016 but a major escalation could shift focus to u s targets sedova pointed to the russian state backed attack on the it software company solarwinds and a ransomware attack that shut down the colonial pipeline for six days as examples of how major russian cyberattacks could disrupt u s operations the biden administration said it does not believe the russian government was involved in the pipeline attack power grids hospitals and local governments could all be targets she said for now sedova said she is more worried about subtler attacks like influence campaigns that aim to sow discord between us and our allies in our resolve to act jointly against russia oftentimes cyber operations go hand in hand with influence she said they re targeting a change of decision making a change in policy in that direction a change in public opinion a major invasion would likely spark a refugee crisis anatolii

bloomberg airbnb inc beat revenue and profit estimates in the fourth quarter bucking a resurgent wave of covid 19 infections and heading into this year even stronger than before the pandemic the shares rose revenue grew 78 to 1 53 billion airbnb said tuesday in a statement that beat analysts projections for 1 46 billion the san francisco based company reported net income of 55 million compared with a loss of 3 9 billion a year earlier marking a record for the period earnings per share were 8 cents compared with estimates for 3 cents chief executive officer brian chesky called the results the best year in our company s history and said that airbnb was able to weather the pandemic because of its highly adaptable business model we have millions of types of homes in nearly every community at nearly every price point all over the world he said in an interview with bloomberg television on tuesday that means that however travel changes we re able to adapt airbnb has recovered from the beginning of the pandemic when the company cut thousands of jobs and considered delaying its initial public offering as travel ground to a halt around the world after the initial shock business boomed as workers no longer had to be in traditional offices five days a week and could work from anywhere as a result airbnb said in a letter to shareholders people are spreading out to thousands of towns and cities staying for weeks months or even entire seasons at a time almost half of the number of nights booked in the fourth quarter were for stays of a week or longer and one in five nights were for stays of a month or more in the early days of the pandemic many people sought out homes in more rural areas within driving distance of big cities though airbnb said guests are now starting to return to cities in the fourth quarter gross nights booked at urban destinations accelerated from the previous quarter and have nearly recovered to 2019 levels for the same period airbnb remained resilient even as the omicron variant of covid 19 swooped in late last year re shuttering businesses and disrupting flights and vacation plans over the holiday season the company said it saw a lower impact on bookings and cancellations with omicron than it had with the delta variant rival expedia group inc which provides reservations for hotels and alternative accommodations through its vrbo platform has also weathered the covid resurgence reporting revenue that more than doubled in the fourth quarter with u s inflation running at a four decade high chesky said it may spur more people to become hosts individuals and families will look for economic opportunity to make it through this time and they can make 9 000 to 10 000 a year hosting occasionally he said the average day rate for airbnb bookings has increased in high traffic areas and the higher prices have helped boost revenue chesky said on a conference call with analysts in the interview tuesday chesky said that the increase in rates was partly due to inflation but that the primary reason was the changing mix of where people are choosing to stay often in more expensive locations in the u s and with larger numbers of people airbnb said it s encouraged by what it is seeing so far this year the impact of omicron has quickly dissipated and guests are confidently booking for the summer travel season early in the year the company said airbnb now expects the number of nights and experiences booked in the first quarter to significantly exceed the first quarter levels of 2019 revenue is expected to be 1 41 billion to 1 48 billion in the first quarter airbnb said the shares gained as much as 3 5 on wednesday in new york the stock has lagged behind expedia this year chalking up gains of 8 compared with its rival s 17 leap many analysts raised their price target on airbnb stock chesky views the disruptions of traditional work culture as a boon to the company s business model because employees have more flexibility to work from anywhere he is even spending several months living in airbnb rentals himself one thing i learned is it s important to have really good wi fi he quipped to embrace the change in what travelers are looking for in the pandemic era airbnb now lets guests search for listings as long as a year in advance but its futurism has limits chesky said airbnb has no immediate plans to offer crypto payments we are absolutely as promised looking into crypto payments he said i don t have anything to announce right now with assistance from emily chang 2022 bloomberg l p

demand and logistics related supply challenges continued to support robust lumber pricing in japan while price momentum was muted for north american commodity lumber until late in the fourth quarter of 2021 we took advantage of these market conditions by increasing shipments to japan despite logistics issues as commodity lumber prices rallied in december 2021 and with continued export logistics challenges we began to redirect production to the north american market late in the quarter lumber revenue rose 4 compared to the fourth quarter of last year despite a 20 decline in lumber shipment volumes lumber prices across our specialty product categories rose by 30 on average japan lumber shipments increased by 83 but logistics challenges drove a reduction in lumber shipments to other markets in addition limited cedar log availability constrained cedar lumber production and shipments as compared to the same period last year flooding and severe winter weather in british columbia bc in november and december 2021 temporarily closed rail and highway shipping channels resulting in logistics disruptions that impacted the company s shipments our average realized lumber price was 1 634 per thousand board feet an increase of 30 from the fourth quarter of last year as we capitalized on strong pricing in japan we increased the percentage of specialty product shipments to 55 from 47 in the fourth quarter last year partly as a result of logistics challenges that limited relatively lower value commodity lumber shipments to china and the us fourth quarter lumber pricing was higher across all segments in 2021 except our commodity segment commodity lumber pricing began to rise late in fourth quarter however logistics constraints largely delayed our realizing that improved pricing until the affected volumes shipped in 2022 log revenue was 48 9 million a decline of 8 from the fourth quarter last year weather related operating curtailments limited the harvest of logs and inventory available for sale we redirected export grade log supply to our sawmills in support of lumber production except 6 000 cubic metres of export log sales originating from a first nations arrangement average realized bc log prices increased by 7 from the same period last year as improved pricing offset a weaker log sales mix by product revenue was 11 0 million an increase of 2 1

production of 179 million board feet in the fourth quarter of 2021 was flat as compared to the same period last year log supply related operating curtailments and severe winter weather in december impacted lumber production we harvested 700 000 cubic metres of logs from our coastal operations in bc in the fourth quarter of 2021 as compared to 901 000 cubic metres in the same period last year log production was significantly impacted by weather related curtailments caused by significant rainfall in november followed by heavy snowfall in december timberlands per unit operating costs increased over the comparative period on lower production volumes higher helicopter logging harvest volume and higher stumpage expense improved pricing for logs and lumber drove a threefold increase in stumpage rates applied to our business as compared to the same period last year with rising stumpage expense mitigated in part through reduced harvest volume bc coastal saw log purchases were 211 000 cubic metres a decrease of 5 from the same period last year coastal saw log supply remains tight as weather negatively impacted harvest volumes on the bc coast as compared to the same period last year fourth quarter freight expense decreased 13 compared to the same period last year as a result of reduced lumber shipments and an absence of log exports freight costs per transaction continued to

as compared to 61 2 million in 2020 as a result of strong operating performance we began 2021 with lumber production and sales directed to north american commodity markets to take advantage of unprecedented pricing this focus led to improved recovery while increasing secondary processing and related costs as north american commodity pricing declined we redirected production and grew export lumber shipments to japan and china taking advantage of robust japan market pricing strong demand and supply constraints caused north american prices to rally late in the fourth quarter of 2021 comparative results were significantly impacted by the restart of operations after the lengthy united steelworkers local 1 1937 strike the strike which had curtailed the majority of our bc based operations through february 2020 and by the impacts of covid 19 sales lumber revenue for 2021 was 1 2 billion 62 higher than 2020 as a result of a 22 increase in realized pricing and a 34 increase in shipment volumes during the first half of 2021 we capitalized on record north american commodity pricing by increasing commodity shipments as 2021 progressed we leveraged our flexible operating platform to take advantage of changing market conditions transitioning production and shipments from record north american markets in the first half of the year to relatively stronger japan lumber and china commodity lumber markets in the second half late in the fourth quarter of 2021 we began to transition our production to meet rising demand and pricing in the north american market this strategy delivered a 64 increase in commodity lumber shipments as compared to the same period last year while ensuring we benefitted from record pricing in the japan lumber market overall price realizations were negatively impacted by a 7 appreciation in the average canadian to us dollar exchange rate year over year log revenue was 169 3 million in 2021 a decrease of 16 from 2020 due to reduced sales volumes we redirected export and certain domestic logs to our sawmills to support lumber production to capitalize on strong lumber markets despite these actions we realized a 16 increase in average log price operating curtailments permitting delays adverse weather including summer fire weather heavy rainfall and early snowfall reduced harvesting production in 2021 the comparative period was impacted by a weaker log sales mix caused by strike related log degradation by product revenue grew to 50 9 million as compared to 27 2 million in 2020 resulting from increased production and shipments and a higher mix of whitewood chips as compared to 2020 chip price realizations improved by 23 as a result of significantly higher nbsk pulp price and species mix operations lumber production in 2021 was 760 million board feet 32 higher than last year we achieved higher lumber production in 2021 through increased operating hours and improved production efficiency while production in the first quarter of 2020 was impacted by the strike the shift to increased north american commodity lumber production in the first half of 2021 contributed to higher production volumes and improved recovery production and recovery benefits associated with higher north american commodity production were partially offset by increased levels of processing required to manufacture north american commodity products lumber production in the second half of 2021 was impacted by lower recovery associated with export lumber production and temporary operating curtailments due to constrained log supply in late 2021 we began to redirect some production to north american commodity lumber as prices rallied and export logistics challenges continued log production for 2021 was 3 090 000 cubic metres a decrease of 10 over last year unfavourable weather conditions and permit delays impacted log production and deferred a portion of road expense to future periods logging expenses have increased over 2020 primarily due to a 110 increase in stumpage expense in 2020 logging operations were curtailed for most of the first quarter of 2020 due to the strike and actions taken to mitigate covid 19 health and safety risks freight expense for 2021 was 93 8 million an increase of 27 as compared to last year due primarily to a 34 increase in lumber shipments rising container freight rates and higher costs from the increased use of breakbulk vessels were largely offset by a significant reduction in export log shipments we partly mitigated ongoing export logistics issues and limited container availability by converting a component of our lumber shipments to breakbulk flood related rail and highway closures in bc delayed north american shipments in the last two months of 2021 adjusted ebitda and operating income in 2021 included 29 8 million of export tax expense as compared to 34 6 million in 2020 in 2021 we significantly increased lumber revenue on which duties were applicable our financial results benefitted from a reduction in cash duty deposit rates in late 2020 from 20 23 to 8 99 and a stronger canadian to us dollar exchange rate the cash deposit rate increased to 17 90 in december 2021 with the issuance of the doc s final determination on assessed rates for 2019 we recognized a 3 3 million export duty tax recovery against export tax expense in

parties including the lil wat nation and inlailawatash limited partnership a tsleil waututh nation business these licence interests had been held by western under the management of 3rd parties as the result of western predecessor company transactions to acquire and reassign operating rights forest landscape plan pilot with n a m g is first nation on september 23 2021 together with the n a m g is first nation we announced the launch of the tfl 37 forest landscape plan pilot project to guide collaborative decision making and for the joint development of an innovative and progressive plan to sustainably manage tfl 37 the three forest areas covered by the plan include the area based tenure managed by western a replaceable forest licence managed by a n a m g is owned corporation and the operating area of the d a nyas limited partnership a successful forest partnership established by n a m g is and western in 2015 this landscape level plan is supported by the bc government province as a formal pilot project to inform amendments to the province s forest and range practices act as identified under the regulatory environment header below integrated resource management plan with tla amin nation on july 6 2021 together with the tla amin nation we announced a renewal agreement and the planned development of a tla amin led collaborative integrated resource management plan for tla amin treaty lands and crown tenure areas and the portion of western s tfl 39 block 1 located in tla amin territory completion of this values and science based plan is expected to take up to two years the renewal agreement advances joint efforts that have been underway since the signing of a 2019 memorandum of understanding supports continued exploration of innovative ideas to advance common interests related our respective forestry assets and interests in tla amin territory quatsino first nation land agreement on june 21 2021 we announced an agreement to sell private land near coal harbour on northern vancouver island bc to a wholly owned limited partnership of the quatsino first nation the land will be used for community housing and a big house the land purchase and sale transaction is another positive milestone in a long standing relationship of joint efforts most recently involving the province we co developed the september 2020 memorandum of understanding to create a framework to collaboration on sustainable forest management on northern vancouver island bc we also co partner in quatern limited partnership a joint logging operation created in 2010 to facilitate collaborative forest management and advance economic reconciliation tsawak qin forestry lp and integrated resource management plan with huu ay aht first nations on may 3 2021 western completed the sale of an incremental 28 equity interest in tflp to hvlp a limited partnership beneficially owned by the hfn for 22 4 million hvlp s current equity interest in tflp is 35 also in the first half of 2021 we began the co development and tflp implementation of an hfn led integrated resource management plan that is anticipated to be completed in 2023 we have previously agreed to an option to sell a further 16 equity interest in tflp to hvlp with an anticipated close in the second quarter of 2023 subject to closing conditions we also have an agreement to sell up to an incremental 26 in tflp to area first nations and alongside the hfn we are now engaging those nations our growing relationship with hfn has resulted in a suite of other mutually beneficial agreements since 2017 including the sale of our former sarita dryland sort assets employment and training agreements and the 2018 reconciliation protocol agreement the western hfn reconciliation protocol agreement set the framework for a shared path to reconciliation and a joint vision for a safe and competitive forest sector in the alberni valley and formed the foundation for the creation of tflp on november 15 2021 the tfl 44 limited partnership formally changed its name to tsawak qin forestry limited partnership the name change is intended to better reflect the shared values of the partnership with tsawak qin meaning we are one in nuu chah nulth language regulatory environment during 2020 and 2021 the province introduced various policy initiatives and regulatory changes that impact the bc forest sector regulatory framework as part of a coastal revitalization initiative and interior renewal process including fibre recovery lumber remanufacturing old growth forest management and the exportation of logs current provincial policy requires that forest management and operating plans take into account and not unreasonably infringe on aboriginal rights and title proven or unproven and provide for first nations consultation first nation opposition to a forest tenure or other operating authorization may delay the province from granting the permit necessary for road development and harvesting the company may manage risks associated with delays in the province granting operating authorizations by fostering positive working relationships with the first nations as discussed above the company may partly mitigate the operating impacts of permit delays by increasing permitted harvest in other areas by purchasing more logs on the open market and by increasing harvest production from private timberlands old growth logging deferral on november 2 2021 the province announced its intention to work in partnership with first nations on the proposed temporary deferral of harvesting in 2 6 million hectares of bc forests the proposed temporary deferrals if implemented are subject to first nations engagement the province has stated that final decisions on proposed temporary deferral areas will be based on discussions between the province and first nations governments western requires more specific information on the province s proposed measures to meaningfully assess any potential impacts on the company s business determination of potential impacts will be subject to further dialogue with the first nations on whose territories the company operates and their government to government discussions should the proposed measures impact western s business the company will seek support from the province for its workers and full compensation for investments western will work with first nations and government as these decisions are made respecting the rights and title of first nations including their right to economically benefit from the lands within their traditional territories on june 9 2021 the province temporarily deferred old growth logging in 2 000 hectares of forest in southwestern vancouver island bc for a period of two years the temporary deferral was implemented at the request of local first nations with the deferral period aligned with timelines required to prepare resource stewardship plans in collaboration with tenure rights holders tflp which is owned and managed by western and the hfn has no active or planned cutting permits in the portion of the 2 000 hectare old growth logging deferral area in tfl 44 and tflp s forestry activity continues as planned on december 2 2021 the hfn announced that they will be upholding their right to harvest in four percent of the proposed temporary deferral area identified by the government s technical advisory panel tap in their traditional territory and tfl 44 the remaining 96 percent of the tap proposed temporary deferral area is already protected under exiting conservation measures or not planned for harvesting in the next two years hfn s preliminary decision is supported by their assessment that 33 percent of the total productive forest area within their traditional territory and tfl 44 is old forest hfn expects to make a final determination on proposed temporary deferrals in early 2022 through further expert analysis the preliminary decision is not expected to have significant short term effects on planned operations within tfl 44 on january 19 2022 western and four member nations of the nanwakolas council announced an agreement to work on a joint approach to managing forests in tfl 39 block 2 this announcement followed an october 2021 letter of understanding between the parties with an intent to complete a collaborative plan that addresses shared interests within the next two years among those agreed items was a temporary harvest deferral area of 1 068 hectares proposed by tap which is in addition to a pre existing temporary harvest deferral of 1 506 hectares for previously agreed bi lateral initiatives between the nanwakolas council and western these temporary deferral areas represent approximately 1 of the total area of tfl 39 block 2 forest and range practices act amendments on october 20 2021 the province introduced bill 23 the forests statutes amendment act 2021 to improve the framework for stakeholder engagement in long term forest planning amongst the amendments that are expected to come into effect through future regulation is the eventual replacement of forest stewardship plans with forest landscape plans landscape level plans developed in collaboration with first nations are intended to guide increased consideration of ecological and cultural values of the forests in bc these proposed act amendments align with western s increasing use of integrated resource management plans for the joint planning of long term sustainable forest management with first nations timber tenure reduction approximately 89 of western s 5 914 000 cubic metre sustainable allowable annual cut aac is in the form of tree farm licences tfl tfls are granted for 25 year terms and are replaced by the province every five to ten years with a new 25 year term in the first half of 2022 we anticipate the province s chief forester to issue a final determination on the aac in tfl 19 which is approximately 729 000 cubic metres we expect that determination may reduce the aac of tfl 19 by up to 18 or approximately 130 000 cubic metres provincial legislation requires the chief forester to routinely review sustainable harvesting levels of individual tenures at least every 10 years and to issue a determination which may result in an increase or decrease to aac the aac determination reflects tree growth ecology regional and local economic and social interests water and other environmental considerations that define how forests can be managed dividend and capital allocation we remain committed to a balanced approach to capital allocation to return capital to shareholders we reinstated a regular quarterly dividend in 2021 and continue to repurchase common shares under our ncib we will continue to evaluate opportunities to invest strategic and discretionary capital in jurisdictions that create the opportunity to grow long term shareholder value we expect to focus near term internal strategic capital investments on projects that reduce manufacturing costs or address kiln drying and planer capacity constraints on the bc coast these potential investments will help support growth of our specific product line initiatives as well as add value to our products we have approximately 10 million in strategic capital projects currently underway in bc and we continue to evaluate opportunities to invest in the competitive positioning of our value added operations the company will evaluate all capital allocation decisions after considering our operating results financial condition cash requirements financing agreement restrictions and other factors or financial metrics that may be deemed relevant quarterly dividend the quarterly dividend program is intended to return a portion of the company s cash to shareholders after taking into consideration liquidity and ongoing capital needs in february 2021 the company s board of directors reinstated a quarterly dividend of 0 01 per common share which had been suspended in response to the global economic uncertainty arising from covid 19 and added financial requirements of resetting the business after the lengthy strike the company s board of directors will continue to review our dividend on a quarterly basis dividends of 3 3 million and 14 3 million were paid in the three and twelve months ending december 31 2021 respectively normal course issuer bid on august 5 2021 the company renewed its ncib permitting the purchase and cancellation of up to 29 726 940 common shares beginning august 11 2021 representing 10 of the public float outstanding as of august 5 2021 the company also entered into an automatic share purchase plan with its designated broker to facilitate purchases of its common shares under the ncib at times when the company would ordinarily not be permitted to purchase its common shares due to regulatory restrictions or self imposed blackout periods in 2021 we repurchased and cancelled 47 702 569 common shares for 96 9 million at an average price of 2 03 per common share no common shares were repurchased in 2020 as at january 24 2022 the company had repurchased and cancelled the maximum 29 726 940 common shares permitted for purchase and cancellation under the current ncib for 60 7 million at an average price of 2 04 per common share strategy and outlook western s long term business objective is to create superior value for shareholders by building a sustainable margin focused log and lumber business of scale to compete successfully in global softwood markets we believe this will be achieved by maximizing the sustainable utilization of our forest tenures operating safe efficient low cost manufacturing facilities and augmenting our sales of targeted high value specialty products for selected global customers with a lumber wholesale program we seek to manage our business with a focus on operating cash flow and maximizing value through the production and sales cycle we routinely evaluate our performance using the measure of roce continuing to guide our actions are the strategic initiatives below with selected accomplishments in 2021 strengthen the foundation advancing our strategic partnerships with first nations and continuing to reposition our coastal tenure assets we completed the sale of an incremental 28 ownership interest in tflp for 22 4 million to the hvlp to the hvlp achieving a series of milestone agreements focused on joint and collaborative planning of forestry activities with first nations in whose traditional territories we operate these agreements build upon western s well established sustainable forestry practices by incorporating indigenous values within planning and forestry activities confirming our net positive climate impact with the release of our latest sustainability report this included the completion of our first full lifecycle carbon accounting reaffirming the positive role western s sustainable forest management practices and wood products have in fighting against climate change completing the sale of significant non core assets for net cash proceeds of 52 0 million in 2021 supporting the repositioning of our balance sheet this includes the sale the company s former orca quarry related assets and the somass division assets since 2014 the company has realized net cash proceeds of 94 5 million from other non core asset sales grow the base we optimized our operations and invested in our sawmills and timberlands to improve margins and position ourselves for growth we continue to look for opportunities to further optimize

washington remain ahead of expectations remain ahead of expectations we continue to evaluate other opportunities to grow our specialty products business including how we may participate in the increased use of mass timber building technologies as well as capitalize on two way trade opportunities with our strong customer relationships in japan market outlook volatile global lumber market conditions and global logistics challenges have required a dynamic sales and marketing strategy in 2021 we successfully levered our flexible operating platform directing production to the highest margin product and market alternatives as we look to 2022 the same combination of strong demand across our core markets and regional production and logistics challenges have created margin opportunities for western in north america we expect high levels of new home construction and sound repair and remodeling fundamentals to drive product demand we expect pricing to remain above trend levels for the foreseeable future as supply is likely to remain constrained due to a combination of reduced log availability and logistics challenges in japan relatively strong demand from new home construction and logistics constrained imported lumber supply should support pricing through the first half of the year in the fourth quarter of 2021 the north american cedar market returned to a more seasonal pattern after the 2020 covid 19 related demand surge as we enter 2022 cedar lumber demand is returning and pricing is expected to improve for our niche products we anticipate that demand from the north american industrial timber market will remain strong while improved demand and pricing is expected for appearance timbers as we head into the spring severe weather events limited domestic log harvest in the last half of 2021 and have reduced inventories to low levels impacting sawmill production we expect domestic saw log prices to increase in the near term due to limited supply rising stumpage costs and higher demand driven by strong lumber markets the price for nbsk pulp in china has improved due to logistics constrained supply higher pulp prices should benefit residual chip pricing in the coming quarters pulp log prices are likely to remain flat due to limited market options and a lack of whole log chipping capacity the ongoing challenges related to covid 19 and global logistics issues continue to create uncertainty in our business and could lead to pricing volatility and ongoing vessel rail and trucking challenges we plan to utilize our flexible operating platform to adjust to market conditions and will continue to align our production volumes to match market demand long term we believe that strong north american housing market fundamentals will support lumber demand and pricing above trend levels low mortgage interest rates an aging housing stock a housing deficit stemming from years of underbuilding and the influence of work from home arrangements on the repair and renovation segment are expected to continue to drive growing demand for lumber at the same time supply has been reduced due to the impact of permanent production curtailments resulting from mountain pine beetle in the bc interior in addition we expect growth in the use of mass timber building technologies the need for carbon neutral products and improved recognition of lumber as the most sustainable building product on the planet will grow demand and benefit the forest sector long term softwood lumber dispute the us application of duties continues a long standing pattern of us protectionist action against canadian lumber producers we disagree with the inclusion of specialty lumber products particularly wrc and yellow cedar products in this commodity lumber focused dispute as duties paid are determined on the value of lumber exported and as our shipments to the us market consists of significant volumes of high value appearance grade lumber we are disproportionately impacted by these duties western expensed 29 8 million of export duties on its lumber shipments into the us in 2021 and recognized an offsetting export tax recovery of 3 3 million arising from the doc s final determination on assessed rates for 2019 export duty tax was comprised of cv and ad at a combined rate of 8 99 on all lumber western sold into the us until november 30 2021 and a combined rate of 17 90 effective december 1 2020 on january 10 2022 as a result of a ministerial error in its second administrative review the doc revised the published cv rate to 6 32 increasing the combined cash deposit rate to 17 91 on january 31 2022 the doc released its preliminary determination for cv and ad rates for 2020 shipments at 11 64 resulting from its third administrative review the doc may revise these rates between the preliminary and the final determination expected to be released on august 3 2022 cash deposits continue at the combined duty rate of 17 91 until the final determinations are published after which the 2020 rate will apply at december 31 2021 western had 151 8 million usd 120 1 million of cash on deposit with the us department of treasury in respect of these softwood lumber duties of which 40 4 million usd 31 9 million is recognized in the company s balance sheet arising from rate determinations in 2017 2018 and 2019 including wholesale lumber shipments our sales to the us market represent approximately 41 of our total lumber revenue in 2021 our distribution and processing centre in arlington washington and our columbia vista division in vancouver washington are expected to partially mitigate the damaging effects of duties on our products originating from canada that are destined for the us market we intend to leverage our flexible operating platform to

as other factors could adversely affect our actual results and performance forward looking statements are based only on information currently available to us and refer only as of the date hereof except as required by law we undertake no obligation to update forward looking statements reference is made in this press release to adjusted ebitda which is defined as operating income prior to operating restructuring items and other items plus amortization of property plant and equipment and intangible assets impairment adjustments and changes in fair value of biological assets adjusted ebitda margin is adjusted ebitda as a proportion of revenue western uses adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin as benchmark measurements of our own operating results and as benchmarks relative to our competitors we consider adjusted ebitda to be a meaningful supplement to operating income as a performance measure primarily because amortization expense impairment adjustments and changes in the fair value of biological assets are non cash costs and vary widely from company to company in a manner that we consider largely independent of the underlying cost efficiency of their operating facilities further the inclusion of operating restructuring items which are unpredictable in nature and timing may make comparisons of our operating results between periods more difficult we also believe adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin are commonly used by securities analysts investors and other interested parties to evaluate our financial performance adjusted ebitda does not represent cash generated from operations as defined by ifrs and it is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs furthermore adjusted ebitda does not reflect the impact of certain items that affect our net income adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin are not measures of financial performance under ifrs and should not be considered as alternatives to measures of performance under ifrs moreover because all companies do not calculate adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin in the same manner these measures as calculated by western may differ from similar measures calculated by other companies a reconciliation between the company s net income as reported in accordance with ifrs and adjusted ebitda is included in this press release also in this press release management may use key performance indicators such as net debt net debt to capitalization current assets to current liabilities and roce net debt is defined as long term debt less cash and cash equivalents net debt to capitalization is a ratio defined as net debt divided by capitalization with capitalization being the sum of net debt and equity current assets to current liabilities is defined as total current assets divided by total current liabilities roce is defined as adjusted ebitda as a proportion of average capital employed average capital employed is defined as the average balance over a year of total assets less cash and cash equivalents income tax receivable duty receivable and related interest deferred income tax assets accounts payable and accrued liabilities and the current portions of lease liabilities reforestation obligation and deferred revenue these key performance indicators are non gaap financial measures that do not have a standardized meaning and may not be comparable to similar measures used by other issuers they are not recognized by ifrs however they are meaningful in that they indicate the company s ability to meet their obligations on an ongoing basis and indicate whether the company is more or less leveraged than the prior year western is an integrated forest products company building a margin focused log and lumber business to

total charter revenues were 166 million in the quarter with around 75 of this from vessels and long term charters at around 25 for vessels employed on short term charters and in the spot market this includes or included the seven handysize bulkers we have sold so going forward we expect a higher relative share from long term charters the ebitda equivalent cash flow in the quarter was approximately 121 million or 10 higher than the previous quarter over the last 12 months the ebitda equivalent has been approximately 434 million and the net income came in at around 80 million in the quarter or 0 63 per share yet again relating to the sale of the bulkers of 39 million and otherwise there were only minor one offs in the quarter including a negative mark to market effect on interest hedging instruments there were also around 1 1 million higher operating costs in the quarter due to additional crew rotation costs linked to covid restrictions we expect a similar effect also in this quarter but hope that the restrictions will ease soon and virtually all our crew are now vaccinated already our fixed rate backlog has increased and stands at approximately 2 8 billion from owned and managed vessels after recent acquisitions and disposals providing continued cash flow visibility going forward the backlog figure excludes revenues from the vessels traded in the short term market and also excludes future profit share optionality in addition we have excluded charter hires relating to the drilling rigs to be conservative in light of the ongoing financial restructuring in seadrill we continue building the portfolio with modern assets on long term charters and have recently agreed to acquire four modern lr2 product tankers in combination with time charters to trafigura the structure is similar to the three suezmaxes we announced last quarter and the deal includes some interesting optionality features if the market should strengthen during the charter period where a sale can be triggered with a profit split and if not the long term charters amortize the vessels down to a comfortable low level with a good base return supported by the 160 million charter backlog linked to these vessels in the quarter we also finalized a sale of the seven handysize vessels for an aggregate net sales price of around 98 million in addition to the sales price there was around 15 million net cash flow from trading the vessels at high rates until delivery so they had a very nice contribution for us in 2021 we have also sourced multiple new financings at attractive terms and see loan margins creeping downwards and we fully redeemed the remaining 145 million convertible notes in cash during the quarter during the fourth quarter we took delivery of three of the seven tankers which are two of the trafigura and we have already taken delivery of three more leaving only one suezmaxes still to be delivered expected later this month excluding the drilling rigs the backlog from owned and managed vessels was 2 8 billion at the end of the quarter over the years we have changed both fleet composition and structure and we now have 75 shipping assets in our portfolio in addition to the long term chartered vessels we have eight vessels treading into short term market currency and four to five coming off their long term charters later this year we have also had significant contributions to cash flow from profit share over time both relating to charter rates and fuel savings the aggregate profit share was around 20 million last year and 7 5 million in the fourth quarter alone we do not have a set mix in the portfolio that focuses on evaluating deal opportunities across the segments and trying to do the right transactions from a risk reward perspective over time we believe this will balance itself out but we tried to be careful and conservative in our investments with a focus on technology and transition over time to more fuel efficient technology for propulsion the two drilling rigs are not included in our reported charter backlog figures and with respect to seadrill and the ongoing financial restructuring we cannot give more details than what we have disclosed in our press releases or as otherwise publicly available after seadrills plan of reorganization was approved by the court they estimate emergence from chapter 11 within the first quarter of this year we received more than 70 of the lease hire under the existing charter arrangement for west linus and west hercules during seadrill s chapter 11 proceedings both rigs are active and working for all companies and the charter rate is sufficient to cover that service relating to the rigs and we are of course pleased to see strengthening drilling markets on the back of the very firm oil price we have entered into a new agreement relating to the harsh environment semi sub west hercules under this new agreement with seadrill the west hercules is contracted to be employed with oil major equinor in norway and canada until september october and thereafter redelivered to sfl in norway sfl continues to receive a bareboat hire of around 60 000 per day while the rig is employed under a contract and generating revenues for seadrill and approximately 40 000 per day in all other modes including when the rig is idle and mobilized to and from canada for the equinor the rig is now on its way to shore for some upgrades required for this job and is expected to move to canada in the second quarter with regards to the west linus which is on a sub charter to an oil major in the north sea until the end of 2028 we continue to have a constructive dialogue with seadrill and the end user for the continued operations of the rig under the contract we have not yet agreed on final terms with seadrill but this is expected before the emergence of chapter 11 given the ongoing discussions we can unfortunately not comment anymore on this for the time being over the years we have gone from a single asset class charter to one single customer to a diversified fleet and multiple counterparties and over time the mix of assets in charter backlog has varied from 100 tankers at the beginning to nearly 60 offshore 10 years ago to container vessels now being the largest segment with nearly 60 of the backlog if you look at the counterparties it is now mainly to end users and market leaders in their respective segments and relatively few are intermediaries where we have less visibility on the use of the assets and quality of operations strategically this also gives us access to more deal flow opportunities such as the repeat business with maersk msc evergreen and trafigura as examples our strategy has therefore been to maintain a strong technical and commercial operating platform in cooperation with our sister companies in the wider seatankers group this gives us the ability to offer a wider range of services to our customers from structured financing effectively to full service time charters and with full control over vessel maintenance and performance including energy efficiency and emission minimizing efforts we can impact improvements to our vessels through the life of the assets and not only be passively owning vessels employed on bareboats where the customer may not always have an incentive to make such improvements in addition we can retain more of the residual value in the assets when we charter out on a time charter basis and in the current environment with rising raw material costs and inflation driving replacement costs for vessels this value is for the benefit of sfl and our stakeholders for bareboat deals this value is usually retained by the charters through fixed price purchase options this is illustrated by the recent sale of seven handysize bulkers we re operating platform has enabled us to trade the vessels in the spot market during a soft market and when the market values doubled last year we could sell the vessels with a significant profit and with that i will leave the word over to our cfo aksel olesen who will take us through the financial highlights of the quarter aksel olesen chief financial officer thank you mr hjertaker on this slide we have shown a pro forma illustration of cash flows for the fourth quarter please note that this is only a guideline to assess the company s performance and is not in accordance with us gaap and also net of extraordinary and non cash items the company generated gross charter hire of approximately 166 million in the fourth quarter including 7 5 million of profits with approximately 75 of the revenue coming from our fixed charter rate backlog which currently stands at 2 8 billion providing us with strong visibility on our cash flow going forward in the fourth quarter the liner fleet generated gross charter hire of approximately 90 million including approximately 3 1 million in profits with contribution related to fuel savings on some of our large container vessels of this amount more than 90 was derived from our vessels on long term charters following the company s recent acquisitions sfl s line of fleet backlog currently stands at approximately 2 billion with an average remaining charter term of approximately 4 4 years or approximately 7 3 years if weighted by charter hire including recently announced transactions sfl has six in crude oil product and chemical tankers with the majority employed on long term charters our tanker fleet generated approximately 17 5 million and gross charter higher during the quarter the net charter hires received where the 5 was derived from our vessels on long term charters among others from and phillips 66 the net charge rate from the company s two suezmax tankers employed in the short term market was approximately 3 1 million compared to 1 7 million in the previous quarter late in the fourth quarter sfl took delivery of one suezmax tanker and two lr2 product tankers with five year charters to trafigura the remaining two suezmax tankers and two lr2 product tankers will be delivered during the first quarter with full quarterly earnings effect from the second quarter our fleet generated approximately 46 3 million in gross charter higher in the fourth quarter including 4 5 million in profit share contribution from our vessels on charter to during the quarter the company had a fleet of 22 dry bulk vessels of which 11 vessels are employed on long term charters and the other 11 are trading in the short term at the spot market the 11 vessels trading in the spot or short term markets generated approximately 21 2 million in net charter hire during the quarter compared to approximately 20 7 million in the previous quarter during the quarter the company completed a stay in the seven smaller handysize dry bulk vessels to a nation buyer and the sales generated net sales proceeds of approximately 19 million in addition to strong spot earnings during the fourth quarter prior to delivery as well as on two drilling rigs which have been changed out from subsidiaries to seadrill on in the fourth quarter we received approximately 12 3 million in charter hire from the rigs this summarizes an adjusted ebitda of approximately 121 million for the fourth quarter compared to 112 million in the third quarter we then move on to the profit and loss statement as reported on the us gaap as we have described in previous earnings calls our accounting statements are different from those of a traditional shipping company as the business strategy focuses on long term charter contracts a large part of our activities are classified as capital leasing as a result a significant portion of our charter revenues are excluded from us gaap operating revenues and instead booked as revenues classified as repayment of investment in the finance business and vessel loans resulting in associates and long term investments and interest income from so for the fourth quarter we report total operating revenue according to us gaap of approximately 152 million which is less than approximately 166 million of charter hire actually received for the reasons just mentioned during the quarter the company recorded profit split income of approximately 4 5 million from our vessels on charter to ocean in addition to approximately 3 1 million from fuel savings arrangements on some of our large container vessels the company also recorded a 39 3 million gain relating to the sale of our seven smaller handysize dry bulk vessels which were also delivered with a new buyer before year end the operating expenses of our fleet are up compared to the previous quarter is a combination of new vessels entering the fleet and expenses relating to covid 19 measures among others due to our efforts to maintain a normalized cruise change cycle for seafarers despite challenging travel restrictions around the globe in addition we also saw an increase in depreciation due to the new additions to our fleet and also the consolidation of the west hercules during the third quarter overall and according to us gaap the company reported a net profit of approximately 80 million or 0 63 per share moving on to the balance sheet at quarter end sfl had approximately 146 million of cash and cash equivalents additionally the company had marketable securities of approximately 25 million base market prices at the end of the quarter furthermore the company had seven debt free vessels with a combined charter market value of approximately 170 million including two lr2 product tankers which the company took delivery of before the end of the quarter must pay with approximately 80 million of cash we expect to draw down financing for all lr2 product tankers during the first quarter approximately 430 million of the remaining capex of recently accounted acquisitions is expected to be financed by debt facilities similar to sfl s other assets with long term charters during the quarter approximately 145 million was used to repay the balance of the convertible note which was due in october furthermore the company received approximately 98 million in cash proceeds from the sale of our seven handysize dry bulk vessels during the fourth quarter so based on q4 numbers the company had a book equity ratio of approximately 28 4 then to summarize the board has declared a cash dividend of 0 20 per share for the quarter an increase of approximately 11 compared to the previous quarter this represents a dividend yield of approximately 9 based on the closing share price yesterday this is the 72nd consecutive quarterly dividend and since the inception of the company in 2004 more than 28 per share or more than 2 4 billion in total has been returned to our shareholders through dividends sfl has successfully committed more than 1 billion to its recent acquisitions in 2021 and in the process we have expanded our relationship with some of our key clients by investing in modern eco design container ships and tankers and at the same time expose of older less efficient assets demonstrating our commitment to further improve our current footprint pursuant to our esg strategy following the recent investments our backlog from our shipping assets now stands at 2 8 billion providing strong visibility on future cash flow debt service and continued distribution capacity with a strong operational platform and our access to attractively priced capital sfl is well positioned to execute on new accretive investments in the quarters to come and with that i give the word back to the operator who will open the line for questions questions answers operator thank you and the first question comes from the line of randy giveans please go ahead randy giveans jefferies analyst howdy team sfl how s it going ole hjertaker chief executive officer hi there randy nice to hear from you randy giveans jefferies analyst yes sir so looking at your fleet here you recently took delivery of numerous tankers you sold some of your dry bulk vessels now currently dry bulk is only about 11 of your contract backlog basically the smallest sector in that and then with the recent pullback in asset values over the last few weeks and even months despite further strengthening and charter rates is the drive of the asset class of choice for growth at the moment if not what sector is it ole hjertaker chief executive officer yeah we look at opportunities across the board and all of these segments i would say generally and then certainly we would be wouldn t mind doing more deals in the dry bulk space but we also have to be cognizant of the sort of market structure in that segment the typically dry bulk vessels are traded more in the spot market and on long term sort of logistical type solutions so our preference is of course the longer term charters and there are not that many long term charters call it in the dry bulk market despite the numerous vessels there so we are chasing transaction opportunities wherever we can find them and i think with our diversification as you point out we can look at the deal opportunities in many segments at the same time and are not tied to only one subsector so yes we look at opportunities there as we do elsewhere as well and but they kind of be specific we always we are happy to announce deals as we do them but we cannot sort of speculate on how much we should invest in each segment randy giveans jefferies analyst sure that s fair i don t expect you to give all your cards away here i was going to ask some questions about the drilling rigs but it sounds like you re on that for now which is understandable so looking at the dividend great to see that kind of continuing to rise is the plan there to slowly increase that going forward and what are sort of hurdles or maybe catalysts for further increases ole hjertaker chief executive officer absolutely i mean we are always happy to please our dear shareholders and we ve been paying dividends now 72 times so we were starting to get the track of that one and the dividend and this is more based on our dividend you could say policy or communication policy around dividend we will never guide on forwarding dividends the dividend is set every quarter by the board and at the discretion of the board but of course as you well know over time and over these 72 quarters it s typically been stable or increasing and with only with of course some adjustments when there has been market events sort of driving it so of course as we have been doing quite a bit of business new business last year and 1 billion new investments etc that will come on stream cash flow from these tanker vessels for instance we will have quite a bit of cash flow from those vessels already in the first quarter and full cash flow effect in the second quarter and also a lot of transactions is of course we do this only with the one sole mindset that we hope to do increase distribution capacity going forward but exactly how much and when i cannot tell you randy giveans jefferies analyst yeah no that s fair well thanks again that is my two questions ole hjertaker chief executive officer thank you very much aksel olesen chief financial officer thank you operator thank you the next question comes from the line of greg lewis from btig please go ahead greg lewis btig analyst hey thank you and good afternoon everybody and sorry i missed you in new york last week question of the round just following up on randy s question around the dividend clearly you re not going to give any guidance around the dividend but it does seem that we re kind of targeting some sort of percentage of cash flow at least that s what it looked like over the last couple of quarters is that kind of a fair way to think about the dividend going forward or is it more a function of your outlook on the market aksel olesen chief financial officer i think as ole said we don t kind of give any guidance and promises on dividends i think what s important for us is to see that we have a good cash flow going forward as the kind we can have a sustainable dividend going forward and as the business it s kind of natural that we are able to also increase the dividend over time so it s going to we don t think it s a specific percentage etc so it s going to see what the sustainable what s the contribution from the cash flow in each quarter and what s the outlook going forward as well and then as i will say after going forward as well and that s greg lewis btig analyst ok that makes sense ok ok and then so i mean you re in the press release you mentioned that seven vessels are unencumbered you mentioned the actual estimated fair market value of those vessels is there any way to think about the potential borrowing ability on those vessels how should we think about that aksel olesen chief financial officer absolutely i mean we intend to draw up the facility on for lr2 product tankers later this quarter ole hjertaker chief executive officer and i would say though that part of the reason for having that and having some of the common vessels is that it enables us given our financial flexibility and enables us to go ahead and close our transactions early and not wait on the financing to be arranged to get a deal done so you could say the net factor is that we get the benefit of the cash flow from the vessels early and then we secure and source the financing and of course the best possible terms some weeks later so that was sort of the incident we also have some smaller i would say like the older vessels that are unencumbered and we don t have any immediate plans necessarily to put leverage on them but we have the flexibility always and can do it on short notice if we need to so you can say it s sort of a we have it s sort of a so you can say it s a part of spare call it investment capacity and with our portfolio of assets there will be situations where some have lower leverage and maybe we can refinance if we think that the leverage has come down too far compared to asset values and vice versa so it s an ongoing call it dynamics in any company aksel olesen chief financial officer exactly our portfolio approach and as a general observation we see that there we have increasing access to very attractive capital with either more new banks coming in competing on terms so i think for us all it s a very good environment greg lewis btig analyst and then as i look at the portfolio i mean clearly asset prices have gone up almost exponentially in container ships clearly that s your largest pool of assets in the portfolio as you re thinking about that business and as you re thinking about those assets and you re talking to your lenders realizing that the bulk of your assets is on long term contracts maybe we re not full we re not really going to benefit from the strength and rates that are driving those asset prices higher that being said or would we is there an opportunity to put on additional leverage on any of those whether it s container ships or other assets where prices have gone higher despite the fact that a lot of those vessels are on long term contracts aksel olesen chief financial officer i mean you could potentially that s not really how we think about that i think as a shareholder i would think that the value of our backlog is really kind of the value of the counterparties and if you see that the majority of the backlog around 2 billion is to i would say probably investment grade counterparties i think that s the strength of the company and you have extremely good visibility on that cash flow and we have been very particular on choosing the counterparties that they have in the portfolio that those are companies that we believe will perform even if kind of the charter marketing will soften which it will in the future so it s more kind of having substance in the company and not necessarily kind of using that to leverage up because you also have minimum value clauses in loan agreements etc so you just have to be very prudent in deciding what to do greg lewis btig analyst ok hey everybody thank you for the time ole hjertaker chief executive officer thank you operator thank you the next question comes from the line of liam burke from b riley please go ahead liam burke b riley securities analyst yes thank you asset values are up not only with containers but pretty much across the board in all your vessel classes how has that affected your acquisition backlog i mean are you still seeing any opportunities or have your opportunities gone down or are you still looking at an attractive pipeline aksel olesen chief financial officer i think if you look at our competitive advantage i would highlight the equally strong operational platform that we have and the fact that if you look at the portfolio approximately 90 of revenues are from time charters and only 10 from bareboats we basically have a different approach to deal origination and we also see a lot of kind of repeat inquiries from existing clients which should be kind of relationships that we ve built over many years so i think in terms of kind of new opportunities we of course both speak to see brokers but we also talk to our clients we see a nice i think it s a good deal flow if we see more deal flow in terms of time charters then we see more financially driven deals like bareboats as many of the banks are coming strongly back to lend as well as kind of money so i think for us we continue to see attractive opportunities liam burke b riley securities analyst fair enough you mentioned in your prepared comments that technology is important for obvious reasons on emissions going forward are there any vessels in your fleet than you would think ok could provide technological risk could offer technological risk to allow you to sell sooner trym sjolie chief operating officer well the risk is maybe a strong word there but if we look at our fleet the vessels that are maybe the sort of the least high deal going forward would be smaller bulk carriers the vessels where we see which we are quite positive to that the big tankers they are will not have a problem from that perspective and also our large container ships are in a good position and especially if we look at our new building programs with the lng dual fuel car carriers they re also going to contribute very well toward the overall fleet carbon intensity indicator track because when we are coming into 2023 and forward it s going to be an increasingly aggressive target as they had but with our current fleet we are well positioned we think ole hjertaker chief executive officer and i think maybe just to add to trym s comment there he is trym sjolie our chief operating officer maybe also add to that that we will have our esg report out in a few weeks time for the last year i think you will see if you compare the report from the previous year you will see a very significant change in our fleet composition and the metrics as a combination of our acquisitions of very efficient vessels including dual fuel new buildings and the sale of less efficient small bunkers that will also be disposed of last year and also many small feeder container ships that were disposed of in the middle of the year that which were generally quite old and therefore had a negative impact on our average on those metrics so i would say we are very focused on these issues and of course our mindset is that we should continue to develop our portfolio over time with that of course as one of our key decision elements liam burke b riley securities analyst great thank you ole hjertaker chief executive officer yes operator thank you the next question comes from the line of chris wetherbee from citigroup please go ahead unknown speaker hey thanks guys this is eli will be on for chris maybe we can start with covid comments quickly i m just curious if we can quantify what the covid impact on the cruise was from an expense standpoint in terms of the headwind trym sjolie chief operating officer sorry i didn t quite catch the question there i mean the cost of the covid costs for us is round numbers 1 million per quarter and that seems to be quite steady it was during last year and it seems to be approximately where we are at the moment too and this has to do with travel costs and quarantine and general sort of delays in moving people around unknown speaker can we talk about capex so where do we currently stand with that looking forward here what s the mix and the strategies going forward there aksel olesen chief financial officer yes i think really the only outstanding capex currently is for carriers dual fuel new buildings coming up of china with 10 year charters to group and respectively we are in active discussions with several financial institutions it s i would say it s more about optimizing the financial terms than anything else we have received extremely strong interest based on the kind of yeah quality of the ship s fuel of a third of the counterparties in an interesting segment with a good supply demand outlook so yeah ole hjertaker chief executive officer so and then and of course we have to pay down installments to the shipyards for all those four vessels as well so we don t expect a very significant call it capex net cash capex because most of the remaining investments in those vessels can be covered by financing aksel olesen chief financial officer exactly ole hjertaker chief executive officer and of course we focus on optimizing that and minimizing the cost of that capital of course but from an overall perspective with a 4 billion balance sheet i think we have a very low capex in a sort of relative numbers unknown speaker sure just following up on that one thing you said i m just curious what is the backlog or the congestion in the shipyards you re seeing right now trym sjolie chief operating officer congestion well we see if you want to go on to get new vessels typically car carriers container ships now you ll probably be looking at 2024 even 2025 so if you want to go to sort of first or second tier yards in asia like china or korea so i don t think you will find many 23 deliveries at the moment so we are taking a look at late 24 early 25 i think that answers your question ole hjertaker chief executive officer and also prices have been going up there is inflation of both in raw material but so and also labor in these countries where most of the ships are being built so this is also helping our overall fleet structure or i would say any shipping companies in the fleet portfolio because it s new building prices are in a way pulling off also secular values as a there s a percentage of replacement cost which is benefiting us so we don t mind calling it the increasing shipyard prices and as we do new transactions as long as we can get charters that is reflective and gives us a decent return even if prices are coming off we are still good to do news transactions and higher prices trym sjolie chief operating officer and some yards are reluctant to take orders going much further in or further out i mean than a sort of mid 24 because of the risk of rising steel prices and general inflation so the yards are also a bit reluctant to take new orders very far into the future unknown speaker sure that makes sense thank you both ole hjertaker chief executive officer thank you operator thank you and with that i would like to hand it back over to the speakers for final remarks ole hjertaker chief executive officer thank you then i would like to thank everyone for participating in our conference call and also thanked the sfl teams onboard the vessels and onshore for their continued efforts day and night in delivering value for our shareholders if you do have any follow up questions there are contact details in the press release where you can get in touch with us

by desmond lachman oscar wilde the famous irish wit wrote that to lose one parent may be regarded as a misfortune but to lose both looks like carelessness one has to wonder what he might have said about today s major central banks who have created not one not two but at least three sets of important asset price bubbles through their excessively loose monetary policies by so doing they have put the world economy at considerable risk when they begin to turn off their monetary policy spigots perhaps the most worrying of these bubbles are those now all too much in evidence in the us equity and housing markets courtesy of around 4 ½ trillion in us treasury and mortgage backed securities bond buying and the prolonged maintenance of ultra low interest rates in the wake of the pandemic us equity valuations have reached nosebleed levels experienced only once before in the past one hundred years at the same time us house prices even in inflation adjusted terms now meaningfully exceed their peak level before the 2006 us housing market bust not to be outdone the chinese central bank has created the mother of all credit and housing market bubbles through many years of ultra easy monetary policy according to the bank for international settlements over the past decade chinese credit to the non financial private sector expanded by around 100 percent of gdp that is a faster rate of credit expansion than that which occurred before japan s lost economic decade in the 1990s or than that which occurred in the run up to the 2006 us housing and credit market bust the unusually rapid rate of chinese credit expansion has allowed its property sector to increase to 30 percent of the overall chinese economy which is almost double the comparable proportion in the united states it has also created a large overhang of unoccupied dwellings and has driven chinese home price to income ratios in its major cities to levels that make those in london and new york look very low the third major sets of bubbles are to be found in government debt markets of the eurozone s highly indebted countries over the past two years in response to the pandemic the european central bank ecb bought eur 1 85 trillion in government bonds including a disproportionate amount of government bonds of the eurozone s highly indebted economic periphery this allowed interest rates on some of these countries bonds like those of the italian government to decline to negative levels it did so notwithstanding the fact that italy s public debt level and its budget deficit are now appreciably higher than they were during the 2010 european sovereign debt crisis in the year ahead a major challenge for the world economic outlook will be the great likelihood that the federal reserve the ecb and the bank of china will simultaneously be moving towards more restrictive monetary policies with us inflation rising to a forty year high the fed has already indicated that it will end its bond buying program in march with a view to paving the way for a series of interest rate hikes recognizing the long run dangers of its credit bubble the chinese government has already taken measures to restrict credit growth to the property sector that has caused evergrande china s largest property developer to default on its loans meanwhile in europe against the backdrop of rising inflation the ecb has announced that it will end its pandemic emergency purchase program in march that has already caused the difference between italian and german government bond yields to rise to their pre pandemic levels all of this means that in the year ahead we could see real world financial market stress as a result of bubbles bursting on several fronts if ever there was a need for international economic and financial market policy cooperation to guide the world economy towards a soft economic landing it has to be now

rogers ark feb 16 2022 globe newswire america s car mart inc nasdaq crmt today announced its operating results for the third quarter of fiscal year 2022 for the quarter revenues were up almost 28 to a record 292 million including an 11 million increase in interest income unit volumes were up slightly for the quarter and the average sales price was up 24 8 to just over 17 000 said jeff williams president and ceo unit sales volumes in november were up 20 compared to the prior year up 7 in december but down 21 in january we believe this was primarily the result of the omicron variant while january had other challenges weather as well as the timing of stimulus payments in the prior year period we believe the omicron variant was the primary cause of the decline in unit volume for january the omicron variant hit our region of the country later than most but it appears to have followed the same trajectory as it has across the rest of the united states and our workforce and our customer base have now returned to normal pre pandemic behavior as such we view january s results as largely a one time event again the impact from the omicron variant now appears to be behind us and we are operating under more normalized conditions we operate in a difficult but very good business we encourage you to view our investor video which covers important aspects of our business model and is available in the investor section of our website at www car mart com we operate in the 490 billion below prime used auto market we believe we are the leading integrated auto sales and finance company but we have a very small percentage less than a quarter of one percent of the total market what makes our business difficult also deters larger companies who cater to prime and near prime customers from entering our business we provide a necessary product and have an obligation to serve more customers said mr williams once again our industry has experienced drastic change accelerated significantly by the covid 19 pandemic the average wholesale vehicle value is up over 45 in the last twelve months and up over 65 in the last two years since fiscal year 2018 we have been able to grow revenues from 612 million to over 1 billion and eps from 4 90 to 15 87 each on a trailing 12 month basis said mr williams we grew receivables from 501 million to over 1 billion at january 31 2022 and repurchased 80 million of our common stock during this same time period we accomplished this while increasing our debt from only 152 million to 373 million over the same period we were able to achieve these results because we are unique in our ability to service our customers in any type of environment we are also unique in our capital structure our balance sheet with an outstanding debt balance at 36 of receivables gives us the flexibility to continue investing in our business as well as repurchase shares when we believe they are undervalued we have produced record earnings during this unprecedented period of disruption and change we have an excellent long term record and that s how we manage the business we are investing in key areas of the business so our dealerships can support 1 000 or more active customers currently our dealerships average 614 customers we believe that these investments will enhance our business and thus produce above average returns make us a dramatically larger more profitable company over time and be even better at providing our customers with what they need these investments are being made with a goal of increasing productivity per dealership from the current 33 units sold per dealership per month to 40 units and beyond over time which we believe is a realistic vision of our future opportunities based on 40 years of operating and supporting our high touch customers in the markets we serve said mr williams we believe the potential financial impacts of leveraging our existing dealership base are very attractive and represent the highest and best use of our capital additionally acquisitions represent a compelling growth opportunity as we look to expand our footprint areas that are receiving foundational investments include recruiting training and retention inventory procurement management customer experience and digital information technology collectively there is a significant amount of baseline work that has taken place in all these critically important areas and we are making good progress with our efforts on past quarterly earnings calls with investors we have received questions about certain aspects of our business continued mr williams we would like to highlight a few of these items and present them within the proper overall context of our business specifically here are a few areas that we would like to mention with respect to our ability to succeed in a rising price environment the early data looks promising for our collections over longer contract terms we believe that we can not only earn more absolute dollar profits but also potentially earn percentage returns at historical levels albeit over a longer period while our contract term lengths have increased they are still significantly below competitive offerings we strive to provide unparalleled support for our customers after the sale to keep them on the road customer demand is strong and would be even stronger but higher prices are keeping some customers out of the market for now we provide basic transportation perhaps less discretionary than other car retailers the overall rate of price increases has begun to slow and we are hopeful that wholesale prices may decline the higher the price the more differentiated we are versus competitors who are unable to match our resources and adapt to new conditions as fast as we can better customers have choices and we must be competitive with payments and terms while a potential rapid decline in used car prices is possible we don t believe that there will be a collapse in the values of cars that we purchase for our consumers there has been an overall shortage of good basic affordable vehicles for well over a decade in our opinion there is solid and increasing market demand for these vehicles however deflation all things being equal would be good for our business and customers we would be in a good position to capitalize on the volume opportunities this scenario would present our economics get better as prices decline and relative to others in the industry our recoveries on repossessions are a smaller percentage of our overall profitability regarding gross margin we manage the business to gross margin dollars not percentage while increased sales prices generally cause the gross margin percentage to go down they result in higher gross profit dollars and greater interest income all else being equal gross margin percentage will decline as the term gets longer and increase as the term contracts we have been able to achieve operating leverage within sg a and we expect to continue to leverage our cost structure over time as jeff mentioned revenues increased 28 for the quarter driven by higher average retail prices and significantly higher interest income interest income increased 10 7 million for the quarter on average finance receivables of 999 million although we saw a continued increase in the average selling price of the vehicle our revenue from our ancillary products accounted for approximately 14 of the increase as our new extended term service contracts are baked into our portfolio as a result the gross margin percentage stabilized compared to sequential quarters and the gross profit dollars per retail unit sold increased to 6 773 compared to 5 774 from the same period in the prior year our associates who support our customers at all levels of the organization are the most important part of our business we are focused on the training retention and engagement of our associates especially in the current environment while sg a spend increased 5 8 million over the prior year quarter and 2 0 million over the sequential quarter we continued to leverage sg a costs at 15 5 of sales compared to 16 7 for the comparable prior year quarter said vickie judy cfo total collections were strong and improved 8 2 per average customer our weighted average contract term for the portfolio is at 41 2 months compared to 35 7 months for the prior year quarter an increase of 15 4 compared to the average retail sales price increase of 24 8 our focus continues to be putting a good customer in an affordable transaction so that they are successful in their contract net charge offs increased to 5 3 compared to 4 9 in the prior year quarter the stimulus money in december 2020 and january 2021 had some positive impact on both collections and net charge off metrics in the prior year quarter the current year metrics are still much improved compared to historical third quarter levels despite the increase in the average retail sales price as our customers continue to perform well our debt to receivables is at 36 at the end of the quarter added ms judy during the first nine months of fiscal 2022 we grew finance receivables by 220 million increased inventory by 37 million repurchased 27 million of our common stock and funded 14 million in capital expenditures our investments in the increased inventory and capital expenditures reflect our commitment to providing the necessary inventory and facilities to support a growing customer base we have remodeled or relocated 21 dealerships in the last nine months with six relocations currently in progress additionally we welcomed the associates and customers of smart auto in johnson city tennessee to the car mart family at the beginning of the fourth quarter as we were able to complete the purchase of the dealership assets smart auto johnson city brings a talented team of associates and helps to expand our footprint in tennessee we are excited for this opportunity and look forward to getting to know our customers and the community looking forward we may utilize our conservative balance sheet to participate in the securitization market as it would allow us to serve more customers and allow for future growth we have a 40 year history of managing through different environments we are very excited about our future and believe we are making the investments to further enhance our business and we have the balance sheet to grow and take advantage of market opportunities conference call and investor presentation management will be holding a

sanctions could drive up prices for everyday russians or cause russia s currency or markets to crash because the u s does not rely much on trade with russia it is somewhat insulated from direct consequences europe is more directly affected but certain sectors of the u s economy rely on highly specific russian exports primarily raw commodities the premise of sanctions is to hurt the other guy more than you hurt your own interests but that does not mean there will not be some collateral damage said doug rediker a partner at international capital strategies energy prices could rise in the early hours following russia s invasion brent crude oil was trading at more than 100 per barrel for the first time since 2014 and another benchmark west texas intermediate rose nearly 5 to more than 96 per barrel russia is a major exporter of oil and natural gas especially to europe as a result officials have reportedly shied away from severe sanctions on russian energy exports but there are other ways the energy market could be disrupted michael sohn ap ap nearly 40 of the natural gas used by the european union comes from russia president biden said prior to russia s invasion of ukraine that the not yet operational nord stream 2 pipeline would not move ahead in the event of an invasion for one russia could choose to cut off or limit oil and gas exports to europe as retaliation for sanctions nearly 40 of the natural gas used by the european union comes from russia and no european country imports more than germany a key ally of the united states even if russia chooses not to limit exports supplies could still be affected by the conflict in ukraine because multiple pipelines run through the country carrying gas from russia to europe they could simply be casualties of a military invasion rediker said either way if europe s natural gas supply is pinched that could cause energy prices which have already been climbing to rise even further and even though the u s imports relatively little oil from russia oil prices are set by the global market meaning local prices could rise anyway there s a geopolitical premium or call it a fear premium in the price of oil daniel yergin vice chairman of ihs markit told morning edition an expectation that as this crisis spirals worse that supplies of oil from russia are going to be disrupted other industries from food to cars might also be hurt russia is a major exporter of rare earth minerals and heavy metals such as titanium used in airplanes russia supplies about a third of the world s palladium a rare metal used in catalytic converters and its price has soared in recent weeks over fears of a conflict ukrainian economic output and industry will likely be significantly disrupted the country is a major source of neon which is used in manufacturing semiconductors as a result u s officials have warned various sectors including the semiconductor and aerospace industries to brace for supply chain disruptions fertilizer is produced in major quantities in both ukraine and russia disruptions to those exports would mostly affect agriculture in europe but food prices around the world could rise as a result global markets could drop the invasion rattled investors wednesday with dow futures down more than 2 before the markets opened in the united states markets across asia also dropped the invasion sent the prices of traditional investment safe havens higher with gold up more than 1 5 overnight markets are fundamentally not prepared for a land war in europe in the 21st century rediker said it s something people just have not contemplated the u s stock market has already been unusually volatile in recent weeks churning over inflation moves by the federal reserve to curb its stimulus programs and the looming conflict in ukraine historically the market has bounced back relatively quickly after geopolitical events that s what s most likely today too analysts say so the effect on people with 401 k accounts may be short term but if the conflict causes long lasting disruption of energy markets and other exports investors could rethink that conventional wisdom you re potentially at a point where not only are we looking at russia potentially invading ukraine and sanctions and countermeasures but you are also looking at a rise of china that doesn t necessarily agree with the american perspective on the world anyway rediker said last week before the invasion are we looking at a point in which some of the major premises that people take for granted have to be reassessed russia could launch disruptive cyberattacks another way russia could respond to u s sanctions is through cyberattacks and influence campaigns various federal agencies including the treasury and the department of homeland security have warned of possible cyberattacks on targets like big banks and power grid operators they have been warning everyone about russia s very specific tactics about the possibility of attacks on critical infrastructure katerina sedova a researcher at georgetown university s center for security and emerging technology told npr russian cyberattacks have targeted ukraine relentlessly in recent years including attacks on the capital city of kyiv s power grid in 2015 and 2016 but a major escalation could shift focus to u s targets sedova pointed to the russian state backed attack on the it software company solarwinds and a ransomware attack that shut down the colonial pipeline for six days as examples of how major russian cyberattacks could disrupt u s operations the biden administration said it does not believe the russian government was involved in the pipeline attack power grids hospitals and local governments could all be targets she said for now sedova said she is more worried about subtler attacks like influence campaigns that aim to sow discord between us and our allies in our resolve to act jointly against russia oftentimes cyber operations go hand in hand with influence she said they re targeting a change of decision making a change in policy in that direction a change in public opinion a major invasion would likely spark a refugee crisis anatolii stepanov afp via getty images afp via getty images a serviceman with ukraine s military forces walks along a trench on the front line with russia backed separatists not far from novoluhanske in ukraine s donetsk region on feb 16 the invasion could send 1 million to 5 million refugees fleeing ukraine u s officials and humanitarian agencies have warned it will be a continent wide humanitarian disaster with millions of refugees seeking protection in neighbouring european countries agnès callamard secretary general of amnesty international said last month in statement poland which shares a border with ukraine and is already home to more than a million ukrainians would likely see the most refugees polish interior minister mariusz kaminski said his country was preparing for an influx of refugees from ukraine the u s military says that the thousands of soldiers deployed to poland this month are prepared to assist with a large scale evacuation assistance with evacuation flow is something they could do and could do quite well they are going to be working with polish authorities on what that looks like and how they would handle that defense department spokesperson john kirby said last week at the largest scale a refugee crisis would not be contained to europe the u s would likely see refugees seeking asylum too copyright 2022 npr to see more visit

exclusive lawmakers in washington and financial experts across the country have been eyeing opportunities to support black banks and make them more accessible keewa nurullah a fourth generation entrepreneur who is a descendant of tulsa race massacre survivors attributes the success of the greenwood business district to capital that flowed through black banks as a toy shop owner in chicago nurullah admits she has been hard pressed to find a black bank to do business with in her area i feel like there s such a drought of black banks she told thegrio nurullah is not alone in this thought lawmakers in washington and financial experts across the country have been eyeing opportunities to support black banks and make them more accessible to communities in a u s house financial services hearing on thursday nicole elam president ceo national bankers association nba explained to congressmembers the grim statistics of black banks only 0 4 of minority depository institutions are black owned among all banks mdis only account for 3 of the industry she went on to share that since 2001 60 of black mdis have closed and to date they only control less than 1 of total bank assets in the united states photo adobe stock elam told thegrio exclusively that modernizing black banks is key to their survival and advancement robert smith owner of finastra provided mdis with financial technology to help black owned and operated banks automate lending for the paycheck protection program elam contends that while the challenge of having software was eliminated it highlighted another area of growth needed at the mdis having it personnel on staff elam points out that there is a rich legacy that black banks maintain but are also in cultural conflict with as they strive to keep doors open and expand for our banks if they have to manage the dna what makes them different and that s the relationships with the community with the hybrid of people wanting to do mobile banking elam added while the economic crisis set off by a global pandemic hammered small businesses it presented an opportunity for black banks to flex their community relations muscles and increase the capital available at each institution james sills leads the nation s second oldest black bank m f bank in north carolina he told thegrio that ppp loans attracted new business to the bank and increased the bank s partnership with mainstream financial institutions m f was founded with 10 000 in capital in 1907 a time when no black americans served in the state legislature that would approve the bank s charter fast forward to 2021 m f increased their capital through investments from bank of america wells fargo jpmorgan chase and citibank totaling 18 million that was a game changer for our institution sills told thegrio another way m f has raised capital is by publicly trading shares of the bank since 1999 m f bank has offered parcels of the business to shareholders to date 70 of those shareholders are black which continues to classify m f as a majority black owned and operated bank m f bank photo abc wtvd there are many benefits to black banks going public according to mccullough williams iii president and chief operating officer of xponance he explained to thegrio that it provides more flexibility for banks to tap into funds needed for business operations you can raise capital in an illiquid market where you don t have to wait long periods of time to get money that you need for your capital foundation as well as for providing pensions for your employees williams said earlier this month carver federal savings bank one of the nation s black operated banks celebrated black history month by ringing the nasdaq closing bell the bank has been publicly traded on this stock exchange since 2007 the opportunity for us to be a public company basically means that it creates interest in investors that ultimately understand and would be willing to support our mission michael t pugh president and ceo of carver federal savings bank as institutions of the black community black banks are often historic among atlantic coast communities and go back to the early 1900s and 1940s for instance doyle mitchell is a third generation black bank leader his father ran the bank he now operates and his grandfather founded it in washington d c industrial bank is a household name however mitchell clings to a humble upbringing that never overemphasized the legacy of the bank while the statistics of the black banking industry overall tell a tale of challenges and struggles to compete with mainstream banks that does not mean the current landscape of black banks lacks vibrant innovation and institutional growth in fact hopefuls in the midwest are nearing approval for the nation s newest black bank adelphi bank jordan miller jr who is one of the proposed incorporators of the bank told thegrio his group is on track to receive conditional approval for the bank by late april 2022 if all goes well the group would then go back to the market to engage in a full investment round to raise capital with a goal of launching in august photo adobe stock since early january 2021 miller and his colleagues have been hosting organizational meetings and building out their consulting team to plan to submit an application to the federal deposit insurance corporation in ohio he admits that the racial disparities unearthed by george floyd s murder the absence of a black bank in the area and overall socioeconomic challenges black ohioans faced prompted the group to begin their quest to jumpstart a new black bank we think that we can be a force in raising the economic ladder and opportunities for those folks that live in that community miller explained they can solve those issues they can solve the health disparities they can solve crime issues if they have a reason to participate in this economy just like everyone else does based on thegrio s conversations with ceos of black banks relationships and community ties serve as foundations for the black banking industry those are the main ingredients of the secret sauce that has allowed mdis to continue to operate and distinguish themselves from mainstream banks theodore daniels founder and president of society for financial education professional development partnered with carver bank in harlem to create a financial literacy program for hbcus students at howard university and medgar evers college receive an overview of personal finance and business operations through the program we know we have a void in the black community in terms of financial education daniels told thegrio daniels said the program is structured with the goal to have hbcu students learn the principles of money management credit management risk management investing and estate planning to then return to their neighborhoods and educate communities in a peer to peer grassroots exchange we know that we have a lot of situations where resources are there but people just don t know how to use them daniels added carver bank is the only black bank associated with sfepd at the moment but daniels is always open to new partnerships

compass revenue jumped 31 percent in the fourth quarter of 2021 and 73 percent for the entire year though expenses related to the company s public debut pushed up losses for the second quarter in a row compass has managed to boost its year over year revenue numbers while also seeing its losses rise according to an earnings report the company published wednesday compass also reported similar results for the entirety of last year with revenue jumping up significantly even as losses much of them related to the company s public debut grew the report specifically shows that during the final three months of 2021 compass earned 1 6 billion in revenue that s slightly lower than the company s revenue hauls in the second and third quarters of 2021 when it earned 1 95 billion and 1 74 billion respectively but it still marks a 31 percent increase compared to the fourth quarter of 2020 at the same time the company lost 175 million between october and december of 2021 by comparison compass lost 100 million one quarter prior and 7 1 million another quarter before that wednesday s earnings report notes that the majority of the net losses in 2021 were driven by the non cash stock based compensation expenses the company had much of which were related to compass initial public offering ipo last spring compass is well known for offering stock to agents and non cash stock based compensation expenses specifically accounted for 93 million in losses during the fourth quarter of 2021 the report also includes total numbers for 2021 revealing that over the course of the entire year compass earned 6 4 billion in revenue which represents a 73 percent year over year increase losses for the year added up to 494 million 386 million of which came from non cash stock based compensation losses in 2021 were up from 270 million in 2020 compass adjusted ebitda which is a measure of earnings before expenses such as taxes and interest and is used as a gauge of a company s profitability was 2 million in 2021 compared to a loss of 156 million one year prior in the report compass founder and ceo robert reffkin described the 2021 revenue growth as exceptionally strong and noted that our agents closed a record 225 000 transactions up 56 percent in 2021 while the industry grew transactions by 8 percent in the fourth quarter alone compass agents closed 56 912 transactions according to the report which is a 20 percent year over year increase i am happy to announce that our strategy of achieving strong revenue growth while improving profitability and investing in our business is working exceptionally well reffkin also said in the report in a call with investors wednesday afternoon reffkin added that compass is committed to increasing profitability and expects to be free cash flow positive in 2023 wednesday s report further notes that compass entered 25 new markets in 2021 which brought the company s total market count to 69 by the end of the fourth quarter the company had an average of 12 176 agents during the fourth quarter of 2021 which was up by 560 compared to one quarter earlier according to the report going into wednesday s earnings report compass stock was trading at around 8 50 per share that was down slightly for the day as well as down from just above 20 per share when the company first went public last april though a number of real estate companies have seen their share prices decline in recent months after compass published its earnings report the company s share price fluctuated in after hours trading but overall ended up about where it had closed for the day compass had a market cap of about 3 46 billion as of the close of the market wednesday the company last reported earnings in november at the time it revealed that it had seen spikes in both its revenue and its losses some of which stemmed from the same non cash stock based compensation expenses that impacted the fourth quarter in any case wednesday s report offers a number of glimpses into compass inner workings the report notes for example that more than 75 percent of principle agents in new york and washington d c which are compass two oldest markets are now no longer on their initial contracts however the company stated in the report that its annual retention rates are in the mid 90s this is significant because compass has aggressively recruited high performing agents sometimes to the chagrin of rivals with generous incentive packages but the latest numbers suggest agents may be sticking around after those packages run out during his call with investors reffkin also noted that our splits are improving and that compass doesn t plan to slow its recruiting efforts going forward we expect to add a similar number of agents in 2022 as we did in 2021 he said the report further notes that in the fourth quarter of 2021 a majority of the agents who came to compass told us they took a less favorable split than at their previous brokerage suggesting the company s recruiting victories may stem from factors beyond just compensation reffkin added during wednesday s investor call that compass retention rates have strengthened since our ipo relatedly reffkin said compass achieved 5 6 percent market share in 2021 which exceeded our original goals and he mentioned that the company is exploring the launch of another major adjacent service this year though final decisions about that move have not yet been made also on the call reffkin weighed in on the strength of the housing market noting that inventory remains tight while demand is still high and that means home prices should continue rising over the course of 2022 we foresee reffkin ultimately concluded strong market growth for the rest of this year update this post was updated after publication with addition information from compass earnings report as well as with comments from call company executives held with investors email jim dalrymple ii

the intent to drive value for our unitholders partners and employees and to make our business more resilient and sustainable for the long term i am very proud of our team for their focus and relentless execution in doing just that their dedication resulted in exceptional progress in 2021 and has allowed led us to enter 2022 from a position of strength for the fourth quarter enlink achieved adjusted ebitda of 286 4 million taking our full year adjusted ebitda to 1 05 billion the robust fourth quarter results placed us within the upper end of the increased guidance range that we provided in june i am also proud to report that on a year over year basis we delivered adjusted ebitda growth of over 17 in the fourth quarter after excluding the impact of mvcs that rolled off in 2020 enlink delivered robust growth in our permian and louisiana segments and we began to see the stability we ve projected in oklahoma and north texas as higher commodity prices spur an increase in activity through our innovative operational excellence program which we call the enlink way and is the road map for how we operate we ve been able to sustain peer leading cost structure reductions enacted in 2020 despite returning to a growth environment and seeing some inflationary pressures with the strength of our business and our disciplined financial approach enlink delivered another year of cash flow of over 300 million which allowed us to reach our leverage goal with a ratio of under 3 9 times as a result of this solid execution we were pleased to announce in december several actions that reflect a more balanced approach to capital allocation and increased returns to our unitholders our base business has shown tremendous execution and i am excited about the progress we are seeing in our carbon solutions business which is pursuing carbon capture and other opportunities that will allow enlink to play an even more active role in energy transition in a few short months we have begun to make real progress in building a comprehensive offering in louisiana yesterday afternoon we announced an alliance with talos energy to provide customers a complete solution for their carbon emissions in louisiana each of these successes is impressive and combined they made 2021 one of our best years to date and have positioned us well to further excel in 2022 last night we issued our 2022 financial guidance which showcases the tremendous improvement across our business we are forecasting adjusted ebitda year over year growth of approximately 10 at the midpoint the robust growth of our business coupled with our capital discipline allows us to continue to generate significant free cash flow and to maintain our strong financial flexibility at the midpoint we are forecasting our third consecutive year with free cash flow after distributions in excess of 300 million we are entering 2022 with an incredibly bright future ahead enlink s path forward will be focused on becoming the future of midstream we believe the midstream company of the future must have the following five key characteristics an integrated business model a large scale cash flow generating platform proven operational excellence a focus on delivering energy solutions for the future and a focus on environmental and responsible operations we believe enlink is well on its way in these five areas and we are focused on moving them forward with diligence and urgency as the future of midstream demands here s how first our large scale cash flow generating platform generates over 1 billion of ebitda and is delivering growth our robust free cash flow allows us to invest in our growing our business while providing attractive capital returns to our unitholders and continuing to improve our balance sheet second we have an integrated business model with scale positions in gmp across multiple basins connected to key downstream demand markets third we are powered by operational excellence we are deploying new technology to build on our position as one of the lowest cost most efficient operators in our industry our leading experienced operations team maintains both a customer centric mindset and a strong safety focus fourth we are well positioned to deliver energy solutions for the future our business is approximately 90 natural gas and ngls which are expected to show demand growth through the energy transition and we are building a promising carbon solutions business last but certainly not least we are focused on environmentally responsible operations in a few short months after establishing near term emissions targets we have made solid progress as demonstrated by an agreement to capture and sell co2 at our bridgeport facility in north texas as i touched on earlier we have a unique and very real opportunity to build a significant ccs business over time by repurposing existing assets in louisiana i d like to provide some color on the efforts enlink is pursuing we believe ccs provides a meaningful path forward to help industrial co2 emitters achieve their emission reduction goals within the united states co2 emissions from industrial and power generation make up nearly half of all co2 emissions the state of louisiana is the second largest industrial emitting state in the country and also ranks as the state with the second greatest sequestration potential due to its geology the majority of the emission sources are industries that are critical to our daily lives like fertilizer plants and chemical plants that make a key component used to make plastics enlink is the natural service provider in the state of louisiana particularly with the highly dense area of the mississippi river corridor where we bring decades of relationships and reliable operating experience plus over 4 000 miles of pipe already in place in addition our pipeline systems are located within close proximity to multiple potential sequestration sites all of that brings me to our latest announcement we are excited to be working with talos energy to jointly develop a complete co2 capture transportation and sequestration solution for industrial scale emitters in louisiana talos brings substantial subsurface expertise and access to potential sequestration sites while we bring the significant midstream assets customer relationships and the other elements that i mentioned as a result we are very excited for 2022 and beyond both for the trajectory of our base business and for the transformational potential of our carbon solutions endeavors with that i ll turn it over to you ben for an operational update ben lamb executive vice president and chief operating officer thanks barry and good morning everyone i d like to start by thanking all of our team members out in the field they not only operated in tough conditions during 2021 which included winter storm uri and hurricane ida but most importantly they did it safely enlink followed up a record safety performance in 2020 with another record in 2021 our 2021 total recordable injury rate came in at 0 44 less than half the industry average of a little over 1 0 this is testament to the actions we take to operate our assets with excellence while never compromising on safety now let s walk through our assets and let s start with the permian where we achieved another record by generating segment profit of 73 8 million during the fourth quarter of 2021 segment profit in the quarter included approximately 5 million of operating expenses tied to plant relocations and unrealized derivative losses excluding plant relocation opex and unrealized derivative activity segment profit in the fourth quarter of 2021 grew an impressive 16 sequentially and over 66 from the prior year quarter the fourth quarter of 2021 also marked the sixth consecutive quarter of positive segment cash flow average natural gas gathering volumes for the fourth quarter were approximately 8 higher compared to the third quarter of 2021 and approximately 28 higher compared to the fourth quarter of 2020 average natural gas processing volumes for the fourth quarter were approximately 7 higher sequentially and approximately 25 higher compared to the fourth quarter of 2020 producer activity across our footprint has remained robust from the fourth quarter of 2021 and into early 2022 as previously announced we reactivated the tiger plant in december of 2021 additionally we continue to make solid progress with project phantom which is on schedule to be placed into service in the fourth quarter of 2022 when we look forward we are projecting another year of significant growth for our permian business at the midpoint we are forecasting that segment profit will increase by nearly 40 to 320 million which includes 40 million of operating expenses related to our plant relocation as we grow alongside our customers the permian is likely to exit 2022 as our largest segment after adjusting for the phantom relocation expenses unlike last year when the growth was primarily driven by midland activity the delaware will also be adding more to the pie following the tiger plant restarting for example one of our customers in the delaware exxonmobil has announced plans to grow their permian volumes by 25 in 2022 turning now to louisiana we experienced expected favorable seasonality with segment profit for the fourth quarter of 2021 coming in at 111 7 million segment profit included unrealized derivative gains of 19 3 million with the majority of this associated with our gas and ngl storage positions excluding the impact of unrealized derivative activity and hurricane ida in the third quarter of 2021 segment profit in the fourth quarter of 2021 increased approximately 21 sequentially and 16 from the prior year quarter relative to the prior year both the gas and ngl businesses are showing strong growth benefiting from increased volume and higher margins the robust segment profit drove record segment cash flow of 107 8 million looking forward louisiana segment profit for 2022 is forecasted to be 355 million at the midpoint of guidance representing a 9 increase from 2021 the growth is largely driven by the ngl side of the business through increased volumes and higher margins compared to 2021 moving up to oklahoma we delivered segment profit of 99 4 million for the fourth quarter of 2021 segment profit in the quarter included approximately 1 4 million of operating expenses tied to plant relocations and unrealized derivative gains of approximately 9 4 million excluding plant relocation opex and unrealized derivative activity segment profit in the fourth quarter of 2021 increased 2 sequentially segment profit grew nearly 10 from the prior year quarter after excluding 17 6 million of now expired mvc deficiency payments received in the fourth quarter of 2020 the volume story out of oklahoma continues to improve as producers have responded to the improving pricing environment natural gas gathering volumes increased 2 sequentially and decreased only 2 compared to the prior year quarter natural gas processing volumes increased 4 sequentially and decreased only 2 over the prior year quarter oklahoma continues to deliver solid and stable cash flow for us during the fourth quarter of 2021 we generated 86 1 million in segment cash flow for 2022 oklahoma segment profit is forecasted to be 345 million at the midpoint which includes 5 million of operating expenses related to our plant relocation this outlook is approximately flat from 2021 when you exclude the adverse impact of winter storm uri we continue to be very encouraged with producer activity in the basin we discussed in our last earnings call the expected well connect activity in oklahoma and the fourth quarter came in as expected with december having more well connects than we saw in the entire first half of 2021 this improved activity gives us great momentum and confidence that volumes will be approximately flat in 2022 wrapping up with north texas segment profit for the quarter was 56 1 million and included unrealized derivative losses of 3 5 million excluding unrealized derivative activity segment profit in the fourth quarter of 2021 declined only 1 sequentially and 4 from the prior year quarter natural gas gathering volumes actually increased 1 sequentially and were flat compared to the prior year quarter for 2022 the north texas segment profit is forecasted to be 230 million at the midpoint this outlook reflects a stable source of cash flow when you exclude the modest impact of winter storm uri we continue to be encouraged with producer activity in the basin as bkv is expected to commence a modest new drilling program in 2022 finally i want to give a quick update on the enlink way and driving value for our stakeholders we completed 25 operational excellence initiatives in 2021 for example we piloted the remote operation of a processing facility and now our silver creek plant is operated entirely by the team at our bridgeport facility as an example outside of operations we ve begun implementing robotic process automation to reduce manual work in manipulating data giving our team time to do more value added work and reducing the chance for errors these efforts are part of an ongoing process to always operate our business better and to create sustainable value with that i ll pass it over to pablo to discuss our financial update pablo mercado executive vice president and chief financial officer thank you ben and good morning everyone i ll start with the fourth quarter highlights as barry mentioned enlink delivered a solid fourth quarter achieving 286 million of adjusted ebitda excluding the impact of the mvc that rolled off in 2020 adjusted ebitda increased over 17 from the fourth quarter of 2020 this result reflects robust growth out of the permian solid growth in louisiana and relatively stable operations in oklahoma and north texas enlink also achieved 67 million of free cash flow after distributions for the fourth quarter of 2021 with all four of our asset segments once again delivering positive cash contributions for the full year of 2021 enlink delivered adjusted ebitda of 1 05 billion and free cash flow after distributions of 314 million on the cost control front our team s focus on efficiency allowed us to sustain our peer leading reduction in operating and general and administrative expenses from 2020 after adjusting for plant relocation costs and the noise from winter storm uri our total cost structure in 2021 was still 23 lower than in 2019 the capital expenditures net to enlink and plant relocation expenses were approximately 85 million for the fourth quarter and 220 million for the full year of 2021 these investments were flat from the prior year despite the growth that our operations delivered this can be attributed to the excellent work the team has done to execute on our capital light strategy which includes optimizing the use of existing assets as we have done by relocating significant processing capacity from oklahoma to the midland basin going forward we remain focused on the disciplined investment approach with high return hurdle rates and quick paybacks on the balance sheet side our actions over the past two years have put us in a solid financial position with ample financial flexibility during the quarter we repaid the remaining balance of our term loan and ended the year with a debt to adjusted ebitda ratio of under 3 9 times consistent with the strategy that we have been discussing with you over the last several quarters we announced at the end of december plans to deploy a more balanced capital allocation approach in the fourth quarter of 2021 we increased our common unit distribution by 20 and accelerated our common unit buybacks bringing the 2021 total to 40 million of spend we also redeemed 50 million of our preferred b units in the fourth quarter and another 50 million at the beginning of this year both at a price of 101 of par the net impact of the distribution increase and the repurchases and redemptions on our overall distribution payout is approximately 25 million on an annualized basis also in december our board refreshed our common unit repurchase authorization to 100 million and we expect to continue to be active with the program to that end we recently entered into an agreement with gip through which they will participate on a pro rata basis in the common unit buyback activity this will have the effect of protecting our public float on a percent basis and maintaining gip s current economic ownership level flat at approximately 46 next let me turn to the 2022 guidance that we announced yesterday we are forecasting another year of solid growth driven by disciplined investments and a continued focus on cost efficiencies from an adjusted ebitda standpoint we are forecasting a range of 1 11 billion to 1 19 billion this represents growth of approximately 10 at the midpoint of the range and is driven by robust growth in the permian strong growth in louisiana and stable operations in oklahoma and north texas exiting 2022 the permian will likely be our largest segment as we continue to execute on our disciplined growth strategy to meet customer needs while approximately 90 of our business is fee based we do benefit from the strong commodity prices we are seeing today current forward prices as of yesterday are sufficient to put adjusted ebitda at the top end of our range more importantly strong commodity prices can drive incremental producer activity as we experienced in 2021 now as a reminder while we don t provide quarterly guidance we typically experience some seasonality especially in our louisiana business with our strongest quarterly results in the fourth quarter and a small sequential decline in the first quarter on the investment front total capital expenditures plus operating expenses associated with project phantom are forecasted to be between 285 million and 325 million in 2022 aside from project phantom we expect 2022 capital to be heavily weighted to well connects and gathering infrastructure projects that have very high returns and quick paybacks our capital light approach allows us to grow alongside our customers in a disciplined manner while generating very significant free cash flow with robust forecasted ebitda balanced by modest increases in capex and the previously announced 20 increase to the distribution we forecast free cash flow after distributions in the range of 285 million to 345 million this will mark at the midpoint the third consecutive year of free cash flow after distributions of over 300 million in summary the enlink team delivered solid results in 2021 and the outlook for our operations in 2022 is even better we re seeing a welcome shift in activity in our oklahoma and north texas segments which we expect to be much more stable in 2022 resulting in an overall growth forecast for enlink with that i ll turn it back to barry barry davis chairman and chief executive officer thank you pablo as you can see enlink continues to deliver and we are entering 2022 with an incredibly bright future ahead including the realization of our vision to become the future of midstream by leading in innovation and creating sustainable value for the long term with that you may now open the call for questions questions answers operator thank you we will now begin the question and answer session and today s first question comes from michael cusimano with pickering energy partners please go ahead michael cusimano pickering energy partners analyst hi good morning everyone thanks for the details today i was hoping we could start on where we are today with oklahoma activity and how the i believe the comment previously has been that you need less than seven rigs to hold volumes flat i was curious how that plays out with 22 guidance and if that expectation has changed at all ben lamb executive vice president and chief operating officer yes good morning michael it s ben that s about right today we are seeing a higher level of activity than that just right at the moment it s 11 rigs on the footprint but what s most encouraging about that is those rigs were operated by eight different customers and the most exciting news of recent days is the addition of a third rig to the devon dow jv when you take all of that together along with the level of activity that we saw in the fourth quarter that we talked about in the prepared remarks it gives us a lot of momentum going into 2022 and confident that the decline in oklahoma has stopped michael cusimano pickering energy partners analyst ok great and then pivoting a little bit can you talk about how much of an increase for your 22 guidance was a result of any like inflation adjustments that you ll have in your contracts i don t think you quantified that in the release but i m curious if you saw any green shoots there ben lamb executive vice president and chief operating officer yeah michael i would say in general on the revenue side of the equation we made an assumption that was not very different from our historical assumptions around inflation so there s not an outsized benefit built in there now we were thoughtful in doing our opex forecast and our capital budget to incorporate in there to the best that we are able the expected inflation that we may see in material prices that goes on that to date it has not been a major factor for us pablo mercado executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah michael i ll take that this is pablo i d just add that we are seeing a little bit of inflation and as ben said it s baked into our forecast at the same time we re working on our operational excellence initiatives which have yielded really good results and part of the focus there is to be able to maintain a cost structure that s flat particularly on the g a side even despite the inflation pressures that we re seeing in labor and on the opex on chemicals and lubricants and that kind of thing michael cusimano pickering energy partners analyst ok that s helpful i do have one more if i can you realized about 24 million of hedge losses this quarter i m curious if you can just give us an idea of how maybe like in a stable strip scenario or like flat with today what those hedge realizations look like in 22 because i think they ve been material for the last few quarters so it would be helpful if you can give us an idea what that looks like going forward pablo mercado executive vice president and chief financial officer yes michael this is pablo again let me sort of take that up a notch and just remind everyone that we re about 90 fixed fee and so we ve got limited commodity price exposure we do benefit some from commodity prices directly but even more importantly through the activity that higher commodity prices like we have today can drive i d say in 2021 we saw some hedge losses as we had layered in some hedges at lower prices than we re in a rising commodity price environment i think that s going to be different in 2022 we entered the year less hedged and as i commented before we see a forward curve currently that s higher than the midpoint that is implied in the midpoint of our range and it would point us to the upper end of the range we have been here recently able to layer in some hedges along with our programmatic approach at those higher prices and so we expect to see some of that benefit as well michael cusimano pickering energy partners analyst all right that s really helpful thank you all and appreciate all the color operator our next question today comes from tj schultz at rbc capital markets please go ahead tj schultz rbc capital markets analyst great good morning maybe barry to the extent possible on the ccs opportunity can you just give us any framework on timing to market the project any expected cost and cash flow from the overall project considering the advantage you have on capital avoidance by repurposing pipe barry davis chairman and chief executive officer yes tj good morning this is barry first of all again we re really excited to be where we are this is something that we ve worked very diligently on for just over a year it s a very fast moving opportunity and i think we have a great opportunity to be a first mover in saying that i think it makes the answer to your question a little complicated because there are so many things we re doing that there are no precedents for and so as we negotiate with customers as we go through the permitting process etc much of this will be the first time that it s been done so i m going to hand it over to ben i think he ll go into some details as to what we think this process looks like ben lamb executive vice president and chief operating officer yeah tj from the perspective of timing with talos having secured the lease of 26 000 acres all of which lie directly under or adjacent to our existing pipe the critical path item on operations is securing class 6 permits for sequestration wells talos expects to file for those later this year and then today it s about an 18 month process perhaps that gets sped up a bit if louisiana gets primacy over the permitting process as we expect them to do later this year from a customer perspective the marketing process is happening now and what we have heard from potential customers is that they re looking for two things number one they re looking for a complete solution not a partial solution and with today s announcement we now have the complete solution we have a transportation solution we have a sequestration solution and to the extent that the customer desires it we have a capture solution the second thing they re looking for is a cost effective option and with the advantage that we bring with pipeline already in the ground we have a cost advantage over the competition and so the marketing is ongoing we re probably a couple of years away from operation when you consider the permitting timeline but we ve as barry said we ve never been more excited about the ccs potential than we are with the announcement of today s alliance tj schultz rbc capital markets analyst ok that all makes sense we ll stay tuned just shifting gears slide 18 and 19 were pretty helpful in your deck on capital allocation and capex the first part of the question is just on growth capex on slide 18 the other bucket if you can kind of detail what s in there what type of projects are you considering outside of gmp and then the second part for free cash flow after distributions on slide 19 you have 165 million allocated to either additional growth projects or debt reduction just any color on how you are considering that allocation is it just a function of rig activity that you may need to react to with additional well connects thanks pablo mercado executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah let me start on the capex question and then we ll move to the capital allocation question i ll probably ask ben to chime in on capex as well so tj our capex budget for this year it s just about the best capital you can spend first the biggest piece is the plant relocation with the phantom facility it s our second plant relocation first one as you know went really well and of course that s had a fraction of the cost of a new built plant the rest of the capital is really focused on well connects and the gathering infrastructure that goes with that which again is some of the best capital you can spend quick paybacks helps us support the growth in volume that we re seeing not only in the permian basin but now good activity across the board ben what would you add to that on the capex side ben lamb executive vice president and chief operating officer yes in terms of the other bucket tj it s mostly well connect adjacent so compression projects larger pipelines that aggregate volumes from multiple well connects into the main system and also some work i would describe as around enhancing the louisiana ngl business when you think about that ngl business it was originally scoped for cadence of our pipeline when it was originally scoped it was about 110 000 barrels a day today we re running 185 000 or so day in and day out to those louisiana fracs and so it s some reliability work to make sure that we can do that day in and day out those sorts of projects pablo mercado executive vice president and chief financial officer and tj on your capital allocation question look i d start by saying we re in a fortunate position where we ve been able to invest in growing the business in a very disciplined way and also pivoted to a more balanced distribution of capital including a 20 increase to the distribution so with all that we re still generating in excess of 300 million of free cash flow after distributions as we ve done in the last couple of years that s higher than that at the midpoint of our guidance range and if you look at that slide 19 in our deck first of all the board has authorized us to spend another 100 million on common unit repurchases we ve been active at the beginning of the year have already spent 10 million and expect to continue to be active returning capital to unitholders that way we ve also importantly i think bought 100 million of preferred fees we did 50 million in the fourth quarter and followed that up early this year with another 50 million which opens the door to potentially doing more of that it s at a good price yielding almost 8 5 so it s another great way to reduce leverage on the balance sheet you pointed that to that 165 million slice that sort of unidentified and talks about growth projects and leverage reduction we would expect and hope that we can do more of the preferred buybacks with that capital in terms of growth projects as you know we are always looking to build our downstream business with projects like the venture global deal that came online at the beginning of last year so we re looking at similar things and now with the ccs announcement i don t expect much capital this year but that s certainly another good use of capital down the road tj schultz rbc capital markets analyst great that s all helpful i ll stop there operator thank you our next question today comes from colton bean at tudor pickering holt and company please go ahead colton bean tudor pickering holt and company analyst good morning so just looking at the year on year step up in permian segment profit is there any rough breakout you could provide in terms of the relative contribution from higher commodity margins versus higher throughput ben lamb executive vice president and chief operating officer hi colton it s ben it s a little bit hard to get to that level of detail but i d say look if you re looking sequentially 3q to 4q and you re correcting for the plant relocation opex and the unrealized derivatives that we give you detail on there was not a huge difference in the price deck you know where there s a bit of a difference in the price deck is from 4q of last year or even 1q of last year to this past quarter and so both elements are contributing in the year over year growth but it s primarily been volumetric growth in recent days i think the broader picture on our permian growth for this year which is in the 40 range is that it s driven by both sides of the basin so last year the vast majority of the growth in the permian came from midland and particularly from the midland gas business this year it will be more balanced we expect to see a significant additional contribution from our delaware business and also to see significant additional contributions from our crude businesses those were a bit smaller than the gas businesses but they still make a difference so this year the permian business is going to be firing on all cylinders to deliver greater than 40 growth over last year colton bean tudor pickering holt and company analyst ok and that s actually like a segue there so you mentioned the growth you re expecting in the delaware i know you ve spoken to this in the past but with the sixth anniversary of the delaware jv coming up later this year can you just update us on how you all are thinking about that partnership whether consolidation might make sense down the road or any changes there pablo mercado executive vice president and chief financial officer yes this is pablo colton it has been a great partnership and gp sees the world the same way we do it s been growing nicely here recently with the need to add the tiger plant back on and we see really good growth prospects i d say they re very patient all private equity firms have become a little bit more patient in terms of seeing good returns in the space so i wouldn t expect anything in the near term but yes over time it would make sense for us to own that in house colton bean tudor pickering holt and company analyst great i appreciate it operator thank you your next question today comes from spiro dounis with credit suisse please go ahead spiro dounis credit suisse analyst thanks operator good morning guys two quick follow ups from me first one sticking with the permian and just thinking about processing plant capacity obviously you mentioned exxon growing at about 25 a clip this year and so as you think about the need for the next processing plant beyond phantom how are you thinking around that timing and is there another relocation option available to you guys again ben lamb executive vice president and chief operating officer hi spiro yes on that i would say first in the delaware we re well taken care of for this year with the restart of tiger tiger is good for 240 and so it s a nice addition of capacity and that will take care of the growth we expect to see from exxonmobil and from a variety of other customers in the delaware business this year phantom is projected to come online in the second half later in the second half of this year and that will add 200 million cubic feet a day of capacity to the midland basin i think it s too early to talk about timing on the next midland expansion i think we need to get through this year get the phantom plant online and then see how the market develops into 2023 before we can pinpoint timing on another expansion pablo mercado executive vice president and chief financial officer actually when we get there we ll be very disciplined in our approach and look at the full range of options as we did here including sort of building up through offloads for a period of time and look at the capital efficient alternatives as we ve done in the past ben lamb executive vice president and chief operating officer yes and in fairness you did ask here whether there s another relocation alternative there is another relocation alternative obviously we chose to relocate thunderbird now its phantom because it was the best option that we had but we do have other options for plant relocations and as pablo said we ll take those into consideration when the time is right spiro dounis credit suisse analyst great it s good color thanks for that guys second one just shifting gears over to lng when you think about scaling up your relationship with venture global going forward you mentioned calcasieu pass obviously up and running now is there an opportunity to do more there and when you think about plaquemines i think that s kind of a stone s throw away from being sanctioned here should we imagine a similar setup with that facility and how you think about utilizing some of your current network to facilitate that as well ben lamb executive vice president and chief operating officer i d broaden that and say that we re very well positioned to support lng growth in louisiana and the deal that we did on calcasieu pass is a great example of that we don t think that will be the last one as you point out calcasieu pass is in the very early stages of its initial operations and so i think it s probably too soon to talk about what comes next spiro dounis credit suisse analyst fair enough thanks for the time guys ben lamb executive vice president and chief operating officer thanks spiro operator the next question today comes from vinay chitteti with j p morgan please go ahead vinay chitteti j p morgan analyst hi good morning maybe i just wanted to follow up on the partnership with talos energy there i remember you previously discussed some projects are viable under the current existing 45q tax structure but we have heard some of your peers discussing there could be mechanical and integrity issues and conversion of a nat gas to co2 pipe is a bit expensive maybe just wanted to share any of your any thoughts on your preliminary work what kind of cost savings could you see from nat gas pipeline conversion to co2 pipes and also if talking specifically about this partnership if you could share any updates on what capex will that be and ebitda upside you would see in the next few years ben lamb executive vice president and chief operating officer yes hi vinay several parts of your question there let me start and then i expect pablo and barry will probably want to add on so let me start with the question about the conversion of natural gas pipelines because i do think there has been a little bit of misinformation out there the advantage that we have is that our existing natural gas network number one has significant redundancy in it today because we own two pipeline systems that both serve the louisiana industrial market the lig system and the bridgeline system so we have the ability to repurpose some of those lines without having a significant impact on the gas business that we have today secondly those pipelines tend to be a very large diameter so we re talking 24 inch 30 inch and 36 inch pipelines and because those pipelines are so large we have the ability to move very significant quantities of co2 in the gaseous phase without having to be in the supercritical phase we re highly confident of that having done a tremendous amount of engineering work and i would say that everyone we ve spoken to in terms of potential partners and in terms of potential customers when they see the work they agree with us so that s not a concern at all from our perspective on 45q at 50 today the emitters that we are targeting are economic now if the congress were to increase 45q whether it 85 or some other number then certainly that further expands the pie but even in today s regime there are sufficient emissions available that are economic to build a scale business in ccs in louisiana and then i think third part of your question was the cost savings that comes from having a pipeline in the ground and the answer is it s savings both in terms of time and in terms of capital because as you will see when you look at the map of the enlink talos alliance all three of the land parcels in the riverbend sequestration scope are directly beneath or directly adjacent to existing enlink pipelines which means that we expect very limited additional pipeline infrastructure to be needed to move co2 to those sites so that s the savings of time in terms of permitting and construction and the savings in terms of capital and frankly environmental benefits to the state of louisiana because you re not crossing sensitive wetlands with new pipelines you re using assets that are already in the ground today vinay chitteti j p morgan analyst got it thanks a lot for all the color there just one follow up on that is it possible to maybe quantify potential ebitda opportunity here and capex or is it too early for that right now barry davis chairman and chief executive officer yes vinay this is barry let me say that it is early and much of that will be determined i think the thing that we would say is this is going to play out in the near term as ben mentioned earlier contracting with our customers is happening now as we speak we are defining plans in terms of exactly how the layout of the systems and so we will know more in the very near future i think from a timing perspective we just highlighted that we believe this business starts to operate in late 23 early 24 and the amount of capital between here and there would be very limited on our side again because of the proximity of the sequestration sites and the customers the redundancy of pipe and so we think what we call phase 1 will be a very efficient start up process vinay chitteti j p morgan analyst got it thanks a lot and then just following up on producer activity here i guess you guys have given a lot of commentary on all the particular basins earlier just wanted to follow up is that is the activity upside driven primarily from private smaller operators going on right now i know you have mentioned some talking about 25 growth next year do you see any further upside from large caps and other majors in 2022 ben lamb executive vice president and chief operating officer look in terms of the levels of activity and how it s being driven in the permian it is a very diverse mix of both large public companies and some of the premier private operators particularly in the midland basin we have a very balanced business there in oklahoma last year it was mostly driven by the private companies what we ve seen in early 22 is the addition of a third rig to the devon activity so from two to three and a little bit of activity from some of the other public companies while we have also seen the private activity level continue and even strengthen a bit in fact i think just right today on the 16th of february we ve got more rigs operating in the basin than we ve had since the summer of 2019 which is a really nice thing to see in terms of the outlook i think that if commodity prices stay strong there s a potential to see a bit more activity but i do think that particularly among the public companies they re going to be very disciplined and try to stick to the plans that they ve laid out and frankly that s ok with us because greater than 40 growth in the permian is a fine place for us to be in 2022 vinay chitteti j p morgan analyst got it that s it from me operator thank you today s next question comes from sunil sibal with seaport global securities please go ahead sunil sibal seaport global securities analyst yes hi good morning folks and thanks for the commentary on the call so first one clarification on the ccs opportunity it seems like capex on this is fairly manageable so is it fair to assume that you will be funding all of this on your own balance sheet or should we think about any other structures that may be put in place for funding pablo mercado executive vice president and chief financial officer yes sunil it s pablo look early on it s going to be minimal capital certainly this year maybe a few million dollars of capital as we see the opportunities develop we ll know more about the capital needs initially i would expect as ben was mentioning relatively light because it s connections to existing pipe so relatively short distances but we ll see i think we are excited about the prospects of this business and how big it could be over time i d say we will likely fund it internally even long term but you never know and we ll consider all of our options for the best and lowest cost of capital sunil sibal seaport global securities analyst got it then on balance sheet could you remind us how the preferreds are treated by the rating agencies in terms of your capital stack and then you know a little bit of a longer or bigger term question how do you think about your ratings so it seems like when i look at credit markets there is kind of limited upside in terms of credit yields going from a high quality high yield player versus investment grade so i was just kind of curious do you see any business kind of benefits going to an ig or how should we think about that the whole issue pablo mercado executive vice president and chief financial officer yes so the preferred bs do get equity credit it varies by agency but we do get some equity credit certainly from our credit facility ratio we get full equity treatment for those that said it is our highest cost of capital in the capital structure and buying them back at almost an 8 5 yield we think is a great way to continue to delever the balance sheet regardless of the equity treatment from a rating agency perspective i think we ve got very good momentum with the agencies i would say that we beat any forecast that we ve put in front of them over the last couple of years and we our credit profile has improved significantly i would also add that investment grade ratings are probably not an objective in and of themselves as you point out from a cost of capital perspective i think we can achieve good cost of capital but we are working our way back toward those metrics and expect some progress there sunil sibal seaport global securities analyst got it thanks for that operator thank you and ladies and gentlemen this concludes our question and answer session i d like to turn the conference back over to the management team for any final remarks barry davis chairman and chief executive officer thank you rocco for facilitating our call this morning and thank you everyone for being on the call today and for your support as always we appreciate your continued interest and investment in enlink we

chief investment officer thank you matt and good morning everyone i ll review the quarter reflect back on 2021 on this year end call walk you through high level business trends and our capital allocation priorities john will provide an update on the operational environment for sho and mob portfolios and tim will walk you through our triple net businesses balance sheet highlights and first quarter guidance 2021 was a year marked by high conviction capital deployment partner and talent acquisition and a powerful inflection in our senior housing business our belief in the long term demand thesis for the senior housing proved out as we witnessed significant occupancy growth starting in the spring of last year which continued through the historically seasonally weak winter season just as importantly in the second half of 2021 we began to see a significant shift in the pricing power interestingly we found these pricing power during a period of relatively low occupancy levels after all what industry or asset class do you know of that is able to achieve pricing power with occupancy levels in the low 70 range low behold that pricing power continued to strengthen in q4 and in the first quarter of this year despite the impact of delta and omicron same store revpor grew 3 4 in q4 following a year over year same store revenue growth of 4 8 one of the strongest quarter in the company s history and even more encouraging is the revenue growth in u s exceeded 6 with the momentum accelerating through fourth quarter john will walk you through the details in a moment though i am not happy with our subpar bottom line results due to increased expenses mainly from the omicron induced labor crisis i continue to believe we will see significant improvement throughout the year given the continued net hiring trends we re seeing from our operating partners this assumes we don t experience a highly infectious variant we can offset the higher cost of full time employees just as we have done during the years prior to covid it is a significant presence of contract labor at surge pricing level that is a source of the issue from a demand standpoint we saw record interest in our product in q4 that continued through january with inquiries up significantly from december however a meaningful number of tours got canceled or postponed as either the prospective resident or their family got covid or a community that did not have enough employees to conduct the tour as there was a covid crisis in the communities however the tours have picked up meaningfully in recent weeks and we are starting to see strong sales activity which should translate into higher net move ins in next three to four weeks if we are right about this you may see occupancy growth exceed seasonal trends while occurring in an environment of strong rate growth we project this will put us into the double digit noi growth range in q1 only to accelerate further throughout the year as disappointed as i am about the diminished bottom line flow through in q4 due to 30 million of agency costs compared to only 5 million in q1 of last year i continue to believe that our 2022 exit run rate and 2023 earnings power of this platform is unchanged moving to capital allocation in 2021 we deployed 5 7 billion across great real estate with fantastic operator and at even a better price the most incredible aspect of this story was the granular nature of execution with a median transaction size of 26 million we re not believers in elephant hunting as larger transactions usually result in value accruing to the seller as you know we manage this company for our long term shareholders to increase our share value q4 was no exception to this consistent trend we have deployed 1 4 billion of capital in q4 across 20 separate transactions with a median size of 24 million i won t bore you with the details of every transaction but i would be remiss not to mention a couple of them which i m particularly proud of including a handful of trophy buildings in boston and florida at a very attractive basis but perhaps the most exciting investment of the quarter was the formation of our partnership with andy and glenn at quality senior living or qsl it is hard to overstate how strong of a team andy and glenn have built from conceptualization of the product to development execution and ultimately their operational excellence for example despite all the labor challenges that i ve highlighted qsl have used virtually no agency labor and their buildings are well occupied andy who is one of the biggest users of our data analytics platform is embarking on a multiyear effort to expand the blake brand with the full support of our platform behind him i hope you are seeing a pattern here with how our data and predictive analytics platform attracts some of the best people in the business as we offer so much more than capital this network effect of platform execution across multiyear partnership that were formed over the last few years will fuel our growth for years to come as delta and omicron induce challenges we had that ugly hit in q4 capital deployment opportunity set only expanded and that continued in q1 which is seasonally the weakest quarter from a deal activity with after a strong close of 2021 we have already closed an approximately 600 million of the investment over the last six weeks and i m pleased to report that our pipeline remains robust highly visible and actionable while the capital market backdrops remain volatile of late driven primarily by the fed headlines we re well positioned to fund our pipeline with well over 1 billion of equity and availability of liquidity in excess of 4 billion we re proud of our capital allocation track record both deployment and sourcing but if capital markets volatility continues we will access different tools from our toolbox as we have done before lastly i m very proud to announce our new partnership with reuben brothers which is buying avery healthcare one of our largest operating partner reuben brothers founded by david and simon reuben is one of the largest family offices in the world and is the owner of prime real estate and infrastructure both in u k and globally they are also a pioneer of investing in alternative real estate and infrastructure as an early investor and owner of global switch reuben brothers share our optimism for the exceptional growth trajectory for healthcare and wellness infrastructure as society ages we re particularly excited about the prospect of expanding the platform together as reuben brothers owns some of the most prime land and real estate in the u k tim and i have said on this call many times that temporary degradation of cash flow doesn t necessarily mean the extraction of value avery which constitutes 16 of our same store triple net noi will be significantly delevered through this equity infusion from reuben brothers partnering with highly sophisticated global investors like reuben brothers validates our view of the long term value of this business despite wall street s obsession with point to time coverage in conclusion i m very proud to of our execution in 2021 across operations capital allocation and partnership that stage is set for multiyear earnings growth as we find ourselves at the bottom of both secular and cyclical cycles with unparalleled platform built with advanced data analytics 20 or so growth vehicles with different partners and talent to execute on it the pandemic has been devastating for our entire ecosystem but we have doubled down during this massive disruption given our high conviction investment thesis you as our shareholders can rest assured that we ll not be resting on our laurels and that will continue to dig deeper and wider moat with that i ll pass it over to john john john burkart executive vice president chief operating officer thank you shankh my comments today will focus on the performance of our management operating segments in the quarter starting with our medical office portfolio in the fourth quarter our outpatient medical segment delivered 2 4 same store noi growth over the prior year s quarter despite a 20 basis point decline in occupancy we continue to see strong retention rates at 86 in the fourth quarter and with increasing construction costs and rising market rates we will continue to push renewal rates in exchange and accept the reasonable level of increased turnover and related frictional vacancy as we maximize the value of the portfolio now turning to our senior housing operating portfolio the strong demand based recovery in the senior housing business continues to strengthen the sho portfolio same store revenue increased 4 8 in the fourth quarter of 2021 representing the first full period of year over year same store revenue growth since the beginning of the pandemic occupancy grew 90 basis points over the prior year s quarter again the first year over year increase in occupancy since the beginning of the pandemic and the largest year over year gain for any quarter since 2016 sequentially the sho portfolio spot occupancy increased approximately 70 basis points during the fourth quarter to 77 7 compounding these strong occupancy trends is a notable shift in pricing power over the second half of the year operators have successfully raised and are again able to charge community raised rates and are again able to charge community fees both of which were reflected in a 3 4 year over year increase in revpor during the quarter and following an outsized increases on january and february renewals with little to no pushback we expect further acceleration in revpor growth over the course of the year geographically each of our markets canada the u k and the u s are showing improvement in same store top line metrics through the quarter our canadian portfolio which has lagged the recovery posted a year over year revenue decline of 3 in q4 2021 however the revenue decline improved intra quarter moving from a decline of 4 2 in october 2021 to a decline of 1 4 in december 21 compared to the prior year s respective months sequentially the canadian same store portfolio grew at a revenue rate of 1 8 in the fourth quarter in the u k our same store revenue increased 7 8 during the fourth quarter on a year over year basis accelerating from 7 1 growth in october of 2021 to 9 in december of 2021 compared to the prior year s respective months finally in the u s where the majority of our portfolio is located year over year revenue growth in the fourth quarter was 6 3 the acceleration in revenue growth was particularly pronounced in the u s accelerating from 3 8 in october 21 versus the prior year s month to 9 1 in december despite these encouraging top line trends expenses increased 8 8 year over year driven largely by excessive agency cost the combination of holiday time off and omicron disruption led to an increase in agency costs in the quarter almost 4 5 times agency expense versus the prior year s quarter excluding agency costs expenses increased 5 3 stress and systems highlights opportunities and issues and the extreme stress in the healthcare system brought on by covid has identified some opportunities to improve the value proposition for our hard working healthcare workers the agencies have been a temporary crutch which will provide a short term option for both operators and the healthcare workers that said the excessive use of agencies is truly short term in nature and the exceptional premiums that they charge as much as six times the base rate during the recent holiday period do not pass through to the agency employees who typically do not receive benefits either the quality of life and their work experience is substantially less desirable than that of a permanent employee agency employees lack the connection to their coworkers and customers that they desire as they travel from site to site city to city and state to state on a daily basis often away from their families additionally agency employees are less efficient as they do not know the systems nor the processes of the operator or the site nor the specific customer requirement our operators have many workflows underway at this time to improve the value proposition for permanent employees which were bearing fruit prior to the omicron nonetheless the results of these outsized expenses was a decline in same store noi of 9 3 in the fourth quarter of 2021 but still marked an improvement from q3 2021 with over 50 of operators delivering positive noi growth for the period the recovery continues to strengthen despite recent omicron disruption and we remain confident in our ability to drive significant noi growth in 2022 through january agency labor expense has declined as staff cases have fallen agency labor expense is expected to moderate further through the first half of 2022 and declined substantially in the second half of 2022 the other disruption caused by omicron was a record cancellation of tourists which shankh described however at this point weekly staff cases are down 81 from their peak including an 89 drop in the u s and we are seeing operations normalize the disruption of tours and sales caused occupancy to fall about 20 basis points in january however with the high level of traffic we expect that the continued occupancy gains will return and that we will regain lost occupancy by the end of the quarter here are some quotes from our operators about the strength of traffic and deposits digital inquiries were up 36 over 2019 in the fourth quarter and continued strong in january and our four week averages for inquiries tours and deposits are the highest they ve been since august of 2021 we are seeing week over week growth in deposits of 10 the last four weeks running we are experiencing the strongest january for inquiries in several years and finally our inquiries from the last week alone have been the highest numbers we ve ever experienced in closing i have shifted from full immersion in the business to planning in action i m even more excited about the future opportunities across the welltower platform we are leveraging our proprietary data analytics platform and operationalizing the data to drive results this process is occurring right now as we have several workflows underway which we expect to bear fruit in the immediate future as well as many more workflows that we expect to drive our outperformance in the quarters and years to come i continue to be appreciative of the warm welcome and excitement expressed by our operators as we leverage our combined real estate operating company and care experience to improve the customer and employee experience and drive financial results each operator has a unique expertise and opportunities we have been working very well together and offering support where needed from implementing best practices to applying data analytics to improve their business in one case we identified a software tool over 25 years old as they say the 90s called and they want their beeper back i m confident there is a substantial opportunity to implement operational excellence across the board and bringing the basic back office and sales operations up to match the high quality of care the operators are delivering which will drive significant margin growth in the years to come i ll now turn the call over to tim tim mchugh executive vice president chief financial officer thank you john my comments today will focus on our fourth quarter 2021 results performance of our triple net investment segment in the quarter our capital activity a balance sheet and liquidity update and finally our outlook for the first quarter welltower reported fourth quarter net income attributable to common stockholders of a 0 13 per diluted share and normalized funds from operations of 0 83 per diluted share relative to the guidance of 0 78 to 0 83 per share our results included approximately 18 million or 0 04 per diluted share of hhs funds and other out of period government grants that were not previously budgeted turning to our triple net lease portfolios as a reminder our triple net lease portfolio coverage and occupancy stats reported a quarter in arrears so these statistics reflect the trailing 12 months at 9 30 2021 in our senior housing triple net portfolio same store noi increased 4 2 year over year driven by improvements in rent collections on leases currently on cash recognition and the early impact of rental increases tied to cpi we expect the impact of both these trends to accelerate in 2022 as rent collections improve given that 20 of our leases are subject to api based escalators trailing 12 month ebitda coverage was 0 8 times looking forward we expect coverages to inflect positively in the first half of 2022 as year over year improvement in fundamentals followed the positive trends expected in our senior housing operating portfolio next our long term post acute portfolio generated negative 0 8 year over year same store noi growth however similar to our senior housing triple net portfolio we expect noi growth to improve in 2022 through greater rent collections on leases currently in cash recognition as well as cpi based rent escalators trailing 12 month ebitdar coverage was 1 29 times over the course of 2021 we completed 458 million of long term post acute dispositions at a blended cap rate of 8 7 with an additional 108 million under contract for sale at year end as a result our long term post acute portfolio represented just 5 2 of total in place noi at year end versus 10 1 at the end of 2020 a 490 basis point decline driven largely by the exit of our genesis relationship and lastly health systems which is comprised of our promedica senior care joint venture with promedica health system had same store noi growth of positive 2 75 year over year and trailing 12 month ebitdar coverage was 0 39 times the sequential improvement in coverage was driven by the previously announced agreement to sell 25 assets that have been contributing negative ebitdar as of year end we completed the sale of 21 of those assets with the remaining four held for sale turning to capital market activity we continue to enhance our balance sheet strength and position the company to capitalize our robust and highly visible pipeline of capital deployment opportunities by utilizing our atm program to fund those near term transactions since the beginning of the fourth quarter we ve sold 11 3 million shares via forward sale agreements at an initial weighted average price 85 06 per share for expected gross proceeds of 961 million we currently have approximately 11 1 million shares remaining unsettled which are expected to generate future proceeds of 949 million this is in addition to 220 million of expected property disposition and loan payoff proceeds during the quarter we also issued 500 million of 10 year unsecured debt maturing in 2032 with a coupon of 2 75 following similar discipline in our equity funding strategy this is our third unsecured issuance in 2021 bringing full year issuance to 1 75 billion with an average ratio of 9 5 years and a coupon of 2 6 at year end when factoring in cash and restricted cash balances our liquidity position exceeded the 4 billion of borrowing capacity on our line of credit when combined with the previously mentioned 1 2 billion of combined unsettled atm proceeds and expected disposition proceeds we are in a very strong liquidity position heading into 2022 we ended the fourth quarter with 6 95 times net debt to annualized adjusted ebitda down slightly from last quarter leverage is impacted by the timing of 1 5 billion of net investment activity completed later in the quarter if we run rate the impact of net investment activity completed in the quarter pro forma net debt to adjusted ebitda decreased to 6 75 times we continue to be pleased with the momentum of our top line recovery in our senior housing operating portfolio with portfolio spot occupancy ending the quarter at 77 7 70 basis points higher than the end of the prior quarter but still 950 basis points below pre covid levels the portfolio also sits 1 300 basis points below peak occupancy levels setting the stage for a powerful ebitda recovery as occupancy upside and strong rate growth is coupled with significant margin expansion of a very depressed base lastly moving to our first quarter outlook last night we provided an outlook for the first quarter of net income attributable to common stockholders per diluted share of 0 17 to 0 22 per share and normalized ffo per diluted share of 0 79 to 0 84 or 0 815 at the midpoint this guidance takes into consideration approximately 6 million or 0 015 per share of hhs funds expected to be received in the first quarter excluding the hhs funds the 0 80 per share midpoint of our first quarter guidance represents a 0 01 sequential increase from an as adjusted 0 785 per share number for 4q which excludes 18 million of previously recognized hhs and out of period u k and canadian subsidies recognized in the quarter this 0 015 increase is composed of 0 025 from a sequential increase in senior housing operating portfolio noi and fourth quarter investment activity and an offset of 0 01 increase of sequential g a and income taxes underlying this ffo guidance is estimated first quarter total portfolio year over year same store growth of 7 driven by subsegment growth of outpatient medical 1 to 2 growth long term post acute 1 to 2 health systems 2 75 senior housing triple net 5 to 6 and finally senior housing offering growth of approximately 15 driven by revenue growth of 10 underlying this revenue growth is an expectation of approximately 420 basis points of year over year average occupancy increase and with that i will hand the call back over to shankh shankh mitra chief executive officer and chief investment officer thanks tim i wanted to conclude this call by addressing something that we usually don t talk about and that is our comprehensive team we have completed completely overhauled and upgraded our team and this was a multiyear effort building out new areas such as breaktime analytics to create a truly scalable platform with extremely low volunteer turnover we continue to hire the best and the brightest to farther deepen our capital allocation expertise historically the majority of the alpha we created have been through astute raising or deployment of capital over the last 15 months though we have also built out an industry leading and frankly a very significant development team under the leadership of mike fey and ayesha menon the last piece of this puzzle is building out our operational excellence and asset management capabilities this started with the hiring of john in 2021 john is building out a world class team that will accelerate value creation for our shareholders for years to come we have added a net 51 people last year and we re likely to add another 80 new colleagues in 2022 many of you who follow our company closely understand that our asset platform is like a coil spring today we spent heavily during the pandemic but most of these assets are sitting with low occupancy and thus cash flow which is about to be released and surge forward to realize its full value similarly the people side of our business platform is also a coil spring today you are only seeing them in g a line but their full contribution to the revenue line will be seen in 2023 and beyond with that operator please open up the call for questions questions answers operator thank you sir our first question comes from the line of jonathan hughes from raymond james please go ahead jonathan hughes raymond james analyst hey good morning i wanted to ask about the quality of the operator relationships in the pipeline or maybe generally out there in the seniors housing industry i m just wondering what the landscape looks like after a couple of years of pandemic related headwinds i know you have a few in progress and you ve had success with several over the past few years but how many high quality operators remain as an opportunity that you don t already have a relationship with and what s the size of those individual opportunities are they smaller or larger in terms of investment volume than the relationships established over the past few years thanks shankh mitra chief executive officer and chief investment officer fantastic question jonathan as i said right now i can think of two operators that in u s particularly this is a u s specific comment and they ll probably be the same for u k and canada that i can think of two specific operators that we don t have relationship today that i want to have a relationship one of them we already have had shaken our hands this quarter and likely probably we re going to talk about it next quarter s call so what you are likely to see that means is we generally have the operator base the platform that we wanted to build you would recall that before pandemic we talked about with you that we have a map right and in that map we have different ideas of where the different types of acuities of assets should be and what kind of operator should be running those right we kind of generally field out that map now what you re going to see we re going to go deep instead of going broad which you have seen over the last call it 18 to 24 months you re going to see us go very deep and that sort of talks about we have a slide on our presentation you can see that we talked about give or take this 25 to 30 relationships across all asset classes not just senior housing senior housing medical office and wellness housing all three platforms that we are growing pretty significantly that we think creates a very significant opportunity of external and growth that we estimate could be an upwards of 2 5 billion 3 billion a year for a decade to come but that s sort of how we re thinking about it it s going deep instead of going broad but we ll talk about hopefully another exceptional operator relationship next quarter operator thank you i show our next question comes from the line of nick joseph from citi please go ahead nick joseph citi analyst thanks john you talked about the challenges with the staffing agency model as you think about coming out of covid do you expect the business model or expense load to change to rely less on agency staffing or is this more of a perfect storm where it s hard to actually change going forward to limit the use in times of crisis john burkart executive vice president chief operating officer yeah no thank you nick no my expectation is that the business will at least get back to historical standards where agency was a small part of the whole picture just was an assistance piece but frankly with the workflows going on i think it s a very strong chance that agency diminishes even further because what has changed is the world has gone from a situation where there s an abundance of employees to a scarcity of employees and so the employers now the good ones have recognized that fundamentally changed how they look at things recruiting has become a sales machine with kpis for the recruiters etc the value proposition has changed dramatically people are looking at what the employee experience is words that would never said employee experience you don t hear that they re looking at that and they re trying to figure out how to optimize so some changes that are going on are people are realizing like hey we should change our hours slightly for some employees because they have to drop their children off at school they can t work here because of when we start not a big deal for us move it an hour and it works perfectly for them a lot of things like that are changing so i think from my perspective it s great for the hardworking healthcare employees it will be great for the operators and will further diminish the agencies but it will take time for this to tail off as i mentioned in my comments so it won t happen overnight but i think long run run rate will be great operator thank you i show our next question comes from the line of vikram malhotra from mizuho please go ahead vikram malhotra mizuho securities analyst thanks so much for taking the question so just a question on rent growth or revpor and margins and just two parts to it just one in the strong pricing part you re seeing can you talk about the mix between the in place bumps and just the releasing or the spreads you re seeing today and what your expectations are and then on margins in your bridge it s maybe this is not the right way to look at it but in your bridge it seems like you re embedding maybe a 60 to 70 incremental margin it seems like it s reasonable but how are you thinking about the incremental in the context of pricing power john burkart executive vice president chief operating officer yeah so i m going to you managed to get two questions there and that was good on the releasing versus the market clearly net effective markets are up significantly they were concessions and community fees that well concessions that were given community fees that were waived that s all reversed itself and so certainly at one point if you go back in the industry market rents were below in place that s now changing and from an in place perspective and overall the rents are moving up pretty significantly very consistent with the comments that shankh made previously with the expectations of mid 5s to 10 in that zone what we re seeing is a lot of strength in the marketplace and a recognition that cost gap come up and it takes a certain amount of money to provide great care and that s what people want shankh mitra chief executive officer and chief investment officer vikram to answer your second question we are getting it back to the pre covid margin on that slide i think you re referring to slide 17 there is no question that if you have pricing power that will improve but remember you also have higher labor cost so to the extent that you have higher pricing power in excess of higher labor costs you will see upside to that margin but it is getting you back to margin q4 of 19 margin for the portfolio that was there in q4 of 19 operator thank you i show our next question comes from the line of derek johnston from deutsche bank please go ahead derek johnston deutsche bank analyst hi everyone good morning so in 2021 you had 5 7 billion in gross investments so off to a solid start here in 2022 so do you believe 2021 number is the high watermark is that level of acquisitions repeatable or even beatable this year and has anything changed in your terms of your ability to source opportunities or even competition for deals since our last call shankh mitra chief executive officer and chief investment officer has anything changed the answer is yes so if you think about what we have been saying that we are mostly focused on what we have been buying as you can see the average age of those assets would indicate they are the children of supply over cycle of 15 to 19 right what you had is disruption from the revenue side because of all these variants then you had a disruption from the cost side because of our employee situation that we talk about something changed there yes something has in the last call it 45 days and that is what you didn t have is the pressure from financing cost all construction loans are made on libor right pretty much all construction loans a variable libor based loan and obviously if you look at the how the outlook for fed has changed over the last call it 45 to 60 days you can imagine that third pressure is just about to come which is higher financing cost so something has changed and now going back is this a level of acquisition possible or beatable the answer to that question is very simple we re not a volume driven investor we re a value driven investor if the volume is there to create part share value we will do it if not we will not do it that s just a simple how to allocate capital the success of a team is not measured at least our team in our opinion is not the growth of the enterprise but par share value creation for existing shareholders so as long as that opportunity is there we ll absolutely do it operator thank you i show our next question comes from the line of steve sakwa from evercore isi please go ahead steve sakwa evercore isi analyst yeah thanks i guess i just wanted to circle back a little bit on the guidance just to make sure tim i understood in the 10 i think revenue growth that you talked about for sho again what was occupancy and what was rent and then what is included in the expense side from the elevated levels that you saw in q4 are you sort of assuming the same level in q1 as q4 or did you assume some moderation thank you shankh mitra chief executive officer and chief investment officer yeah thanks steve so on the revenue side we re assuming 420 basis points of occupancy increase on a year over year basis driving that 10 revenue growth so the remainder of that revenue growth is being driven by rate and on the expense side i think the best way to look at it is sequentially we re talking a lot about agency labor we are assuming a sequential reduction in agency labor about 10 from the fourth quarter to the first quarter in that pool and that s supported by early trends we ve seen in the quarter operator thank you i show our next question comes from the line of rich hill from morgan stanley please go ahead rich hill morgan stanley analyst hey good morning guys i recognize you re not giving a full year guide but i think back to 3q 21 there were some bread crumbs given on where renewals and maybe street rates are trending based upon my notes one of your competitors have talked about 8 renewals and i think you had talked about 1 5 to two times faster as the renewals for street rate wondering if you could just provide any updates on that as we think through what full year 2022 might look like shankh mitra chief executive officer and chief investment officer john just talked about that the street rate comments i made is a net effective rent and you are seeing because obviously the concessions that were given the lack of community fees that you had the effective net street rate is moving up because of that not necessarily the pace is moving but the net effective rent is moving we continue to see in fact we have seen some a couple of our operators have now moved street rate above in place rent a couple of our very large operators have gotten much closer so it s a pretty encouraging sort of it as we look in the future tim just walked you through what our 10 guidance means from a rate and occupancy perspective and that sort of gives you the second answer to that question right so we are a shop we re focused on ultimately optimization of revenue not necessarily one component of the revenue and on top of that you have to think about one component of the revenue comes with higher cost which is labor right if you just occupancy which obviously rate doesn t so we re trying to optimize all of those things together and that sort of blends to what we talked about which is a 10 ish percent revenue growth in q1 15 noi growth in q1 and that noi growth should continue to accelerate as we get to the year for two reasons right one is as you build occupancy you will get obviously your marginal margin will expand obviously right so that s one point second you will get a continuation of sort of burn off of the agency labor that you got so that s sort of two of these things together you will get an acceleration of noi growth as we get to the second half of the year operator thank you i show our next question comes from the line of juan sanabria from bmo capital markets please go ahead juan sanabria bmo capital markets analyst hi good morning thanks for the time recognizing again you re not giving full year guidance to one of the larger operators in the space talked about 500 to 600 basis points of occupancy growth for the year as their target so curious how you feel excluding any new covid wave how that feels to you particularly given seasonality is still apparent in the business and typically you don t necessarily gain occupancy outside of the third quarter so just curious about your general commentary and targets for occupancy growth for the year shankh mitra chief executive officer and chief investment officer yeah so first you said the magic word excluding any more new variants right so that s a very important word you mentioned there and despite that i m not going to venture a guess of what it will look like i will tell you there are a couple of things to think about last year you got a massive disruption in q1 you ve got a significant occupancy loss you started at a big hole and you had to climb up that hole to get to a point where on an average basis you can build out documents so you don t have that problem this year right john talked about january our occupancy from point to point is down 20 basis points which is probably will make this january the best january we ever had seasonality perspective so you don t have a hole to climb out second you have better demographics this year you can see the demographics is building so we have more demand there and that s sort of playing out for all the leads and other data that john disclosed on his script third you have a significantly lower number of deliveries this year right so and then if you under your assumption if we don t get hit by four waves like we did last year and hopefully that will translate into better occupancy growth i m not going to comment on any specific operator or try to sort of venture a guess of what entire year is going to look like however the table is set if all of these things we just discussed play out we ll see a better year but we re long term investors we re not focused on how occupancy plays out this quarter versus that quarter but we re pretty optimistic because of what the underlying trends we see in the marketplace operator thank you i show our next question comes from the line of mike mueller from j p morgan please go ahead mike mueller j p morgan analyst yeah hi just curious on the watermark transaction what was the pricing difference between i guess the entry fee assets versus the rental just in terms of like a rough cap rate difference shankh mitra chief executive officer and chief investment officer mike we re not going to get into a specific deal let alone things within the specific deals right obviously as you know how these things play out is that you sign a confidentiality agreement with the seller we re not going to get into it we have talked about i believe in the last call that what we like about that transaction is a the price per unit was very attractive to us b some of the underlying land ultimately as you were thinking about real estate investment you have to think about the dart exceptional dart and three we think there is value to be created because of what these assets are and the lands that come with it and what you can do with this only with all of those three combined we re very excited about the portfolio we got but we re not going to get into economics of a specific deal let alone different parts of that deal that just will put us in a significant violation of a confidential agreement that we have signed operator thank you i show our next question comes from the line of connor siversky from berenberg please go ahead connor siversky berenberg bank analyst good morning out there thanks for having me on the call i just want to keep this simple focusing on senior housing in particular in consideration of the value based investment approach so in this positive environment for pricing i mean do you expect to see some cap rate compression this year on increased competition and then just how does this change the opportunity set for you does that mean more granular transactions or perhaps a restriction in activity on your end or expectations on your end shankh mitra chief executive officer and chief investment officer yeah connor i answered this question earlier i m just going to repeat what i said what changed is there s a hard stress that s coming and that s because majority of construction loans are done on a floating rate basis if not all of them are done on a floating rate basis and you have a very significant sort of a potential increase of libor that s coming to the pipe that will put even more stress in the system and the second point is we re not cap rate buyers it is hard to cap rate is a stabilized concept senior housing is anywhere but stabilized at this point i do not expect cap rates even if you re talking about in the context of stabilized cap rate i do not believe there is going to be a significant compression in fact i think a lot of institutional investors are looking at all asset classes including many we own and that we talked about historically that underlying growth rate versus inflation at sudden capex makes no sense right i ve talked about for example for quarters after quarters that given sort of the outlook of what the forward curve was telling you inflation breakeven and others it made no sense to me for what people who are paying for mobs with 2 growth rate finally it seems like there is a obviously a understanding on the institutional investor side people are waking up to say what did i buy for this and how do i make return so i think there has to be a reconciliation of when you look at your irr you have to think about what is the real growth versus the nominal growth and that s going to show up that s going to show up at your exit and we re long term irr buyers we think through these things and that s why we refuse to chase the market you have seen that for years and years we have done and there was not going to be any difference in that discipline going forward operator thank you i show our next question comes from the line of rich anderson from smbc please go ahead rich anderson smbc nikko securities analyst thanks good morning so shankh you have said in the past that you are not likely to be an elephant hunter that you get noise in the system when you go too big and i can appreciate that but that is a different mentality versus your predecessor so if you re not willing to be a buyer as an elephant hunter is there anything that you could see from the sales perspective that could be i mean if you re a 26 million average deal price on the buy side what do you think your average deal price would be on the sell side given that mentality forward shankh mitra chief executive officer and chief investment officer yeah very good question it s an extremely astute observation look at 2020 and look at how many billions we sold and if you looked at the disposition you will see sales were done on a multiple of the buys right i don t know exactly what the number is but it is likely to be multiple of that 24 million 26 million that we mentioned we want to buy retail and sell buy wholesale and sell retail that s what we do right fundamentally no matter what investment class you are it s something very simple how you make money is buy low sell high right that ultimately is how you allocate capital to make money so portfolio when there s a lot of hunger in the market to buy a certain asset class portfolio premiums are real so you go sell portfolios but you buy smaller assets i think we mentioned that 5 7 billion we bought in a median size of the transaction not median sized of the building median size of the transaction was 26 million that s how we create real value operator thank you i show our next question comes from the line of john pawlowski from green street please go ahead john pawlowski green street advisors analyst hey thanks for the time john as you picked through the sho portfolio either by property type al il memory care or geography are there any signs within the portfolio of structurally higher vacancy rates where maybe move in percentage or just not improving in recent months or occupancy is actually sliding here shankh mitra chief executive officer and chief investment officer no each area is improving across the board the starting point that we re at right now is of course pretty low so the bar is low to build from as we get to an optimal level which would be substantially higher your question is a good question and there may be some things that become more apparent but at this point in time everything is working across the board operator thank you i show our next question comes from the line of michael carroll from rbc capital markets please go ahead michael carroll rbc capital markets analyst yeah thanks i wanted to transition to the triple net portfolio for a second tim can you quantify how many triple net tenants are on a cash basis today and what s the difference between the current cash that s being paid and recognized compared contractual rents on those leases tim mchugh executive vice president chief financial officer so in the first quarter or sorry the fourth quarter it s about 15 to 20 it s kind of stayed within that range for most of the last few quarters so that s the quantum of kind of how much of that in place rent is being recognized on a cash basis and i don t have the gap to contractual right now shankh mitra chief executive officer and chief investment officer but mike remember all of our triple net senior housing portfolio is in u s and u k right and you can see how much that cash flow is sort of inflected or expected to be inflected this year because they re obviously on cash the underlying noi is what we eat and that underlying noi is going up significantly which is translating into that same store triple end growth expectation that tim just gave you in other words we took the hit by putting it obviously on cash recognition tim talked about that on many calls now we re on the other side of that operator thank you i show our next question comes from the line of steven valiquette from barclays please go ahead steven valiquette barclays analyst great thanks good morning so with all your commentary on the labor expense that was definitely helpful i guess i m curious for the 30 million of the agency labor expense absorbed in the fourth quarter is there any further color on whether that was fairly evenly spread geographically across the shop portfolio or did you find it as geographically concentrated maybe in a few markets and also since well has more of an urban footprint in shop overall just any generalization from your view whether labor shortage issues are more or less prevalent in rule versus urban markets just in general thanks shankh mitra chief executive officer and chief investment officer sure that s a great question and we ve done an awful lot of studies on that particular issue leveraging our data analytics team the interesting thing that we found is it gets back to my comment on stress identifies opportunities and issues and when looking at it closely clearly some markets can have a level of stress specific to that market but then when you dig deeper in you find out that tremendous amount of assets have zero labor and selected assets have a lot of agency selective assets have a lot of agency the cause of that is a combination of in some cases omicron came in and had a material impact on a great amount of staff which is no surprise in other cases my belief frankly is leadership and that s partly what gives me great optimism in moving forward and solving this because the leadership issues are solvable and the leadership issues this is one indication but they also tie to other issues occupancy etc so this frankly helps us identify some situations that will as we make adjustments we ll improve things going forward dramatically so hopefully that s helpful thank you operator thank you i show our next question comes from the line of jordan sadler from keybanc capital markets please go ahead jordan sadler keybanc capital markets analyst thank you guys good morning i wanted to this is sort of a little bit of a two parter one i wanted to clarify the contract labor assumption embedded in 1q i think you said down 10 so 30 million of expense becomes 27 million is that the way to think about it and then separately just kind of thinking about the cadence of your guidance for the sho portfolio in particular right last time you gave sequential guidance for 4q right we ended up with a surprise variant late in the quarter that ended up providing pretty significant headwinds especially on the labor front and pressured numbers lower relative to what original expectations were i m curious how much that experience in the fourth quarter impacted sort of your decision surrounding guidance for the first quarter in other words this appears kind of conservative relative to the moderation in expenses and what seems to be a flat occupancy assumption for the first quarter overall despite the fact that you only lost 20 basis points in january so i know that s i ve asked a lot there but i m basically asking about the cadence on giving guidance shankh mitra chief executive officer and chief investment officer yeah so john why don t i start and tim will finish first is understand q1 is seasonally a weak period from an occupancy standpoint so as john talked about we re down in january about 20 basis points and we re kind of thinking obviously the sales activity picked up pretty significantly toward ebitda and we re thinking as sales picked up you get some lag right call it 20 to 30 days lag from sales to occupancy so that kind of puts you at sort of toward the end of the quarter so you don t have a lot of time to pick up that occupancy right so that sort of i wouldn t call that a conservative right i would call that what we think was going to happen the up 10 down 10 who cares but just sort of generally speaking i want you to understand what we re thinking about you are right i mean that will on average quarter average q1 occupancy goes down about 70 80 basis points so you get sequentially flat which will probably put on average or flat and significant year over year growth that s a pretty good outcome because you have to think about what that means for the rest of the year right it s not about just q1 days the second point is look i mean i am pretty disappointed about the bottom line results in q4 there s no two ways about it we did not expect that omicron will hit us like the way it did and frankly speaking there s 45 more days to go in the quarter and as we have seen it s highly infectious where it comes and how that can impact you quarter to quarter john who knows right i mean we re focused on what s the real run rate earnings power of the platform and what we see is pretty exciting at least what we see today but it s hard to get into specifics or when things happen you have an operating business right which is driving the marginal differences try to get very very sort of prescriptive about how exactly things are going to play out it s hard to comment tim mchugh executive vice president chief financial officer i would just add to the labor piece of that agency piece jordan so your math is correct on the expectation kind of the step down and i don t think what happened in the fourth quarter necessarily changes certainly very carefully is anywhere like conservative in the way that we re forecasting but the variance in what we ve seen happen over the wave is that the labor disruption has been much greater than the man disruption particularly over the last two waves and omicron was a significant labor disruption so certainly changes what you forecast from the inputs and confidence levels around it so i m not saying it s conservative it s more of a there s a lot of uncertainty in the short term it s the labor piece and how it s impacting the labor market it being the different variants is probably the biggest reason why i have to make a longer term forecast right now so i think as i said earlier i think the early trends we re seeing in january are very supportive of our view on the step down in agency and we thought that was going to be a little bit more back half of the quarter weighted but i think in general it still stands a pretty good assumption operator thank you i show our next question comes from the line of nick yulico from scotiabank please go ahead nick yulico scotiabank analyst thanks i just want to follow up here on this agency question so it sounds like it s going to be about 27 million for those costs in the first quarter if you go back to the third quarter i think it was 20 million so still up versus then and just trying to hear a little bit more about your assumption for why at some point that expense which is about 3 of your expenses goes away and why you re confident that it s a covid issue and not a tight labor market issue that s driving the use of that agency cost shankh mitra chief executive officer and chief investment officer well it s both no doubt about it it s both and when you look at the fourth quarter some more color on that is you ve got some healthcare workers all of the healthcare workers who have worked unbelievably they tirelessly worked and did not take pto for a long long period of time so you had increased ptos that occurred around the holiday season and then you add in omicron and you get the result of agency at 6x so agency is usually two to three times the rate and it got as high as 6x it s surge pricing kind of like uber so as that backs away that will lower the expense regardless of the hours but again going back to my comments the reality is each of the operators have workflows in play to increase hiring and they re all working so it was just a unique situation the combination of the pto and omicron that came so i am confident that it won t be a long term item in the industry but exactly how it abates is it will be over time operator thank you i show our next question comes from the line of tayo okusanya from credit suisse please go ahead tayo okusanya credit suisse analyst yes hi everyone i wanted to talk a little bit more about the reuben brothers transaction i m intrigued by it that s kind of given again the high quality assets that they tend to own over here in the u k curious how big that jv could become over time all the idea is you re going to be building stuff like the sunrise assets at 56th second right in central london is that the idea there shankh mitra chief executive officer and chief investment officer the idea is to expand the jv to reflect the fact that u k society is aging just like u s society is aging and there is a lack of high quality product if you think about reuben owns lot of extraordinary prime lands and billings obviously around the united kingdom and we re looking at a lot of opportunities to grow the platform and that could include trophy assets just like you mentioned that sunrise at east 56th street which by the way opened this quarter and is doing pretty well if you are in new york you want to visit the asset let us know finally through all the noise of the covid and we re seeing some very early demand story there which is playing out pretty well but it can be but doesn t have to be just trophy assets tayo okusanya credit suisse analyst gotcha thank you operator thank you i show our last question comes from the line of daniel bernstein from capital one please go ahead daniel bernstein capital one securities analyst good morning so i have to ask a question here last second so you talked about ramping up their development team and when i was looking at your slide in your supplemental it pretty noticeable that you only have three mob properties under development almost everything else is seniors housing so i was hoping you might be able to talk about on the mob side whether the lack of development there is more lack of opportunity versus the lack of value certainly on the acquisition side you talked about an inflationary environment you don t want to buy four or five cap assets with 2 growth but on the development side is there a different story there shankh mitra chief executive officer and chief investment officer yeah so a couple of things first is our mob pipeline is actually pretty meaningful i don t know then what s in the south versus what s been reported not reported i can tell you that the mob pipeline is very very significant it s 1 million plus square feet that s fully leased so it s probably not been reported yet what you see is reported as a senior housing is because we don t separate out what senior housing from our wellness housing business it s all reported as one bucket but a very substantial portion of our development activity is on the wellness side of the house rather than on the senior side of the house on the senior side of the house they re very targeted but they re very large buildings right so think about i ll give you an example i mean is 56 street which is delivered that s a 300 million asset you think about 1 001 van ness that s roughly a 300 million asset hudson yards is a 400 plus million asset brooklyne is 150 million assets right we talked about kisco it s 170 million asset too so you have very few assets there that is substantial that does make a difference to the number but from a number of properties perspective they re actually not that high and the reason being frankly speaking other than very special situations right think about where 1 001 van ness it s going to be the most trophy building in san francisco pier full stop i think about brooklyne now the fact that we got something entitled in brooklyne in middle of fisher hill i mean right next to the brooklyne country club that should have taken probably 15 years to do right so just so it s a special opportunity and that s why we re executing but other than that senior housing development today in my opinion doesn t make a lot of sense and the reason it doesn t make a lot of sense is you don t know where the ultimate labor cost adjusted rent will land you just don t know that and there is no reason to go and guess that and just obviously if you re doing for your own capital if you re a for fee developer or a fee only operator which is mostly the people who are i m seeing starting that help in these days because they have no money on the line right if it works out it s great i have a promote if it doesn t somebody else lost money so i just don t see how that works particularly in the context of very high cost and higher financing costs right so it just goes back to my point that i made earlier on libor based and floating rate base construction loan industry so we are thinking about giving you additional disclosure sometime this year about what s the wellness side of the house versus the senior side of the house and we ll get to that but majority of our new activity is on the wellness side of the house where we re a lot more confident on where the margin lands and frankly speaking their cap rates are much much much tighter to create value on the acquisition side so our focus on the development and you re going to see as i said the pipeline is very strong on the development side and that s just coming through i said i ll finish it by saying what you have said on that question a very important one i still no one has explained me how someone makes money in a significant inflationary environment on a real basis not on a nominal basis with an asset class that grows 2 with a 40 cap rate when your inflation is much higher so somebody s yet to explain me that and unless i believe that will not be active on the acquisition side you saw we bought a small mob portfolio which was a high quality portfolio in arbor we bought we bought it at a 5 5 cap which i have said for multiple years it sort of gives you the right level of irr operator duration 70 minutes call

best practices frazier s carpet one floor home dec 2021 home news best practices frazier s carpet one floor home dec 2021 by jessica chevalier while running a successful business requires a big picture perspective kevin frazier president of frazier s carpet one never forgets that the big picture is made up of the small details consider his approach to invoicing every single invoice is double checked and in fact at this year s carpet one convention he will speak on his process which saves his business almost 200 000 annually in mistakes or oversights while it may seem boring or tedious to many this one small practice integrated into daily procedures can set the business on the course for greater success affording salaries for additional associates for instance or helping to fund a showroom renovation my mom said early on and it s now a kevin ism the money is where the money is not in floorcovering kevin notes we pay attention to things that other retailers think of as too minute similarly rather than scrambling every time it has a job opening frazier s continuously hires retail sales associates rsas and installers on the rsa side frazier s has an on going policy of offering a 1 000 finder s fee to any associate who recruits a new individual that achieves a tenure of six months this may be an associate s friend or relative or simply someone serving them in a restaurant who they believe might be a good fit for the organization in addition the company has an ongoing posting on indeed which doesn t produce many good candidates but does keep the search active activity creates activity says kevin sometimes you don t know what exactly you need to do so you just start swinging the catchphrase of the company s hiring philosophy is recruit train deploy on the installer side frazier s runs a recruitment ad on the local classic rock station an idea kevin borrowed from a carpet one member in ohio in addition kevin notes that his team is always keeping an eye on the journeymen hired by cash and carry customers to install their flooring ones that stand out as skilled competent and professional are getting a call says kevin since the 1970s frazier s has been running an installer apprentice program to grow its own installation force an initiative started by kevin s dad ken while we have tooled it up more over last decade that s a part of us understanding from our past experience that we might run out of installers sometime in the future says kevin in this way frazier s is constantly preparing for needs to come we are well organized and understand why we do everything we do says kevin we have command of our vison and execution of our business model in the same vein some of the lingo that we use is with one eye on our heritage and one eye on the horizon it s about experience and vision playing to both how long we have been doing this and always looking to improve and from a floorcovering standpoint we stock big and manage that well from the ground up in 1945 c m frazier and his son charlie returned from world war ii resettling in their hometown of knoxville tennessee charlie struggled to find work and out of desperation borrowed 800 from a loan shark to purchase hardwood floor sanding equipment and went to work charlie paid off his loan and shortly thereafter c m left his mill job to join his son soon the pair was managing a small fleet of sanding crews in 1956 at the age of nine charlie s son ken joined his father and grandfather in the business working after school on weekends and during summer breaks c m passed away in 1960 and six years later ken dropped out of the university of tennessee at his father s encouragement to travel to st louis to learn the process for pouring sand cora decorative industrial flooring however before the father and son could diversify their offering using the methods ken had learned ken was drafted into the army to serve a tour of duty in vietnam in 1967 while ken was still in vietnam his wife gave birth to kevin when ken returned home his father was eager to expand the family business in 1966 the federal housing authority approved carpet for use in new homes and a year later charlie and ken made the decision encouraged by a builder they worked with to expand into the carpet business in 1968 frazier s opened its first retail store twice a week ken would make early morning carpet runs to dalton with kevin curled up beside in on the front seat of the truck and in 1971 frazier s broke ground on the building that it still inhabits today a few years later charlie and ken decided to position the business as an everything for the floor store with a full offering of products the decision to build frazier s where they did was fortuitous it s really close to an interstate exit which wasn t even there at the time and we are dead center in the middle of the metro area says kevin so we re easy to access from all four corners of the city the company continues to stock a full range of flooring products including both stocked and bound to order area rugs in addition its offering extends beyond retail we are a four legged stool says kevin though one leg is distinctly bigger than the others and that is residential retail replacement our mainstreet commercial and new builder businesses are the next two the final leg is the proprietary relationships we have with insurance companies the insurance business developed under my leadership but while the pipeline didn t exist before dad saw it coming interestingly ken has long believed that the key to a successful succession involves one generation stepping fully out when the next generation steps in dad had a great vision years ago that generations work best together if they work in a more linear fashion like a relay team not rugby team kevin explains there were maybe eight years of overlap where my father and grandfather were both mr frazier with my dad and i it was six years so there is not time for a lot of competing or jostling you work together for a short time so it heightens the appreciation i intend to do it the same way ken fully retired in 2009 and comes in only a few times a year now heritage while c m and charlie worked hard to build frazier s they weren t around to see their business achieve the level of greatness that it has today c m was never able to move out of the poor part of town as kevin puts it he died at the age of 51 and had a hard life charlie lived in poverty until his children were adults when he was able to move to a more middle class neighborhood they didn t have the luxury of asking what do i want to do with my life says kevin but i was given that luxury kevin an attorney by training is always mindful that the sacrifices his forebears made have afforded him the quality of life he has today in the late 1990s ken asked kevin to take over the business which like his father he grew up in and knew well ken always prioritized being an entrepreneur over a businessman my dad did a great job of morphing into an entrepreneur and he encouraged me to go to law school for that reason to make me a better entrepreneur kevin s focus in his law practice was tax and contracts law ultimately kevin was persuaded to leave law for multiple reasons the financial aspects played into it substantially but what pushed me over the edge was that this business has afforded more than 1 000 teammates a decent living over 70 years and from 1974 on a good living explains kevin the national competitors around us pay blue collar wages my dad was thinking about shutting the business down and i felt it was important for us to continue to give back to our community in a larger fashion through affording people white collar livings for things that the national competitors don t this business is helping other people send their kids to college and grad school that s the difference the devil is in the details kevin s mom wasn t always active in the business but she had an exceptional mind for numbers and she passed her insights along to her son the most boring aspect of what we do is probably most important says kevin we really focus on our financials everything from zealous inventory and cost control to how we handle ownership of our real estate it is the bedrock of keeping a command of our business along with that the company is highly focused on being able to prepare its hires for success through its recruit train deploy strategy my strength is taking things that work well and breaking them down into easily communicable widgets so that different departments have well written standard operating procedures that are easy to train new folks on paul johnson taught me that and one of the necessary components is that training must be easy and standardized with clear objectives written out well in bite sized pieces says kevin managing growth kevin is focused on maintaining the standards that prior generations have set even as the operation expands our greatest challenge is to figure out how to grow without sacrificing quality he says that s not altruistic it s a sanity statement my dad s vision was one massive building our building is now three times bigger than it was in 1971 how do you manage an empire without dropping things through the cracks ultimately kevin s greatest desire for the business is that it still be going strong in 70 more years in whatever form it takes the model we have in place is not a model for how to do well for the next ten years but to succeed across multiple generations i have great enthusiasm for the fact that the frazier family has empowered more families to experience the american dream in a robust and dynamic way the company has both a succession plan in place and a timeline for implementing it but isn t yet ready to reveal the details big on marketing kevin says we spend 4 of our gross on advertising that is our goal and we do it marketing is one of our top three secret sauces the business uses both traditional media and digital the traditional forms that it utilizes radio tv outdoor and direct mail are employed substantially and multiple times a year with radio and tv ads running continuously kevin voices all the radio spots as well as live remotes for tv ads frazier s has two spokeswomen who represent the businesses demographic we are serious about advertising and about having a consistent message with a high frequency the entrepreneur reports we do funny stuff too digital affords us the ability to put stuff together cheaply and use it in a timely manner kevin believes that its consistency in advertising helps it stand out from the competition we do a great job communicating our story and our quality to the community constantly with consistent messaging and high frequency we have a jingle it has been the same since i was in ninth grade we re record it from time to time but it remains the same and people know it copyright 2021 floor focus

executive outlook 2022 with demand holding strong industry executives are generally optimistic dec 2021 home news executive outlook 2022 with demand holding strong industry executives are generally optimistic dec 2021 by jennifer bardoner the world may look a lot different than it did last year but much of the uncertainty that characterized 2020 remains augmented by additional concerns after business ramped back up at breakneck speeds following last year s shutdowns for flooring industry executives it s been a double edged sword of supply versus demand as they ve struggled to navigate material shortages exorbitant costs an upended labor market limited logistics capacity and delivery delays what looked like a temporary situation is stretching into the coming year but everyone is still looking for hope on the horizon we asked industry executives about their outlook for 2022 tim baucom shaw industries president and ceo q what do you foresee in the residential and commercial markets in 2022 baucom residential will start to level out in units but it will increase in dollars both because of all these inflationary pressures but also because the consumer is making better choices and upgrading either in wall to wall or near wall to wall rugs carpet has really had a resurgence and it s better carpet it s not carpet as a compromise it s carpet as a choice lvt is still red hot even though it has gone through hyper inflation between the tariffs and the cost of transportation lvt is as much as 50 higher in cost and it s still just as hot which tells you that the consumer is maybe not as price sensitive as the very competitive channel is i think we ll see double digit growth in dollars with low single digit growth in units our commercial market is seeing a lot of pent up demand our backlog is dramatically higher than it was in 2019 businesses are very intentional about how to use space and any time they talk about reconfiguring space it s good for us in the short and intermediate term we re back to 2019 in dollars already i see growth ahead q what do you see happening with carpet in 2022 baucom i see it both continuing to grow and to shift we re seeing face weights going up better yarn constructions we re making a 400 million investment in state of the art fiber and yarn manufacturing that we announced in october carpet brings a very compelling value both in terms of the material and the installation efficiency but a lot of what is driving the excitement in carpet comes from products that are still a great value but a little bit more expensive than just the basic near room size area rugs continue to be in demand they re also a unique way to get around installation issues q what about hard surface baucom our hard surface business has been growing fast lvt is leading and everything else is adjusting to that we re continuing to add capacity to our state of the art lvt plant as we can get machinery in and installed within the same facility rp1 makes state of the art flexible products rp2 makes rigid products we continue to de choke and de bottleneck to get more capacity out of rp1 and we continue to add incremental capacity to rp2 q how have you managed production in spite of the labor crisis do you see any easing of employee shortages baucom to make sure we have a ready workforce that s healthy and can show up in the midst of our very aggressive management of the disease we re running at more than a 100 census our goal is always in the markets we re in to be the employer of choice what we are seeing is that today s workforce is looking for things that are beyond standard table stakes treatment with dignity and respect paying very competitive wages great benefits stability of work opportunity for promotion flexibility is more important than ever for job seekers we re continuing to work on how to enhance that in the environment that we re in obviously a continuous manufacturing operation doesn t have the same level of flexibility as other industries our biggest crisis is not as much in manufacturing as it is in trucking you can t just pick up a trucker they have to have a cdl license and today in most states you can t even apply for a cdl license until you re over 21 paul de cock mohawk industries flooring north america president q what s your overall outlook going into 2022 de cock i think it will be a good year there are a lot of home transactions and when people buy homes they want to do upgrades and there s a lot of pent up demand in the multifamily sector because of eviction moratoriums from a commercial point of view a lot of projects were postponed in hospitality and workplace those will come back in 22 23 and as we recover to pre covid levels probably in 23 24 on the residential side of the business i would say mid single digits and for the commercial market high single digits i m optimistic but i am also aware of mitigating effects if a homebuyer spends all their money on purchasing a house how much is left for remodeling there is a lot of inflation in the market and at some point the fed is going to have to react q what do you foresee in terms of soft surface versus hard surface de cock we expect stable conditions for carpet today s consumers driven by high fashion and high impact use carpet to make a statement in their homes and so we do think that fits with the demand we believe in the continued growth and marketshare for lvt and laminate albeit at a slower pace than what we ve seen in the last few years on the lvt side the wood category will be a little bit under pressure because of the excellent visuals and alternatives that lvt and laminate provide the exception will be what i call performance wood which combines the realism of wood with the performance of laminate and lvt we see strong demand in lvt and laminate so we re putting capacity in both we re expanding our manufacturing capacity in north america we re building a new facility for lvt but we re not talking about that yet q can we expect any new products de cock we ve been able to make 100 fully recyclable carpet backing that we have branded recover and we re bringing it to market in 2022 we ll also launch our new signature finishing technology the most realistic wood visual we ve ever done q what s your outlook on the labor market de cock when the economy is good the labor market is tight and then we have the covid impact on the labor market we do see it improving as we move through 2022 but we also have to be realistic it will stay tight q do you see supply chain relief in the coming year de cock things are improving as we speak and should improve as we move through 2022 the question is when is normal normal and then the question is to what level will things improve and will the issues be completely gone by the end of 2022 i don t know that it s difficult to say what the new normal will be and so for us as business leaders agility is key right now we need to adapt our organizations to these changing market conditions and we need to be nimble and able to move quickly it requires a balance between driving efficiency and staying agile q do you think domestic production is the answer to supply chain issues de cock with the impacts of covid and the international supply chain people are looking at domestic investment we are looking at domestic investment that being said business is strong and we re also looking at importing where it is appropriate russell grizzle mannington mills ceo q what will business look like in 2022 grizzle we will see improvements in the commercial market and still a strong residential market commercial seems to be picking up some from where we were post pandemic hopefully we re going to have some pent up demand or a backlog that will carry over from this year so i would say mid single digits overall on a dollar basis it s going to be a good year on a units basis i m not sure when it gets back to 2019 we re probably not there by the end of the year but we ll be getting closer q which categories do you expect to see growth in 2022 grizzle lvt if the supply chain issues get resolved is still a big growth category it s been hampered a little bit because of the supply chain maybe a little more than others laminate in particular has benefited from some of those supply chain issues and has seen a little bit of a rebound q what is your strategy related to supply chain issues grizzle we re trying to manufacture as much as we possibly can on our own we want to onshore as much manufacturing as we possibly can obviously that s got some raw material challenges we re still in the final scale up phase of our rigid core manufacturing we re constrained by raw materials but we re ready to go other than that we don t have quite enough capacity to manufacture everything in our portfolio so we still have to source a significant amount it will take a couple more years before that changes q do you think others will move toward domestic production grizzle it s been a coming trend the tariffs and then the supply chain it all adds up to more people wanting to onshore that s going to be an overall market trend but it s going to be a while before we get close to enough being manufactured onshore because the volume in lvt is so large now q do you foresee supply chain relief in 2022 grizzle it s probably going to be a little bit better going into 2022 than it s been but it s still unprecedented in terms of the cost and availability we ve just come off the peak a little bit from the absolute worst but it will probably take at least another year it s not just lvt coming out of asia it s virtually every single raw material that we source michel vermette armstrong flooring president and ceo q what is the biggest challenge facing the industry in 2022 vermette the speed of inflation is probably top of mind for me it is challenging a lot of the accepted norms there were certain price points that had been established for many years that people were used to working off of whether in construction retail or manufacturing hopefully it will stabilize but inflation is not done in 2022 raw materials of every type are hard to get from pvc resins to wearlayers to print films it s going to take some time to really stabilize none of us are back to full capacity because none of us can get the full set of supplies that we want q do you see an increased appetite for domestic production or products vermette we re seeing requests from customers every week right now we want u s made everybody is requesting domestic product because none of us have the inventory to supply the demand we ll rebuild capacity and rebuild the stocks and then we ll figure out the next step capacity wise where do we need to be to meet demand and where will demand really be at that time for anybody who is going to build a plant it s probably 50 more expensive than it was two years ago and there are some new plants right now that have not been able to produce anywhere near capacity since they started up and some started a year ago q do you see any relief in terms of the labor shortage vermette we re seeing mild improvement but demand is super strong and there are more job openings than people looking people are reassessing what s truly important to them what they want to do where they want to live what hours they want to work there s a lot of knowledge leaving organizations and a lot of talent that has to be retrained we will be dealing with a talent shortage through 2022 we have embraced fully remote work so we can recruit nationally we empower all our associates to manage their time as they wish to get their job done and manage their personal lives we come together when we need to it s been great to attract different talent q what do you think the key to success will be in 2022 vermette you can t over course correct and that s the challenge right i ve been at this for 30 years yes you ve got to take decisive action you ve got to move but you re better off being measured in your approach and keeping your eye on the long term like anything else this will settle james lesslie engineered floors commercial division president q are you optimistic heading into 2022 lesslie i don t think there s anything that says flooring sales are going to be bad but i don t see anything to say that it s going to be a huge growth year i would put it in the single digits you ve got to almost compare yourself to 2019 and 2019 was single digits but there are a lot of things that could line up to make next year a challenging year for many in flooring inflation is a reality of life labor inflation raw material inflation and i see nothing that s going to change that unless we get a different direction in how the country is going to address our natural resources q do you think the supply chain will improve next year lesslie ocean freight is going to stay a very tough market until at the earliest the third quarter but labor next year is probably going to be a bigger challenge than the supply chain and raw materials labor is the new paradigm we re on the back end of the baby boomers the last of them will be hitting retirement age in the next two to three years that s the largest population surge the country has seen in the last 100 years and females not coming back to the workforce is going to keep constraining the labor supply q have you been impacted by the labor shortage lesslie thanks to some good decisions our service held up during the pandemic better than any the connectivity and focus on the mission of the company is going to be something companies have got to figure out and make employees feel part of the company and not an island the companies that are going to win next year will win on service q are you adding any capacity lesslie in the last ten years we ve invested over 1 billion in capacity and we re going to continue those investments we re putting in new capacity again next year our capacity is pretty flexible we re invested in soft surface and hard surface q is the supply chain having any impact on what people are buying lesslie people want more reliability from u s products laminate is probably going to grow at a higher pace than lvt this year there s a lot of european laminate coming in too that doesn t have the same supply chain issues laminate is going to grow because it s a different category from lvt yet it gives a similar look at a little better price point we re talking relative growth rates here lvt is not going to slow down lvt has got some interesting long term technology so i m very bullish on the category it s a new technology and new technology continues to evolve just like there s more to come in carpet everybody who says carpet is going away or shrinking is wrong harlan stone hmtx industries ceo q how is the supply chain impacting profits stone the stabilizing of the supply chain will not only satisfy demand but it will also improve profitability the supply chain disruption is costing this industry and increasing the disruption in raw materials if that all goes away we could see improvements in delivery costs of more than 10 q is domestic production the answer to supply chain issues stone i m not going to make a geographic recommendation or prediction or reveal everybody needs to invest wherever it makes sense for them everybody underinvested when the pandemic started kind of this end of the world thought pattern and now we realize the world is pretty good demand for flooring in the u s is incredible q where are you investing stone we believe that design is an area where investment will have the greatest impact if people find that the floors in their home make them happy and reflect their personality and emotions they will be more willing to spend fashion forward fast is an opportunity in the flooring business with the digital transformation going on in this world we can be much more responsive i think the speed at which we are able to come to market is too slow and i want to speed that up by several quantum leaps that s what we plan to do with our new hmtx headquarters q how is the price of pvc impacting your strategies stone right now it s a short term problem based on the unavailability of adequate supply i believe it can and will be addressed in the coming quarters i won t say months but that opens up the opportunity for new materials and we re certainly looking very hard at those i see more sustainable materials coming on the market the durability strength and recyclability is a great positive but ultimately it has been a great value if the cost goes up it s not as attractive q do you see any lingering impacts from the current supply chain challenges stone the theory of just in time inventory will fade into the past we will look much more toward resiliency and redundancy should there be a problem with one of your lines you will have built in backups like you used to do in your computer system whether it s warehousing distribution and assembly wheel and spoke there will be a lot more appetite to be less reliant on a single line there will be definite investment in north america industrial real estate in critical markets in this country is growing faster than residential real estate dan frierson the dixie group president and ceo q where do you foresee growth in 2022 frierson the upper end that s one reason our decorative products will be hitting the market in january multi fibers and multi looks there will be significant new products in both fabrica decor and masland 1866 we have seen the majority move to better goods the very high end of our product categories is doing the best overall that s a trend i think will continue into 2022 i believe some of it has to do with the age of those who are shopping q any developments on the hard surface side frierson we started into hard surface flooring about four years ago and it s growing very rapidly for us and the industry we will have additional offerings there some domestic made i think in today s plagued supply chain it s certainly advantageous if you can source domestically q what s your outlook on the supply chain frierson it will be back in sync when we have a downturn for sure but you don t want to wish for a downturn to get back to normal all imported products are being impacted dramatically but even in this country there are a lot of logistics issues that will take quite a while in getting back to normal it gets back to labor it gets back to people all of us are trying to do things a little better a little smarter but these are major issues that are not easily solved by an individual company q will you be bringing on any additional domestic capacity frierson it s a difficult thing today trying to start up a new operation when you don t have a nucleus of people who are trained and come to work every day in selling our commercial business we did not sell any manufacturing facilities we did sell some tufting equipment but that was designed to make commercial product so now we have a facility where we were running commercial with machinery and a trained workforce so in essence we have increased our capacity for residential product that was part of the strategy all the metrics in housing seem to be favorable going into 2022 and i don t see what s going to change that unless inflation just takes off like crazy i do think as people can travel more and do things they were unable to do flooring may get a smaller percent of the total dollars but i still think it s going to be very strong q what is the biggest challenge facing the industry in 2022 frierson finding enough people and not unique it s virtually any restaurant you go to any factory the country is still at a very low rate of people working we don t have a full complement of people in our office or plant brian carson ahf products president and ceo q what are the biggest opportunities going into 2022 carson if you re in the residential part of the business and you have products that do well in residential remodel and residential new you re certainly in the right part of the market i expect demand to be strong and quite frankly higher than supply there s obviously inflation in the market but the consumer looks like they re continuing to buy i think residential is going to be strong for the next few years it would take the builders more than a year to just satisfy the existing demand let alone the new consumers coming in i think the flooring industry overall will be up 6 to 8 next year with residential being stronger than that and commercial being less strong q what is your outlook on the supply chain and how are you strategizing carson things will improve somewhat next year in terms of the lead time issues everybody has but i don t think things are going to normalize the new normal is supplies are going to be tight it s going to be more expensive to ship it s going to be more expensive to make products and it s going to be that way for a while being closer to the customer is a good thing having your raw materials closer to home is a good thing that s why we re adding capacity and getting into laminate and spc with u s supply q how does your acquisition by paceline equity partners position you carson the management of paceline has tremendous experience and tremendous success in building product categories they re coming on board probably in january they will bring an excess of capital to allow us to grow faster and we ve got plenty of ideas on how to do that look at what we ve done in the last three years we ve expanded the markets we participate in we ve entered laminate we ve entered vinyl we ve entered commercial our plant in cambodia will be five times bigger next year than it was when we bought it three years ago we re expanding it again as we speak to service capacity we ve got additional vinyl capacity that will be in the united states for next year we just entered the laminate category and we ve got a good supply of laminate we combined with american oem and one reason we did that is they had additional capacity to make engineered hardwood right here in america we ve added capacity in our solid hardwood operations as well we haven t taken advantage of that capacity yet we re waiting for the lumber supply to increase i think paceline is going to add additional fuel for us to grow at a faster rate q what is your product strategy carson we ve added a number of brands as we roll into next year we re going to put more product categories under those brands generally speaking the demand for products is going to be higher than the supply for products so the folks that have more supply to service the customer either in the united states or outside the uncertainty around chinese based goods the better you ll be john wu novalis innovative flooring ceo q do you foresee more growth for lvt in 2022 wu i believe lvt will have double digit growth next year but it will be more on the residential side commercial will probably have to wait another year until it gets back to growth i would say single digits in 2022 and double digits in 2023 the bigger challenge for the commercial market is most of these projects were bid two or three years ago now if you have a project that you just won you re going to say i can t do it at that price anymore and it will delay the project stop the project or you will have a very unhappy customer q what s your view on domestic production versus imports wu today you can probably say domestic production is better but you can t find people to make the products tomorrow when the ocean freight gets back to normal imports will be better you ve got to be really nimble in your business that s why we built a u s factory and have factories in china and vietnam q have your u s operations been impacted by the ongoing labor shortage wu we ve all heard about the great resignation unfortunately factory work is not one of the great things people want to do in life we ve all tried to give out hiring bonuses referral bonuses and then we tried to increase pay i have all this great resilient and spc capacity being built but i don t know where i m going to find people to run the machines q do you see companies exploring other locations for production wu i ve heard people saying they re going to mexico southeast asia still has the cheapest labor but it s not easy to make any product in a region where it hasn t been made before the supply chain is not ready china remains the country that has the most connected supply chain for making anything if you are manufacturing in vietnam you still have to bring in material from china q how does inflation impact your outlook wu the consumer confidence level will determine whether we can sustain this growth not just in terms of lvt but overall production if inflation is truly transitory we will be in for a good four or five years if there s a shortage in demand with all this new capacity being built commoditization of the product will drive the price down having said that lvt is the only product in which year after year the average price is higher we re able to move people to buy more expensive product the average selling price is higher than it s

vancouver bc accesswire february 16 2022 galore resources inc tsxv gri otcqb galof is pleased to announce that diamond drilling at the company s san jose prospect commenced and the initial results observed from the field are promising as announced on january 19 2022 galore has received permits to diamond drill 4 000 meters at its san jose and el alamo prospects in the company s 100 owned dos santos property in zacatecas state mexico previous exploration at these two projects has provided valuable information to encourage and facilitate the search for viable economic mineralization the initial phase of the current drill program is focusing on san jose where the company expects to drill about 1 350 meters this could change depending upon what is learned in the field the planned depth of this first drillhole sj 021 is 250 meters and information from the field indicates that the driller is nearing that objective what the company seeks from drilling this first hole is to intersect a northeast mineralized system and identify any fault systems and the direction of any folds the company expects that additional holes will expand this knowledge and delineate a north south mineralized trend that has been identified from surface observations current interpretations indicate that the san jose area is rich with lower and middle cretaceous sediments that display profound and diverse alteration weak to moderate silification weak phyllic alteration and significant recrystallization in carbonates presumably as the result of intense hydrothermal activity field observations indicate that san jose is dominated by veinlets and a feeder system running in nearly right angle directions to each other the veinlets appear to be running to the northwest and are filled with calcite calcite quartz calcite barite and occasionally ferric or ferrous oxides the feeder system appears to be running to the northeast and is abundant with oxidized pyrite hematite goethite and manganese an early drilling report from the field states that drillhole sj 021 already has been cutting these systems well before the hole was at a depth of 112 meters a more recent drilling report sent to the company when the drillhole was at 191 meters states that the alteration continues at least to 191 meters alternating between weak and moderate and that there are traces of mineralization in the structures core from hole sj 021 exhibits evident mineralization with supergenic effects which is composed of secondary hydroxides and clays dr rocha rocha new geological team galore has a new geological team that management is excited to introduce gustavo narvaez ramirez is the company s lead geologist in mexico with dr macario rocha rocha and dr julio pinto linares acting as geological consultants galore s new geological team believes that the geology at dos santos displays many similarities to the geology at newmont s nearby multi billion dollar penasquito mine galore s geological team has a combined experience that exceeds 100 years of prospecting and exploration particularly in this region of mexico galore s geological team is being led by gustavo narvaez ramirez who also has spent several decades prospecting and exploring in mexico and central america particularly in the concepcion del oro mining district of which galore s dos santos is a part he was graduated as a geological engineer from the autonomous university of san luis potosi and has focused on northern mexican epithermal deposits successfully collaborating in identifying deposits such as cairo and san agustin in durango

connecticut house minority leader vincent candelora r north branford speaks during opening session at the state capitol wednesday feb 9 2022 in hartford conn jessica hill associated press house republicans unveiled the capitol s most aggressive tax cutting plan to date wednesday pitching a combination of ongoing and one time relief worth more than 700 million and centered on middle income households and small and mid sized businesses republicans also called for further investigations into the contracting practices of gov ned lamont s administration and other initiatives to enhance government transparency i think overall the affordability in the state of connecticut is one of the biggest concerns that residents have said house minority leader vincent j candelora r north branford advertisement article continues below this ad after two years of a corornavirus induced economic slump including a 2021 marked by inflation above 7 percent connecticut households and businesses are reeling state government though thanks to a robust stock market and unprecedented federal pandemic relief has a record setting 3 1 billion in its rainy day fund and is expecting an unprecedented 2 5 billion surplus when the current fiscal year ends on june 30 the house republicans chief plan to aid middle income households would involve roughly 300 million in state income tax relief advertisement article continues below this ad the gop would boost the income tax credit that offsets local property tax expenses from 200 to 500 a peak level it hasn t reached since 2011 it also would again make households without children or seniors eligible for the credit something they lost in 2018 the 200 property tax credit currently provides about 53 million in annual relief to connecticut families the last time it stood at 500 and was available to households without children or seniors it was worth 365 million house republicans said working families also would benefit by repeal of the new mileage tax on commercial trucks proposed by lamont and enacted last year by the democrat controlled legislature that tax which would raise 90 million annually by 2024 would only exacerbate inflation republican lawmakers argued driving up the cost of groceries department store goods and other necessities typically transported by truck advertisement article continues below this ad rep holly cheeseman of east lyme ranking house republican on the tax writing finance committee said it was no accident that all of her caucus revenue proposals were aimed at broad groups of taxpayers this is a question of priorities and it s clear where our priorities lie she said where can tax relief give us the biggest bang for our buck lamont a greenwich democrat has said he fears tax hikes on connecticut s wealthy would drive them from the state the governor did propose more than 330 million in tax cuts including boosting the property tax credit to 300 and freezing municipal taxes on vehicles statewide at 29 mills but candelora said that plan wasn t aggressive enough given state government s swelling coffers democrats represent the urban poor and our very wealthy it s the republicans who represent the broad based middle class the minority leader added advertisement article continues below this ad we are happy to see republicans on board with our proposal to provide tax relief to connecticut residents and families lamont spokesman anthony anthony said any day where we are discussing how much money we re putting in people s pockets is a good day for the state as governor lamont has said time and time again he ll work with anyone on ways we can support our working and middle class families our small businesses and our small but mighty state economy the caucus chief proposal to aid connecticut businesses is tied to the massive debt the state s unemployment trust incurred during the pandemic according to the department of labor the state borrowed about 850 million from the federal government to keep jobless benefits flowing businesses legally are responsible for covering that debt and face a special assessment starting this fall the governor and legislature agreed last summer to use 155 million in federal pandemic relief grants to help close that debt house republicans would draw another 300 million from the state s surplus to further reduce what businesses would owe advertisement article continues below this ad the caucus also proposed bolstering another credit for small and mid sized businesses that would provide an estimated 50 million in recurring annual relief house gop shadows in lamont administration pre date latest controversybesides pitching tax relief house republicans also focused much of their agenda for 2022 on increasing transparency in state government one of the issues that we certainly continue to see percolate is the corruption that yet again has hit the state of connecticut said candelora who said a culture of diminishing transparency struck the state not long after gov ned lamont took office in january 2019 by april of that year lamont and hedge fund billionaire ray dalio would announce a public private partnership to invest at least 200 million across five years in connecticut s under performing schools but by june the ct mirror would disclose that as a condition of funding half that initiative dalio and lamont would insist upon the partnership being exempt from state ethics and disclosure laws advertisement article continues below this ad dalio and his wife barbara dissolved the partnership one year later following media reports that the dalios were forcing the venture s executive director from the job and while fbi officials currently are investigating certain projects overseen by lamont s former deputy budget director kosta diamantis candelora noted the seeds of that problem were planted in the spring of 2019 that s when the lamont administration unilaterally moved the state s massive school construction program from the department of administrative services into the governor s budget office in the spring of 2019 an act that candelora and many other legislators from both parties argued couldn t be done without legislative approval it was no surprise to us that within a couple of years of that happening we re seeing scandals arising out of that candelora said adding that it s time for an independent review of contracting practices if we have individuals that are involved in scandals and corruption i don t think it behooves us to join arms and have the very people involved in these scandals actually do the investigation candelora said we actually need a more forensic accounting that is not just going to look at how the money was spent but how much of that money was spent and who benefitted advertisement article continues below this ad lamont s office did not comment on house republicans call for an independent investigation of contracting procedures and charges of a lack of transparency in the administration house republicans also would require all quasi public state agencies to abide by all transparency and ethics standards imposed on more traditional state agencies that includes being subjected to oversight by the state contracting standards board the governor in his latest budget proposal last week recommended removing the contracting board s chief enforcement power to suspend any procurement process deemed not in compliance with state rules another house republican proposal would make all contracts entered into by the state but not subjected to competitive bidding available for public review on the internet
updated february 24 2022 at 1 57 pm et the long feared invasion of ukraine by russia jolted markets sent energy prices higher and prompted promises of a new round of consequences for russia signals that even people out of immediate harm s way will be affected by what threatens to become the biggest war in europe since world war ii here s how the invasion will have ripple effects far outside the borders of the conflict there could be collateral damage from sanctions on russia this week president biden announced a first tranche of economic sanctions on two russian banks with about 80 billion in assets and five russian oligarchs and their families and prohibited u s entities from purchasing russian sovereign debt more sanctions are expected to follow in response to what biden said is a needless act of aggression against ukraine and global peace and security brendan smialowski afp via getty images afp via getty images president biden speaks about russia and ukraine in the east room of the white house on tuesday the forthcoming sanctions could include restrictions on major russian banks that would dramatically affect russia s ability to conduct international business severe u s sanctions could drive up prices for everyday russians or cause russia s currency or markets to crash because the u s does not rely much on trade with russia it is somewhat insulated from direct consequences europe is more directly affected but certain sectors of the u s economy rely on highly specific russian exports primarily raw commodities the premise of sanctions is to hurt the other guy more than you hurt your own interests but that does not mean there will not be some collateral damage said doug rediker a partner at international capital strategies energy prices could rise in the early hours following russia s invasion brent crude oil was trading at more than 100 per barrel for the first time since 2014 and another benchmark west texas intermediate rose nearly 5 to more than 96 per barrel russia is a major exporter of oil and natural gas especially to europe as a result officials have reportedly shied away from severe sanctions on russian energy exports but there are other ways the energy market could be disrupted michael sohn ap ap nearly 40 of the natural gas used by the european union comes from russia president biden said prior to russia s invasion of ukraine that the not yet operational nord stream 2 pipeline would not move ahead in the event of an invasion for one russia could choose to cut off or limit oil and gas exports to europe as retaliation for sanctions nearly 40 of the natural gas used by the european union comes from russia and no european country imports more than germany a key ally of the united states even if russia chooses not to limit exports supplies could still be affected by the conflict in ukraine because multiple pipelines run through the country carrying gas from russia to europe they could simply be casualties of a military invasion rediker said either way if europe s natural gas supply is pinched that could cause energy prices which have already been climbing to rise even further and even though the u s imports relatively little oil from russia oil prices are set by the global market meaning local prices could rise anyway there s a geopolitical premium or call it a fear premium in the price of oil daniel yergin vice chairman of ihs markit told morning edition an expectation that as this crisis spirals worse that supplies of oil from russia are going to be disrupted other industries from food to cars might also be hurt russia is a major exporter of rare earth minerals and heavy metals such as titanium used in airplanes russia supplies about a third of the world s palladium a rare metal used in catalytic converters and its price has soared in recent weeks over fears of a conflict ukrainian economic output and industry will likely be significantly disrupted the country is a major source of neon which is used in manufacturing semiconductors as a result u s officials have warned various sectors including the semiconductor and aerospace industries to brace for supply chain disruptions fertilizer is produced in major quantities in both ukraine and russia disruptions to those exports would mostly affect agriculture in europe but food prices around the world could rise as a result global markets could drop the invasion rattled investors wednesday with dow futures down more than 2 before the markets opened in the united states markets across asia also dropped the invasion sent the prices of traditional investment safe havens higher with gold up more than 1 5 overnight markets are fundamentally not prepared for a land war in europe in the 21st century rediker said it s something people just have not contemplated the u s stock market has already been unusually volatile in recent weeks churning over inflation moves by the federal reserve to curb its stimulus programs and the looming conflict in ukraine historically the market has bounced back relatively quickly after geopolitical events that s what s most likely today too analysts say so the effect on people with 401 k accounts may be short term but if the conflict causes long lasting disruption of energy markets and other exports investors could rethink that conventional wisdom you re potentially at a point where not only are we looking at russia potentially invading ukraine and sanctions and countermeasures but you are also looking at a rise of china that doesn t necessarily agree with the american perspective on the world anyway rediker said last week before the invasion are we looking at a point in which some of the major premises that people take for granted have to be reassessed russia could launch disruptive cyberattacks another way russia could respond to u s sanctions is through cyberattacks and influence campaigns various federal agencies including the treasury and the department of homeland security have warned of possible cyberattacks on targets like big banks and power grid operators they have been warning everyone about russia s very specific tactics about the possibility of attacks on critical infrastructure katerina sedova a researcher at georgetown university s center for security and emerging technology told npr russian cyberattacks have targeted ukraine relentlessly in recent years including attacks on the capital city of kyiv s power grid in 2015 and 2016 but a major escalation could shift focus to u s targets sedova pointed to the russian state backed attack on the it software company solarwinds and a ransomware attack that shut down the colonial pipeline for six days as examples of how major russian cyberattacks could disrupt u s operations the biden administration said it does not believe the russian government was involved in the pipeline attack power grids hospitals and local governments could all be targets she said for now sedova said she is more worried about subtler attacks like influence campaigns that aim to sow discord between us and our allies in our resolve to act jointly against russia oftentimes cyber operations go hand in hand with influence she said they re targeting a change of decision making a change in policy in that direction a change in public opinion a major invasion would likely spark a refugee crisis anatolii stepanov afp via getty images afp via getty images a serviceman with ukraine s military forces walks along a trench on the front line with russia backed separatists not far from novoluhanske in ukraine s donetsk region on feb 16 the invasion could send 1 million to 5 million refugees fleeing ukraine u s officials and humanitarian agencies have warned it will be a continent wide humanitarian disaster with millions of refugees seeking protection in neighbouring european countries agnès callamard secretary general of amnesty international said last month in statement poland which shares a border with ukraine and is already home to more than a million ukrainians would likely see the most refugees polish interior minister mariusz kaminski said his country was preparing for an influx of refugees from ukraine the u s military says that the thousands of soldiers deployed to poland this month are prepared to assist with a large scale evacuation assistance with evacuation flow is something they could do and could do quite well they are going to be working with polish authorities on what that looks like and how they would handle that defense department spokesperson john kirby said last week at the largest scale a refugee crisis would not be contained to europe the u s would likely see refugees seeking asylum too copyright 2022 npr to see more visit

vancouver bc accesswire february 16 2022 galore resources inc tsxv gri otcqb galof is pleased to announce that diamond drilling at the company s san jose prospect commenced and the initial results observed from the field are promising as announced on january 19 2022 galore has received permits to diamond drill 4 000 meters at its san jose and el alamo prospects in the company s 100 owned dos santos property in zacatecas state mexico previous exploration at these two projects has provided valuable information to encourage and facilitate the search for viable economic mineralization the initial phase of the current drill program is focusing on san jose where the company expects to drill about 1 350 meters this could change depending upon what is learned in the field the planned depth of this first drillhole sj 021 is 250 meters and information from the field indicates that the driller is nearing that objective what the company seeks from drilling this first hole is to intersect a northeast mineralized system and identify any fault systems and the direction of any folds the company expects that additional holes will expand this knowledge and delineate a north south mineralized trend that has been identified from surface observations current interpretations indicate that the san jose area is rich with lower and middle cretaceous sediments that display profound and diverse alteration weak to moderate silification weak phyllic alteration and significant recrystallization in carbonates presumably as the result of intense hydrothermal activity field observations indicate that san jose is dominated by veinlets and a feeder system running in nearly right angle directions to each other the veinlets appear to be running to the northwest and are filled with calcite calcite quartz calcite barite and occasionally ferric or ferrous oxides the feeder system appears to be running to the northeast and is abundant with oxidized pyrite hematite goethite and manganese an early drilling report from the field states that drillhole sj 021 already has been cutting these systems well before the hole was at a depth of 112 meters a more recent drilling report sent to the company when the drillhole was at 191 meters states that the alteration continues at least to 191 meters alternating between weak and moderate and that there are traces of mineralization in the structures

stocks shook off an early slump and ended mixed on wall street wednesday after minutes from the federal reserve s latest policy meeting showed policymakers still leaning toward moving decisively to fight inflation trading was choppy following the midafternoon release of the fed minutes the s p 500 wound up 0 1 higher after having been down 0 9 in the early going the dow jones industrial average slipped 0 2 and the nasdaq composite fell 0 1 treasury yields bounced around a bit as traders tried to parse the latest update from the fed the 10 year treasury yield ended up at 2 03 just below where it was late tuesday wall street has been looking for clues about how much and how quickly the central bank will begin raising interest rates traders see a 44 chance for a first hike in march of half a percentage point double the traditional move in their discussion of the outlook for monetary policy most fed policymakers suggested that a faster pace of increases in the central bank s benchmark short term interest rate than what the fed followed after its last rate hikes in 2015 would likely be warranted should the economy evolve generally in line with the committee s expectation policymakers also noted during the meeting that it would be appropriate for the fed to make a significant reduction in the size of its balance sheet brand connections in markets timing is everything and the delayed reaction from the fed has investors convinced that aggressive policy tightening is on the horizon said charlie ripley senior investment strategist for allianz investment management the s p 500 rose 3 94 points to 4 475 01 the benchmark index was coming off a broad rally on tuesday that snapped a three day losing streak the dow fell 54 57 points to 34 934 27 while the nasdaq lost 15

for much of the s p 500 s modest rise keeping losses in the technology and communications sectors in check most fed officials agreed during their meeting last month that faster interest rate hikes would be needed if inflation does not move down as the central bank s policymaking committee expects as recently as december fed officials forecast that inflation based on their preferred measure would fall to an annual rate of 2 6 it is currently 5 8 but fed policymakers differ on how quickly to raise rates on monday james bullard president of the federal reserve bank of st louis repeated his call for the fed to take the aggressive step of raising its benchmark short term rate by a full percentage point by july 1 esther george president of the kansas city fed expressed support for a more gradual approach and mary daly of the san francisco fed declined to commit herself to more than a modest rate hike next month most analysts expect fed officials to raise that forecast at their next meeting in mid march to reflect the acceleration of consumer prices inflation has reached its highest pace in four decades hammering household budgets and wiping out the benefit of rising wages rising inflation has been crimping profits and revenue for businesses in a wide range of industries many companies have been raising prices to offset the costs including cereal maker kellogg that has raised concerns that consumers could eventually pull back spending though the latest report from the commerce department shows that retail sales remained strong in january as the threat of the omicron variant of covid 19 faded the government reported wednesday that retail sales surged 3 8 last month whizzing past the projections of most economists that compared to the prior month when sales slid 2 5 investors brushed off the encouraging retail sales data but the results and other solid economic updates remain reassuring for the bigger economic picture as the fed starts tightening its interest rate policy said liz ann sonders chief investment strategist at charles schwab the fed is moving period she said that s happening no matter what so it s better if along the way you have economic data

by allison morrow cnn business the tale of zachary horwitz made headlines this week after he was sentenced to 20 years for bilking investors out of 650 million by peddling bogus licensing deals with hbo and netflix ironically it is just the kind of juicy swindler story you might binge watch on those platforms horwitz a 35 year old actor who had bit roles in a handful of low budget films over the past decade pleaded guilty last fall to committing federal securities fraud and running an illegal operation known as a ponzi scheme for years prosecutors say horwitz used his investors money to fund a lavish hollywood lifestyle until his scam unraveled ponzi schemes explained in short a ponzi scheme is a type of financial fraud that uses money from new investors to pay off earlier ones the term comes from the 1920 swindler charles ponzi but in recent years has become synonymous with the crimes of bernie madoff the mastermind behind the largest financial fraud in history who died in prison last year although ponzi schemes have a long history they are far from a bygone threat experts say in fact they remain a major risk to investors in an era of soaring stock markets and wild surges in newfangled assets like nfts and cryptocurrency fraudsters really feed on times of uncertainty financial distress upheaval times of change and those are really the times that we ve been living in the past few years says kathy bazoian phelps a lawyer who runs a blog about ponzi schemes and of course there s a lot of money out there people are looking to invest horwitz s case appears to check the major boxes for a ponzi scheme they re typically perpetrated by a men who b promise steadily high returns with minimal risk and c often prey on friends and family to get the scam off the ground early investors in a ponzi scheme get rewarded with mindbogglingly large dividends horwitz allegedly promised returns between 25 and 45 that propel them to tell others about the golden opportunity which keeps new money flowing into the scam once the pool of new investment dries up of course the fraud falls apart a fraud is born prosecutors say horwitz who goes by the stage name zach avery promised his investors many of whom were friends that their money would be used to buy film distribution rights that he would then license to streaming platforms for a profit but as his victims came to learn was not a successful businessman or hollywood insider prosecutors said he just played one in real life savage burn prosecutors horwitz s company neither acquired film rights nor entered into any distribution agreements with hbo or netflix and he provided fake documents to his investors hbo like cnn is part of warnermedia horwitz instead routed the funds to his own accounts shelling out 5 7 million on a house and splurging on trips to vegas on private jets according to a complaint filed by the securities and exchange commission it s not hard to imagine how an investor might be sucked into such a scam in the era of meme stock rallies and overnight cryptocurrency millionaires the fear of missing out is a powerful tool for grifters phelps who wrote the ponzi book a legal resource for unraveling ponzi schemes says people often rely too much on word of mouth without due diligence to determine whether an investment is legitimate that can be especially true when it comes to schemes involving cryptocurrencies or artificial intelligence all it takes is for somebody to represent that they have the proprietary algorithm that guarantees returns and that sounds pretty technical and fancy and like a sure thing she said that feels comfortable to people because somebody knows technically what they re talking about supposedly and the outcome is a guaranteed return that s much higher than something they re going to find somewhere else in fact the sec is particularly worried that the rise of cryptos may entice fraudsters to lure investors into ponzi and other schemes in part by promising investors an opportunity to get in on the ground floor of a growing internet phenomenon the agency cited a 2013 case in which an alleged ponzi scheme advertised a bitcoin investment opportunity in an online forum investors were promised up to 7 interest per week and that their funds would be used for bitcoin arbitrage instead the crypto funds were used to pay existing investors and exchanged into us dollars to pay the organizer s personal expenses even professional investors can fall victim to fraud phelps notes but there are several ways to avoid getting taken for a ride step one is simply being mindful of the potential for fraud i m not even sure if that crosses people s minds at all she said beyond that investors need to ask due diligence questions beware of promises of guaranteed return with no risk and watch out for returns that are higher than what you re likely to find in the marketplace if you can t really understand what the investment is after a five minute explanation phelps says you probably shouldn t be investing in it the cnn wire 2022 cable news network inc a warnermedia company all rights reserved

washington feb 16 reuters federal reserve officials last month agreed that with inflation tightening its grip on the economy and employment strong it was time to raise interest rates but also that any decisions would depend on a meeting by meeting analysis of inflation and other data according to the minutes of the jan 25 26 policy meeting the account of the two day session showed the u s central bank readying for a fight against the fastest pace of price increases since the 1980s with officials saying that while they still expected inflation to ease through the year they would be ready to hike rates fast if it does not most participants noted that if inflation does not move down as they expect it would be appropriate for the federal open market committee to remove policy accommodation at a faster pace than they currently anticipate the minutes stated as it stood fed officials said the strength of the economy and the high current pace of inflation would warrant raising rates quicker than the once per quarter pace seen during the tightening cycle that began in 2015 a statement some analysts said perhaps points to rate hikes at every meeting this year the fed meets eight times per year or roughly every six to seven weeks but with the united states still near a peak in coronavirus infections when the last policy meeting was held the minutes gave no obvious indication policymakers were wed to a particular path and especially no sense they would start the liftoff in borrowing costs at their upcoming meeting in march with a half percentage point rise in the benchmark overnight interest rate the fed in recent years has stuck with smaller and usually well anticipated quarter percentage point increases among the fed officials who have made public comments about monetary policy since the january meeting most have favored a smaller initial increase including two who spoke on wednesday even though surprised by the persistence of inflation participants emphasized that the appropriate path of policy would depend on economic and financial developments and their implications for the outlook and the risks around the outlook the minutes stated fed officials will be updating their assessments of the appropriate setting for the policy stance at each meeting bond yields fell and stocks on balance moved higher after the release of the minutes the yield on the 2 year treasury note the maturity generally most sensitive to fed interest rate expectations slid to 1 52 from 1 55 and the s p 500 index spx rose into positive territory on the day balance sheet debate following the january policy meeting fed officials issued a statement saying that it would soon be appropriate to raise the central bank s benchmark overnight interest rate from its near zero level data since the beginning of this year have if anything heightened the fed s readiness to act u s retail sales in january were strong and u s employers added 467 000 jobs that month far more than expected the most recent inflation data showed no sign of easing from the current 40 year high but policymakers have not committed to much beyond the notion that they will increase rates at their march 15 16 policy meeting and will likely continue to raise rates through the year depending on how inflation responds investors had begun pricing in the prospect that the fed would raise its target interest rate by half a percentage point next month but they now see a quarter percentage point hike as more likely while the minutes of the late january fomc meeting pre date the release of the stronger than expected labour market and inflation data covering last month officials didn t appear to be seriously considering either a 50bp rate hike to start the tightening cycle or a hike at each of the remaining seven policy meetings this year said paul ashworth chief north america economist at capital economics the fed in january also released a broad set of guidelines about how it plans to reduce the nearly 9 trillion portfolio of securities held by the central bank discussion of the balance sheet included debate about whether or not outright sales of securities will be needed the minutes stated though no decision has been made the minutes noted that many participants in the meeting said sales may be needed at some point in the future
