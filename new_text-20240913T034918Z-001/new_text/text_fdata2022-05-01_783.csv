florida gov ron desantis said on friday that disney would pay more taxes as he signed a bill into law dissolving disney world s special status but some say it s the state s residents who bear the brunt of the changes to disney s tax status national tax expert and founder of engineered tax services inc julio gonzalez said that desantis will work to ensure florida taxpayers don t assume any increased tax burdens due to disney i know the media says that that there s no chance that even governor desantis said that if there s any raise in taxes it would go to disney corporation and not the u s citizens gonzalez told ntd evening news host stefania cox in a recent interview there s no question about that have to pay several million dollars more in taxes a big cost to them because of their pandering and politics gonzalez is referring to the fact that disney like other big corporations has gotten involved in political debate instead of showing neutrality for the sake of all of their patrons disney ceo bob chapek criticized a florida bill hb1557 that he says takes away the rights of transgender and gay people but supporters of the bill say it gives parents more say in their child s education and prohibits teachers from instructing young children k 3 on sexual orientation and gender he said the tax increases would have to be assumed by disney but that the other scenario is that the amusement park would negotiate another deal with florida s government to remedy the current situation the company then said it would work to try to rescind the parental rights bill which drew condemnation from desantis and other republicans i truly believe we are an infinitely better and stronger company because of our lgbtq community chapek said in a statement in reference to the law several weeks ago i missed the mark in this case but am an ally you can count on and i will be an outspoken champion for the protection visibility and opportunity you deserve the epoch times reached out to disney for further comment in response to disney getting political desantis signed a bill that revoked disney s 55 year special status within the state that provides the corporation a significant tax break while allowing it to self govern a 25 000 acre area near orlando one of the state s u s senators rick scott r fla told fox business over the past weekend in a company that is relying on a special tax status that doesn t make any sense i don t understand why disney would be doing what it s doing i m a business guy you would not go engage in social issues like this if you want to keep all your customers but i d say the same thing about coke and delta when they lied about the election security laws in georgia scott continued about 150 people attend a rally to oppose the walt disney company s stance against a recently passed florida law that prohibits schools from teaching their youngest students about sexual orientation and gender identity outside of disney s headquarters in burbank calif on april 6 2022 jill mclaughlin the epoch times gonzalez said desantis won t be deterred from standing up for parental rights and ultimately getting political will cost disney revenue disney like major league baseball entered in politics and it ended up costing the ceos 31 percent of their stock value now millions of dollars more in cost bad news and i m sure this will be correct behind closed doors in addition desantis made reference on april 22 to disney s pledge to have hb1557 repealed i was very clear about saying you ain t influencing me i m standing strong right here he said incredibly they say we are going to work to repeal parents rights in florida while desantis s critics say this will cost him politically supporters say protecting parental rights will work out in his favor and possibly give other governors the courage to stand up to big corporations i think it ll play out well for governor desantis and hopefully other states will realize that no corporation is worth these tax incentives when it costs the people of the state tom ozimek contributed to this report

so far 2022 has hit amazon where it hurts in the wallet during the first three months of the year the e tailer suffered a 3 8 billion net loss shocking analysts and wall street it was the company s first quarterly loss in seven years and it turns out amazon itself may be partly responsible after reporting 116 4 billion in revenue which limped over estimates of 116 3 billion and even showed a little growth at 7 percent over the same time last year analysts were left stunned by the financial stumble advertisement advertisement more from wwd amazon blamed the tanking value of its major investment in rivian automotive a once buzzworthy ev electric vehicle company whose initial public offering in november was hailed as the most successful ipo in several years rivian basked in the glow of its key investor and thanks to a partnership deal could boast that it was supplying ev delivery vans to one of the world s top e commerce platforms but in recent months its stock has been tanking leaving investors agape as three quarters of rivian s share value evaporated for amazon which soaked a total of 1 8 billion into the start up the free fall resulted in a whopping 7 6 billion loss the reasons for the downturn range from self inflicted like a big price hike that triggered backlash from preorder customers to other complications including component shortages but amazon s own actions didn t help it s supposed to receive 100 000 rivian made electric delivery vehicles but confusion reigns as it s not clear when they re coming and how many have been produced so far what investors do know however is that amazon isn t relying on that early this year revelations surfaced that the company has been striking e car deals with stellantis daimler and others shaking confidence in the start up it makes for a fascinating twist rivian s marquee investor wound up undermining the business now its falling share value fueled by that and other woes came back to bite amazon not that it s alone ford motor company invested in the ev company as well resulting in 5 4 billion in loss but optimism over its strategic plans and the fact that it beat revenue and earnings estimates gave ford some resilience that s not the case for amazon right now the last quarter looks particularly bad compared to last year in the first quarter of 2021 pandemic fueled online shopping and gains across other business units drove 44 percent year over year growth and 108 5 billion in revenue with profits north of 8 billion first quarter 2022 projections essentially cut that in half laying out expectations of 4 4 billion in profit that were ultimately unfulfilled story continues according to amazon the second quarter doesn t look much better it forecasts slowing year over year growth between 3 and 7 percent pegging revenue between 116 billion and 121 billion analysts thought it would come to 125 5 billion shares fell 10 percent in after hours trading and as of friday they still haven t recovered at least it has the prime day annual sales extravaganza to look forward to in july according to chief executive officer andy jassy the pandemic and subsequent war in ukraine have brought unusual growth and challenges which paints amazon as subject to the same broader challenges that have been plaguing the retail and technology sectors across the board while that s true it s clearly not the full picture advertisement advertisement still he tried to focus on the bright spots during the quarter like amazon web services which has become a rather foundational part of the company the cloud division outperformed amazon as a whole with 18 44 billion in sales blowing past the 18 27 billion expected and operating income soaring 57 percent to 6 5 billion jassy also painted a positive portrait of its consumer business with high growth over the past two years prompting the company to double its fulfillment network with that behind it now it s focusing on efficiencies like delivery speed performance has been improving he said even approaching levels not seen since the months immediately preceding the pandemic in early 2020 it s not clear if rivian s electric delivery vehicles are supposed to be part of that plan and if so when the new buy with prime program could also be a pressure test on amazon s infrastructure as offering fast shipping and other prime perks to outside e commerce sites looks like a major expansion notably in only the second time amazon broke out figures for its ad business it apparently eked out a small victory which is conspicuous in a tough quarter for tech in general ad sales of 7 88 billion may not have met expectations of 8 17 billion but they still represent a 23 percent uptick over last year that s good enough to edge out google 22 percent and trounce facebook 6 1 percent of course as a retailer amazon faces challenges that go beyond tech sector concerns like warehouse labor issues just weeks ago workers in staten island new york voted in favor of forming a labor union setting up a historic first for the company the arrival of its first official unionized workplace in the u s now other warehouses are trying to unionize as well amazon is fighting it

sign up for daily news updates from cleantechnica on email or follow us on google news elon musk s focus on tesla has been under fire this week unless you ve been off the grid say lounging beneath a palm tree on a remote sandy beach you know that musk and twitter s board have been wrestling over control of one of the world s top social media sites musk s diatribe about free speech rights seems a distraction to many tesla stockholders who have seen the tesla portfolio valuation of late resemble more of a rollercoaster than a preferred slight but steady upward slope an article this week in the guardian explores whether to focus on twitter or focus more on tesla is elon musk overextended should musk s focus on tesla and his other established companies spacex neuralink the boring company be exclusive when musk turns his attention away from tesla is he reducing the potential of the all electric car company whose future viability is by no means guaranteed with analysts looking for sales to double to 34 billion by the end of 2023 as new plants in berlin and texas produce at full capacity many still insist that tesla s valuation is exuberant should tesla ceo elon musk focus on tesla much more let s engage in a point counterpoint discussion and see what we can determine chip in a few dollars a month to help support independent cleantech coverage that helps to accelerate the cleantech revolution how quickly a week changes everything counterpoint tesla investors are wary that musk s recent laser focus on the twitter takeover does pull him too far away from the day job according to the guardian a week ago tesla shares dropped 3 yet today with the 2022 q1 earnings in tesla s stock value increased 8 overnight yes tesla comprises one of the most ambitious manufacturing expansions in corporate history with a rapidly growing capacity the guardian acknowledged last week that this is a hugely impressive feat given that the company essentially had to invent electric vehicle production tesla just reported first quarter earnings for 2022 and beat analysts expectations on the top and bottom lines here are the key numbers earnings per share 3 22 vs 2 26 expected revenue 18 76 billion vs 17 80 billion expected no detailed guidance on deliveries going forward was offered but cfo zachary kirkhorn and musk expressed confidence that the company will experience 50 annual growth on a multi year basis new plants in berlin and texas will add to existing factories in fremont california and shanghai china musk s recent proposal to acquire twitter was not discussed during yesterday s earnings call a follow up article in the guardian commended tesla s record q1 2022 albeit couching the affirmation with a side note saying the successes occurred despite a tumultuous few months for its ceo elon musk point during the earning s call musk and kirkhorn variously spoke to obstacles that needed to be overcome in order to generate the positive q1 earnings inflationary pressures parts and semiconductor chip shortages ongoing pandemic and russia s devastating invasion of ukraine they admonished their audience to be aware that supply chain constraints are likely to continue through 2022 and that inflation is worse than has been reported tesla s solar deployments dropped by nearly half to 48 mw in the first quarter of 2022 versus the same time last year reportedly caused by import delays beyond the company s control recent covid 19 outbreaks have been weighing on our supply chain and factory operations they delineated furthermore prices of some raw materials have increased multiple fold in recent months the inflationary impact on our cost structure has contributed to adjustments in our product pricing what had been an 8 day tesla global vehicle inventory in q1 2021 fell to a 3 day supply a year later the full self driving fsd program has hit more false dawns than any technology development musk had previously been involved in he acknowledged in january musk announced that tesla would not produce a new vehicle model this year instead it will focus on its existing output and deal with supply chain constraints tesla would however turn its attention to improving its production and what it sees as a groundbreaking bet on fsd which aims to perform everyday driving tasks with an attentive driver behind the wheel these barriers have a heady influence on tesla s overall stability and stock performance counterpoint musk has proven he can guide tesla through manufacturing complications a lot of companies get confused musk has pointed out they spend money on things that don t actually make the product better in 2018 he attempted to soothe a customer whose delivery date had been pushed back several times sorry we ve gone from production hell to delivery logistics hell but this problem is far more tractable musk explained in a tweet we re making rapid progress should be solved shortly and indeed he and the company did solve the hellish problems on the road to this week s announcement of continued tesla accomplishments the innovator leader genius visionary and futurist said in a 2010 interview that entrepreneurs need to be extremely tenacious and then just work like hell you just have to put in 80 to 100 hour weeks every week he explained if other people are putting in 40 hour workweeks and you re putting in 100 hour workweeks then even if you re doing the same thing you will achieve in 4 months what it takes them a year to achieve in 2018 musk slept on the floor of the company s vehicle assembly plant because he wanted to suffer more than any other employee during the troubled production ramp up for the model 3 sedan this week tesla has required shanghai workers to similarly sleep on a factory floor as it plans to gradually resume production during the closed loop restart workers have each been given a sleeping bag and a mattress point tesla is just one of several companies under musk s control any and all of which require him to devote time and energy that could otherwise be devoted to tesla with neuralink micron scale threads would be inserted into areas of the brain that control movement each thread contains many electrodes and connects them to an implant the link this first neural implant ever could let you control a computer or mobile device anywhere you go spacex builds and launches the falcon 9 and falcon heavy rockets both of which have booster stages that return to earth for refurbishment and cost savings the dragon is a space capsule that can carry crew and cargo to the international space station a large rocket and spacecraft system starship will be able to carry massive payloads to space a massive constellation of small satellites called starlink intends to provide global high speed internet access cyber defense and overcoming signal jamming of its starlink internet satellites amidst russia s ongoing invasion of ukraine has caused company upset the boring company creates safe fast to dig and low cost transportation utility and freight tunnels in order to enable rapid point to point transportation ceo elon musk was already busy juggling leadership roles at these major companies before he launched an unsolicited takeover offer for twitter that s a lot of distractions and it may be one too many for tesla investors according to cnn counterpoint unlike most of its peer carmakers tesla has spent years focusing on how to secure its own nickel supplies the efforts are part of chief executive elon musk s focus on vertical integration to maintain control over tesla s supply chain the company jointly operates a large battery cell plant outside reno nevada with panasonic tesla buys cells from other leading suppliers as well but also manufacturers its own supply nickel is a key component for the cathodes of electric vehicle batteries and tesla is focused on nickel based chemistries for longer range vehicles it uses iron phosphate batteries for shorter range vehicles point musk seems to have an inability to focus he dismantled tesla s public relations department and instead keeps the company in the media spotlight by posting on twitter there s a lot of misunderstanding of tesla in the press and among the public but there isn t a focused pr team to effectively correct those misunderstandings adding the falcon wing doors to the model x was elon s last minute idea as techcrunch notes he was adamant that the company could build a car factory that was almost entirely automated and that shift to automation was fraught with initial problems he also implemented the ability to pay with cryptocurrency then took the option away and then reintroduced it for tesla vehicles and services final thoughts it seems as if points and counterpoints here are pretty equal which leads us to a stalemate what we probably can agree on however is that elon musk is a pretty rare bird who can accomplish more in one lifetime than scores of others could together with that intellect come flaws of course and so musk s need to be self actualized in as many different iterations as possible will likely always affect the tesla stock price it may be a side

according to uk judges laws should be made by parliament a few weeks back i wondered in this space whether the courts possess a legislative mandate the concern stemmed from a growing trend in many democracies including kenya where courts have adopted the practice of interpreting the constitution or applying the law in a manner that sets fundamentally new legal direction in critical matters in some situations such interpretations and rulings seem to alter or go against the expressed values and ethos of the people the question therefore is whether such precedent setting interpretations should not be taken to the people either directly in a referendum or through their elected representatives in parliament interestingly as if in response to my wonder a privy council judge lady arden of heswall england just about a month ago on 25 march 2022 argued that the task of making laws belongs to parliaments and not the courts the learned judge was speaking as a distinguished guest of the grand court in cayman islands a self governing british overseas territory in the western caribbean sea in her lecture titled taking stock of recent jurisprudence of the judicial committee of the privy council lady arden warned that if the courts were allowed to make legislation the law could become a judge s plaything which could result in undermining the will of parliament and of the people the import of this is huge especially coming from the privy council the privy council is regarded as the final court of appeal throughout england and wales and several overseas territories its primary role is to hear complex cases on issues of how the law across each jurisdiction is to be interpreted by providing an objective review of cases lady arden had been part of a panel of uk judges siting in the privy council who ruled last month that cayman s constitution does not provide a right for same sex marriage however in the recent lecture she reasoned that a same sex marriage law was still a possibility for the cayman islands so long as it was brought about by the legislature and not by a judge as she argued it is for legislators not judges to create laws granted in most cases courts do not go out of their way to create laws however two factors have contributed significantly to this trend of judicial law making first is a trend generally known as judicial activism judges with particular social personations take up controversial cases and make rulings in line with their worldviews often to perpetuate an agenda once such rulings have been made the second factor kicks in precedent according to the principle of precedence a court decision automatically becomes an example or authority for judges deciding similar issues later furthermore in some jurisdictions decisions of higher courts become mandatory precedents on lower courts this effectively means that once a judge especially of a higher court has made a decision that decision effectively becomes law binding on any future rulings on similar cases looked at through the prism of societal norms and values it then becomes obvious why the ruling by the panel of judges in the privy council was profoundly significant it is the only way to build the trust in the judiciary because in places like the usa and parts of europe where the judges have taken up the task of legislation the courts have become extremely politicised in the us for example because of the ideological differences between the republicans and the democrats the appointment of judges is a hotly contested affair various interest groups literally fight to have friendly judges appointed into strategic positions in the judiciary ostensibly to advance their agenda through appropriate rulings this is unfortunate because judges are supposed to be politically non partisan and expected to maintain the highest levels of objectivity in hearing and determining cases yet when one gets into office with personal biases and external expectations as to how they should decide cases that come before them then it all becomes a travesty of justice
berkshire is investing in quality dividend stocks and taking what the market gives it inflation is on the minds of investors policymakers and everyday americans we can feel it at the pump at the grocery store the post office and even the barbershop since inflation is higher than the rate of economic growth the real gross domestic product for the first quarter of 2022 decreased by 1 4 year over year if we get another negative reading for the second quarter the u s economy will officially be in a recession both warren buffett and charlie munger spoke about inflation at berkshire hathaway s brk a 0 59 brk b 0 74 annual shareholders meeting on saturday here s what the longtime chairman and vice chairman said and how they re positioning berkshire to ride out the storm an unavoidable consequence buffett and munger both spoke negatively about the state of the economy due to inflation and how it is largely a result of loose fiscal and monetary policy this policy artificially inflated demand and effectively caused a supply demand imbalance the cure for which was rising prices to try and lower demand and now the remedy seems to be raising interest rates to try and reduce demand we are seeing an unleashing of the fact that we just mailed a lot of money one way or another said buffett however buffett and munger view inflation as a necessary consequence to get the u s out of what could have been a covid 19 induced depression we ve had a lot of inflation and it was almost impossible not to have it if you re going give out the kind of money we gave out and it s probably a good thing we did it in fact i think at one point when the federal reserve was creating the money if they hadn t done it our lives would be worse a whole lot worse now that was an important decision said buffett in another exchange munger said it happened on a scale this time that we ve never seen before those checks are just mailed out to everybody who claimed to have a business and claimed to have employees they probably drowned the country in money for a while and as you say they probably had to do it in my book jay powell is a hero buffett responded it s very simple he did what he had to do find value wherever it s available one way of growing wealth during inflationary times is looking for opportunities that aren t otherwise available the trick is having plenty of experience looking for those opportunities in other economic conditions too we depend on mispriced businesses through mechanisms where we aren t responsible for the mispricing of them buffett said buffett surprised investors when he disclosed a roughly 9 5 stake in activision blizzard the stake is worth about 6 2 billion as of friday s close buffett owned about 1 billion of activision before microsoft announced it would acquire it for 95 a share buffett then increased berkshire s position as a classic arbitrage opportunity under the assumption that microsoft is a reliable buyer and would come through on the deal that arbitrage opportunity is sizable considering activision blizzard s stock is currently 75 60 per share buffet s activision blizzard play is merely an old school way of finding value in a challenging market however regular investors should probably steer clear of these kinds of investments as the deal isn t based on fundamentals and could fall through you don t want to end up owning a company you don t understand and didn t really want in the first place so what can you do learn from buffett s actions it s all good and well to say that inflation is unavoidable but the real question many investors are probably wondering about is how to position their portfolios for prolonged inflation first off it s important to remember that economic cycles are simply par for the course in a long investing career whether inflation is the cause of a sell off or not is secondary the bigger takeaway is that a bear market can create life changing wealth for investors in companies with bright futures positive cash flows and durable balance sheets what berkshire is showing through its actions is an increased buying appetite that we haven t seen in years which indicates berkshire is finding value mainly in the energy sector in less than a year oil and gas went from a minor allocation to a major one berkshire s chevron holding has pole vaulted to its third largest position while occidental petroleum has been a top 10 holding since berkshire increased its stake in february and march berkshire also took a stake in hp this year and its acquisition of insurer alleghany shows its classic value stock bent chevron is known for its industry leading balance sheet and a low cost of production that allows it to reach breakeven free cash flow even when oil is in the low 40s per barrel meanwhile occidental petroleum is a much more aggressive spender and has a higher breakeven than chevron but its relatively high capital expenditures have paid off now that oil and gas prices are at eight year highs meanwhile berkshire s other major positions are in diversified large companies like apple and coca cola which is one of the most recession resistant and reliable sources of passive income on the market treading carefully in a challenging market all told buffett s actions show that berkshire is finding value in the market more value than it has found in years but that berkshire isn t just buying the dip on any company it is selectively buying companies that are contributors to inflation upstream producers like occidental or have relatively reliable cash flows and inexpensive valuations like chevron and hp for investors who don t manage billions of dollars in assets sticking with unstoppable stocks you ll want in your corner if the market crashes can be a great way to rest easy at night and endure the gauntlet of a bear market

uncertainty is high but that doesn t mean it s time to panic berkshire hathaway s brk a 0 59 brk b 0 74 2022 shareholder meeting had the usual mix of wisdom and laughs but it also had a deep sense of seriousness given the economic challenges that are affecting the world now that the meeting is done here are chairman warren buffett and vice chairman charlie munger s top takeaways on where the market stands and where we could go from here the importance of security the war in ukraine has cast a new spotlight on supply chains and resource security through agriculture and energy in particular berkshire has increased its stake in energy stocks such as chevron and occidental petroleum which comes on top of the company s 91 ownership of berkshire hathaway energy buffett highlighted the importance of land farms real estate and other productive assets that have tangible value especially during times of inflation and geopolitical risk america is blessed in that it produces upwards of 11 million barrels per day of oil and is one of the world s largest producers of natural gas and exporters of liquefied natural gas yet buffett and munger acknowledge that energy and commodity markets are riddled with speculation right now aside from a discussion on commodities buffett discussed the importance of security for berkshire investors both in knowing that their money is being invested in a responsible way and that the company will carry on even after he is gone i would say that the future for a long time is about as assured as you can have in the world buffett said we don t have an answer for the nuclear bomb or anything but we have a culture that a has worked and b has the shares and the shareholders that will carry it a long way finally berkshire discussed the growing importance of cybersecurity especially on mission critical assets berkshire hathaway energy in particular operates several assets from regulated utilities to pipelines that if hacked could be a security risk not just to berkshire s businesses but to the security of the nation buffett and his team view cybersecurity as a growing investment and something that they can try and fight directly unlike the threat of nuclear assault welcome to the gambling parlor an ongoing theme for several berkshire annual meetings has been the heightened volatility and impulsive nature of markets last year buffett s annual meeting came right after the peak of meme stock mania and special purpose acquisition companies which buffett and munger heavily criticized this year berkshire witnessed firsthand the rapid fire nature of markets when you re able to gobble up 14 of occidental petroleum stock with ease over the course of two weeks you re not buying from investors buffett said i find it incredible you wouldn t be able to do that with berkshire if you want to buy 14 of the company it will take you a long long time companies have become poker chips the s p 500 doubled between 2019 and the end of 2021 a remarkable return given the state of the economy due to covid 19 buffett and munger believe that a lot of the fuel that powered that raging bull market came from speculative practices by wall street and retail investors the market has been extraordinary said buffett sometimes it s quite investment oriented and other times it s almost totally a casino it s a gambling parlor and that existed to an extraordinary degree in the last couple of years encouraged by wall street the money is in turning over stocks wall street makes money one way or another catching the crumbs that fall off the table of capitalism munger used the rise and fall of robinhood markets hood 4 34 as the embodiment of this phenomenon it s so easy to overdo a good idea said munger that s what s going on now you have a lot of good ideas that are being grossly overdone look what happened to robinhood from its peak to its trough wasn t that pretty obvious that something like that was going to happen robinhood when it came out and went public and all the short term gambling and big commissions and hidden kickbacks and so on it and so on it was disgusting but now it s unraveling god is getting just short term uncertainty amid wry jokes sharp wit and admissions of countless mistakes buffett was as usual open about berkshire s inability to time markets at the last meeting he joked about his fumbling of berkshire s investment in airline stocks this year he discussed the short term uncertainty of the increasingly volatile market the interesting thing is obviously we haven t the faintest idea what the stock market is going to do when it opens on monday said buffett we never have we spent a big percentage of our net worth at a very dumb time i shouldn t say we i should say i we have not been good at timing we ve been reasonably good at figuring out when we were getting enough for our money reasonably good is an understatement seeing as berkshire s compound annual growth rate from 1965 to the end of 2021 was 20 1 versus 10 5 for the s p 500 with dividends reinvested the best lesson of all if warren buffett one of the greatest investors of all time is simply focusing on what he can control and navigating what he can t control as well as possible then individual investors could do well to follow in his footsteps the old saying is that the stock market is a staircase up and an elevator down meaning that bull markets can rock you to sleep with a slow and steady uptrend only to be abruptly turned down by an accelerating bear market yet it s the qualities of patience and temperament and as buffett says sanity that separate legendary investors from average ones buffett often says it doesn t take a genius to be a good investor rather discipline and a long term mindset are better tools than simply looking for market beating stocks

according to uk judges laws should be made by parliament a few weeks back i wondered in this space whether the courts possess a legislative mandate the concern stemmed from a growing trend in many democracies including kenya where courts have adopted the practice of interpreting the constitution or applying the law in a manner that sets fundamentally new legal direction in critical matters in some situations such interpretations and rulings seem to alter or go against the expressed values and ethos of the people the question therefore is whether such precedent setting interpretations should not be taken to the people either directly in a referendum or through their elected representatives in parliament interestingly as if in response to my wonder a privy council judge lady arden of heswall england just about a month ago on 25 march 2022 argued that the task of making laws belongs to parliaments and not the courts the learned judge was speaking as a distinguished guest of the grand court in cayman islands a self governing british overseas territory in the western caribbean sea in her lecture titled taking stock of recent jurisprudence of the judicial committee of the privy council lady arden warned that if the courts were allowed to make legislation the law could become a judge s plaything which could result in undermining the will of parliament and of the people the import of this is huge especially coming from the privy council the privy council is regarded as the final court of appeal throughout england and wales and several overseas territories its primary role is to hear complex cases on issues of how the law across each jurisdiction is to be interpreted by providing an objective review of cases lady arden had been part of a panel of uk judges siting in the privy council who ruled last month that cayman s constitution does not provide a right for same sex marriage however in the recent lecture she reasoned that a same sex marriage law was still a possibility for the cayman islands so long as it was brought about by the legislature and not by a judge as she argued it is for legislators not judges to create laws granted in most cases courts do not go out of their way to create laws however two factors have contributed significantly to this trend of judicial law making first is a trend generally known as judicial activism judges with particular social personations take up controversial cases and make rulings in line with their worldviews often to perpetuate an agenda once such rulings have been made the second factor kicks in precedent according to the principle of precedence a court decision automatically becomes an example or authority for judges deciding similar issues later furthermore in some jurisdictions decisions of higher courts become mandatory precedents on lower courts this effectively means that once a judge especially of a higher court has made a decision that decision effectively becomes law binding on any future rulings on similar cases looked at through the prism of societal norms and values it then becomes obvious why the ruling by the panel of judges in the privy council was profoundly significant it is the only way to build the trust in the judiciary because in places like the usa and parts of europe where the judges have taken up the task of legislation the courts have become extremely politicised in the us for example because of the ideological differences between the republicans and the democrats the appointment of judges is a hotly contested affair various interest groups literally fight to have friendly judges appointed into strategic positions in the judiciary ostensibly to advance their agenda through appropriate rulings this is unfortunate because judges are supposed to be politically non partisan and expected to maintain the highest levels of objectivity in hearing and determining cases yet when one gets into office with personal biases and external expectations as to how they should decide cases that come before them then it all becomes a travesty of justice

sacramento calif lorenzo johnson has a batman watch and a methamphetamine addiction he has a pair of vans and a schizophrenia diagnosis a prison record and a niece named jameelah jones who lives alongside him here in a small patch of shared squalor at 56 johnson has no home he wants one he and his niece jones sleep in a tent on a shoulder of 16th street in the river district where migrants once settled after their long walk from the dust bowl to work in the salmon canneries along the sacramento river those with nowhere else to go still end up on its streets advertisement more people than ever have congregated in the open spaces here johnson s camp comprises about a dozen tents many teeming with rats the rodents scrounge for loose food like the lentils and beans he warmed over an open fire one recent morning for himself and his neighbors jones has been in and out of prison for much of her life too not long ago she had a steady job as an accountant she earned a degree behind bars that vanished when the pandemic began so did her apartment which burned in a fire about the same time she has been living on this road ever since in a routine defined by small searches and permissions like the allowance she received from the warehouse owners across the street to fill a bucket each morning at an outdoor tap so she johnson and her niece can wash this is a pandemic of homelessness you see said jones who is 44 and wears a mask resembling a lion s mouth against a virus she is terrified of contracting we need shelter we need housing i ve just never seen so many families with children on the streets and i ve lived here my whole life here in the political capital of blue state america even the homeless cannot believe how many homeless there are the despair and frustration here mirrors how much of the state as well as many major cities across the coastal west are feeling about the worsening humanitarian crisis of homelessness for years democratic governments in california have tried to solve the problem by helping finance affordable housing in some of the most expensive real estate markets in the nation the issue has been stubbornly resistant to the billions spent on resolving it but there is something happening here where two major california rivers converge currents placing democrats of various shades of blue against each other one approach is being promoted by the state and local governments which want to focus more resources on the mentally ill the most visible and defining characteristic of the crisis another is being advocated by business leaders neighborhood groups and angry voters who have watched the expanding homeless population fill in the city s public spaces and now want local officials to force people to accept housing getting them off the streets those who decline an offer of an available bed of which there are none now would no longer be allowed to live on the street the proposal highly popular with the public will come before voters in november behind each is the idea of creating a new definable responsibility from local governments viewed as largely ineffective in confronting the issue even elected officials say it is time to hold themselves to account in new ways after a year when an average of more than three homeless residents died on the streets of sacramento county each week from my vantage point when it comes to the compassion around homelessness it can be impractical compassion or it can be practical compassion said sacramento city council member jeff harris a former building contractor who took office eight years ago the homeless count in sacramento was about 1 200 people at that time and it has grown exponentially since then harris s district which includes the small camp along 16th street where johnson and jones live is home to about half of the city s homeless i m getting real heartburn with how far left things are swinging because of this impractical compassion said harris a democrat who favors a more aggressive city approach to tent clearing and to criminals who prey on the homeless and other residents people are not paying attention to the signs on the street about what s really going on down here homelessness braids together drug addiction exorbitant housing prices a history of high prison populations and a legacy of broken promises to the mentally ill in short the most pressing social policy concerns confronting the nation s most populous state a quarter of the country s homeless population about 160 000 people lives in california here in sacramento the last homeless census conducted in 2019 before the pandemic s onset showed 5 570 people countywide did not have a permanent place to live the number could be twice that today according to advocates for the homeless and city officials and more than a third suffer from addiction or mental illness there are fewer than 3 000 year round emergency shelter beds in the city nearly all of them filled each night so the crisis sits largely on display in roadside camps in the shade of the tree branch canopies of popular parks and in smaller single tent setups across the capital among those who lived downtown was melinda davis 57 who died earlier this month along with five others after being fatally shot in what police say was probably a gang related gunfight davis sweet and popular often slept in a florist s doorway at the same time a pair of gruesome crimes allegedly committed by homeless residents has shifted some public sympathy toward fear across the community in september a 51 year old homeless man named troy davis allegedly broke into the downtown home of mary kate tibbitts and killed her and her two dogs molly and jenny tibbitts 61 had lived in land park a high demand neighborhood of young families spanish and mediterranean style homes and brewpubs for nearly a decade davis has been charged with murder and assault with intent to commit rape among other counts he has a long criminal record and officials have said a methamphetamine addiction it s incredible to me when you look at how many times he was in the system and clearly the system didn t help said council member katie valenzuela a democratic socialist who represents the district where tibbitts lived maybe we could have stopped this by recognizing early on that he had every symptom every sign that something like this might happen with him we did nothing to address it until someone was murdered so i think this is just a systems failure on every level then earlier this year the body of 20 year old emma roark was found along the american river parkway a magnetically popular lush 32 mile trail system that connects downtown sacramento with the city of folsom and beyond roark who family members said was autistic and frequently spent time photographing along the riverside was sexually assaulted and killed a 37 year old man named mikilo rawls who camped along the river has been charged with the crime he also has a criminal history the violence from homeless camps has shaken residents here and across the state in a statewide survey conducted last month by the public policy institute of california 64 of respondents said homelessness was a big problem where they lived including an even higher percentage among democrats more than 8 in 10 respondents said they were at least somewhat concerned by the homeless in their communities it has also shoved the sacramento city council into action just days after the downtown shooting that killed melinda davis the council voted by a wide majority to place a measure on the november ballot that would require the city to provide emergency shelter on a tight timeline for 60 of the city s homeless population failing to do so would expose the city to legal liability a foundation for lawsuits from homeless residents and civic groups alike those most opposed to the idea fear it could bankrupt the city or at least force the local government to find three to four times the amount of money it currently spends on homeless issues within months if the measure passes and the city meets its goals law enforcement would be allowed to clear homeless camps on public land but only after residents are offered and refuse an available shelter bed a 2018 federal appeals court ruling now prohibits cities from enforcing anti camping measures on public property if not enough beds are available to accommodate those without shelter homeless advocates say the proposed measure still would run afoul of that ruling made in the case of martin v boise and only push homeless residents with a wide variety of needs from one place to another bob erlenbusch executive director of the sacramento regional coalition to end homelessness said we understand the frustrations of the neighborhood associations and the business community since we are equally frustrated at the lack of urgency by the city and county to enter into a partnership to responsibly address the crisis of homelessness and lack of affordable housing in our community but this proposal moves us significantly backwards he said and only will serve to make our unhoused neighbors more invisible than they are already but its supporters and even the measure s critics say there are many argue that more government accountability and a sharp tack in approach is needed to change the situation on the ground clearly the population has expanded much faster than our response but how is doing nothing different now in any way compassionate said amanda blackwood chief executive of the sacramento metropolitan chamber of commerce a major supporter of the ballot measure blackwood said surveys of her 2 000 business members have shown that public safety is their chief concern a finding consistent over recent years philosophies aside we have 10 000 human beings without homes blackwood said what are we going to do about that what will we do to make sure another 200 homeless people won t die again this year for years democratic policy ideas on homelessness have cross pollinated here between a liberal local government and the liberal state capitol in its midst the mayor of this policy petri dish knows both the legislature and city hall well at 62 darrell steinberg has been an influential liberal voice in california politics for decades he was president of the state senate before his 2016 election to run this city which gives its mayor few powers beyond a vote on the city council and a prominent pulpit last year steinberg followed up on an idea he first suggested in a 2019 newspaper column that called for the state to guarantee a right to shelter for all state residents what made steinberg s a first in the nation idea and distinct from new york city s right to shelter law was that he also proposed requiring homeless residents to accept shelter beds if they are available many advocates for the homeless were sharply critical of the must accept mandate but the state legislature took up the idea the following year and approved a bill guaranteeing a right to housing in some form for all californians as the pandemic gained strength democratic gov gavin newsom vetoed the legislation calling the principle laudable but fearing the expense of building sufficient housing to meet sharply rising demand and the potential legal liability that a new right would create the estimated annual cost of the bill was 10 billion steinberg proposed something similar in december but he lost the council vote in the angry aftermath over a city led effort to clear a parking site used by the homeless at commerce circle in the river district the city towed more than 160 recreational vehicles and cars used by homeless residents as shelter after repeated complaints from nearby businesses my point was that i m fine with you moving people who are a nuisance to other places steinberg said in a recent office interview a framed cartoon portraying him as a don quixote tilting at windmills during his time in the senate on the wall behind him i m not fine with moving people who are simply impoverished unless you have a genuine alternative steinberg has other ideas too a few months ago he began discussing the idea of guaranteeing a right to mental health to all city residents the homeless population primary in his mind the state s modern history on the issue has been uneven beginning with a 1967 measure that closed large state mental institutions and ended the forced commitment of the mentally ill into care the lanterman petris short act signed by then gov ronald reagan r was also meant to channel money to closer to home mental health treatment centers a model that never fully emerged since then nearly every attempt to strengthen the state s hand in compelling the mentally ill into care has walked a narrow line on civil rights grounds legislation designed to give the state and courts greater powers have had to be so watered down that it has proved largely ineffective since the defeat of his right to housing resolution steinberg has considered bringing a right to mental health proposal before the council this year he believes such a measure would in effect force a guaranteed right to housing since treatment cannot be effective unless the patient has a home opening one door leads to the other door he said i don t really care where we start my fundamental point again is no matter how you do it the law must require us to help the neediest among us a few blocks away from the mayor s office the state s top leaders have also focused on mental illness as key to addressing one of the most intractable aspects of homelessness newsom appears headed to a relatively easy reelection in november after fending off an attempt to recall him last year his budget plans to spend nearly 14 billion to address the homeless crisis over the next two years a roughly fivefold increase from the previous one in a sign in part of his political vulnerability on the issue much of that will fund ways to increase the state s affordable housing stock but it is his plan to create a new legal process to compel the mentally ill into treatment that has steinberg s attention the idea known as care courts would be to create a new branch within the civil court system where those suffering from the most severe mental illnesses could be brought before a judge rather than face forced commitment or punishment they would receive a treatment plan those with the legal right to bring someone before the court would also expand to include not just first responders and medical clinicians but also outreach workers and immediate family members the proposal has generated significant opposition already from civil rights groups and some medical associations concerns focused on what has been described as the coercive nature of the process and the very real possibility that no housing will be available to those who enter care jason elliott a senior counselor to the governor said the proposal is not another form of conservatorship or forced hospitalization in conception the care court idea is designed to prevent the need for criminal courts or a conservatorship process from starting against those suffering from severe mental illness those who appear before care courts elliott estimated that 7 000 to 12 000 californians probably would qualify would have their cases reviewed regularly by a civil court judge an estimated cost has yet to be given but elliott said new administrative expenses within the court system would be significant this is our proposal to address the most heartbreaking element of the homeless problem in california elliott said these are people who seem completely unable to help themselves and you know californians probably are familiar with this feeling you re feeling a little bit afraid right but you re also feeling heartbroken and holding those two feelings in your heart at the same time can be confusing a curving line of tents runs along the sacramento river the state s largest as it flows slowly through the city there are 61 tents in all fenced in from the riverside and from the roadside this is the miller regional park safe ground a city sanctioned site to temporarily house the homeless there are showers and case managers one to a resident and a sense of safety that many tucked away in the tents have not known for many years belongings shoes bikes coolers are stacked neatly outside a few of the tents in all the safe ground encompasses 80 parking spaces and costs the city 2 million a year to run as small as it is even this line of tents was hard to create sitting on the edge of the business district but still far from sight the city operates three such camps and each is in the council district of valenzuela who has championed them since winning office in 2020 as temporary steps toward permanent housing valenzuela paid a political price for her outspoken safe ground advocacy and appearance of favoring homeless rights over the public safety concerns of the neighborhoods in her downtown district a recall campaign is taking shape against her even though she is not even at the halfway point of her term while people are scared and want action on this crisis they don t like the solutions much better in some cases than the problem said valenzuela 35 and that i don t really know what to do with valenzuela was one of only two council members who opposed placing the homeless housing measure on the november ballot arguing that without sufficient new housing the homeless would simply be forced to move into other public spaces or into unsuitable shelters a risk especially for women the measure s supporters acknowledge the challenge but they also argue that nothing else has worked we have not had the difficult but necessary conversations in our communities about what it s going to take to address this correctly because it is true that there are no overnight solutions said daniel conway a political strategist and the face of sacramentans for safe and clean streets and parks the group behind the ballot measure there s got to be near term trade offs for any kind of long term solutions he continued but you know californians we don t trust our politicians we trust ourselves that s why we love going to the ballot a sacramento resident and father of four conway is a prominent democrat the former chief of staff to kevin johnson a close ally of then president barack obama who served as the democratic mayor here just before steinberg in 2020 a group called the la alliance for human rights filed suit against the city of los angeles demanding on civil rights grounds that it take action to house its rising homeless population conway was the group s chief strategist the landmark suit drafted by a former los angeles city attorney was settled in negotiations earlier this month the agreement requires the city to provide shelter for 60 percent of its homeless residents now numbering more than 66 000 people in each council district over the next five years before the settlement conway had filed papers here for a ballot measure that called for a higher housing target and a tighter timeline enough shelter to accommodate 75 of sacramento s homeless population within 60 days more than 20 000 sacramento voters had already signed the petitions half the number needed then he changed course and proposed similar terms to the los angeles settlement the council voted earlier this month to accept the offer and in return for the lower housing requirement agreed to place the measure on the november ballot making the costly process of signature gathering no longer necessary conway said the measure would still require the city to act within 90 days to provide the first new batch of shelter beds a timeline homeless advocates predict will simply lead to a series of sanctioned tent camps in public parking lots across the city not permanent housing we re going to have to build shelters in many places in order to get up to scale conway said but the trade off is you get public spaces back and i think that s what this initiative does in a legally binding way that has not been done before the american river drains the sierra nevada snowpack to the east and as it bends around this city to join the sacramento a large park lines its banks stony dredge sites from early 20th century gold mining operations mark the banks in places chinook salmon swim in these waters beavers and deer herons and snakes live in and around its shores this is the public land many sacramentans want back the american river parkway is a wonderland of urban park planning a network of paved and dirt trails boat ramps and rest stops fish hatcheries and marshland as many as 8 million people use it each year several times the number who visit yosemite national park the sacramento skyline is visible in the near distance about 2 000 people also call it home among them is raymond caldwell who has either been homeless or in prison for much of his 58 years grand theft auto drug possession the list goes on he says he and his miniature pinscher chase are sitting in a patch of sun his bicycle nearby he fixes bikes for pocket money he has been helped into housing in the past most recently a room at a nearby comfort inn paid for by state project roomkey funds that help the homeless take a step toward permanent housing it was cool it was my own place he said but i didn t follow many of the rules so he is here after being kicked out amid the cottonwoods the willows and oaks the wild turkeys and the many other people who sleep in thickening camps under the natural green canopy this is out of sight out of mind said dianna poggetto executive director of the american river parkway foundation which oversees its programs promotion and much of its upkeep this has been particularly difficult work as homelessness here as expanded and since february when emma roark s body was found within its boundaries public fear has grown in march 2021 a coordinated volunteer cleanup effort filled seven dump trucks with trash a total of three tons in three hours safe needle disposal boxes regularly overflow the contents at times sticking cleanup volunteers hundreds of fires mostly small ones break out along its length each year from the camps a bill introduced earlier this month at the capitol would make it easier for local governments to clear parks such as this one if not for county maintenance and foundation volunteers we d be standing in a landfill poggetto said why would you want to see one of the great amenities of sacramento destroyed caldwell sun wrinkled after many years outside simply likes the peace of the place he has a long history of post traumatic stress disorder from years in some of the state s maximum security prisons he isn t particularly interested in living inside i mean i don t like being told i can t have visitors or told i can only see people in some dormitory visiting room caldwell said i ve been out here so long it doesn t matter if it gets cold and dark right now i d put on my blankets and sleep there is a wall that serves as the backdrop to a small fountain in the middle of the loaves fishes campus here scores of names have been etched into the stone these are former homeless clients of the largest homeless nonprofit in the city all of whom have died there are the names of a mother and son monica and richard henderson who perished on the streets 15 years apart generational homelessness is alive and well said joe smith the nonprofit s advocacy director we can see it on the wall smith s past is there too the name of a 53 year old woman named teri anderson is inscribed on the wall she is the mother of smith s daughter born when smith himself was a struggling homeless alcoholic searching for help smith said he emerged from his homeless life more than a decade ago during a moment of declining health a hepatitis c diagnosis and a flash of clarity that he was able to turn into a place to get sober a place to live and a job those services were available then much less so now given the demand it s so important to capture that moment said smith a grave yet gracious 53 year old the responsiveness of the system is essential right now that responsiveness doesn t exist there is housing being built around the river district that may be able to accommodate some of the newly homeless those who fell out of work and then homes during the pandemic and need few other services but shelter but smith said it is nowhere near enough probably leaving loaves fishes as a chief provider of homeless services unless the local government can find the money to meet its goals under the ballot measure you see how hard it is to get even these small safe ground sites done he said it s like pulling teeth around the corner and down 16th street lorenzo johnson and jameelah jones who wash and eat at loaves fishes occasionally pass the morning with neighbors at a camp that could be among those cleared depending on the outcome of the ballot measure one of their neighbors is james crofton who traverses the camp in a wheelchair with a novice s unsteadiness in early february after a cold streak crofton had his feet amputated just above the ankles because of frostbite several of his fingers are still blackened dead of all feeling but pain born in chico crofton grew up with two parents during the early part of his life a mother who worked as a registered nurse until she died of leukemia at 37 and a father who died three decades later in a car accident he has spent 20 years in prison in and out of some of the most notorious in the state including san quentin soledad and folsom at 51 he does not know where his five children are today he is not searching for them either that s not what i want to do he said through a thick beard i don t want to be a burden crofton probably would be spared from any future city camp clearing along 16th street because he said he would happily accept an offer of housing so would several of his neighbors cooking eating laughing and yelling at their dogs in the slanting sun on the side of the road as morning turned into afternoon but crofton said it s never happened like that copyright c 2022 the

warren buffett lambasted wall street at berkshire hathaway s annual meeting on saturday telling investors that the market encourages risky behavior in the stock market that turns it into a gambling parlor buffett 91 criticized investment banks and brokerages to a crowd of tens of thousands of investors at his annual shareholder meeting at omaha arena saying that wall street makes a lot more money when people are gambling than when they re investing it s much better to have somebody that s going to trade 20 times a day and get all excited about it just like pulling the handle on the slot machine he said you may not say you d want that person but that s where you make the money the degree to which the market got dominated by that is showing wall street makes money one way or another catching the crumbs that fall off the table of capitalism he said they don t make money unless people do things and they get a piece of them large american companies have become poker chips for market speculation he said citing an increase in call options and said brokers make more money off bets than simple investments but amid that environment he said his company berkshire hathaway seized an opportunity spending more than 50 billion on stocks in the first quarter of 2022 warren buffett 91 pictured criticized investment banks and brokerages to a crowd of tens of thousands of investors at his annual shareholder meeting at omaha arena saying that wall street makes a lot more money when people are gambling than when they re investing charlie munger 98 berkshire s vice chairman and buffett s longtime partner called the current market a mania of speculation two men take a break on a bench during the berkshire hathaway 2022 annual shareholders meeting weekend at the chi health center in omaha people line up for the berkshire hathaway 2022 annual shareholders meeting weekend outside the chi health center in omaha that s why markets do crazy things and occasionally berkshire gets a chance to do something he said occasionally berkshire gets a chance to do something and it s not because we re smart it s because we re sane berkshire revealed in its earnings report saturday morning that its mountain of cash shrank to 106 billion in the first quarter from 147 billion at the beginning of the year as buffett invested 51 billion in stocks and repurchased 3 2 billion of its own shares but after buffett told shareholders in his annual letter on february 26 that he was having trouble finding anything to buy at attractive prices he said deals began revealing themselves over the next three weeks buffett revealed saturday that he has made a big bet on microsoft s planned acquisition of activision blizzard he said a couple months after one of berkshire s other investment managers bought roughly 15 million activision shares he increased that stake to roughly 9 5 of the company or about 74 million shares after microsoft announced the deal in january because activision stock was selling for less than the 95 per share deal price a warren buffett rubber duck is available during the berkshire hathaway 2022 annual shareholders meeting weekend at the chi health center in omaha special see s candies boxes are available during the berkshire hathaway 2022 annual shareholders meeting weekend at the chi health center in omaha the business magnate also allocated 7 billion toward shares of occidental petroleum in the first half of march grabbing 14 percent of the oil producer s total shares he also revealed that he boosted berkshire s stake in oil giant chevron to 26 billion up from 4 5 billion at the beginning of the year making it one of the conglomerate s largest four investments edward jones analyst jim shanahan said that with the chevron and occidental investments combined berkshire now has more than 40 billion invested in the oil sector even before saturday it was clear buffett was on the hunt because he agreed to buy the alleghany insurance conglomerate for 11 6 billion and made another multibillion dollar investment in hp inc buffett said saturday that he also bought three german stocks but didn t name them charlie munger 98 berkshire s vice chairman and buffett s longtime partner called it a mania of speculation we have people who know nothing about stocks being advised by stock brokers who know even less munger said it s an incredible crazy situation i don t think any wise country would want this outcome why would you want you country s stock to trade on a casino both buffett and munger reiterated their past criticisms of cryptocurrencies like bitcoin because they don t produce anything munger said cryptocurrencies are stupid because they re likely to go to zero and evil because they undermine the federal reserve plus he said they make american leaders seem foolish for not banning them like china did share prices were boosted to record highs during the pandemic as retailers flooded into the stock market last year meme stocks on reddit forums fueled the calamity further but the market has flipped on its head this year putting many at home traders at a loss the nasdaq composite is down more than 23 percent from last year s high after a downturn in april warren buffett has long been critical of investment bankers and firms calling them money shufflers and saying that they encourage mergers and spinoffs to make a profit rather than improving companies a truck with rotating images protesting over the ongoing contract negotiations for bnsf railway union workers drives past people lining up for the berkshire hathaway 2022 annual shareholders meeting outside the chi health center in omaha on saturday people line up for the berkshire hathaway 2022 annual shareholders meeting weekend outside the

chi health center garrett northwall 11 of nashville tennessee watches a model train and trolley during the berkshire hathaway 2022 annual shareholders meeting weekend he also said during the shareholder s meeting that the company would always be cash rich in times of need he said it would be better than the banks at giving companies loans and credit lines was that a banker screaming buffett joked as an audience member made an inaudible comment buffett also assured his investors that the berkshire hathaway would endure long after he was gone berkshire is built to forever there is no finish point buffett said the new management and the management after them and after them are just custodians of a culture that s embedded investor harris kupperman who leads the praetorian capital hedge fund said he s not especially worried about the berkshire s future because the eclectic conglomerate has a solid foundation he built it as well as he could build it nobody is ever going to be him that s obvious kupperman said he said perhaps buffett s eventual successor will be able to reevaluate some long term berkshire investments that buffett has held for decades and decide whether it still makes sense to hang onto things like the company s huge coca cola stake even though berkshire is led by aging buffett and munger investors didn t ask much about succession planning perhaps because buffett said a year ago that vice chairman greg abel who oversees all of the company s non insurance businesses now will eventually replace him as ceo berkshire also has two other investment managers who will take over the company s portfolio people line up to get inside the berkshire hathaway 2022 annual shareholders meeting weekend at the chi health center in omaha nestor riano of roseville minn gets his photo taken near a welcome sign during the berkshire hathaway 2022 annual shareholders meeting weekend but buffett s and munger s ages are always in the back of berkshire investors minds because there may not be too many more meetings with both of them munger sat in a wheelchair during saturday s meeting actuarially i don t know how much longer they ll be able to do this said josu elejabarrieta 43 of miami who was attending his first meeting earlier saturday berkshire said its first quarter earnings fell more than 53 on a large swing in the paper value of its investments berkshire said it earned 5 46 billion or 3 702 per class a share during the quarter that s down from 11 7 billion or 7 638 per class a share a year ago buffett says that berkshire s operating earnings are a better measure of the company s performance because they exclude investment gains and losses by that measure berkshire s earnings remained steady at 7 04 billion or 4 773 84 per class a share up from 7 018 billion or 4 577 10 per class a share a year ago the four analysts surveyed by factset expected berkshire to report operating earnings of 4 277 66 per class a share in

these stocks have plenty of fuel to pay their dividends in the coming years the energy industry has had its ups and downs in recent years because of that it hasn t always been the best place to go for those looking for a sustainable passive income stream however the midstream segment of the energy market has done a much better job of delivering steady dividends because of that investors seeking income should take a closer look at this part of the oil patch three midstream companies that stand out as excellent options are enterprise products partners epd 1 86 enbridge enb 1 26 and kinder morgan kmi 0 88 paying you well while delivering power to the world reuben gregg brewer enterprise products partners master limited partnership mlp enterprise products partners is one of the largest owners of energy infrastructure in north america its pipelines storage processing and transportation assets help to move oil and natural gas around the country and the world it is a vital cog in the energy industry machine what s notable here is that most of enterprise s assets are fee based that means the mlp gets paid based on the use of its assets often volatile commodity prices aren t that big a deal here so more conservative types looking at the energy space can sleep a bit easier at night as for the environmental social and governance esg zeitgeist that is pushing the world to limit the use of carbon fuels well it s a great idea but one that will take decades to implement not days months or even years meanwhile income focused investors can collect enterprise s fat 7 1 distribution yield and that payment has been increased annually for 23 consecutive years it was covered by distributable cash flow by a huge 1 7 times in the fourth quarter of 2021 and is backed by an investment grade rated balance sheet that should be enough to entice even the most conservative income investors aboard more than two decades of dividend increases and counting neha chamaria enbridge enbridge is one of the top energy dividend stocks you can rely on for some passive income flow year after year the stock doesn t just yield a hefty 6 2 but supports it with dividend growth enbridge has increased dividends every year for the past 27 consecutive years and its dividend per share has grown at an impressive compound annual growth rate of 13 since 2008 you d be stunned to see how much that dividend growth has contributed to the total returns shareholders in enbridge have earned over the years enb data by ycharts so what is it that makes enbridge s dividends so reliable the answer a large energy infrastructure business a strong balance sheet and commitment to shareholders enbridge transports nearly 30 of all crude oil produced in north america and 20 of all natural gas consumed in the u s and it does so primarily under long term fee based contracts which is why enbridge s cash flows are sustainable even in a low oil and gas price environment that also explains why the company can pay steady and higher dividends year after year enbridge has a project pipeline worth nearly 10 billion canadian dollars through 2025 which should boost its distributable cash flows and support higher dividends with the company prioritizing financial fortitude and shareholder returns investors in enbridge can simply sit back and expect to earn solid passive income for years to come a gas powered passive income stream matt dilallo kinder morgan kinder morgan has worked hard over the years to put its high yield dividend on a more sustainable foundation one of the biggest changes has been to live within its cash flow the natural gas pipeline company expects to generate 4 7 billion in cash this year that s enough to cover its 2 4 billion dividend outlay and 1 3 billion expansion budget with nearly 900 million to spare this excess cash will give it the financial flexibility to further shore up its solid balance sheet pursue additional growth opportunities and opportunistically repurchase shares kinder morgan is starting to see new expansion opportunities emerge fueled by higher oil and gas prices and the impact russia s invasion of ukraine is having on the global gas market the company is currently evaluating market demand for a potential expansion of one of its natural gas pipelines in the permian basin if there s enough demand it could finish that project by the end of next year the incremental cash flow from the expansion would provide further support for the dividend meanwhile kinder morgan launched a new energy venture unit last year to pursue low carbon investment opportunities it s currently building several renewable natural gas plants the company is looking for other investment opportunities that could fuel future growth the company also has a strong balance sheet giving it the additional financial flexibility to make acquisitions as the right opportunities emerge it could enhance its natural gas infrastructure operations or make further inroads into lower carbon fuels kinder morgan s legacy pipeline operations should continue to generate steady cash flow in the coming years add in the growth from expansion projects and investments and the company should have the fuel to steadily increase its high yield dividend that makes it an excellent option for investors seeking a sustainable passive income stream
during a recent appearance on the after the bell podcast wwe superstar and former three time aew tnt champion cody rhodes spoke about his grand return to wwe at wrestlemania 38 which included the american nightmare sharing how nwa worlds champion matt cardona was very supportive of his decision to come back after leaving in 2016 rhodes explained that he assumed cardona would advise against a return but the pendulum swung the other way he said a very small circle of people when this initially was brought to me knew and i told him everything every detail everything and i was really legitimately expecting him to go don t do it don t and man he went completely the opposite way he was of your train of thought corey of that s the ultimate undeniable come back and land in the fashion that you did and he inadvertently set all of this in motion i really thought he was going to say go the other way but man no he was gung ho rhodes also revealed that wwe hall of famer diamond dallas page was a little hesitant about his decision but ddp would play an instrumental part in guiding rhodes back i think there was one person that was concerned and that was ddp he came over to my house and downstairs we have the nightmare bar he came down there and i just got one of these bartesians where you get the instant cocktails and i was really excited to show him the light margaritas and he drank all the ones that i had in stock and over the course of the six or seven margaritas he kept slamming down he was just really tensive he brought up a good point the last time i did something major leaving the wwe he was of the same thought process well if you believe if you re confident than i ll be confident with you and confident for you and he gave me some tips on people to speak to and people to let things know before it all went down he was the only one who was a little bit more fatherly and like okay let s make sure this is really what you want and not just a knee jerk thing for the most part everyone who knew in that very small circle was like absolutely go do it absolutely which surprised me rhodes has mentioned many times in the past that his wrestling window is small he compared himself to seth rollins before laying out his goals for his wwe return 35 42 is historically men s wrestlers prime i was a slow learner seth rollins is a much faster learner than me he got to the mountain top quicker i genuinely felt that there wasn t a better wrestler in the world than me and i know people who qualified it a hundred different ways work rate promos charisma they get into all these categories to me wrestling is about a discussion pro wrestlers create a discussion week to week are you talking about this guy or that girl are you interested in seeing this match all that aside 35 42 is the wrestler s prime so i didn t want to lock myself out because hey i didn t get the big one i wanted when i was there last time frankly i wasn t ready or prepared i wasn t doing the work to get it now this has been presented as an opportunity to go for it to try and i didn t want to lock myself out age wise i could be doing this till i m 50 like my brother who s doing this still at a high level but i don t think for me i ll be able to have the ability to do it beyond this 35 45 window and the reason i say that is because i started at 20 and i was a bad guy my whole carer so all i did was fall down take bumps i was on the wwe schedule friday saturday sunday monday tuesday sometimes that makes you go from 35 to 65 real quick so that s in my mind and i want to do it while i m the best and i absolutely am i want to do it when i m at the top of my game h t wrestling inc

community garden had been discussed previously but was never brought to fruition ott recently took over for former director del gast who also worked extensively with the lead program partnering with osage students for projects such as the new pickleball court and disc golf course ott has been great working with the girls molitor said swenson and neal approached ott earlier this year with their proposal we thought it was a great idea ott said they had a good plan in place he stated the most difficult part for park and rec would be maintenance of the garden which the lead students worked into their proposal they will keep ott in the loop as planning continues they made it easy for us ott said all we had to do was find a location for them ott provided site options for the garden and the girls chose wisely according to ott the location works well because it is in a section of harmony park with powerlines stretching above where trees cannot be planted therefore the spot gets plenty of sunlight the garden will be situated near the intersection of chestnut street and 1st street currently there are only yellow flags as boundary markers in the grass the unusually cold spring has delayed work he gets things done neal said of ott we just had to wait for the frost to clear neal hoped for groundbreaking later that week park and rec will soon till the garden in preparation for planting molitor interacts directly with ott about the project he s excited about it molitor said he knows it s going to be a good thing for the community he s a young man who works hard and is willing to try new things he wants to continue the park and rec and lead relationship to help our kids gain skills and to help the community greenhouse because it was a horticultural project swenson and neal also worked with osage ag ffa instructor malayne meyer who oversees the greenhouse lunch program she s a good asset swenson said she gave them a chance to learn how to create it how to sustain it and to understand what seeds to plant molitor said of meyer we gave them ideas and helped them brainstorm we want them to be the lead of their own projects the girls got a head start in early march planting their crops in the osage greenhouse meyer advised them what to pick from the available seed stock the girls chose lettuce salad mix hot peppers tomatoes carrots zucchini spinach sweet onions and sugar snap peas to name a few future residents of the community garden sugar snap peas are our problem child but also our pride and joy neal said swenson s mother tends a family garden and swenson has sought advice from her as well once swenson and neal leave for college they will pass the community garden to the next generation of lead students hopefully they ll take care of it and love it as much as we do neal said it ll be cool to be able to look at the garden and say we created that ourselves from start to finish said swenson it is extremely rewarding for molitor to watch her students take ownership in a myriad of ways from pickleball to pickles to help the community it builds their toolbox she said osage english instructor katerina walk also teaches a lead section she offers speech classes to her students as high schoolers are still learning social skills reaching out to people is such a good skill to have molitor added we give them real world experiences so they re ready for the next chapter in their lives it makes them less afraid to try things in the future according to molitor there are not only class credits that students must take to graduate but also real world credits that do not show up on a grade card but are just as necessary the lead teachers evaluate the students on universal constructs like creativity productivity and accountability it s something employers need molitor said a lot of times they don t care what you know about their business they want to know you re a hard worker a good communicator a good collaborator someone who s going to show up and be accountable and productive when you re there legacy the community has already become involved with the garden swenson and neal recently received donations thanks in part to a sign inside the front door of the osage public library requesting seeds plants funding and tools both swenson and neal will graduate in may but they will continue their work through the summer the ultimate goal is passing the trowel to the next class who will tend the garden one way lead has grown is simply in the number of students willing to get their hands dirty but for swenson and neal the time is now both of them are hard workers molitor said of swenson and neal they want to make sure they make a difference lauren and natalie are good at coming up with ideas they re good at collaborating together they re both very organized and detail oriented because of her schedule swenson is short on time and only able to take one section of lead molitor holds briefs with the busy girls discussing their work and timeline for the community garden molitor said most students have two class periods every day to work on their projects swenson and neal spend much of their time in the greenhouse they get a lot of hands on opportunity not only to speak with people but to take the steps necessary to create the garden molitor said it gives them a chance to consider how to help the community and do something to provide a legacy
berkshire is investing in quality dividend stocks and taking what the market gives it inflation is on the minds of investors policymakers and everyday americans we can feel it at the pump at the grocery store the post office and even the barbershop since inflation is higher than the rate of economic growth the real gross domestic product for the first quarter of 2022 decreased by 1 4 year over year if we get another negative reading for the second quarter the u s economy will officially be in a recession both warren buffett and charlie munger spoke about inflation at berkshire hathaway s brk a 0 59 brk b 0 74 annual shareholders meeting on saturday here s what the longtime chairman and vice chairman said and how they re positioning berkshire to ride out the storm an unavoidable consequence buffett and munger both spoke negatively about the state of the economy due to inflation and how it is largely a result of loose fiscal and monetary policy this policy artificially inflated demand and effectively caused a supply demand imbalance the cure for which was rising prices to try and lower demand and now the remedy seems to be raising interest rates to try and reduce demand we are seeing an unleashing of the fact that we just mailed a lot of money one way or another said buffett however buffett and munger view inflation as a necessary consequence to get the u s out of what could have been a covid 19 induced depression we ve had a lot of inflation and it was almost impossible not to have it if you re going give out the kind of money we gave out and it s probably a good thing we did it in fact i think at one point when the federal reserve was creating the money if they hadn t done it our lives would be worse a whole lot worse now that was an important decision said buffett in another exchange munger said it happened on a scale this time that we ve never seen before those checks are just mailed out to everybody who claimed to have a business and claimed to have employees they probably drowned the country in money for a while and as you say they probably had to do it in my book jay powell is a hero buffett responded it s very simple he did what he had to do find value wherever it s available one way of growing wealth during inflationary times is looking for opportunities that aren t otherwise available the trick is having plenty of experience looking for those opportunities in other economic conditions too we depend on mispriced businesses through mechanisms where we aren t responsible for the mispricing of them buffett said buffett surprised investors when he disclosed a roughly 9 5 stake in activision blizzard the stake is worth about 6 2 billion as of friday s close buffett owned about 1 billion of activision before microsoft announced it would acquire it for 95 a share buffett then increased berkshire s position as a classic arbitrage opportunity under the assumption that microsoft is a reliable buyer and would come through on the deal that arbitrage opportunity is sizable considering activision blizzard s stock is currently 75 60 per share buffet s activision blizzard play is merely an old school way of finding value in a challenging market however regular investors should probably steer clear of these kinds of investments as the deal isn t based on fundamentals and could fall through you don t want to end up owning a company you don t understand and didn t really want in the first place so what can you do learn from buffett s actions it s all good and well to say that inflation is unavoidable but the real question many investors are probably wondering about is how to position their portfolios for prolonged inflation first off it s important to remember that economic cycles are simply par for the course in a long investing career whether inflation is the cause of a sell off or not is secondary the bigger takeaway is that a bear market can create life changing wealth for investors in companies with bright futures positive cash flows and durable balance sheets what berkshire is showing through its actions is an increased buying appetite that we haven t seen in years which indicates berkshire is finding value mainly in the energy sector in less than a year oil and gas went from a minor allocation to a major one berkshire s chevron holding has pole vaulted to its third largest position while occidental petroleum has been a top 10 holding since berkshire increased its stake in february and march berkshire also took a stake in hp this year and its acquisition of insurer alleghany shows its classic value stock bent chevron is known for its industry leading balance sheet and a low cost of production that allows it to reach breakeven free cash flow even when oil is in the low 40s per barrel meanwhile occidental petroleum is a much more aggressive spender and has a higher breakeven than chevron but its relatively high capital expenditures have paid off now that oil and gas prices are at eight year highs meanwhile berkshire s other major positions are in diversified large companies like apple and coca cola which is one of the most recession resistant and reliable sources of passive income on the market treading carefully in a challenging market all told buffett s actions show that berkshire is finding value in the market more value than it has found in years but that berkshire isn t just buying the dip on any company it is selectively buying companies that are contributors to inflation upstream producers like occidental or have relatively reliable cash flows and inexpensive valuations like chevron and hp for investors who don t manage billions of dollars in assets sticking with unstoppable stocks you ll want in your corner if the market crashes can be a great way to rest easy at night and endure the gauntlet of a bear market

uncertainty is high but that doesn t mean it s time to panic berkshire hathaway s brk a 0 59 brk b 0 74 2022 shareholder meeting had the usual mix of wisdom and laughs but it also had a deep sense of seriousness given the economic challenges that are affecting the world now that the meeting is done here are chairman warren buffett and vice chairman charlie munger s top takeaways on where the market stands and where we could go from here the importance of security the war in ukraine has cast a new spotlight on supply chains and resource security through agriculture and energy in particular berkshire has increased its stake in energy stocks such as chevron and occidental petroleum which comes on top of the company s 91 ownership of berkshire hathaway energy buffett highlighted the importance of land farms real estate and other productive assets that have tangible value especially during times of inflation and geopolitical risk america is blessed in that it produces upwards of 11 million barrels per day of oil and is one of the world s largest producers of natural gas and exporters of liquefied natural gas yet buffett and munger acknowledge that energy and commodity markets are riddled with speculation right now aside from a discussion on commodities buffett discussed the importance of security for berkshire investors both in knowing that their money is being invested in a responsible way and that the company will carry on even after he is gone i would say that the future for a long time is about as assured as you can have in the world buffett said we don t have an answer for the nuclear bomb or anything but we have a culture that a has worked and b has the shares and the shareholders that will carry it a long way finally berkshire discussed the growing importance of cybersecurity especially on mission critical assets berkshire hathaway energy in particular operates several assets from regulated utilities to pipelines that if hacked could be a security risk not just to berkshire s businesses but to the security of the nation buffett and his team view cybersecurity as a growing investment and something that they can try and fight directly unlike the threat of nuclear assault welcome to the gambling parlor an ongoing theme for several berkshire annual meetings has been the heightened volatility and impulsive nature of markets last year buffett s annual meeting came right after the peak of meme stock mania and special purpose acquisition companies which buffett and munger heavily criticized this year berkshire witnessed firsthand the rapid fire nature of markets when you re able to gobble up 14 of occidental petroleum stock with ease over the course of two weeks you re not buying from investors buffett said i find it incredible you wouldn t be able to do that with berkshire if you want to buy 14 of the company it will take you a long long time companies have become poker chips the s p 500 doubled between 2019 and the end of 2021 a remarkable return given the state of the economy due to covid 19 buffett and munger believe that a lot of the fuel that powered that raging bull market came from speculative practices by wall street and retail investors the market has been extraordinary said buffett sometimes it s quite investment oriented and other times it s almost totally a casino it s a gambling parlor and that existed to an extraordinary degree in the last couple of years encouraged by wall street the money is in turning over stocks wall street makes money one way or another catching the crumbs that fall off the table of capitalism munger used the rise and fall of robinhood markets hood 4 34 as the embodiment of this phenomenon it s so easy to overdo a good idea said munger that s what s going on now you have a lot of good ideas that are being grossly overdone look what happened to robinhood from its peak to its trough wasn t that pretty obvious that something like that was going to happen robinhood when it came out and went public and all the short term gambling and big commissions and hidden kickbacks and so on it and so on it was disgusting but now it s unraveling god is getting just short term uncertainty amid wry jokes sharp wit and admissions of countless mistakes buffett was as usual open about berkshire s inability to time markets at the last meeting he joked about his fumbling of berkshire s investment in airline stocks this year he discussed the short term uncertainty of the increasingly volatile market the interesting thing is obviously we haven t the faintest idea what the stock market is going to do when it opens on monday said buffett we never have we spent a big percentage of our net worth at a very dumb time i shouldn t say we i should say i we have not been good at timing we ve been reasonably good at figuring out when we were getting enough for our money reasonably good is an understatement seeing as berkshire s compound annual growth rate from 1965 to the end of 2021 was 20 1 versus 10 5 for the s p 500 with dividends reinvested the best lesson of all if warren buffett one of the greatest investors of all time is simply focusing on what he can control and navigating what he can t control as well as possible then individual investors could do well to follow in his footsteps the old saying is that the stock market is a staircase up and an elevator down meaning that bull markets can rock you to sleep with a slow and steady uptrend only to be abruptly turned down by an accelerating bear market yet it s the qualities of patience and temperament and as buffett says sanity that separate legendary investors from average ones buffett often says it doesn t take a genius to be a good investor rather discipline and a long term mindset are better tools than simply looking for market beating stocks

from birch gold group this week your news to know rounds up the latest top stories involving gold and the overall economy stories include always expect the fed to mess up 2 175 as the next target and palladium during the russia ukraine crisis buy gold says analyst because the fed can be expected to mess up keith mccullough founder and ceo of hedgeye risk management says that the economy is heading towards something they label a quad 4 a state of emergency warranting government intervention a quad 4 means disappointing growth and inflation year after year mccullough expects growth and inflation to slow causing a period of major earnings losses in the stock market and that s all due to the fed s too little too late approach to inflation if you go back to june 2020 when we started making the call that inflation was going to accelerate it wasn t until 12 to 18 months later that the fed realized it wasn t transitory they re playing catch up the fed always screws up their policy is too tight too late to mccullough it s a matter of when the federal reserve will start pulling back on its hiking cycle essentially throwing in the towel on its battle against inflation recessionary risk has already been priced into the markets even though we ve only seen a single quarter point rate hike so far if the fed sticks to their plan of six or seven more rate increases recession will become reality but mccullough predicts an early end to the fed s efforts this dovish turn by the fed says mccullough will signal an economic recovery before that happens though we ll likely see more suffering since a stock market crash happens every time the fed tightens during a quad 4 mccullough s firm are forecasting a minimum 20 downturn in equities how bad could it get mccullough says the longer the fed stays vigilant tightening into a slowdown the faster stock prices fall you re going to really deflate asset prices how much could asset prices deflate from a historical standpoint

only safe haven investments mccullough thinks are suitable to ride out the crash ahead bank of america gold could hit 2 175 this year silver 30 in a tuesday report bank of america analysts said gold s recent price movements are a bullish development bank of america analysts believe 2 175 is a reachable target in a worse case scenario gold will hit 2 078 instead a run to either 2 078 or 2 175 should mean plenty of opportunity bank of america recommends buying gold at 1 940 or below for maximum benefit the team is in general very bullish on gold as well as silver against traditional safe haven treasury bonds and other commodities gold vs copper and gold vs silver look like they are forming bottoms in favor of gold outperforming this summer they just need one break higher to confirm gold vs

previous 3 000 high in doing so then a pullback then back to 2 400 then down then to 2 500 to avoid feeling the burden as if having to time the market long term palladium investors should simply remember to keep a long term view like gold palladium isn t a make a quick buck investment it like other precious metals is a long term investment meant to shield one from both crises and wealth erosion its wide industrial use obviously gives it greater upside however and that upside has been coming to prominence recently what exactly is palladium for palladium is a vital component of pollution control devices for cars and vans its use is on the rise as governments especially the chinese government tighten regulations to combat car pollution it is also used as an alloying agent for jewelry making and in dentistry the metal is also used to make surgical instruments electrical contacts musical instruments transverse flute and watches the organization of petroleum exporting countries or opec says there is no replacing russia as a supplier commerzbank strategist daniel pressman said russia accounts for 38 of global palladium production since other regions cannot compensate for supply cuts the market risks falling into a huge supply shortfall palladium is in many ways doing what silver believers would have liked the second most popular metal to but the industrial element for better or for worse always adds one or more unexpected twists to the mix instead of waiting for lower priced entry points novice and returning palladium investors should rejoice that they are seeing just how crucial palladium has become in the modern world

strategies with managed futures and macro funds at the top the only two strategies with meaningfully positive returns however the return numbers were different even though eurekahedge is owned by with

by charles hugh smith on of two minds the awakening of inflation after decades of slumber has triggered a flurry of comparisons to the 1970s accompanied by a chorus of projections for 1970s type stagflation defined as inflation plus economic stagnation limited or negative growth and high unemployment a less popular comparison is with the 1920s a massive expansion of debt an equally massive speculative bubble in assets and extreme wealth income inequality all against a backdrop of slowing growth and debt saturation each of these eras shares certain characteristics with the present but beneath the surface there are consequential systemic differences let s start with the 1970s the oil shock that fueled inflation had two sources 1 the oil exporting nations took control of their hydrocarbon resources and repriced them in the context of 2 declining reserves and production in the west particularly the u s which had been the saudi arabia of the world through the 1930s 40s and 50s a second much less understood dynamic was the immense investment required to clean up the u s industrial base pollution in the u s was out of control by the early 1970s with toxic rivers catching fire and high levels of air pollution the oil shock prompted federal regulations on pollution and improvements in the basic efficiency of appliances vehicles etc this was a major sea change for the entire industrial sector and it required immense investments of capital and a painful learning curve this diversion of capital depressed profits and acted as an economy wide tax on the system in today s money the overall cost of this transition was in the trillions of dollars the debt levels in the 1970s were by today s standards absurdly modest the cultural values of frugality and avoidance of debt still held and there was resistance to heavy public private borrowing that has completely vanished the demographics of the 1970s was also completely different from today the 65 million strong baby boom generation was entering the workforce and starting families and enterprises the demographic double whammy was the mass entry of women into the workforce as opportunities and ambitions expanded meanwhile the energy picture was brightening under the radar as the development of newly discovered super giant oil fields in alaska the north sea and africa began it took many years to bring these new hydrocarbon sources online but by the mid 1980s the price of oil had fallen to lows that slashed the income of oil exporting nations including the soviet union we are primarily funded by readers please subscribe and donate to support us none of these conditions are present today much of america s domestic production was offshored in the past 20 years the demographics are no longer as favorable soaring population of elderly and flatlined workforce and the production from the super giant fields brought online in the 1970s is declining there are no new super giant fields in the global pipeline to replace those in the depletion phase of declining production as for the 1920s the parallels are debt saturation and speculative excess against a backdrop of an economy that feasted on debt fueled spending and speculation while absorbing new technologies the differences are the u s still had immense natural resources and relatively limited infrastructure in the 1920a while private debt was through the roof 100 in a stock market account leveraged 900 in stock purchases due to the 10 cash margin requirement federal debt was still modest compared to modern levels this set the stage for massive expansions of federal debt in world war ii that funded sustained investments in infrastructure through the 1940s 50s and 60s in the present we have all the fragilities of the 1920s and few of the strengths we have all the debt saturation and speculative bubble excesses but our resources have been heavily tapped and every sector of the economy is heavily indebted all of these similarities and differences are setting up a sea change revaluation of capital resources and labor that will be on the same scale as the tumultuous transformations of the 1920s and 1970s we re in uncharted territory more on these revaluations next week a small collection of stocks 5 a share or less check out the 4 penny stocks that our analyst says could be a portfolio saver these stocks are trading for 5 a share or less and could be a game changer for investors looking for unique diversity in today s rocky market get the names ticker symbols here

a bipartisan contingent of lawmakers is pressing to give car dealerships relief from bigger tax bills they could face due to global microchip shortages that have pinched the supply of new vehicles rep dan kildee d michigan is leading the charge to deliver relief to dealerships and working to attach his bill with rep jodey c arrington r texas to a bigger package that can get it to president joe biden s desk in the coming months kildee a member of the tax writing ways and means committee and house democrats whip team said in an interview that he hopes it will be added to a package aimed at boosting u s semiconductor manufacturing and competitiveness with china that measure is in conference negotiations to resolve differences between house and senate passed bills kildee a member of that conference committee said his proposal is both a tax and trade issue and should be germane to the broader competitiveness package it s a bill and an issue that fits very neatly in that subject he said if that doesn t work kildee plans to look for the next possible legislative vehicle including a potential year end tax package that could address expiring tax policy and a range of other outstanding tax issues the issue facing auto dealerships stems from an unexpected plunge in inventory because of the covid 19 pandemic auto groups say the global health crisis caused factories to close and reduced the supply of computer chips critical for producing cars and trucks among numerous other consumer goods without the chips needed to power safety features dashboard displays and more auto plants have shut down or slowed production and left car dealerships with emptier lots lifo concerns dealerships tend to use an accounting method called last in first out for their inventories which allows them to consider the latest cars purchased for their lots as the first sold lifo accounting is a time honored method employed by numerous industries reliant on large inventories from oil refiners to grocers to wine and beer distributors it s meant to smooth out the effects of inflation by providing bigger deductions for the cost of goods sold when higher prices kick in conversely price drops will saddle companies with lesser deductions when inventory drops sharply businesses like car dealers can see taxable income balloon because they re stuck with slimmer cost of goods sold deductions based on lower priced vehicles acquired earlier for dealerships such sharp drops in inventory typically only occur when unloading product quickly with the intention of selling or winding down the business under current law the treasury department can offer relief in these situations if inventory falls due to an embargo boycott or other major foreign trade interruption typically the relief would allow three years for businesses to build their inventory back up and decide what portion of goods to attribute to each tax year in effect that would allow car dealerships to catch up on their inventory purchases and avoid a bigger tax bill once supply improves but treasury thus far has declined the industry s plea despite backing from kildee and more than 90 fellow lawmakers in a november letter treasury determined they don t have that authority under current law according to kildee and the national automobile dealers association an industry trade group that s pressing for relief a spokesperson for treasury declined to comment in a january letter to treasury the nada cited correspondence from the department arguing businesses that primarily produce or source inventory from within the u s aren t eligible for relief treasury also questioned whether dealerships can demonstrate their inventory declines were directly and primarily due to foreign supply chain disruptions according to the industry group the dealers association argued the statute and legislative history say nothing about where inventories are produced or sourced and that they ve clearly established the connection to foreign trade disruptions kildee s bill would make treasury implement the change by law sidestepping the need for administrative action under the legislation anyone who deals in new motor vehicles including cars buses trucks boats farm machinery and equipment and other vehicles and uses lifo accounting would be allowed through 2025 to replenish their inventory and in the meantime avoid recognizing any income for the 2020 or 2021 tax years related to falling stock life and death issue kildee said the pandemic and related chips shortage has caused a unique challenge for dealerships that he s witnessed at home in flint mich he said thousands of trucks manufactured in his district are sitting in parking lots and open fields while they await chips so they can be sent to dealerships and sold the issue could be life and death for some dealerships kildee said and was never congress intent the federal government never anticipated that they would have a windfall from car dealerships as a result of the pandemic and so you know we clearly need to act he said kildee s bill has nine democratic co sponsors and seven republicans signed on including arrington a fellow ways and means member other co sponsors include those who own car dealerships themselves including ways and means gop rep mike kelly of pennsylvania and roger williams r texas virginia rep donald s beyer jr a ways and means democrat whose family owns dealerships across northern virginia is another co sponsor another ways and means member rep carol miller r west virginia isn t on the bill but signed kildee s november letter her husband owns a string of dealerships across west virginia and one in charlotte n c a companion senate bill to kildee s is also in the works senate banking chairman sherrod brown d ohio is planning to introduce legislation his office confirmed brown also led letters to treasury urging them to grant car dealerships relief including a february letter with senate finance chair ron wyden of oregon and 18 other senate democrats finance committee member sen tim scott of south carolina led 32 senate republicans in their own letter pressing for relief for dealerships from the biden administration alongside the auto dealers group the biggest u s trade association for automakers the alliance for automotive innovation is also pushing for relief the group represents companies that produce 99 percent of cars and light trucks sold in the u s and says new vehicles can contain up to 3 000 microchips the organization s data shows month end inventory of light vehicles began to decline in early 2021 and stayed far below 2019 and 2020 levels throughout most of the year other groups are also weighing in on the issue cnh industrial a london based manufacturer of farming and construction vehicles reported lobbying on kildee s bill in the first quarter of 2022 the association of equipment manufacturers a milwaukee based advocate for construction and agriculture equipment makers disclosed lobbying on the topic too in a letter to kildee and arrington last week the american institute of cpas a member group for accountants announced its endorsement of their measure the group is among kildee s top donors this cycle according to opensecrets org while it has bipartisan backing kildee said challenges to getting his bill over the finish line include the complexity and relative obscurity of the issue at hand which he s working to explain to colleagues there s also congress busy to do list in the coming months the number of sort of issues competing for the limited oxygen in the room is also an issue he said i mean we ve got a lot going on and that makes it more difficult 2022 cq roll call inc all rights reserved distributed by tribune content agency

it is hard for governments and businesses to come to terms with this they have spent years if not decades building their china strategies and getting used to the idea that china s market and power warts and all is the future and unstoppable it is true that high levels of integration are hard to disentangle but this thinking could turn out to be as flawed as the one that led our politicians astray in the 1990s and 2000 and that is before considering the significance and consequence of china s two most recent shocks its zero covid policy and the russian invasion of ukraine china is the biggest or nearly the biggest trade partner for about 120 countries across all continents it is the hub of global supply chains hoovers up copious quantities of copper iron ore oil and other raw materials from perth to peru and has acted as a magnet for foreign manufacturing financial and other service producing companies captivated by china s market size or committed to it as the ideal place to make or assemble manufacturing technology and financial products it is certainly a technology leader in many but by no means all branches of science and engineering the world s dependency on china is legendary production of a lot of lower value goods such as toys and textiles has moved to the likes of vietnam and bangladesh but china still supplies the west with clothing footwear sporting equipment cooking and home appliances and furniture we also rely on china for some so called rare earth elements the minerals used in mobile phones and for electric vehicles batteries solar energy equipment smartphones tablets tvs computers and other office equipment as our experiences of covid demonstrated china also supplies large quantities of pharmaceutical and medical equipment antibiotics and prescription drugs the us china relationship is one of the most complex and interdependent in the world the value of their engagement is more than 2 trillion bilateral trade in goods and services runs at a bit more than 700bn a year the stock of us investment in china is a little shy of 150bn while china s in the us is about 60bn china s government holds over 1 trillion of us financial assets in its currency reserves of more than 3 trillion and probably more as some assets are held in offshore financial centres or outsourced to private foreign managers bank loans have financed china s belt and road accounting for the bulk of the 1 trillion or so of loans and projects that have accumulated since 2013 the lending has actually dried up since 2018 but china is still eager to develop what it calls the digital and health silk roads where it wants to be the go to place for public health goods and services and communications and technological equipment and standards dependency is of course a two way street and china s dependency on the rest of the world is similarly high it needs the 1 5 trillion of annual bilateral trade that it does every year with the us and europe it needs the foreign firms in china that supply high technology goods and expertise aerospace equipment and parts and extensive know how it wants foreign financial firms to supply wealth management and investment banking expertise it remains highly dependent on imported technology especially microchips on which it spends more than it does on crude oil with a closed financial sector capital controls and a managed currency china still needs global capital markets to be open and to invest the proceeds of its trade surpluses which seem destined to endure breaking up is not so hard to do you could be forgiven for thinking that so much dependency working both ways would be hard to disentangle and it is yet it would be a mistake to think that high levels of integration cannot be undone by politics as indeed our predecessors learned at great cost after 1914 today the political drive to decouple or disengage has become much stronger businesses have continued to prosper in china until recently at least and have adapted to the chinese communist party s idiosyncrasies even as xi s china turned more authoritarian and controlling but from about 2020 there has been much greater edge to beijing s policies not only in support of already prominent state enterprise and government involvement in the economy but also in measures designed to bring private firms and entrepreneurs to heel financial and regulatory punishment of the tech giant alibaba and a blizzard of regulation affecting data finance and technology platforms have soured the industrial mood as the government piles pressure on private firms to align their activities with the party s social and political goals and objectives corporate angst and business uncertainty have become more evident in the wake of the crackdown on hong kong that started in 2019 and the deterioration in relations following both the outbreak of the covid pandemic in 2020 and revelations about the incarceration of uighur muslims in xinjiang province where chinese oppression has even sparked claims of genocide the 2018 focus on trade tariffs has been replaced by an extensive network of export controls greater scrutiny over foreign investment restrictions on who domestic firms can do business with and ultimately sanctions on those who fall foul of the regime some of these have been applied because of hong kong xinjiang and on national security grounds but china has also continued to punish sovereign states and companies with whose policies it disagrees these actions and developments have already begun to compromise firms drawn increasingly into the awkward crosshairs where they have to choose whose rules and laws to flout and whose to follow china s support for the russian invasion of ukraine and more recently the quarantine and lockdown consequences of its zero covid policy have taken these issues and concerns to a new higher level

living standards are set to fall at their fastest rate since records began in the mid 1950s last month the office for budget responsibility predicted that real household incomes will fall by 2 2 this year as energy and food prices increase but wages fail to keep pace with rising bills the impact will not be felt equally for some it will barely register for other families it will mean difficult decisions about what to cut back on for others still it will be profound stretching precarious budgets in which there is already no give forcing impossible choices between essentials such as putting food on the table and keeping the heating on and sharpening the fear of the unexpected outlay that can trigger a debt spiral from which there is no escape one estimate suggests lower income households will face a drop in income of 1 300 this year nadhim zahawi suggested increasing the maximum number of children an early years worker can be responsible for to reduce childcare costs last week the latest thinking from ministers on how to address this crisis in living standards trickled into the headlines after a cabinet brainstorming meeting grant shapps the transport minister proposed moving car mots from once a year to once every 24 months saving a one car household a paltry 23 a year at the risk of jeopardising road safety the education secretary nadhim zahawi suggested increasing the maximum number of children an early years worker can be responsible for in order to modestly reduce the cost of childcare others around the table reportedly suggested unilaterally scrapping tariffs on food imports which would weaken britain s hand in trade negotiations and scrapping government commitments to reduce carbon emissions a move that would create significant long term economic and environmental costs for the uk the shallow suggestions reveal the government s desperation to give voters the impression it is taking action to address these harsh economic circumstances but without spending any money they are not serious policies but fodder for press releases before the local elections britain is experiencing a prolonged economic malaise wages have been mostly stagnant since the financial crisis productivity has barely grown since then and sits 15 below the united states germany and france and external shocks the self inflicted pain of leaving the eu s single market and customs union and the war in ukraine have sent prices rocketing there are no shortcuts to increasing living standards any approach has to be three pronged first economic policy needs to target rising productivity and to ensure the spoils are shared evenly with employees through increased wages particularly for those in low paid work one of the reasons in work poverty rates have risen is that there are too many jobs that simply do not pay enough to enable people particularly those with children to ensure a minimum standard of living that can be achieved only by narrowing the growth gap between london and the south east and the rest of the country it would take at the very minimum a radical rebalancing of government investment in transport infrastructure and skills away from the richest regions of the country which already receive more investment per capita towards the poorest brexit has only made this task harder it is forecast to significantly reduce exports and to increase regional inequalities over the long term second the real terms cuts to benefits and tax credits of the past decade for low income families with children must be reversed in an economy with significant amounts of low paid work there will always be a need for government to redistribute income towards low income parents yet successive conservative chancellors have reduced the value of benefits and tax credits over time with some families losing the equivalent of thousands of pounds a year from their household budgets while delivering expensive income tax cuts that have disproportionately benefited more affluent households this is another key reason why in work poverty rates have increased and why in a country as rich as ours there are people including those in work relying on food banks to feed their children the support that the chancellor rishi sunak has announced to help families with energy bills is too thinly spread including across households for whom it is not critical leaving the poorest families horribly exposed more and more people have little hope of ever buying their own home in an overpriced private rented sector last the government needs to implement structural reforms to tackle the high cost of living the most important of these is housing the costs of which erode too much of people s pay cheques in one fell swoop the uk has never built enough housing without significant public sector investment into social housing yet social housebuilding levels have dropped dramatically since the 1980s leaving the social housing stock to dwindle as a result of demolitions and the right to buy this has pushed more and more people who have little hope of ever buying their own home into an overpriced private rented sector britain urgently needs a programme of public investment in housebuilding to create more affordable homes for rent these are long term economic reforms that require sustained investment even if put in place immediately they will take time to fully deliver for the economy yet this is a government that swings from crisis to crisis with little willing or capacity to plan for the next decade and a dearth of ideas to address britain s very real and structural economic problems this lackadaisical approach will probably consign us to years more of sluggish growth that drives increasing numbers of families with children into poverty

new york indonesia s decision to suspend palm oil exports in the face of domestic shortages has pushed vegetable oil prices to new highs further tightening a market already on edge due to the war in ukraine and global warming the prices of palm soybean european rapeseed and even its canadian gmo counterpart canola oil have reached historic highs following indonesia s announcement on wednesday we already had problems with soybeans in south america with canola in canada said philippe chalmin an economics professor at paris dauphine university in france stating that both crops had been severely affected by extended droughts then came devastation for the sunflowers in ukraine due to russia s destructive invasion he added palm oil is the most consumed vegetable oil in the world and indonesia accounts for 35 percent of global exports according to james fry chairman of lmc consulting firm indonesia s export ban is designed to bring down prices in the country and limit shortages according to authorities but chalmin said the move comes at the worst time the rise in prices dates back to last year already and it is exacerbated by the ukrainian conflict he explained rich nelson of the agricultural market research and trading firm allendale said the industry believes it ll last maybe for one month perhaps two but in the meantime prices are skyrocketing in a market that was already accelerated he said unlike other oilseeds palm fruit does not keep once picked and has to be processed immediately fry said indonesia s palm oil storage system which was already holding substantial reserves is now under further stress fry said even though the price of vegetable oil in addition to multiple other agricultural commodities has been rising for months demand has yet to slow it s difficult to ration demand for food commodities with higher prices said arlan suderman chief commodities economist at stonex financial palm oil which is used heavily in processed food such as instant noodles and baked goods is also present in other consumer products such as personal care items and cosmetics eventually it will trickle down said paul desert cazenave of consulting firm grainbow but it s still too early to measure price increases to consumers in the short term the only oilseed that might be able to provide some relief on the vegetable oil market is the soybean the united states and brazil the world s two top soybean exporters still have available stock even though more shipments from the countries would only have a marginal impact on edible oil prices the united states department of agriculture usda announced last month that it expects soybean acreage to increase more than 4 percent from last year while corn would shrink by a comparable amount the world s top rapeseed exporter canada meanwhile said tuesday that it expected a seven percent decline in acreage devoted to the gmo rapeseeds used in canola oil analysts and economists say they see a need for public policy concerning the food crisis since in addition to food vegetable oils are also widely used in biofuels based on the current crisis we re going to see more pressure on countries to reduce their biodiesel blending mandates and renewable diesel mandates suderman said that s going to take time he warned but that s ultimately where you re going to get your biggest demand destruction europe passed a directive in 2018 excluding palm oil from renewable energy targets by 2030 some of the bloc s countries including france have already stopped using it despite the current turmoil indonesia and malaysia the world s second largest exporter have maintained their respective programs blending palm oil in their biofuels to make matters worse many of the major palm oil importers mainly egypt bangladesh and pakistan have seen their currencies depreciate significantly in recent months said michael zuzolo president of global commodity analytics and consulting some major oilseed exporters such as the united states and brazil have meanwhile experienced the opposite with the dollar reaching multi year highs this is kind of the worst case scenario starting to develop said zuzolo putting importers in a negative feedback loop where they re going to have more and more difficulty keeping supplies ample that s the potential tragedy we re walking ourselves into
alarm bells rang out through india s defense establishment on april 14 2022 as the russian warship moskva was sunk by ukrainian neptune missiles in the name of national security india needed to immediately probe and uncover how one of the world s mightiest naval forces could lose such a prestigious warship more so at the hands of a so called underdog like ukraine furthermore could india face a similar strategic threat from its own underdog neighbor pakistan this was a debacle for russia one that india needs to urgently focus on to dissect and learn from large portions of india s arms and weaponry bear the made in russia seal russia has been india s largest supplier of arms and experts in new delhi would be keenly watching the performance of russian military hardware in the ukrainian conflict pakistan s harba anti ship missile a valid question then arises could india s military assets be susceptible to similar vulnerabilities that we see in the russia ukraine conflict today can india s vulnerabilities be exploited by pakistan whose armory contains a fresh stock of harba anti ship missiles this demands urgent strategic answers india has begun scrutinizing the reasons behind the moskva sinking which will be tabled during the naval commanders conference how was the moskva brought down the sinking of their great warship dented russian morale and tarnished their prestige despite the capture of mariupol city in ukraine on april 22 2022 the first pieces of the puzzle were uncovered shortly a report by economic times claimed that the moskva had anti ship missiles and surface to air missiles but was not equipped with russia s latest generation kalibr cruise missiles or hypersonic missiles indian navy warships are equipped with the best available technology and now carry barak 1 and barak 8 surface to air missiles along with a close in weapons suite ciws to tackle aerial and cruise missile threats india developed the barak missile range in collaboration with israel the understandable danger from an indian perspective is that china and pakistan could foment a two front war on india china has made considerable use of pakistan as its proxy against india stirring an already fiery political and military rivalry given the escalating climate and pakistan s stockpile of anti ship missiles india must derive critical lessons from the sinking of the moskva and aim to fortify its naval fleet according to a report published in defensepost pakistan has developed the harba anti ship missile a non nuclear fire and forget weapon system harba was developed from the babur family of missiles by the state owned global industrial defence solutions the medium range ship launched cruise missile can strike land and sea targets up to 280 kilometers 174 miles away at speeds of up to 988 kilometers per hour 614 mph in all weather conditions it uses a digital scene matching area correlator camera radar and infrared seeker to follow and strike targets in march 2022 pakistan showcased its anti ship cruise missile harba for the first time at the doha international maritime defence exhibition and conference dimdex in qatar the missile was developed for the pakistan navy to create an indigenous anti ship missile solution for its vessels with china helping to arm pakistan s navy to the hilt as reported by eurasian times india meanwhile is working on its defensive strategy to protect its naval fleet in the event of a missile attack recently india launched a ballistic ins dhruv missile in 2021 operated by the national technical research organisation ntro to help deter a missile attack against india india s crucial chaff system india has reportedly devised a technology called the chaff system developed by the defence research development organisation drdo according to reports the indian air force and the navy have tied up with the defence research development organisation for the chaff technology to shield warships and aircraft against missile attacks it is a critical defense technology that is used to protect fighter jets and naval ships from hostile radar threats the significance of this technology lies in the fact that very little quantity of chaff material deployed in the air acts as a decoy to deflect the enemy s missiles and ensures the safety of the fighter aircraft or naval ships chaff creates a metal particle cloud around the jet or the ship and deflects missiles from it using precise satellite data on incoming missiles the chaff system can help to protect indian warships and aircraft from ballistic threats the system releases a cloud of metalized glass or plastic rods that acts as a decoy thereby confusing any incoming missiles and serving as an impact point away from the warship india is hard at work optimizing and deploying this technology within its air and naval fleets nonetheless among the learnings to be had from the moskva sinking speculation is still rife that the us had provided ukraine with precise satellite coordinates which enabled them to bombard the moskvya with missiles unfortunately any weapons defense system would struggle against a torrent of attacks such as this including the powerful russian s 400 therefore india will need to quickly learn from russia s mistakes if it is to be prepared for its impending threats such as this
we offer our weekly macro and technical commentary below ahead of tomorrow s publication of bannockburn s may monthly outlook the week ahead is packed with several central bank meetings and important high frequency economic data the week begins with china s april over the weekend the world s second largest economy is being hit by the lockdowns as part of the policy response to the outbreak of covid however the economic impact seems somewhat milder than when the pandemic first arose in q1 20 and the economy shrank by 10 3 quarter over quarter still more stimulus measures from beijing and the pboc seem likely the reserve bank of australia on may 3 the market s perception of the likelihood of a hike increased markedly after last week s stronger than expected q1 it rose to 5 1 year over year from 3 5 in q4 21 and was above the 4 6 median bloomberg survey forecast the underlying measures quickened to above 3 and more than expected before the inflation report the cash rate futures implied a 1 in 4 chance of a 25 bp hike now there is about a 60 chance of a such a move but a 15 bp move is fully discounted previously the conventional wisdom was that the rba would wait for june after the may 21 elections like other central banks governor lowe emphasized developments in the labor market perhaps the pullback in the 4 2 in april provides extra encouragement but it should not be over emphasized the rba s trade weighted index did pull back after approaching last year s high but it is still relatively firm and near mid march levels almost 6 above the late january low the federal reserve on may 4 a 50 bp hike is a foregone conclusion the fed funds futures market a 50 bp hike not only at this meeting but also at the following three meetings june july and september the federal reserve will also announce its balance sheet roll off strategy the forward guidance has suggested a short ramp up period in june and reaching a maximum of 95 bln a month investors and reporters may have some questions about the bill holdings and if the fed would consider selling some mbs outright to achieve its goals the market has shown a recent pattern by which it reacts one way to the fed s and reverses it during chair powell s the economic highlight is the april employment report at the end of the week the early estimate is for around a 400k gain in under normal circumstances it would be regarded as robust however if the forecast is accurate it would be the smallest increase since last april subject to revisions job growth averaged 562k in q1 22 still and even if average earnings growth slows powell s assessment that the labor market is strong perhaps too strong will not interrupt the fed s expeditious course to neutrality the and norway s meet on may 5 despite some poor economic data including the squeeze on the cost of living that has seen excluding gasoline falling in nine of the past 11 months the market is confident that the boe will deliver its fourth hike in the cycle that began in december that will lift the bank rate to 1 0 the swaps market is looking at another 100 125 bp hikes this year also on may 5 england and wales hold local elections the tories do not appear to be doing well prime minister johnson will come under pressure but a compelling alternative does not jump out now that chancellor sunak s support has waned note that sein fein looks poised to oust the democratic unionist party to lead northern ireland s assembly the norges bank has also lifted rates three times already and the deposit rate stands at 0 75 the underlying rate of which excludes energy and adjusts for tax changes stood at a relatively mild 2 1 in march the has been no match for the dollar but it has appreciated against most of its major trading partners this year the recent weakness is unlikely to be sufficient to spur the norges bank into faster action after hiking last september december and march this year it will likely wait for the june meeting to hike again tokyo s april cpi will be reported at the end of next week tokyo s is reported ahead of the but provides a good economic tell the april report is important because the cut in mobile service prices last april drop out of the 12 month comparison this means that tokyo and by extension japan s consumer price measure will jump the phone charges are thought to be worth around one percentage point and this is what the market is anticipating as a result the headline pace rises to 2 3 from 1 3 and the core rate which excludes fresh food may increase to 1 8 from 0 8 it means that the measure that excludes fresh food and energy will turn positive for the first time since march 2021 however the boj will see through it and the new fiscal measures are projected to reduce consumer inflation by around half of a percentage point in the may september period four other central banks of note meet next week two from south america and two from central europe with next week s hikes and are maybe 1 or 2 hikes away from being done a 100 bp hike in the brazilian selic rate brings it to 12 75 the latest reading puts inflation slightly above 12 year over year the swaps market looks for rates to peak near 13 5 chile s is closer to 9 and its policy rate is 7 the last two hikes january and march were 150 bp each and before that the central bank hiked twice by 125 bp it raised rates by a total of 100 bp in june and july last year the swaps market envisions 155 bp tightening over the next six months for the peak poland and czech central banks have wood to chop with march inflation around 11 and 12 7 poland s has hiked rates at each of the last seven meetings for a total of 440 bp it hiked by 100 bp in april and another hike of that magnitude appears likely the swaps market looks for a peak near 6 next year the czech repo rate is at 5 0 the has also hiked rates at its last seven meetings for 475 bp in total it dialed back its hikes after 125 bp and 100 bp moves last november and december to 75 bp and 50 bp in february and march a 50 bp hike is the most likely scenario the market also looks for the czech rate to peak near 6 next year turning now to the price action in the foreign exchange market despite or because of naysayers it is trading new multi year highs against the and the greenback may begin consolidating the gains that took it to 20 year highs against the yen chinese efforts to slow the yuan s descent appear to have done the trick and broken the strong downside momentum the unusual politburo statement ahead of the weekend and extended holiday is conducive of a consolidation phase after a sharp decline and with signals of policy support forthcoming chinese stocks may draw some new attention the six day rally ended before the weekend with the help of china s allusion to more economic support for the world s second largest economy the modest pullback was only the third decline since march 30 it barely slipped through the previous day s low and was marginally inside the upper bollinger band 103 35 the momentum indicators are stretched but do not appear to rule out a new high it may take a break of the 101 80 102 35 band to signal a correction instead of a flattish consolidation april s nearly 5 net gain is the largest monthly rise since january 2015 euro the euro bounced ahead of the weekend to snap a six day fall that took it from around 1 0850 to almost 1 0470 its lowest level since early 2017 the momentum indicators are over extended but do not appear poised to turn higher yet the squeeze that carried the single currency to almost 1 06 before the weekend was met with new selling and it settled in the middle of the day s range there is more talk about a test on 1 00 parity ahead of it the 2017 low 1 0340 may offer the next target given the sharpness of the euro s decline a move above the 1 0650 1 0700 area is needed to cause the bears any pain japanese yen the boj s signals of its intent to defend the 0 25 cap on the 10 year cap indefinitely broke the dollar out of the pennant or flag formation and sent it to jpy131 25 the boj governor recognized that rapid moves are not helpful for businesses but saw the weaker yen as a net positive force for the economy overall the finance minister s rhetoric is gradually strengthening but intervention ahead of what is expected to be a 50 bp fed hike is highly unlikely ahead of the weekend and with tokyo markets closed for a holiday the dollar found support near jpy129 40 some lighter activity during the holiday period may be conducive for consolidation maybe the lower end of the range may be in the jpy128 60 jpy129 00 area on the other hand a move toward jpy135 would likely coincide with us yields pushing above 3 british pound sterling dropped like a rock too since reaching a high a little shy of 1 31 and reversing lower on april 21 sterling nearly declined seven cents to almost 1 24 on april 28 it has not been lower since july 2020 the six day slide ended before the weekend amid the broader dollar pullback before the bounce sterling had settled five consecutive sessions below the lower bollinger band the macd looks poised to turn higher and appears to be a little ahead of the slow stochastic the next important chart point is around 1 2250 meanwhile the 1 2670 area offers the nearby cap a bout of short covering could lift sterling further ahead of the boe meeting the swaps market has a 25 bp hike fully discounted now and another at the june meeting the market appears nearly evenly divided between a 25 bp and 50 bp move at the august meeting the us dollar has extended its pullback into a third session ahead of the weekend when the dramatic decline in us equities turned it around the greenback s small correction stalled near cad1 2720 the 38 2 retracement of the advance from the april 21 low cad1 2460 the macd and slow stochastic are still rising suggesting a re test of the cad1 2880 cad1 2900 ceiling canada has a solid macroeconomic story but it has been overshadowed by the broad gains for the greenback the unwinding of the commodity currency theme as questions raised over chinese demand and the risk off mood the correlation between changes in the exchange rate and the over the last 30 sessions is about 0 60 which is about twice the inverse correlation with 30 a break of cad1 27 could spur a move into the cad1 2620 cad1 2640 area australian dollar the aussie has fallen out of bed coming into this month it appreciated in seven of the past eight weeks starting with the week ending april 1 it has fallen for five consecutive weeks the latest leg down was brutal after peaking near 0 7460 on april 21 the australian dollar fell by about 5 25 to the low on april 28 by 0 7055 that was the lowest level since early february the pre weekend bounce stalled around 0 7180 it must get above 0 7200 to be meaningful it seems more likely to retest the year s low set in late january near 0 6970 the risk of a deeper decline toward 0 6850 may be growing the macd looks like it can turn higher soon but the slow stochastic may take longer the rba meets and if it does not hike the cash target rate by at least 15 bp the aussie may be vulnerable to a new bout of selling the swaps market has discounted about 245 bp of tightening this year that seems too aggressive and an adjustment could also leave the currency vulnerable when everything is said and done the mexican peso proved itself relatively resilient in april to the greenback s surge the peso fell by about 2 6 in the month less than all the major currencies but the canadian dollar the dollar recouped half of what it lost from the early march high near mxn21 4675 it stalled after reaching almost mxn20 64 the initial pullback found slightly below mxn20 29 this seems like a rather shallow pullback warning of the risk of a new attempt higher next week that said the momentum indicators may be poised to turn lower in the coming days a break of mxn20 20 would undermine the dollar s technical tone the dollar gapped higher against the yuan on april 25 and has not looked back the gap would be particularly significant in a less controlled currency because it appears on the weekly charts the dramatic losses in the euro and yen put downward pressure on the yuan which the pboc says is managed against a trade weighted basket the pboc s 1 cut in required for foreign currency deposits was seen as a tepid protest more a warning the dollar s surge extended to cny6 65 before the politburo s pledge of more economic support which sent it to about cny6 5850 with mainland markets closed for the first three sessions next week cnh will be monitored more closely as typically happens when the yuan falls the falls faster the spread between the two is the largest of the year e g the dollar settled at cny6 6080 and cnh6 6400 consolidation over the next few days may serve nearly everyone s interest arguing backward from the 20th party congress later this year where china s xi is expected to take a third term there must be a desire to provide a good economic backdrop it is partly a function of the covid response and partly a function of the economic stewardship

the face of war by daria marchenko commenter jay sent me the image and suggested it for tonight s post ms marchenko created it back in 2015 after putin s initial invasion of ukraine here s the details on it from the australian broadcasting company aka abc a young ukrainian artist has captured global media attention by creating a striking portrait of russian president vladimir putin out of 5 000 bullet shells collected in the separatist east daria marchenko s the face of war a realistic and politically tinged depiction of mr putin in a dark suit and red tie stands more than two metres tall and dominates the artist s studio apartment sleeping in the same room with him was a bit scary at first but i got used to it the 33 year old artist and graphic designer said the 62 year old russian leader s face changes expression under different light his deep set eyes turning from gloomy to more light hearted marchenko her own right eyebrow pierced and fingers weighed down by heavy metal rings demonstrates by drawing the window curtains and shining a hand held lamp around her work he can be proud confused or serious she said he can look like a person on a soviet poster or he can be superman her story has been covered by britain s top media outlets and major european and australian papers and television channels but the artist has received barely a mention in russia ukraine s giant neighbour where mr putin s approval rating is huge and denial of any involvement in the 16 month conflict is ever present in the state dominated media only russia s popular moskovsky komsomolets broadsheet broke ranks by devoting a two sentence paragraph to marchenko s work last month marchenko has not concealed her deep seated suspicion putin personally instigated a conflict that has killed nearly 7 000 people since breaking out after kiev s ouster of a kremlin backed president when people see his expression change it reveals certain things she said to me this war is different from all others because it is built on a lie buckets and wooden crates filled with bullet cases occupy the centre of the artist s small room her first handful of shells came from her boyfriend an active member of the euromaidan movement that toppled the corruption stained and deeply unpopular president viktor yanukovych and forced him into self imposed russian exile but her art supplies now come from friends fighting across the war zone in eastern ukraine s industrial heartland much more at the link here s today s address by president zelenskyy transcript after the jump unbreakable people of the bravest country today we marked the border guard day it is clear that there can be no celebrations during the war but it is necessary to support ukrainian men and women who defend the state in the ranks of the border guard service since the first days of the war and not only since february 24 but also since 2014 border guards have been bravely defending ukraine they fulfill combat missions they were the first to face the russian invaders at the state border they are under daily shelling they are fighting side by side with the armed forces of ukraine with our national guard with the national police with the territorial defense and all those who stood up for our state in particular they are fighting in mariupol heroically defending our city 340 border guards our heroes i talked to them today congratulated them thanked them i am grateful to everyone whose professional day was today i had the honor to present state awards to border guards who distinguished themselves in the battles for our state the occupiers are accumulating additional forces for new attacks against our military in the east of the country they built up reinforcements in the kharkiv region trying to increase pressure in donbas they have already lost more than 23 000 soldiers in the battles of this senseless war for russia but they do not stop we know that the russian command is preparing for new big losses in those units the personnel of which was almost completely destroyed or significantly weakened in march april new people are being recruited with little motivation with little combat experience they just want to get the right amount so that they can throw these units into the offensive the russian command is well aware that thousands more russian soldiers will be killed and thousands more will be wounded in the coming weeks but why do the russian soldiers themselves need this why do their families need this russian commanders lie to their soldiers saying they will face some serious responsibility for refusing to fight and at the same time they do not tell for example about the preparation by the russian army of additional refrigerators for storing corpses they do not tell what new planned losses the generals expect every russian soldier can still save his life you d better survive in russia than die on our land our defenders have already destroyed more than a thousand russian tanks almost two hundred russian aircraft almost two and a half thousand armored fighting vehicles of course the occupiers still have equipment in stock yes they still have missiles to strike at our territory but this war has already weakened russia so much that they have to plan even fewer military equipment for the parade in moscow we are actively communicating with partners to enhance sanctions on russia for mariupol for all the destroyed cities and communities of ukraine for war crimes against our people for missile and air strikes at the territory of ukraine today the occupiers again fired missiles at the dnipropetrovsk region and odesa again and again russian troops prove that the people of odesa are the same enemies for russia as all other ukrainians the runway of the odesa airport was destroyed we will of course rebuild it but odesa will never forget such a russian attitude towards it we expect a decision on oil restrictions against russia in the near future we insist that a fair part of sanctions against russian oil should be the blocking of any attempts by russia to circumvent restrictions through the sale of so called oil blends if any company or state helps russia trade oil it must also face sanctions any sponsorship in the interests of the russian military terrorist machine must end i spoke today with president of france emmanuel macron on various areas of cooperation between ukraine and france especially on defense also on cooperation on ukraine s path to the european union we are moving towards the political formalization of what is already a fact ukraine has become an integral part of a united europe i also spoke with british prime minister boris johnson on defense support for ukraine and other efforts necessary to end the war i informed boris about the current situation on the battlefield in the areas of active clashes and in detail about the situation in our east in mariupol in the south of the country all the leaders of the free world know what russia has done to mariupol and russia will not go unpunished for this many of the leaders are trying to help save our heroic defenders of the city this was discussed in great detail with the un secretary general during his visit to kyiv we are doing everything to ensure that the evacuation mission from mariupol is carried out i held talks with president of

home a girl says we want to see the sunshine these scenes are from videos shared online in recent days by the azov regiment a unit in the ukrainian military which says they were taken in the mazelike bunkers beneath the sprawling azovstal steel plant in mariupol ukraine russian soldiers control the rest of the city and fighting continues around the plant the plant has become the last refuge for thousands of trapped ukrainian fighters and civilians there is no escape and little chance of rescue the independent journalists who chronicled the siege of mariupol for western news media left a month and a half ago because the security risks were too great the warring parties have stepped in to fill the vacuum of firsthand coverage sharing content from the ground and in azov s case pleading for help to their hundreds of thousands of followers on social media with almost no cellphone service electricity or access to the internet azov s videos provide what could be some of the only glimpses into life at the steel plant early thursday azov fighters said russian forces had bombed a field hospital within the plant reportedly killing wounded soldiers and burying people in the rubble reports of the attack prompted renewed calls from ukrainian officials and the united nations secretary general antónio guterres for a humanitarian corridor to evacuate civilians supplies within the plant are said to be running extremely low it is not a matter of days it s a matter of hours mariupol s mayor vadym boychenko told a news conference on friday if mariupol is hell azovstal is worse russia views capturing the port city as crucial to its aim of securing a land bridge along ukraine s south to connect crimea to the donbas and its forces have been shelling the plant relentlessly the devastation there city officials have said that tens of thousands of residents have been killed stands as one of the largest humanitarian crises of the war we are filming these videos to draw attention to the fact that they are at the plant so that the enemy does not say there are no civilians here capt svyatoslav palamar the deputy commander of the azov regiment based at the factory told the new york times in a text message so that they can be evacuated the times could not independently verify the exact location of the videos but the interiors appear consistent with the design of the plant and a former employee familiar with the premises confirmed that the images seemed to have been created there since april 18 azov has released several videos that focus on civilians who say they are trapped at the plant and feature mostly women and children i want everyone who sees this video to help us create this green corridor to help us leave here said one mother holding her toddler in a video released on april 24 when ukraine was observing orthodox easter safely alive the civilians and the soldiers much more at the link many ask why ukraine wants to evacuate soliders civilians from

olexander scherba olex_scherba april 30 2022 radio free europe radio liberty rfe rl has published a report on the sabotage campaign within russia early in the morning on april 27 a drone crashed in a muddy field southwest of the russian city of kursk around 100 kilometers northeast of the border with ukraine locals tracked down the destroyed device not long after and posted photographs to telegram and other social media the device appeared to be a bayraktar tb2 a versatile turkish designed unmanned aerial vehicle capable of long distance surveillance as well as dropping guided bombs or firing anti tank missiles it wasn t the russians who were flying the drone and that wasn t the only unusual thing that happened in that part of russia that same morning there were also two unexplained explosions at russian military and industrial sites one in kursk and one near voronezh not far to the east nor does it appear to have been russians who flew low altitude attack helicopters in the pre dawn hours of april 1 around the time that a fuel depot exploded less than 50 kilometers from the ukrainian border since february 24 russian forces have laid waste to towns and cities in northern eastern and southern ukraine killing thousands of civilians and forcing millions to flee in a war that prompted the west to punish moscow with sanctions and send massive supplies of military aid and support to kyiv ukrainian forces thwarted an offensive aimed at taking kyiv in the war s early weeks prompting russian troops to withdraw from close to the capital much of the fighting is now focused on the region known as the donbas and other areas in the east and south away from the active battlefronts within ukraine though there s a less bloody less prominent front in the two month old war a shadow campaign that has included attacks on military and industrial targets in russia itself it s not clear how many incidents have occurred or whether they resulted from air strikes or missiles or sabotage an unofficial tally by rfe rl based on open source reporting counts at least a dozen since the war s beginning the preponderance of evidence points directly at ukraine but the attacks have gone largely unheralded by kyiv they ve also been played down by russia for reasons that analysts said include embarrassment that its formidable military is unable to protect the country from being attacked from a foreign location some of the incidents may also have a more mundane explanation said william alberque director of strategy technology and arms control at the london based international institute for strategic studies negligence or corruption in russia and its armed forces on the one hand you have to understand that russia is moving ammunition at scale so accidents are going to happen alberque told rfe rl but once you get over what 22 accidents in 60 days then you are also going to be looking at enemy action some of it is bravery some of it is incompetence some of it is russian corruption but let s not get bogged down in the details he said the larger picture is that this is incredibly poor russian planning incredibly poor russian execution they ve allowed infiltration of their airspace and by missiles much more at the link last night in comments commenter cameron asked if i d seen a couple of articles columns opinion pieces and asked what i thought and

the us also needs indonesia perhaps more than it realises the biden administration s indo pacific framework and indeed anything the us does in asia needs indonesian buy in to succeed but indonesia does not want to get its hands dirty in great power politics it takes non alignment seriously this is a problem because of the increasing injection of geopolitics into economic forums such as apec and potentially the g20 a process in train before vladimir putin s invasion of ukraine but one that has accelerated drastically since joko widodo and joe biden at the 2021 climate summit in glasgow scotland ap when us and asean leaders meet at the washington summit a point for discussion will be finding a way for indonesia and the west to prevent the diplomatic fallout over russia s invasion of ukraine from derailing the economic co operation agenda embodied in the g20 while also addressing the substantial economic impact of the conflict itself the politics of the g20 are multifaceted for indonesian president joko jokowi widodo the success of indonesia s chairmanship is deeply important to him not only for the short term policy wins that may emerge from this year s meetings but for his own legacy as he prepares to leave office in 2024 for that reason jakarta will have to take on board the view of some g20 members that it would be a travesty to offer vladimir putin a chance to pose as a responsible stakeholder in the international system by participating in the g20 leaders summit in bali some have mooted a boycott should putin attend advertisement indonesia could solve this problem and let the g20 proceed as planned simply by contriving a way through quiet diplomacy to keep putin away from the bali summit but domestic political optics now starkly colour decision making with the us and allies having staked out their position so publicly by disinviting russia the government would face accusations at home that it had caved to western pressure the indonesian public was supportive of putin initially due to anti western sentiment in indonesia though that mood has shifted as the economic effects of the conflict notably resurgent food and energy price inflation have cut in the attendance of ukrainian president volodymyr zelensky offers a chance to ring fence the ukraine russia conflict at the g20 ukraine and russia could deliberate on the sidelines of the summit perhaps aided by the mediation of turkey or another non aligned g20 member this could be complemented by a commitment from all countries to present in bali for the summit whatever it takes to keep the g20 focused on the economic co operation agenda is the priority a framing that focuses on the economic impact of the conflict and the framework for a post war settlement in europe including the conditions for lifting sanctions and rebuilding the ukrainian and russian economies is a way forward post conflict russia needs to be germany after world war ii not germany after world war i the costs of failure should be clear to president widodo of all people as he faces political blowback from rising food prices in response to a spike in cooking oil derived from crude palm oil of which indonesia is the world s largest producer the government instituted a retail price ceiling in january predictably stocks either disappeared from shelves or traded hands at inflated market prices advertisement in the hope of stabilising domestic supply and prices the government has now banned crude palm oil exports sending the global market into disarray crashing the local farm gate price and costing the government billions of dollars a month in lost tax revenue the palm oil export ban exemplifies the kind of knee jerk policy which if replicated across the world will imperil the post pandemic recovery with the global trading system in a sorry state in the short term the g20 is the world s best hope for dialogue and policy co ordination to forestall counterproductive national responses to inflation supply chain disruptions and geopolitical fracture the global trade and economic recovery agenda is a burden beyond the capacity of the us and g7 alone which collectively account for only 27 per cent of world trade without active participation of developing economies in the g20 for these reasons the focus of the us asean summit is bigger than asean it s an opportunity for the key stakeholders in the regional architecture to send a message to the us leadership on their multilateral priorities for indonesia it s a chance to impress upon the americans the need for scope to exercise leadership in global affairs on its terms guided by its long professed values and its unalterable domestic political realities yose rizal damuri is executive director of the centre for strategic and economic

kyodo news may 1 2022 11 12 feature all japan japan has decided to require listed companies to disclose in their annual securities reports the ratio of women in management positions in a bid to increase female leaders in the country s male dominated corporate world the financial services agency s move to oblige about 4 000 firms mostly listed comes as investors are paying more attention to how women are promoted and help their companies perform better the agency aims to make the disclosure mandatory possibly in fiscal 2023 starting in april next year through a cabinet office ordinance revision under the japanese financial watchdog s plan the listed companies must now also disclose details such as the average pay by gender and the ratio of male workers who took child care leave currently the securities reports require stating information such as the number of employees and their average age under law companies are penalized for making any false statements the plan was presented in late march to a working group of an agency panel tasked to improve information disclosure to investors japan has lagged behind other major economies in achieving gender equality in management level posts it ranked 120th among 156 countries in the overall gender gap rankings in 2021 and 117th in economic participation and opportunity according to the world economic forum a swiss based think tank data from the ministry of internal affairs and communications showed that the female manager ratio in japan stood at 13 2 percent in 2021 below the 30 to 40 percent seen in the united states and european countries the government has failed to meet a goal in 2003 of filling around 30 percent of leadership positions in japan with women by 2020 in a policy review in 2020 the government pushed back the date to as soon as possible within the 2020s gender wage gap has also been an issue of concern with labor experts attributing this to women working fewer years in continuous employment than men as well as a small number of women in management positions tied with higher salary women working full time earned 251 800 yen in monthly salary on average which is 74 3 percent of the 338 800 yen by men in 2020 according to the ministry of health labor and welfare japanese companies had been obliged to disclose the salaries for women and men but this was struck off from the year through march 1999 to simplify the securities reports but the entries of salaries of women and men will once again be required as this has become one of the barometers for investors in assessing corporate value the fsa has said research showed a company tends to perform better when it has a higher female manager ratio britain and germany seek the disclosure of the female manager ratio and set goals for it businesses have also become more proactive in putting women in executive or managerial positions according to waris co an employment agency matching companies with candidates for female executives the number of companies who want to have their first female board member has increased from two years ago with the reorganization of the tokyo stock market companies are trying to make themselves more attractive to investors said miwa tanaka co ceo of waris on april 4 the tokyo bourse was reorganized from its four sections into three trading segments prime standard and growth markets to lure more foreign investment through stricter listing standards and corporate governance the bourse operator has urged the top tier prime market listed companies to improve corporate governance such as by having outside directors make up one third of board members and enhancing transparency by offering information to investors in english

indonesia s decision to suspend palm oil exports in the face of domestic shortages has pushed vegetable oil prices to new highs further tightening a market already on edge due to the war in ukraine and global warming the prices of palm soybean european rapeseed and even its canadian gmo counterpart canola oil have reached historic highs following indonesia s announcement on wednesday we already had problems with soybeans in south america with canola in canada said philippe chalmin an economics professor at paris dauphine university in france stating that both crops had been severely affected by extended droughts then came devastation for the sunflowers in ukraine due to russia s destructive invasion he added palm oil is the most consumed vegetable oil in the world and indonesia accounts for 35pc of global exports according to james fry chairperson of lmc consulting firm indonesia s export ban is designed to bring down prices in the country and limit shortages according to authorities however chalmin said the move comes at the worst time the rise in prices dates back to last year already and it is exacerbated by the ukrainian conflict he explained rich nelson of the agricultural market research and trading firm allendale said the industry believes it ll last maybe for one month perhaps two but in the meantime prices are skyrocketing in a market that was already accelerated he said unlike other oilseeds palm fruit does not keep once picked and has to be processed immediately fry said indonesia s palm oil storage system which was already holding substantial reserves is now under further stress fry said even though the price of vegetable oil in addition to multiple other agricultural commodities has been rising for months demand has yet to slow it s difficult to ration demand for food commodities with higher prices said arlan suderman chief commodities economist at stonex financial palm oil which is used heavily in processed food such as instant noodles and baked goods is also present in other consumer products such as personal care items and cosmetics eventually it will trickle down said paul desert cazenave of consulting firm grainbow but it s still too early to measure price increases to consumers in the short term the only oilseed that might be able to provide some relief on the vegetable oil market is the soybean the united states and brazil the world s two top soybean exporters still have available stock even though more shipments from the countries would only have a marginal impact on edible oil prices the united states department of agriculture usda announced last month that it expects soybean acreage to increase more than 4pc from last year while corn would shrink by a comparable amount the world s top rapeseed exporter canada meanwhile said tuesday that it expected a 7pc decline in acreage devoted to the gmo rapeseeds used in canola oil
scott simon host congress is busy considering a number of measures including latest ukraine aid package requested by president biden of 33 billion also another covid aid package the new york grand jury investigation into former president donald trump s business practices has wrapped up with no news from those proceedings npr s senior editor and correspondent ron elving joins us ron thanks so much for being with us ron elving byline good to be with you scott simon and let s begin with that new york grand jury does not seem to be much of a chance of an indictment does there elving no the prosecutors took three years lining up what looked like key witnesses but it never got to the point of seeking an indictment from a grand jury which as you say has now expired now we know that there s a new district attorney took office in manhattan over the winter alvin bragg and he seems to have different concerns and priorities which would lead him to devote the resources of his office to other matters leaders of the trump investigation have resigned and bragg could impanel another grand jury but he has not said he will and meanwhile there s still a civil case going forward regarding the trump organization s business practices in new york and a judge in that case this week held trump in contempt for withholding information but for now the criminal case seems on hold simon another grand jury is being formed right now in georgia to consider charging donald trump for his attempts to pressure state officials to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential elections in that state what do we know elving this case is at the opposite end of the grand jury process in a sense it s just getting started we know trump and his attorneys tried in various ways to cast doubt on the 2020 election results one especially gaudy gambit was in georgia where we have that famous audiotape of trump urging georgia s secretary of state to find another 12 000 votes for him so he could win that state now the prosecuting attorney in georgia has said that tape is part of the case and having a grand jury will enable the prosecution to issue subpoenas but we don t expect those to go out until after the georgia primary elections next month simon president biden wants more aid for ukraine any significant opposition to it in congress elving ukraine aid is still broadly popular on the hill and this 33 billion should be no exception there were 69 votes in the house against the ukraine aid that was voted on last month most of those were republicans some said they didn t like the way the aid was packaged with other things or the risks involved in escalating the conflict others said we needed to recalibrate our support for a country that s not even in nato and we needed to stop trying to be the world s policeman simon tell me about some talk about trying to tie this bill to another one for additional covid spending that has significantly more opposition right elving yes in fact that s the real question mark for the ukraine aid will it be yoked with the covid spending which has far less bipartisan support in fact some of the senior senate republicans have already forced this round of covid aid to come down from a 22 billion request to 10 billion and even that amount is in doubt if it comes to the floor by itself that s why speaker pelosi would like to see ukraine and covid aid combined but republicans say we ve already spent too much responding to covid there are billions in the pipeline yet to be spent and fresh money could be further fuel for inflation still without this aid scott there will be people lacking vaccines and therapeutics and the agencies that have been fighting this pandemic would be squeezed as well simon we have half a minute left what s going on with the economy elving laughter ah what a wild week in the world of economic forecasting and the world of the stock market the major indices plunged on wednesday skyrocketed on thursday fell off the table entirely on friday and some of this may be the slowdown in the economy in the first quarter it could be fear of inflation higher interest rates or even a recession on the horizon but analysts do seem to agree that the market s extreme volatility is a response to uncertainty and weeks like this one can only add to that simon npr senior editor and correspondent ron elving thanks so much elving thank you scott transcript provided by npr copyright npr
if republican rep lauren boebert of colorado has her way congress will put an end the biden administration s effort to equate the truth with whatever it might want it to be earlier this week homeland security secretary alejandro mayorkas revealed the existence of the disinformation governance board according to the washington post we have just established a mis and disinformation governance board in the department of homeland security to more effectively combat this threat not only to election security but to our homeland security he said on top of that it was revealed that the board is headed by nina jankowicz who
coffee was wildly popular in sweden in the 17th century and also illegal king gustav iii believed that it was a slow poison and devised a clever experiment to prove it he commuted the sentences of murderous twin brothers who were waiting to be beheaded on one condition one brother had to drink three pots of coffee every day while the other drank three pots of tea the early death of the coffee drinker would prove that coffee was poison it turned out that the coffee drinking twin outlived the tea drinker but it wasn t until the 1820s that swedes were finally legally permitted to do what they had been doing all along drink coffee lots of coffee the cornerstone of the scientific revolution is the insistence that claims be tested with data ideally in a randomly controlled trial gustav s experiment was noteworthy for his use of identical male twins which eliminated the confounding effects of sex age and genes the most glaring weakness was that nothing statistically persuasive can come from such a small sample the problem today is not the scarcity of data but the opposite we have too much data and it is undermining the credibility of science luck is inherent in random trials in a medical study some patients may be healthier in an agricultural study some soil may be more fertile in an educational study some students may be more motivated researchers consequently calculate the probability the p value that the outcomes might happen by chance a low p value indicates that the results cannot easily be attributed to the luck of the draw how low in the 1920s the great british statistician ronald fisher said that he considered p values below 5 percent to be persuasive so 5 percent became the hurdle for the statistically significant certification needed for publication funding and fame it is not a difficult hurdle suppose that a hapless researcher calculates the correlations among hundreds of variables blissfully unaware that the data are all in fact random numbers on average one out of 20 correlations will be statistically significant even though every correlation is nothing more than coincidence real researchers don t correlate random numbers but all too often they correlate what are essentially randomly chosen variables this haphazard search for statistical significance even has a name data mining as with random numbers the correlation between randomly chosen unrelated variables has a 5 percent chance of being fortuitously statistically significant data mining can be augmented by manipulating pruning and otherwise torturing the data to get low p values to find statistical significance one need merely look sufficiently hard the 5 percent hurdle has had the perverse effect of encouraging researchers to do more tests and report more meaningless

12 05 2017 for nearly four years food fuel and medicine have travelled across frontlines into the besieged eastern suburbs of damascus through a network of underground tunnels but an army offensive near the syrian capital has shut the routes into the rebel enclave of eastern ghouta causing supplies to dwindle and prices to rocket residents say the price of fuel went up like crazy said adnan 30 the head of a local aid group that distributes food a cooking gas canister now costs 50 000 syrian pounds nearly four times its price before the attack and almost 20 times the state regulated price in nearby damascus adnan whose aid group buys rice lentils and other goods that arrive via the tunnels said the shutdown and steep price hikes had triggered rising despair in the suburbs as the army tightens the noose fighters and civilians are bracing for a full blown assault and bitter shortages that could last through the winter the operation aims to strangle the ghouta by closing off the crossings and tunnels hamza birqdar military spokesman for the jaish al islam rebel group told journalists trade through the tunnels has completely stopped government forces have blockaded eastern ghouta a densely populated pocket of satellite towns and farms since 2013 it remains the only major rebel bastion near damascus though it has shrunk by almost half over the past year president bashar al assad s government has been steadily defeating pockets of armed rebellion near the capital with the help of russian air power and iranian backed militias it ultimately aims to seize the ghouta pushing fighters to accept state rule or leave for rebel territory in the north in a type of negotiated withdrawal that has helped shore up its rule over syria s main urban centres heavy fighting and air strikes have rocked the districts that stand between damascus and eastern ghouta severing smuggling routes that provided a lifeline for around 300 000 people in the besieged suburbs the army assault entered a higher gear in recent months in the districts of barzeh and qaboun at the capital s eastern edges which abruptly ended a local truce that had been in place with rebels there since 2014 their relative calm and location had turned them into a transit point where traders brought supplies from the capital and shuttled them underground into the opposition enclave government forces have now swept into most of the two districts the siege generated a black market economy and profiteers who traded across frontlines says an activist who has smuggled medicine through one of the tunnels goods prices were ramped up by payments to checkpoints in government held areas and rebels that control the tunnels the activist and other residents said syrian officials were not available for comment on such allegations syrian state media says ghouta militants dug tunnels hundreds of metres long to move weapons and ambush army positions the tunnels have been a target of army operations with several blown up in recent months it has said the wide array of rebels including hard line jihadists and other groups supported by turkey the united states and gulf monarchies have been on the back foot across syria in eastern ghouta a bout of renewed rebel infighting after a rebel attack at the fringes of damascus quickly fizzled out in march could play into the government s hands birqdar said rebels faced heavy shelling air strikes and incoming tanks every day we must prepare for every scenario that could happen on the battlefield he said we are fully ready to negotiate over stopping the bloodshed by the regime but will not accept any talks that lead to surrender he ruled out a local evacuation deal the government says such deals have succeeded where u n based peace talks failed the opposition describes it as a strategy of forced displacement after years of siege a method of warfare the united nations has condemned as a war crime the u n has warned of impending starvation if aid does not reach eastern ghouta where international deliveries have long been erratic and obstructed a convoy that entered last week for the first time in months carried food and supplies for just about 10 percent of the estimated population people have rushed to the markets to stock up said adnan because they have bitter memories of 2013 when their towns first came under siege merchants inside the ghouta had filled up large warehouses that would last months and residents would harvest crops in the area s remaining farmland in the summer he said things will get worse when winter comes the wafideen crossing at the outskirts where checkpoints allowed food to enter has also been restricted since february adnan and others said one resident said rebel fighters also ran their own hidden routes through which they had moved unnoticed or smuggled arms medics relied on the tunnels for antibiotics anaesthetics and other supplies said abu ibrahim baker a surgeon in eastern ghouta hospitals would be able to hold out god willing but not for very long he said reuters related articles on qantara de the syrian conflict mendacious diplomacy u s missile strike in syria trump turns the table

i submitted the paper to an academic journal and the reviewer s comments demonstrate beautifully how deeply embedded is the notion that statistical significance supersedes common sense the paper is generally well written and structured this is an interesting study and the authors have collected unique datasets using cutting edge methodology it is tempting to believe that more data means more knowledge however the explosion in the number of things that are measured and recorded has magnified beyond belief the number of coincidental patterns and bogus statistical relationships waiting to deceive us gary smith is an economics professor at pomona college
hospitals are starting to emerge from the worst of covid 19 but one consequence has persisted they still have to pay workers more hca healthcare inc and universal health services inc two of the largest u s for profit hospital chains each warned last month that the price of labor could continue to eat into their profits while executives say costs should eventually subside as covid dies down when and by how much remain to be seen wages have gone up for hospital workers across the board according to aaron wesolowski vice president of policy at the american hospital association that s particularly so in positions that faced the most strain during the pandemic such as nurses respiratory therapists and intensive care staff drug and supply costs are up as well with patients coming in sicker and needing more care and staff wearing more protective gear it doesn t take much to really exacerbate that issue of workforce costs wesolowski said which make up more than half of a typical hospital s expenses even small increases can make a big difference he said and what we re seeing are really large increases a report released by the aha last week said that labor costs per patient jumped by 19 in 2021 from 2019 high cost traveling nurses made up 39 of hospital nursing budgets in january 2022 up from 5 in 2019 the pandemic upset the u s economy in many ways but health care was subject to some of the biggest shocks nurses doctors and other staff were exposed to covid on a daily basis before vaccines were available and often lacked proper protective gear in the first year of the pandemic more than 3 600 health care workers died of covid according to kaiser health news high labor needs burnout and illness have left many hospitals short staffed and large numbers of nurses took better paying travel jobs working on contract for a few weeks or months in surge locations it s true that supply chain shortages and a tight labor market have pushed up the cost of goods across many industries but health care wages have increased faster than other sectors from january 2020 to january 2022 private wages at hospitals rose 13 1 compared with 11 across all sectors according to the u s bureau of labor statistics before covid hospital labor increases were predictable rising 1 5 to 2 a year said martin mcgahan co head of consulting firm alvarez marsal s health care practice which helps hospitals in financial trouble that has changed dramatically he said in massachusetts the omicron wave hit hospitals so hard in january and february that almost all had to run at a loss even with the government subsidies according to the massachusetts health and hospital association it is clear that these hospital losses are simply unsustainable association chief executive officer steve walsh said in a statement even as many small hospitals have suffered the largest operators have still managed to turn a profit hca universal health and community health systems inc three of the largest publicly traded chains all reported growing profits and stock prices over the course of the pandemic rising costs have begun to take a bite however hca reported 1 27 billion in adjusted net income in the first quarter down from a year prior universal health services reported smaller first quarter profits than in any quarter of 2021 shares of both companies fell after they reported in some cases hospitals have curbed how many patients they care for universal health employs about 89 000 people and runs more than 400 hospitals behavioral health centers and other facilities at some of those locations which treat mental health conditions and substance use disorders they ve had to limit the number of patients they take on executives said they believe costs will ease over time hca employs more than 270 000 people and has 184 hospitals in about 20 states ceo sam hazen last month called this period a high water mark on labor costs and said we re going to gain ground on the pressure that we ve experienced over the past three quarters so far though even as covid hospitalizations have declined following the omicron wave labor pressures have continued said universal health cfo steve filton last week on the company s earnings call to some degree i think we ve found labor issues to be stickier and more difficult to navigate in the back half of the quarter than we were expecting filton said referring to late february and the month of march hospitals are trying to come up with ways to help build a pipeline of workers and retain the ones they have community health which operates 83 hospitals in 16 states said it will expand its employee benefits in an effort to attract and retain a strong workforce the company said those added benefits are valued at about 40 million each year across its about 66 000 workers and include new student loan repayment benefits reimbursement for job license renewals and an expanded tuition reimbursement program hospitals can pass along some costs to insurers and their clients but not instantaneously it can take a year or two before higher labor costs get baked into medicare s reimbursements to hospitals executives from hca said on an earnings call late last month and rates with commercial insurers are typically contracted well in advance health insurance rates haven t yet responded to higher labor costs said insurer centene corp s ceo sarah london we haven t really seen anything so far this year she said on a call with analysts tuesday the fact that our rates are contracted creates a buffer on that she said

istanbul for months istanbul restaurant tarihi balikca tried to absorb the surging cost of the sunflower oil its cooks use to fry fish squid and mussels but in early april with oil prices nearly four times higher than they were in 2019 the restaurant finally raised its prices now even some longtime customers look at the menu and walk away we resisted we said let s wait a bit maybe the market will improve maybe prices will stabilize but we saw that there is no improvement said mahsun aktas a waiter and cook at the restaurant the customer cannot afford it global cooking oil prices have been rising since the covid 19 pandemic began for multiple reasons from poor harvests in south america to virus related labor shortages and steadily increasing demand from the biofuel industry the war in ukraine which supplies nearly half of the world s sunflower oil on top of the 25 from russia has interrupted shipments and sent cooking oil prices spiraling it is the latest fallout to the global food supply from russia s war and another rising cost pinching households and businesses as inflation soars the conflict has further fueled already high food and energy costs hitting the poorest people hardest the food supply is particularly at risk as the war has disrupted crucial grain shipments from ukraine and russia and worsened a global fertilizer crunch that will mean costlier less abundant food the loss of affordable supplies of wheat barley and other grains raises the prospect of food shortages and political instability in middle eastern african and some asian countries where millions rely on subsidized bread and cheap noodles vegetable oil prices hit a record high in february then increased another 23 in march according to the u n food and agriculture organization soybean oil which sold for 765 per metric ton in 2019 was averaging 1 957 per metric ton in march the world bank said palm oil prices were up 200 and are set to go even higher after indonesia one of the world s top producers bans cooking oil exports starting thursday to protect domestic supply some supermarkets in turkey have imposed limits on the amount of vegetable oil households can purchase after concerns about shortages sparked panic buying some stores in spain italy and the united kingdom also have set limits german shoppers are posting photos on social media of empty shelves where sunflower and canola oil usually sit in a recent tweet kenya s main power company warned that thieves are draining toxic fluid from electrical transformers and reselling it as cooking oil we will just have to boil everything now the days of the frying pan are gone said glaudina nyoni scanning prices in a supermarket in harare zimbabwe where vegetable oil costs have almost doubled since the outbreak of the war a 2 liter bottle now costs up to 9 emiwati who runs a food stall in jakarta indonesia said she needs 24 liters of cooking oil each day she makes nasi kapau traditional mixed rice that she serves with dishes like deep fried spiced beef jerky since january she s had trouble ensuring that supply and what she does buy is much more expensive profits are down but she fears losing customers if she raises prices i am sad said emiwati who only uses one name we accept the price of cooking oil increasing but we cannot increase the price of the foods we sell the high cost of cooking oil is partly behind recent protests in jakarta indonesia has imposed price caps on palm oil at home and will ban exports creating a new squeeze worldwide palm oil has been sought as an alternative for sunflower oil and is used in many products from cookies to cosmetics the associated press has documented human rights abuses in an industry whose environmental effects have been decried for years across the world in london yawar khan who owns akash tandoori restaurant said a 20 liter drum of cooking oil cost him 28 a few months ago it s now 49 we cannot pass all the price rises to the consumer that will cause a catastrophe too said khan who also struggles with rising costs for meat spices energy and labor big companies are feeling the pain too london based unilever maker of dove soap and hellmann s mayonnaise said it has contracts for critical ingredients like palm oil for the first half of the year but it warned investors that its costs could rise significantly in the second half cargill a global food giant that makes vegetable oils said its customers are changing formulas and experimenting with different kinds of oils at a higher rate than usual that can be tricky because oils have different properties olive oil burns at a lower temperature than sunflower oil for example while palm oil is more viscous prices could moderate by this fall when farmers in the northern hemisphere harvest corn soybeans and other crops said joseph glauber a senior research fellow at the international food policy research institute but there s always the danger of bad weather last year drought pummeled canada s canola crop and brazil s soybean crop while heavy rains affected palm oil production in malaysia farmers may be hesitant to plant enough crops to make up for shortfalls from ukraine or russia because they don t know when the war might end said steve mathews co head of research at gro intelligence an agriculture data and analytics company if there were a cease fire or something like that we would see prices decline in the short run for sure he said longer term the crisis may lead countries to reconsider biofuel mandates which dictate the amount of vegetable oils that must be blended with fuel in a bid to reduce emissions and energy imports in the u s for example 42 of soybean oil goes toward biofuel production glauber said indonesia recently delayed a plan to require 40 palm oil based biodiesel while the european commission said it would support member states that choose to reduce their biofuel mandates in the meantime consumers and businesses are struggling harry niazi who owns the famous olley s fish experience in london says he used to pay around 29 for a 20 liter jug of sunflower oil the cost recently jumped to 55 niazi goes through as many as eight jugs per week but what worries him even more than rising prices is the thought of running out of sunflower oil altogether he s thinking of selling his truck and using the cash to stock up on oil it s very very scary and i don t know how the fish and chips industry is going to cope i really don t he said so far niazi has held off on raising prices because he doesn t want to lose customers at jordan s grab n go a small dyersburg tenn restaurant known for its fried cheeseburgers owner christine coronado also agonized about price increases but with costs up 20 across the board and cooking oil prices nearly tripling since she opened in 2018 she finally hiked prices in april you hate to raise prices on people but it s just that costs are so much higher than they were a couple of years ago she said

corporations conducting their business habitually damage our climate their environs their consumers their workers and society at large as long as their raison d être the pursuit of profit goes unchecked enterprises will avoid bearing the external societal cost of their activities preferring the public to pay for the mess they leave behind lawmakers and governments therefore have to step in introducing health regulations labour laws competition rules or environmental standards for instance they task independent regulators to police corporations accordingly this does not always work to everybody s satisfaction due to underfunding lobbying collusion with the regulated and changing priorities entertained by policy makers the observation that public regulators were not quite up to the task led to the idea that investors and the invested industries themselves had to step forward and volunteer in doing good in 2006 un secretary general kofi annan addressed industrial leaders with his principles of responsible investment the great financial crisis 2008 and the paris climate agreement 2015 added urgency the world must not wait for governments to do the right thing the investment industry and its managers would have to engage to make sure that money will be invested for the good of mankind rather than for its doom henceforth responsible investment will not only focus on prudent bookkeeping and profitability but on environmental social and governance esg criteria too as per today the financial industry has slated assets worth 80 trillion us dollars to be invested according to esg guidelines if this sounds too good to be true it perhaps is the investment industry has to face up to a lot of contradictions on its way to benefaction it tries to argue with superior returns generated by esg conscious investment on the face of it belching smokestacks and open pits forebode a future of diminishing returns coal and tobacco companies for instance are on a seemingly unstoppable downward path as consumers are smoking less and prefer cleaner forms of energy if we are ever going to tackle climate change vast deposits of fossil fuels will remain buried necessitating a painful depreciation of reserves already accounted for to equate harmful business practice with dire profit prospects is overly simplistic though investment decisions should never be a verdict about current misbehaviour alone but a wager on expectable improvement and adaptability farriers ran out of business irrespective of their contribution to sustainability the promise of financial gratification for investment decisions based on the common good rather than individual profit also misses the point whenever we take a moral stand we value the desired outcome or the salvation of our self esteem more than its cost many esg parameters are hard to evaluate accomplished gender equality in board rooms lgbtq conscious advertising or longer holidays for better paid workers are laudable but not necessarily profitable easier to calculate is the fact that esg stocks promoted for their goodness tend to be more expensive thus lowering earnings per share and diminishing future returns even ignoring the cost of esg picking and screening they are unpromising investments arithmetically as the theory goes divesting from miscreants will increase their cost of capital to the point of rendering the business unprofitable this is not true if i sell my shares in exxon mobil for instance someone else less scrupulous will buy it and if stock markets would run out of buyers the enterprise will be taken private and continue its harmful activities with heightened profitability the current energy crisis exemplifies this with clarity while listed corporations have heeded their investors demand to put less money into upstream operations oil producers of unsavoury regimes in africa asia and the middle east rake in a fortune they certainly earn enough money to shrug off our unwillingness to provide capital they have enough income to find our position laughable the more so as we beg them to increase production should we just pass sentence on the miners while praising the battery solar panel and wind turbine producers who are supplied by the very miners we condemn andreas weitzer initially i embraced esg investing enthusiastically as yet another arrow in the quiver fighting climate change but even before esg had branched out to moralise every aspect of economic endeavour i realised problems what esg scores should we assign to mining companies blasting indigenous sanctuaries deluging villages poisoning rivers and bribing government officials while at the same time supplying us with all the cobalt copper and lithium we need to save the planet should we just pass sentence on the miners while praising the battery solar panel and wind turbine producers who are supplied by the very miners we condemn one of the seemingly insurmountable problems of esg scoring was the lack of standards and the creep in of fact washing a form of post truth hovering a safe distance to outright lies challenged by the opacity of corporate emission disclosure the sec america s stock market watchdog recently published a 500 page document standardising rules of emission disclosure the sec s heroic undertaking demonstrates the difficulties we face when we try to legislate for good behaviour instead of directly penalising harmful emissions with mandated curbs or taxes the biggest flaw of esg investment is the idea that it was possible to transform personal moral judgements into a box ticking exercise in april a couple of yale university scholars published in the new york times an opinion piece analysing the corporate behaviour of almost 600 companies with operations in russia they assigned scores on a scale of leaving scaling back halting investments and staying course deploring companies not fully committed to ending atrocities according to their opinion russians who rely on the food or medicines those companies make or the jobs they provide may suffer hardship but if that s what it takes to stop mr putin from killing innocent ukrainians that s what business must do this is like many esg assessments a moral judgement and a very peculiar one for that matter it has nothing to do with success or failure in business the leavers ranking highly on the esg score board of the two yale professors may do well in their further business endeavours they may have realised that staying will not further their bottom line yet those staying may have equally compelling reasons to do so independent of who will in the end have to cede the moral high ground all businesses are guilty of pocketing their workers surplus value according to marx this is their original sin they exploit wage earning workers where we retail investors wish to draw the line is a personal decision no esg investment manager can relieve us from taking individual responsibility in the wake of the recent energy crisis many of us have started to make peace with nuclear power following russia s brazen invasion of the ukraine some even see the moral benefits of investing in weapon manufacturers while condemning anything russian from opera singers to vodka from russian trollops to oligarchs some schools have even started to take tolstoy and dostoyevsky off the curriculum such is our cancel culture but even long before the invasion it would have been foolish to make a case for a russian stock market investment and neither was there ever one for the ukraine no matter how much we d wish to favour the underdog related stories are embargoes a strategy or a punishment andreas weitzer the end of free money and other headaches andreas weitzer to cast a harsh light on corporate mis behaviour is laudable it will lead to better informed policies and may sway critical private and public investment decisions but elucidating the public is what good journalism is about it s not a role for product sales managers to wrap investment products in a cloth of morality the purpose of this column is to broaden readers general financial knowledge and it should not be interpreted as presenting investment advice or advice on the buying and selling of financial products andreas weitzer timesofmalta com
