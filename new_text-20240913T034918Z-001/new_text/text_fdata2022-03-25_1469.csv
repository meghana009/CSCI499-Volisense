article originally published in jan feb 2022 edition asset prices are on the rise signaling a new wave of inflation federal reserve chairman jerome powell and his counterparts like european central bank board member fabio panetta have described inflation as transitory again and again but that well worn term is starting to sound almost as out of place as fifteen days to slow the spread maybe inflation is here to stay nobody believes that prices will go back to the level they were at in 2020 that would require deflation where the cost of goods and services trends down not up in that scenario consumers delay purchases and save money because whatever they are planning on buying will be cheaper down the line this puts pressure on businesses facing top line revenue reductions compelling them to cut their bottom line costs to stay afloat that means negotiating lower prices with their suppliers which perpetuates the same problem downstream or what is far more likely businesses cut costs by firing workers and shutting down sites friendly reminder the goal is to have stable goldilocks prices this traditionally has been understood as prices rising two percent or less in a given year the u s s 10 year inflation average for the years 2011 2020 was 1 75 percent for the eurozone 1 28 percent in other words in europe and america central banks have done a decent job we ve all gotten used to the idea that from one year to the next prices may go up a little but there won t be any sudden or surprising movements tipping point at least until now year over year inflation for 2021 hit five percent in the e u and seven percent in the u s shooting well past anything anyone regards as acceptable quarter by quarter both economies racked up numbers not seen since the 1980s is this still transitory word on the street is even more dire some older cars are selling for more than they cost when they were new and dealerships are selling out of new stock as soon as it arrives perhaps because the manufacturer s suggested retail price for a new car is cheaper than buying a used one martin weiss of deutsche automobil treuhand dat remarked the price increases are often five to 15 percent in individual cases they can be significantly more it s crazy what we re seeing and that s another facet of inflation if prices don t move up fast enough to stay in line with the market the result is a shortage people snap up assets because they immediately feel the value this depletes the supply chain which has trouble replenishing itself with new product because the cost of production has in the meantime gone beyond the revenue generated at the final point of sale when this self reinforcing price spiral becomes sufficiently powerful it compels companies to increase prices faster and faster quarterly or monthly rather than once a year inflationary spiral take hyundai heavy industries hhi south korea s largest shipyard where newbuild prices are up 12 percent year over year hhi was paying more for steel plate to fill its existing orders so it suffered a loss steel plate makes up 90 percent of the material used in fabricating a typical commercial vessel hhi s situation prices for its products are up but its bottom line is underwater is what triggers the inflationary spiral shipbuilding contracts are normally divided into four parts with specific triggers a down payment due upon signing a second installment due upon cutting the first steel plate a third installment due upon keel laying and the remainder due upon launch all of these installments add up to a single total price for the newbuild which is usually non variable this model works in a low inflation environment with stable costs an owner could calculate a price obtain financing and then ideally amortize the vessel via a long term charter party after paying the shipyard to avoid the situation hhi is in now wherein it absorbs the shock from rising steel prices it will need to contractually offload those price problems onto the owner two possibilities are available first the price of the newbuild doesn t need to be quantified up front rather it can move in line with the market and the owner will only know what his ship will cost after it finally launches typically this construct is achieved by building price adjustment clauses into the shipbuilding contract requiring the owner to cover costlier materials or even higher labor costs and new taxes and fees second cost plus contracts may come into vogue which require the owner to reimburse the shipyard for all of the vessel s building costs plus guarantee a fixed predetermined margin of profit for the yard both of these contractual mechanisms protect against inflation but make life hard for the buyer especially tricky is the fact that the owner will only be able to quote a charter party rate after the newbuild is launched since any risk in the commitments made to the shipyard will need in turn to be passed on to the charterer thus the charterer will necessarily pass that risk on to the cargo side i e to shippers who will spiral style ask consignees for more money this is what is meant by perpetuating the same problem downstream while the global orderbook for newbuilds was at a 31 year low in january of 2021 this has totally reversed since peter sand bimco s chief shipping analyst summarized the situation by saying going into 2021 the orderbook only stood at 2 5 million teus since then a record high 3 3 million teus have been ordered a byline from lloyd s list recently warned new capacity on order risks flooding the market when it arrives in 2023 from zero to hero shipbuilders are looking back on what has been called a spectacular year it s just a pity that inflation has taken the profit out of it so why not just buy an older vessel and avoid all of this hassle and uncertainty well in april of 2021 clarksons reported that its secondhand index was up 33 percent year over year as the overall total value of the global merchant marine fleet surpassed 1 trillion that 33 percent increase is even higher than the 12 percent premium you d be paying as a customer of hhi so maybe waiting for the yard is worth it this is starting to feel very familiar like deciding between a new or used car maybe the fact that as time passes these problems are being identified industry by industry is a bad sign because the reality is that they are shared that they affect all sectors and that they are becoming secular blinking red in terms of the global economy practically all the control panel status lights are blinking red the imf reported at the end of 2021 that the response to covid 19 in 2020 was the largest surge of public debt in 40 years spiking sharply to just under 250 trillion worldwide and that doesn t account for 2021 a year in which spending was even higher at the same time global incomes are down for the second consecutive year irrespective of whether you are rich or poor you re worse off now than you were two years ago again the biggest declines perversely affected the poorest quintile of earners with a 6 7 percent drop in 2021 and military tensions like those between russia and ukraine are rattling energy markets other problems like port congestion and cargo chaos are no better than they were last year even though time has passed and solutions were tried in fact while last year s focus was on blue water shipping now truckers and railways are at risk too for two years now the word transitory has been used to describe all kinds of problems lockdowns shutdowns and quarantines shortages shipping delays inflation runaway spending anything transitory is relatively easy to rationalize but when it becomes apparent that a situation is not transitory but rather reflective of a new status quo of a new normal it can trigger a shift in thinking and perspective that may often lead to different behavior how should we act in a world that is staring down the barrel of heavy inflation and higher taxes in order to both dilute the value of and help service debt in the face of price uncertainty where money spent now is worth more than money spent later and assets store value rather than depreciate of shortages that are worsened by the knowledge that shortages are all but inevitable so buyers will walk out with everything that s available for sale and it ll cost more tomorrow anyway when incomes grow lower every year as one band aid after another fails to fix the fundamental problem which is that the delicate humpty dumpty of the just in time economy is broken and there s no decent replacement yet will we just have to make it work with the bits and pieces measuring stick a feedback loop is when a part of a system s output is used as input for that system s future behavior the worldwide reaction to covid 19 has become a latticework of externalities that are now governing our day to day decisions the way out will be hard but it will probably first be found in the price of a container from shanghai to rotterdam all the upstream and downstream risks and all of the costs for the vessel bunkers labor will be priced in unlike governments and central banks that container will be telling us the unvarnished truth that s going to be one expensive container and it will only be the first of many

dr andrew mccoy is passionate about innovating the residential construction industry to make homes affordable and sustainable for virginians over this career he has authored over 100 articles on this topic and through his work he has secured over 6 million in research grants dr mccoy is the director for virginia center for housing research at virginia tech he is also the beliveau professor of building construction and the associate director of the myers lawson school of construction at virginia tech dr mccoy said working on making housing more affordable is rewarding because he meets people who are in need and he has a way to help them our main goal our mission is affordability so we work with different parts of the state or even different parts of the country in some type of cases internationally on ways to basically work with their current housing stock understand income limits and try to create options for more people to afford more housing dr mccoy said dr mccoy s most recent grant of half a million dollars came from virginia housing dr mccoy and dr philip agee with vchr received the pact 3d concrete house printing innovation grant to help make housing more affordable the one year 500 000 grant is being used to design and produce a 3d printed concrete home in richmond vchr has partnered with alquist a 3d printing construction firm to print the home s exterior walls virginia housing and vchr have also partnered with project homes better housing coalition and rmt construction development group to explore innovative affordable and energy efficient new homes dr mccoy said that he doesn t know that people really understand what affordable housing is the needs of it but also how it works a lot of people are one economic problem or health problem away from having total economic failure and what this does having affordable housing provides stability it provides stability from the standpoint of children and education possibly health care and where you live close to but it also helps people to be able to recover a little bit more easily if they can afford where they re living when something else might pop up dr mccoy said last year habitat of humanity in partnership with alquist and vchr was able to build the first 3d printed home in the nation located in williamsburg as part of the grant dr mccoy handed the keys to the new owner april stringfield and her son the owner is this amazing person who is a single mother who had worked three jobs during the pandemic to make sure that she would qualify to be able to afford the house she wanted to prove to her children that if you work hard enough that you can make you can make things happen and you can live your dreams dr mccoy said for stringfield to qualify for the house she participated in habitat homebuyer program were had to give 300 hours about 2 weeks of sweat equity towards another home or hers on top of this she needed to make sure she qualified for the home with her income dr mccoy said stringfield s story echos the larger story in the state and county millions of people need more affordable housing options if you make below 50 area median income the options are really slim and the ability for people to produce housing for that amount of money is very difficult and so between 30 and 50 percent area median income we have and they can do it because typically they have volunteer labor and hopefully they have material donations dr mccoy said the nation s affordable housing crisis can be traced back to the 2008 recession when we had the recession a lot of people did not like the cyclical nature of housing and the housing industry and so you saw there were a lot of people who went out of business but you also saw a lot of labor and firms that just said you know we re going to move on to a different industry dr mccoy said so we lost you know half of our capacity to actually build well over time since 2008 what you ve seen is that the number of sales of homes has gotten back to pre 2008 levels to 2006 levels dr mccoy said this has caused multiple generations in the same family to compete for housing with a limited stock and high demand prices were increasing rapidly we saw stories of three generations of the same family looking at the same house the young generation looking to buy it to build equity the grandparents looking at it to downsize and the generation in the middle the parents they re looking at it because it s a great rental property and rental prices are going up dr mccoy said so it s just this confluence of all these stresses on the market dr mccoy said the industry did not have the ability to produce enough housing quickly on top of it with the pandemic then we started getting to the place where lumber prices material prices supply chain issues we started seeing the global kind of supply chain and the stresses of that on the ability to produce houses as well it just made for a really good time for a product you know a production cycle that could actually consolidate the many different materials that you might have on the exterior of the home in the interior the home into one process that could be very durable that could go up quickly dr mccoy said one solution to the affordable housing crisis is 3d printing 3d concrete printing is very customizable so that s what s one thing that s very nice about it dr mccoy said dr mccoy said 3d concrete printing is like building a layered cake you re just building layers upon layers vertically and you have all kinds of different ways that you need to kind of control that and make sure that it s fitting the right size and in the right direction and the coordinates that you set dr mccoy said the benefits of having a 3d printed home is that their price tag is more affordable and the homes are also cost efficient so far the houses built using 3d printing technology in virginia have been electric we think it s wonderful to provide an affordable home that people can purchase but it s also another thing to provide a home that people can afford to operate right and energy prices are rising these houses that we ve built and designed in the state of virginia so far they have very low operating costs mccoy said the total construction cost for a 1 550 square foot home using 3d print technology can range from 180 000 to 190 000 the homes then sell for about 220 000 it s a real win in terms of how we might look at economic growth and then it s helping people who might otherwise not have a chance to build equity into grow their own economic footprint it gives them options dr mccoy said 3d printing can bring new life into the construction industry it is customizable so people will push the boundaries to create homes with different floor plans features and more i think what you re seeing right now especially from the digital side the digitization of our industry we hear about digital twins the idea that buildings digitally are completely represented before you ever get out there and put shovel into the ground you can understand all the risks you can understand how the trades are going to work everything from that standpoint we re seeing a huge shift in how we will view industry moving forward dr mccoy said
naval air station north island calif the navy is making the first major changes to the carrier air wing in a generation the service just wrapped up the first carrier deployment of the f 35c lightning ii joint strike fighters the first new fighter jet on a carrier in 20 years and is a few years away from introducing the first unmanned aircraft into the air wing but while the navy is moving ahead with new platforms and ways of fighting it is still wrestling with maintenance gaps and a fighter inventory too small to deploy and train efficiently the service is also shifting its strategy to focus on the indo pacific a vast region for the carrier air wing to operate in after two decades of providing close air support for combat missions in the middle east and central asia in an interview last month with usni news vice adm kenneth whitesell the commander of naval air forces and naval air force pacific laid out his vision for blending fourth and fifth generation aircraft into the future carrier air wing and the transition to future sixth generation systems whitesell is also focused on remediating the backlog of super hornets waiting to enter the service life modification program that will upgrade the aircraft and extend their service lives implementing lessons from the first f 35c deployment to inform the future of carrier aviation and ensuring it has enough fighters to meet its air wing requirements by 2025 we ve got a we ve got a strategy and the funding piece we just worked last week with navair for program management n98 for money coordination whitesell said in a recent interview at his office as we build the map we know where our deployments are roughly going to be and the modifications that have to be on the carrier and the modifications that have to be so that the air wing itself syncs the capabilities the all the systems sync so i m pretty happy i m okay with where the strategy is right now the lynchpin is going to be the funding piece from modernizing the fourth generation f a 18e f super hornets to the ongoing integration of the f 35cs into the carrier air wing to a 2022 emphasis on cost saving measures whitesell says u s naval aviation is on a path to eliminate fighter gaps in the next three years while achieving new mission capable rate goals affordably we can t afford the ultimate numbers that we have at this price that we re paying today we have to squeeze efficiencies out and that is the 2022 focus for naval aviation is the cost transformation whitesell said referring to the mission capable rates the navy uses to evaluate the readiness of its aircraft but congress remains skeptical of the service s math on its strike fighter shortfall which the navy says it can eliminate by 2025 five years sooner than anticipated air wing of the future the navy s future carrier air wing will include a mix of both fourth and fifth generation aircraft with the f 35c and the super hornets making up the strike fighter fleet the recent f 35c deployment aboard uss carl vinson cvn 70 the first fifth generation aviation deployment on a carrier featured a squadron of 10 aircraft so the navy could get the f 35 operating forward quickly the primary driver right now is get the maximum capability in fifth generation platforms forward into the western pacific whitesell said that s why the next navy f 35c deployment by the warhawks of vfa 97 from naval air station lemoore calif will include 14 planes the number currently planned for f 35c squadrons as lockheed martin continues to build there is potential to go to 20 total deployed on a single carrier whitesell said and now we have to decide whether that s going to be a single squadron or whether it s going to be two squadrons or if comes along faster exactly how we re going to build jsf out while increasing the number of f 35cs and ea 18g growlers in the air wing is a possibility whitesell pointed to numerous factors to consider including the carrier s deck density the planned introduction of the mq 25a stingray unmanned tanker into the air wing the new ford class aircraft carriers and the manning required for operating 20 f 35cs we re also looking at resizing what the helicopter community s going to look like on the carrier because as i plus up from 10 to 14 as i add five mq 25 growler ea 18g at seven platforms and then start to think about manned unmanned teaming now we have to wait until we transition to ford class he said the difference in the loading from a nimitz class to a ford class we just did the experiments up in lakehurst about three or four weeks ago and the loading on ford class gives us a ton of different options on what future air wings are going to look like moving the island aft having more capacity for storage gerald r ford is going to be a game changer for us when it comes down to capability and numbers on a flight deck vinson s recent deployment included seven growlers two more than the typical five in an electronic attack squadron and carrier strike group 1 commander rear adm dan martin said the crew wanted more after seeing how the platform operated in the u s 7th fleet area of responsibility with the f 35c it s a brand new aircraft with advanced sensors so we like to pair them with the growler to complement each other and when you fly around that theater collection operations become a big deal martin said of the f 35c during a recent usni news trip aboard vinson now that vinson has completed its deployment to the indo pacific whitesell will hear feedback from the first navy f 35c and cmv 22b squadrons to deploy the argonauts of vfa 147 strike fighter squadron vfa from naval air station lemoore calif will be key to understanding how the f 35c operated in a maritime environment whitesell said learning how the afloat spares package maintenance kit worked aboard the carrier and how the squadron managed in the joint strike fighter s global supply chain is at the top of his list of questions now that the first deployment is complete with our international coalition partners flying the platform too when we ask for a part did we lose out to another country when we were on deployment where were we on the pecking order right now it looks like we fared well but i need to talk to lockheed martin since they run the asp and the global spares program he said the air boss said he also needs to look at the f 35c mission capable rates during the deployment and see if the numbers are attributable to the supply of parts or maintenance aboard the ship for that generation five fighter to be fully full mission capable what was the percentage rate which right now looks on paper starkly low but now what systems were not up and how did it really affect if we had to go into conflict what would that be and then what do we have to do to fix it whitesell said is it a supplies based system or is it us talking to lockheed martin and their subprimes to understand what through reliability control boards what parts need to last longer and then it also goes back to us we don t wait on just in time delivery of parts on the carrier we stock the carrier and we have some repair capability on the carrier what can i do to improve the range and depth of supply items and then what can i do to potentially repair things on the ship as we move towards that model during the recent deployment the f 35c squadron found that some seals on the aircraft did not function as planned in the at sea environment there s already new design coming out of lockheed martin for the new seals he said so there s some learning that s been done but those platforms have to be remeasured against the baseline to find out how they fared on this deployment strike fighter gaps while quickly moving the f 35c out to the fleet will help the navy mitigate the strike fighter shortfall the service is also working its way out of a backlog for super hornet modernization the navy s stated goal is to eliminate the strike fighter shortfall by 2025 an objective whitesell described as having several moving parts according to the service the current shortfall is 35 aircraft the navy is required to have nine carrier air wings and has called for each air wing to include 44 strike fighters for a total of 396 combat coded aircraft according to a 2020 summary reviewed by usni news in addition to the strike fighters earmarked for air wings the navy says it needs 263 for training and development and 126 in long term maintenance for a total of 785 fighters these numbers do not include attrition reserve aircraft the shortfall is the difference between the number of aircraft in the navy s inventory and the number of combat coded strike fighters it says it needs to meet its missions or 396 as a result of reforms implemented through the naval sustainment system aviation and performance to plan initiatives the u s navy has steadily reduced its strike fighter shortfall over the past several years from 65 in 2018 to less than 35 in 2022 whitesell recently told usni news in a statement while the strike fighter inventory has been effectively managed to ensure that operational requirements have consistently been met a further reduction in strike fighter shortfall will decrease the burden on our fleet maintainers the navy projected the shortfall would be 44 aircraft in 2022 40 in 2023 22 in 2024 and falling to 0 in 2025 according to a briefing provided to congress with the fy 2022 budget submission and obtained by usni news working out of the backlog of block ii super hornets entering the service life modification program will also help decrease the gap in navy fighter requirements the service is currently performing preparation work to ensure boeing receives aircraft to upgrade in a timely manner and at an appropriate cost we ve done pre slm work based on what boeing has seen now we re in pre slm maintenance corrosion work and those are the jets that are butting up against 6 000 hours and once they get done they don t go back to the fleet they go right to boeing we ve completed 19 of those whitesell said we ve done something called maintenance reset he added and that is again taking the data that we ve found from boeing and we ve gone back through and put jets through maintenance reset and we ve got about 40 jets block iis that are in maintenance resets now those will go back to the fleet for those birds boeing s slm upgrades are meant to increase the flight hours of the super hornets by several thousand and enable them to transport more weapons at longer ranges with a little more stealth bringing them up to block iii configuration boston consulting group also helped boeing evaluate how to improve the slm project so it could quickly move the block ii super hornets through the upgrade line and mitigate the backlog but the slm backlog is a concern for congress particularly the house armed services committee which has cited the program for its skepticism of the navy s goal to eliminate the shortfall by 2025 report language accompanying the house s version of the fiscal year 2022 defense authorization bill cited the removal of 104 aircraft from the slm program the delayed timeline for the f a xx program and fewer f 35c procurements than previously projected in calling the navy s math highly circumspect prior navy projections said the service would eliminate the shortfall by 2030 a hasc aide recently told usni news that the navy appears to have reduced its force structure requirement for strike fighters in part by taking away the combat coded missions from the reserve squadrons to mitigate the shortfall sooner they also make rosy assumptions about the performance of the service life modification line in that it s going to start putting out jets on the schedule that they re planning for but they haven t yet actually executed to date yet in terms of the time to go through the line the aide said whitesell said the navy is increasing the number of hours the block iii hornets and the block ii aircraft are slated to fly each year the service originally planned for each super hornet to fly between 210 and 230 hours per year but now the navy is increasing that number to 300 hours per year whitesell said with the slm initiative to upgrade the block ii super hornets from 6 000 total flying hours to 10 000 and then increasing the number of hours each aircraft flies per year the air boss said he has a cushion between when the super hornets eventually retire in the 2030s and when the navy s next generation air dominance family of systems begins to enter service we did not expect to have to go beyond their service life and there was no plan that s why we were stuck more sand coming out of the hourglass than coming in now we ve planned for it he said slm has been a planned process by the program office now we have some capacity for next generation air dominance and f a xx development so it built some space by increasing the number of hours the new block iii aircraft and the upgraded block ii aircraft can fly each year the super hornets service lives have been extended by roughly 13 years whitesell said eliminating the shortfall by 2025 is also contingent on lockheed martin delivering the f 35c on time we ve already had 15 deliveries out of slm from boeing so the deliveries have already started the fact that lockheed martin will ramp up their deliveries when it goes into the model that s why adm loiselle has said that by 25 we won t have a strike fighter inventory shortfall and that s the model whitesell said referring to the director of the chief of naval operation s air warfare directorate opnav n98 but hasc is not convinced a second committee aide noted that the navy s fy 2022 projections for f 35c procurement decreased from its fy 2021 projections the service s fy 2022 outlook showed it purchasing 20 f 35cs each year between fy 2023 and fy 2026 while the prior year s projections showed a buy of 22 f 35cs in fy 2023 22 in fy 2024 and 24 in fy 2025 according to the summaries reviewed by usni news the changes amount to a decrease of 8 aircraft through the year the navy says it will eliminate the shortfall the summaries also show the shortfall projections increasing between fy 2021 and fy 2022 overall they decreased their strike fighter requirements in their inventory which kind of had an artificial effect of oh look we don t have as many strike fighters that we need to replace now the first committee aide said basically they re decreasing their force structure and then marketing it as oh look we re resolving our strike fighter shortfall five years early the aide added asked how the navy would go from a 22 aircraft shortfall in fy 2024 to 0 in fy 2025 a spokesman for naval air forces pointed to the navy s decision to use u s air force f 16 falcons and swiss air force f 5 tigers for the service s adversary squadrons n pb22 the navy changed the adversary recapitalization plan so that f a 18c d hornets in two adversary squadrons will now be replaced with f 16 fighting falcons from the u s air force and f 5 tiger iis from the swiss air force instead of transitioning to super hornets in fy25 cmdr zachary harrell told usni news in a statement this resulted in significant savings in operational cost to our adversary units and a reduction in 20 super hornets required in the u s navy strike fighter inventory future budgets may affect strike fighter inventory management but the naval sustainment system aviation and performance to plan initiatives continue to make strides in returning long term down aircraft to the fleet and the current u s navy strike fighter inventory is the healthiest it has been in the last 20 years harrell added but the committee in the report accompanying its version of the fy 2022 defense policy bill also voiced concern over this plan because the f 16s and f 5s will not be capable of surging for combat if necessary like the reserve squadrons the panel at the time wrote that the navy is taking away the combat coded mission requirement from the adversary squadrons to more quickly eliminate the strike fighter shortfall ith the navy transitioning their adversary squadrons to f 16 and f 5 aircraft they ve eliminated a longstanding mission requirement of the adversary squadrons in that they could in the past be available and counted as combat coded f 18 force structure if ever needed to support a warfighting contingency operation the first committee aide told usni news since f 5 and f 16 aircraft they plan to use will not be combat capable the navy has less combat coded strike fighters in their inventory to be concerned about keeping relevant and crews proficient mission capable rates while addressing the strike fighter shortfall will help the navy deploy more f 35cs to the u s military s priority region of the indo pacific the service also remains focused on the readiness of aircraft in its inventory more than three years after defense secretary jim mattis set a requirement for the super hornet fleet to achieve an 80 percent mission capable rate the navy has increased the readiness goals for the strike fighters while 341 mission capable super hornets was the previous goal whitesell said the super hornets new objective is 360 jets we re pushing up in the 350s the high 340s to 350s and we ve touched 360 about nine times since we ve changed the number to 360 what we have found is that it s not the nss process that needs changing whitesell said referring to the naval sustainment system program which adopts commercial aviation s best maintenance methods to make navy aircraft sustainment more efficient nss is working whitesell said but the impediment to hitting 360 mission capable super hornets is the logjam of block ii aircraft waiting for service life modifications we ve found that the jets that are in our reporting inventory the jets that are going into slm the ones that are in backlog at slm those numbers have been the biggest driver we get to 360 he said once we get it moving so that it gets to the 12 to 15 month delivery it gets down to the 6 to 8 million cost for delivery and we start that assembly line of slm birds coming out it s the inventory not the process that s driving the road to 360 the navy also now has a consistent method for calculating these mission capable numbers based on operational planning and combatant commanders needs whereas before the service lacked a standardized formula for determining the rates we applied it to two different reference models one was the most tasking plan and the other was a set of plans that are run by the joint staff so we didn t trust one model we calculated it both ways and we found out the numbers and the methodology for calculating mc we could come up with a standardized set of numbers that number one was approved by the combatant commanders and number two with any mc number there s money attached to that because you ve got to maintain it so now we found something a capability or capacity in building mc that could agree with because they ve got to pay for it whitesell said the navy has defined north star numbers or a target number of mission capable aircraft for each platform the objectives are 86 ea 18g growlers 34 e 2d advanced hawkeyes 77 p 8a poseidon aircraft 128 mh 60s helicopters 126 mh 60r helicopters and 16 cmv 22bs the p 8s and mh 60 helicopters are currently above their respective target mission capable numbers while the growlers and ospreys are each fewer than 10 below their targets whitesell told usni news in a statement this month whitesell noted the navy is still getting deliveries for the osprey squadrons meaning the target number for the platform is more than what the navy has in its inventory the marine corps is also following the same methodology to determine the mission capable numbers for its aircraft now we ve got numbers that apply to every platform in our inventory and the marine corps bought off on a methodology to calculate their mc numbers too and we re using the same methodology across navy and the marine corps to determine what mc is like whitesell said in the interview last month finding efficiencies whitesell s efforts within naval aviation come amid an unpredictable budget environment while service officials have forecast flat budgets in the coming years it s unclear what the biden administration s upcoming fy 2023 submission will look like usni news recently reported that the defense department s fy 2023 topline could be more than 770 billion which would be about a 55 billion increase from fy 2022 the air boss has been directed to look for money to maintain aviation readiness within his type command vice chief of naval operations adm bill lescher told whitesell that any money he saves he can keep within the naval aviation enterprise where can we find efficiencies ruthlessly look at our processes understand where we can do things faster cheaper we can make sure that parts are more reliable working with primes as well as other contractors whitesell said we can look at how we operate them on what we re doing with some of the platforms and then how we can squeeze some of the money out and we ve found money to do that he added so this isn t one where i just go with hat in hand saying if you want to have this requirement you ve got to pay me one area where the navy could find efficiencies according to whitesell is in naval aviation s partnership with naval supplies systems command they do the reliability control boards so they know what we ve bought what the components are specc ed to last for and then they do the analysis on every part in every platform that is a high priority part or a high fail time part and then we try to understand why it fails he said for example whitesell said navsup helped the navy figure out what parts for the e 2d advanced hawkeye needed design tweaks or repairs they found out why they were failing back to the contractors and they ve implemented some repairs on those components or changed the engineering changed the design form he said so time on wing is what we re measuring right now and ultimately we just want the things to stay on the wing the way they were designed

panel of housing experts sees pandemic fueled deficits sticking around until then panel expects a two year climb back to pre pandemic for sale inventory levels share of first time buyers is forecast to stay below 2019 levels until 2024 home price appreciation should outstrip all inflation measures this year except that of energy seattle march 24 2022 prnewswire the housing market is expected to return to pre pandemic 2019 norms at least in terms of inventory and the share of purchases made by first time home buyers by 2024 according to a panel of housing market experts polled in the latest zillow home price expectations survey 1 zillow logo prnewsfoto zillow group the dwindling supply of homes for sale has been a key driver of the recent explosion in u s home values which have risen 32 in the past two years total inventory has fallen from a monthly average of 1 6 million units in 2018 and 2019 to just over 1 million in 2021 and monthly figures in 2022 are lower still inventory should return to a monthly average of 1 5 million units or higher in 2024 according to the largest group 38 of respondents to zillow s survey but many are more optimistic the second largest group 36 believes supply will bounce back to pre pandemic levels in 2023 while 2025 earned the third highest share of votes with 12 inventory and mortgage rates will determine how far and how fast home prices will rise this year and beyond said zillow senior economist jeff tucker we are seeing new listings returning to the market slowly as we enter the hottest selling season of the year but this supply deficit is going to take a long time to fill return of the first time home buyer the pandemic ushered in record breaking price growth alongside rent hikes that made saving for down payments even more difficult as a result the share of first time home buyers dropped from 45 in 2019 to 37 in 2021 according to a zillow survey of recent buyers first time buyers should regain their pre pandemic share of the market in a couple of years according to the majority of experts polled with 26 pointing to 2024 and 25 liking 2025 eighteen percent of the experts polled did not believe the share of first time buyers will rise above 45 until after 2030 despite millennials the largest u s generation ever aging well into their prime home buying years before that time inflation considerations inflation has already begun eroding the bottom lines of american households with the bureau of labor statistics noting rising costs for energy housing and food as prime factors driving it to a four decade high of the six categories considered survey participants expect energy prices to increase the most over the course of 2022 followed by house prices residential rents and food costs employee wages and stock prices were ranked fifth and sixth respectively rounding out the list price growth projections pulsenomics founder terry loebs said the panel s average projections for home price growth in 2022 have been revised upward from 6 6 three months ago to 9 in this survey against the backdrop of tightening fed policy and increasing mortgage rates this more bullish outlook for home values suggests that home inventory shortages will remain the dominant price driver this year loebs said if price increases this year for homes rents energy and food each exceed wage growth as the panel expects home affordability challenges will intensify further especially for low and moderate income renters zillow economists forecast a 16 3 rise in typical home values from february through december 1 this

denise winfree has lived on coalter street in mosby court for the past 10 years known affectionately to her neighbors as ms dee this vivacious and friendly grandmother of six is gracious enough to give us a tour of her home the space is quite small with a living room and a kitchen on the first floor tucked here and there are culturally significant pieces of art cozy throws and other comfort items and placards on her cinderblock walls with sayings as positive as what she wears on her shirt which proclaims good vibes only winfree s demeanor is energetic even joyful as she describes her tiny kitchen with a half sized stove i enjoy having all the family over she says so we can have big family dinners but the stove is a problem it s so small it cooks good but it takes a lot for me to have to keep cooking and cooking winfree is one of about 10 000 public housing residents preparing to put richmond s aging public housing units behind them over the next several years the richmond redevelopment and housing authority intends to demolish the six largest public housing developments and replace those with mixed income units living on a fixed income winfree says she s willing to pay a little more for the premiums she most wants but those premiums are things that most people take for granted she has a washer but not a dryer upstairs she has two bedrooms and a bathroom that most would describe as tiny and she has two closets without any doors i am very hopeful for the new plan that richmond redevelopment housing authority is going to have when they re going to tear it down and put up the new i want to be a part of it i want to be a participant involved in what they re going to be doing and i want to give full input i believe i have some good ideas housing communities that have become synonymous with violence drugs and crime were touted as a bright new beginning when they were first built an outgrowth of president franklin delano roosevelt s new deal the first federally subsidized housing in richmond was gilpin court in the jackson ward neighborhood started in 1941 but not finished until 1943 because of complications brought on by world war ii a decade later on the southside hillside court opened for white people only then in the east end came creighton whitcomb fairfield and mosby courts the genesis of public housing in other virginia localities was similar between the early 1940s and the early 1960s charlottesville and communities in hampton roads and northern virginia created housing developments for the lowest income usually black residents sometimes these urban renewal schemes involved demolishing mostly black neighborhoods which were deemed substandard housing or even slums and then rebuilding or even relocating residents to less visible but still poor parts of town in fact in richmond the task of building these communities was initially referred to as slum clearing according to city records and the headlines in the richmond times dispatch when mayor gordon ambler struck the first ceremonial blow that would demolish homes of more than 300 families he did so with john riis by his side riis was the son of jacob riis famous for documenting the misery of new york slums in his book how the other half lives and motivating the nation to do better for the poorest among us the younger riis incidentally was a reporter for the richmond news leader for 20 years as he stood with richmond s mayor and civic leaders at the commencement of this massive urban renewal project it appeared to most that they were doing a great thing for richmond s poor and working class citizens mostly black people however many of the supposed slum dwellers became homeless or ended up living with relatives in quarters that were much too small for many years after the promise of new housing for hundreds was delayed by the need to house defense department workers and then by the final project being large enough for only a fraction of those who had been evicted from the area that had been called apostle town one of the goals of public housing nationwide was to put willing workers in close proximity to jobs and economic opportunities in the city in richmond as in most of america over the decades urban employment opportunities moved elsewhere that exodus to the suburbs often referred to as white flight and many decades without public transportation to reach well paying jobs created economic dead ends for many public housing occupants in this way an outsized share of city crime problems took root in public housing communities those who managed to earn enough to escape areas of high poverty were legally barred from buying or renting in higher income areas if those individuals were black current social problems in virginia s public housing communities have clear connections with systemic racism in virginia s past it was only with the passage of civil rights laws including legislation related to fair housing that economic and social mobility has become more possible in more recent years many of the descendants of whites who fled urban centers have begun to return to america s cities including those in virginia bringing with them concerns about gentrification of displacing lower income residents who cannot afford to live in increasingly affluent neighborhoods but public housing has remained a kind of refuge albeit not always a desirable option for those who don t earn a great deal unlike affordable housing government owned and operated public housing caps the amount of rent a tenant pays at no more than 30 of income no matter how low the income in virginia s cities much of the public housing stock has become outdated and problematic for a number of reasons for decades richmond leaders have talked about wanting to re envision and recreate these neighborhoods and it appears that the time may have come in the past two years rrha has won substantial grant funding to begin the makeover of public housing following a trend set by the federal government s housing and urban development to demolish public housing and replace it with mixed income communities in the blueprints for these improved neighborhoods public housing tenants live alongside wealthier neighbors with little perceptible distinction in the way the units appear interim rrha director stacey daniels fayson shares a vision of how good life might be for thousands of public housing tenants once these mixed income units are complete she says i would like to see our families have the amenities that we have in terms of you know wi fi washer dryer 21st century stoves refrigerators appliances and you know some people may think well that s not really a lot but i think it is in stages the housing authority is engaging residents to hear what they want in new homes elsewhere or rebuilt on the current sites assisting with temporary relocation and providing credits or vouchers to allow current tenants to rent or purchase new homes and in time to return to their rebuilt communities if they choose daniels fayson says it s very important for us to work strategically with the city as well as our stakeholders and others to ensure that any project that we have any redevelopment efforts that we have is appropriately funded and is completed it may not necessarily be completed on time just because of the nature of the business and in terms of construction but we want to be very responsible and intentional and in terms of how we redevelop rrha is one of more than 3 000 public housing authorities funded by hud which is making wholesale moves nationwide towards community partnerships and mixed income communities in charlottesville it was residents who campaigned for improvements following the 2017 unite the right rally racial inequities fueled an aggressive quest to abate some of the systemic racism that had led to poor housing opportunities and now charlottesville is diversifying ownership of public housing and renovating more of its properties in norfolk also plans are underway for mixed income communities created by partners one of richmond s partners the better housing coalition has used its nonprofit resources for more than three decades currently bhc provides affordable housing for more than three thousand richmonders bhc s president and ceo greta harris says she is excited to be among the partners bringing a needed change for public housing tenants she says there was a single dad with two young kids who formerly lived in creighton court public housing and he moved into our one of our newer development in church hill call the goodwyn that s on venable street and when one of our teammates was showing him around the new unit that he would be in he started crying because some of the public housing units the interior walls are cinderblock that s what you see there s sometimes questionable heat no air conditioning when you have dirty clothes you have to pick them up and take them to a when he walked in he had an open space plan big windows with wonderful light coming in granite countertops pendant lighting and full size washer dryer and a thermostat that he could control and it s wonderful to be able to see it see people have hope that their future can be better than their present armstrong renaissance is one of the new communities where rrha better housing and several others are partnering for a mixed income development with both rentals and homes for purchase it s right across the street from creighton court and some of its first residents came from creighton residents of the new development preferred to remain anonymous but several expressed great satisfaction with their homes one woman was heading to her job but stopped to share that this is something totally different from over there in creighton it s more spacious i have three floors everything in here is brand new it s a lot of things that you can t do over there that you can do here and my kids love it she goes on to tell me that when she lived in creighton she didn t go outside or allow her children to play outside because of the threat of crime but here as the security guard passes on patrol she says she feels safe and it s no problem for her children to play outdoors harris says she believes that living in an upgraded space improves people s mental and emotional outlook in ways that most might not appreciate i think over time you become more willing to take risks and to step out of your comfort zone in order to achieve the dreams that you may have for yourself or your family i think when you have a good place to call home and what we offer is not luxury by any stretch of the imagination but it s safe it s clean it s quality and you build community and so you feel like you have wind under your wings in order to take a step forward and try to accomplish things that may be just out of reach some longtime public housing residents are skeptical that the change will be good for everyone shakima broaddus grew up in gilpin court and is now in other public housing but she is in the process of buying a first home for her family she says there are a few people who prefer to live on the system rather than pushing to own more and be more self sufficient broaddus says i think people don t like to hear that you re living off the system but you have some people that really are because you have folks that can go out and get a job and they choose not to because they re getting assistance and if you apply for assistance and you work you get denied broaddus says public housing is better as a temporary solution and that while she enjoyed the sense of community at gilpin court she thinks it s time for something new in its place omari al qadaffi is a community organizer and housing activist he has focused for years on what s best for low income residents in richmond even now he tends a green space he helped create next to mosby court and he warns of the danger of giving too much control to private partners even well intentioned nonprofits he says i would much rather see public housing renovated and not turned over to a private developer or a private landlord it s it s a public resource that really needs to stay in the public sphere you know there is no data that shows that this large group of people you know they moved over to mixed use mixed income housing and then their lives just were so improved of course i mean of course it s going to happen to you know a small amount of people but i i m not sure that there s data that really shows that it s because they you know someone moved to another place history does support some of what concerns him in the 1990s as hud implemented its hope vi program to revitalize america s urban centers results were not universally positive in richmond s blackwell neighborhood the demolition of more than 400 public housing units with a promise of hundreds of new mixed housing units translated into only a few dozen new homes and 25 years later most of blackwell s former public housing residents are scattered some became homeless and hope iv is still unfinished also there is research suggesting that families who relocate from public to mixed income housing have not necessarily found a better quality of life in a 12 year duke university study many of those who relocated reported feeling isolated and far away from some of their most essential services for black boys in particular studies showed great difficulties readjusting and finding a sense of well being al qaddafi s skepticism extends to concerns that dissolving pockets of poverty might also dissolve concentrations of black voting power he says that by scattering so many black families including those with many children it s likely that we will begin to see school closures and less political representation for black residents in the city of richmond and in other urban communities al qaddafi says i think that the promises of public housing haven t been realized yet you know advocates including myself we like to look towards the the opportunities that are in like the section three program that is the mechanism that gives priority for contracting and employment opportunities wealth building opportunities for low income residents and a much higher priority for public housing residents and you know there s been so many studies about the missed opportunities to inject wealth into the communities through those mechanisms you know and i really think that those are real ways using the section three program that s that s a real way where you re not just giving money over to nonprofits to deal with people in a paternalistic way you re actually you know because that s that s that s not empowerment you know that s not sustainable section three of the 1968 housing and development act earmarks money for wealth building opportunities for people living in public housing it is not a part of this revitalization project al qaddafi and other advocates have voices concerns including what happens to rent when the tax credits and vouchers expire loss of access to services like public transportation and the potential of a net loss of public housing units rrha s daniels fayson says many of the potential pitfalls are being addressed as the region learns from past mistakes and as rrha works hard to gain and keep the trust of residents she says it s a priority harris also highlights the many services provided for those who make the move so that even if their rent increases slightly they find supports in terms of job training access to transportation and educational opportunities so they get a genuine chance at a life makeover that is more than a surface change denise winfree says she is ready while she doesn t claim complete trust in the system or the process she is willing to take a chance and this is why she is answering the surveys and attending meetings sponsored by rrha she says it was about six of us i believe on the zoom meeting it may have been eight but everybody was hopeful we all were putting in good good information and it was recognized and it was accepted so they are

investorplace stock market news stock advice trading tips russian president vladimir putin invited the world s scorn upon the country s invasion of ukraine resulting in a severe if not unprecedented isolation of his country russian defense stocks must be earning some hushed sideways glances due to the special military operation apparently not going to plan on the other side of the atlantic and the pacific u s and western based defense stocks are enjoying an industry renaissance to put it cynically few military experts anticipated that the ukrainian resistance would put up this much of a fight and be so devastatingly effective that s not to say that ukraine hasn t suffered severely because it has still love of the homeland combined with american weapons technology has done wonders per a statement from the white house the u s government will send an additional 800 million in security assistance to ukraine under the plan several diverse weapons systems will make their way to the embattled nation including anti aircraft and anti armor missiles essentially it s christmas time for defense stocks even though we re only heading into april not december ukrainians are making defense contractors look great much like a nimble wide receiver putting his quarterback in the best possible light thus these defense stocks represent a bright spot in an otherwise muddy market environment lockheed martin nyse lmt nyse raytheon technologies nyse rtx nyse aerovironment nasdaq avav nasdaq olin nyse oln nyse booz allen hamilton nyse bah nyse dupont nyse dd nyse general dynamics nyse gd defense stocks to buy lockheed martin lmt source ken wolter shutterstock com developed under a joint venture between lockheed martin and raytheon technologies the javelin anti tank missile has become the de facto symbol of resistance in the battlefields of ukraine fired from the shoulder the javelin is terrifying because death can literally arrive from anywhere the effectiveness of this weapons system comes down to its trajectory though fired from the ground the javelin quickly finds its way skyward before screaming down onto its target tanks typically have their hardest protective compounds to the side while the top is relatively vulnerable it s no wonder why some russians abandoned their tanks and other vehicles getting hit by a javelin is a horrible way to die a u s special operations official reported that out of 300 missiles he had seen estimates of 280 russian armored vehicles taken out by the javelin while it s hard to know how precise those numbers are the undeniable effectiveness of the weapon will likely warrant massive demand everywhere raytheon technologies rtx source jordan tan shutterstock com though raytheon technologies deserves just as much credit as lockheed martin for the javelin anti tank missile i m going to share the love individually for rtx by mentioning the stinger anti aircraft weapons system just like its arguably more popular cousin the stinger is shoulder fired unfortunately the fog of war prevents independent analysts from verifying the statistical effectiveness of the stinger nevertheless newsweek reported that per the ukrainian ministry of foreign affairs russia had lost 77 aircraft since its invasion as of march 14 in addition the ministry stated that russia also suffered the loss of 90 helicopters since the start of hostilities again these numbers cannot be independently verified still videos from the fighting demonstrate how deathly frightening being a russian helicopter pilot must be during this war as with lockheed raytheon is one of the defense stocks to buy since its brand is basically enjoying real time proof of effectiveness of its products defense stocks to buy aerovironment avav source pavel kapysh shutterstock com throughout the conflict ukrainian officials from president volodymyr zelenskyy on downward have begged for the u s and nato forces to impose a no fly zone over ukraine however western leaders have been reluctant to even consider this option as it would square up the u s and europe against russia understandably europeans are especially concerned because that might bring war to their front door still all hope for the ukrainian resistance is not lost drones have proven especially deadly to russian invaders and that brings aerovironment into the picture specializing in the switchblade drone they distinguish themselves from other unmanned aircraft in that the drones themselves are the weapons hence the term kamikaze drones but the pivotal reason why they are effective is that they re small and easily deployed with soldiers able to hit targets outside the line of sight should russian forces advance into more urban areas of ukraine the switchblade could unleash excruciating devastation thus avav is looking great among defense stocks as the switchblade could be yet another symbol of the defense of global democracy olin oln source igorgolovniov shutterstock com typically i mention olin under the context of publicly traded firearms businesses however it has easily become one of the most significant defense stocks to buy because of the crisis in ukraine true olin doesn t generate the coverage of lockheed or raytheon however if there is a true fundamental symbol of resistance it could be olin why back in october 2020 the company made news when it assumed full management and operational control of the lake city army ammunition plant in independence missouri essentially the move makes olin the u s army s largest supplier of small caliber ammunition given its relevance to the military industrial complex olin may play a significant role in the fight for ukrainian independence as events unfold in ukraine we ve seen everyday people picking up guns and ammo and defending their homeland under a context where firearms in the u s have come under heavy political pressure it s a positive for olin and defense stocks in general to tie in with an alternate storyline defense stocks to buy booz allen hamilton bah source jer123 shutterstock com while the actual fighting and bloodshed may be thousands of miles away from the u s the double edged sword of connected technologies means that serious conflict is only a mouse click away because of the severe sanctions that western allies imposed on russia concerns erupted that the kremlin could retaliate with cyberattacks cynically this threat profile boosts the relevance of booz allen hamilton specializing in cyber defense among other services booz stands prepared to defend u s agencies and critical infrastructure from nefarious online activities to be fair it s not a given that the russians will launch cyberattacks against western forces further the social and economic devastation that could stem from cyberattacks means that companies like booz allen hamilton are on the front lines therefore i like bah and other defense stocks related to cybersecurity dupont dd source ricochet64 shutterstock com known worldwide as a chemicals and applied sciences specialist i wouldn t normally plug dupont as one of the defense stocks to buy however under the biden administration s aid package it will send defensive assets to ukraine such as body armor as it turns out dupont originated the kevlar material that forms the backbone of such armor here s an important history lesson stephanie kwolek invented kevlar and per the non for profit organization kevlar survivors club the underlying material has documented 3 200 lives saved kwolek s work is playing a critical role on in the battlegrounds of ukraine as resistance forces desperately struggle against a numerically superior enemy while most defense stocks that will see upside from this conflict are related to offensive weapons dd provides an excellent alternative to those that may be squeamish about the military industrial complex defense stocks to buy general dynamics gd source casimiro pt shutterstock com arguably best known for developing the f 16 fighting falcon general dynamics is a rather versatile name among defense stocks the company is also in the business of producing mortars per its website general dynamics ordnance and tactical systems produces mortar bodies for the full range of the u s army s 120mm mortar munitions inventory mortar production includes the m934 high explosive he the m929 smoke the xm930 illumination and the m931 full range training round frtr why is this important according to the latest security assistance plan for ukraine the u s will send over 20 million rounds of small arms ammunition and grenade launcher and mortar rounds to be frank i m not a mortar expert i usually write about cryptocurrencies so i m not entirely sure if general dynamics will be involved with this assistance package however so long as the fighting continues the need for deadly projectiles will rise especially as urban fighting will likely bunch up soft

addis ababa ethiopia s government on thursday declared an indefinite humanitarian truce effective immediately saying it hoped to help hasten delivery of emergency aid into the tigray region where hundreds of thousands face starvation since war broke out in northern ethiopia in november 2020 thousands have died and many more have been forced to flee their homes as the conflict has expanded from tigray to the neighboring regions of amhara and afar prime minister abiy ahmed s government is committed to exert maximum effort to facilitate the free flow of emergency humanitarian aid into the tigray region it said in a statement to optimize the success of the humanitarian truce the government calls upon the insurgents in tigray to desist from all acts of further aggression and withdraw from areas they have occupied in neighboring regions it said the government of ethiopia hopes that this truce will substantially improve the humanitarian situation on the ground and pave the way for the resolution of the conflict in the northern ethiopia without further bloodshed the conflict erupted when abiy sent troops into tigray to topple the tigray people s liberation front tplf the region s former ruling party saying the move came in response to rebel attacks on army camps fighting has dragged on for over a year triggering a humanitarian crisis as accounts have emerged of mass rapes and massacres with both sides accused of human rights violations more than 400 000 people have been displaced in tigray according to the u n the region has also been subject to what the u n says is a de facto blockade the united states has accused abiy s government of preventing aid from reaching those in need while the authorities in turn have blamed the rebels for the obstruction nearly 40 percent of the people in tigray a region of 6 million people face an extreme lack of food the u n said in january with fuel shortages forcing aid workers to deliver medicines and other crucial supplies on foot there was no immediate reaction from the tplf to the government s announcement welcome news western nations have been urging both sides to agree to a cease fire with britain and canada hailing the truce declaration the uk welcomes the government of ethiopia s decision to announce an indefinite humanitarian truce and to ensure unimpeded access of aid into tigray we call on tigrayan authorities to reciprocate the british embassy in ethiopia said on twitter canada s embassy to ethiopia and djibouti said on twitter that the announcement was welcome news as aid is urgently needed in northern ethiopia diplomats led by olusegun obasanjo the african union s special envoy for the horn of africa have been trying for months to broker peace talks with little evident progress so far analysts said the truce was an important step but urged the government to follow up the announcement with action and ease humanitarian access to tigray the unconditional and unrestricted delivery of aid could also help create enough trust to pave the way for ceasefire talks and eventually dialogue said william davison the international crisis group s senior analyst for ethiopia ground to a halt more than 9 million people need food aid across afar amhara and tigray according to the u n s world food program but humanitarian organizations have been forced to increasingly curtail activities because of fuel and supply shortages wfp operations in the tigray region have ground to a halt with only emergency fuel stocks and less than one percent of the required food stocks remaining the agency said this week a tplf push into afar has worsened the situation driving up the need for emergency aid in the region the road from afar s capital semera to tigray s capital mekele is the only operational land route into tigray where the un estimates hundreds of thousands are living in famine like conditions the government previously declared a unilateral cease fire in tigray in june last year after the tplf mounted a shock comeback and retook the region from federal forces but fighting intensified in the second half of 2021 with the rebels at one point claiming to be within 200 kilometers of the capital addis ababa before reaching a stalemate
by tesfa alem tekle more by this author by afp more by this author ethiopia has declared an indefinite ceasefire to allow free flow of humanitarian aid to the conflict ravaged northern tigray region the humanitarian truce announced thursday by prime minister abiy ahmed s government was effective immediately according to the united nations about 10 million people in northern ethiopia need humanitarian assistance more than half of them in the tigray region international aid agencies have warned that hundreds of thousands of lives could be in danger if aid is not provided immediately the 16 month civil war that broke out in tigray in november 2020 has claimed thousands of lives and forced millions more to flee their homes as the conflict expanded to the neighbouring regions of amhara and afar the truce announcement comes one day after the us special envoy to the horn of africa david satterfield wrapped up his two day official visit in ethiopia advertisement during his stay in addis ababa mr satterfield held talks with top ethiopian government officials un officials and representatives of various humanitarian organisations after his ethiopia visit he told reuters that one among the top priorities of president joe biden s administration is to make sure unhindered humanitarian delivery to the war torn region of tigray and elsewhere fuel and cash on thursday addis said it is taking measures to expedite the provision of humanitarian aid to people in need in the tigray region to this end it has increased the number of united nations humanitarian flights and expedited through improved clearance procedures the delivery of fuel and cash for payments by aid organisations the government said in a statement however currently thousands from the tigray region are trekking into neighbouring regions in search of assistance while it is heartening to see the fraternal bond and solidarity that is being demonstrated by communities that are receiving and helping those in need of assistance the government believes that the situation warrants urgent measures to ensure that those in need are able to receive aid in their localities the statement added the region has been subject to what the un says is a de facto blockade the united states had accused abiy s government of preventing aid from reaching those in need while the authorities in turn have blamed the rebels for the obstruction the commitment being undertaken by the government of ethiopia could have the desired outcome of improving the humanitarian situation on the ground only to the extent that it is reciprocated by the other side to optimise the success of the humanitarian truce the government called on the rebels in the tigray region to desist from all acts of further aggression and withdraw from areas they have occupied in neighbouring regions the government of ethiopia hopes that this truce will substantially improve the humanitarian situation on the ground and pave the way for the resolution of the conflict in northern ethiopia without further bloodshed the statement added rebel fighters loyal to the tigray people s liberation front tplf have been fighting the government and its allied regional and eritrean forces since november 2020 tplf has yet to react to the government s unilateral truce welcome news western nations have been urging both sides to agree to a ceasefire with the uk and canada hailing the truce declaration the uk welcomes the government of ethiopia s decision to announce an indefinite humanitarian truce and to ensure unimpeded access of aid into tigray we call on tigrayan authorities to reciprocate the british embassy in ethiopia said on twitter canada s embassy to ethiopia and djibouti said on twitter that the announcement was welcome news as aid is urgently needed in northern ethiopia diplomats led by olusegun obasanjo the african union s special envoy for the horn of africa have been trying for months to broker peace talks with little evident progress so far analysts said the truce was an important step but urged the government to follow up the announcement with action and ease humanitarian access to tigray the unconditional and unrestricted delivery of aid could also help create enough trust to pave the way for ceasefire talks and eventually dialogue said william davison the international crisis group s senior analyst for

for former anambra state governor mr willie obiano the last seven days have been extremely eventful on march 17 2022 he had had to leave the exalted position of anambra state governor having handed over to mr charles chukwuma soludo on that day while he sat stock still he had to endure the public humiliation that followed his wife s unsightly altercation with mrs bianca ojukwu wife of former biafran warlord mr chukwuemeka odumegwu ojukwu the former governor left the venue shell shocked following the altercation which has since gone viral drawing wave after wave of bad publicity for the former first family of anambra state he was soon to endure more humiliation when the economic and financial crimes commission picked him up murtala mohammed international airport lagos just as he was about to depart to houston texas usa with his family months before his exit from power in anambra state the economic and financial crimes commission had reportedly placed mr obiano on its watch list with time having taken its toll on his immunity as governor the efcc swooped to take him into custody for questioning mr willie obiano s questioning or grilling by the efcc as the case may be was going well away from the prying eyes of the public and the elephantine memory of the social media until a certain video shot just under 12 seconds went viral the video showed the former governor sat in the custody of the efcc clad in shorts and drinking a bottle of water if the video was meant to be funny or to draw plaudits for the efcc for putting the former anambra state governor on the hot seat on allegations of frittering away billions from the coffers of anambra state while he was governor it has spectacularly backfired the chorus of condemnation for the efcc has been loud and lacerating with many fashioning sticks out of the video with which they have poked the ribs of the efcc while mercilessly reminding it of its predilection for media trial the video has also seen many allude to nigeria s lurid romance with ethnicism in alleging that the video was circulated to humiliate the former anambra state governor and strip him of his dignity given that he comes from the southeast region of the country that has held the short end of the stick under a tidal wave of condemnation the efcc has come out to say it has identified its staff who leaked the video and commenced disciplinary actions against him like many others like him who governed states in nigeria mr obiano left office with a mixed legacy reports of quiet achievement in transforming anambra state were quickly offset by allegations of extravagant spending of the state s resources and even debauchery yet that a video which should have drawn mirth from nigerians has instead drawn opprobrium for the efcc shows that it must do more to shake off its perceived obsession with media trial the commission has since scrambled to contain the effects of the video and reiterate that mr willie obiano s predicament at the hands of the commission is not politically motivated but the commission must do more the world is under unprecedented scrutiny from the social media and every day many people and events are always just a click away from going viral and being vaulted into the valley of embarrassment because the internet does not forget once a clip goes viral damage limitation is mostly like closing the stable door after the horse has bolted in a month where the efcc announced that within the last one year it had recovered n152 billlion 386 million and recorded 2 220 convictions what the commission is doing well and what it needs to improve is clear for all to see pervasive corruption remains endemic in nigeria and as the country scrambles to fight the scourge the bodies responsible can do without the distraction occasioned when some of its rogue staff go on a frolic of their own to indulge the wild unpredictability of the social media kene obiezu keneobiezu gmail com

officials said investigators found and seized about 14 kilograms of fentanyl about 1 000 bags of prepackaged fentanyl about 16 000 more fentanyl pills about 75 grams of heroin 41 grams of cocaine base crack a kilogram press four assault style rifles two handguns ammunition multiple false identification cards with rosario hernandez s photo and about 66 000 in counterfeit u s currency to put into perspective how much fentanyl was found just one kilogram has the potential to kill 500 000 people according to the dea it s a potent synthetic opioid that is approximately 100 times more potent than morphine and 50 times more potent than heroin said colleen harrington deputy commissioner of the department of mental health and addiction services the substance has taken the lives of many in connecticut you re talking about 1 500 deaths last year in the state of connecticut 85 of which were connected to fentanyl that s huge harrington said it is alleged that these defendants have been involved in a drug trafficking network that involved a massive amount of fentanyl and the production of thousands of fentanyl pills that could easily be mistaken for legitimate oxycodone pills said u s attorney leonard boyle as fentanyl continues to be the leading cause of overdose deaths in connecticut and around the country we are determined to do everything to stop the flow of this deadly drug into and around our state this case represents one of the largest one time seizures of fentanyl that we ve seen in connecticut and i thank the dea and its task force members for their excellent work their efforts in taking these dangerous drugs and guns off the streets have saved lives rosario hernandez and arias de la cruz have been detained since the bust both were charged with conspiracy to distribute and two counts of possession with intent to distribute 400 grams or more of fentanyl rosario hernandez also was charged with possession of firearms in furtherance of a drug trafficking crime and offenses related to the distribution of heroin and crack cocaine fentanyl is causing deaths in record numbers and dea s top priority is to aggressively pursue anyone who distributes this poison in order to profit and destroy lives said dea special agent in charge brian boyle illegal drug distribution ravages the very foundations of our families and communities so every time we take fentanyl off the streets lives are saved this investigation demonstrates the strength of collaborative local county and state law enforcement efforts in connecticut and our strong partnership with the u s attorney s office this investigation is being conducted by the dea s hartford task force which includes personnel from the dea hartford resident office the connecticut state police and the bristol hartford east hartford enfield manchester new britain rocky hill wethersfield windsor locks and willimantic police departments you can carry a large amount of fentanyl in a very small package and so because of that it s very difficult to stop so whenever law enforcement can stop a load like this it s wonderful to get it off the streets said ken gray a senior lecturer in the department of criminal justice at the university of new haven this case is being prosecuted by assistant u s attorney geoffrey m stone through the organized crime drug enforcement task forces ocdetf program have a story

tesla airbnb and apple will have plenty of opportunities to reward long term investors putting more money into the stock market right now may feel like a risky endeavor the s p 500 the benchmark many investors use to measure how stocks in a broad sense are doing is down about 5 year to date but as unsettling as falling share prices can be they don t signal that it s the time to get out of the market on the contrary a down market can actually be a good time to buy shares of fantastic companies if you have even 1 000 not already committed that you can add to your long term investment portfolio putting it into these no brainer stocks could help you build up your wealth at a time when some others are tapping out of the market 1 airbnb airbnb s abnb 2 37 share price has been all over the place recently i ve felt the price swings too since i bought the stock last year but i m still convinced that airbnb will deliver fantastic results in the coming years because no other company offers the same experience sure you can rent vacation homes via a number of websites but airbnb features an easy to use platform a huge selection 4 million hosts and offers users the opportunity to book unique experiences at their destinations as well indeed i took my family on a four month long road trip in the pre pandemic times during which we stayed almost exclusively in airbnbs we hit the mountains in colorado the beaches of florida and many places in between that trip wouldn t have been possible to do in the same way without airbnb the company has created a unique platform that i don t think the market has fully appreciated yet despite its solid financial results in 2021 airbnb s revenue increased 25 compared to 2019 i m skipping over 2020 because so much travel was essentially shut down due to the pandemic and airbnb s gross booking value jumped 23 over the same period airbnb s bookings have surpassed its pre pandemic bookings and as more parts of the world open back up to travel and drop their covid 19 restrictions the company should continue to benefit with airbnb s strong growth in 2021 and its share price down 15 over the past 12 months this stock looks like a fantastic place to put some cash right now 2 tesla i know tesla tsla 5 59 sparks a lot of opinions both pro and con nearly every investor has a view on the electric vehicle ev leader but one commonly held opinion is that it s too late to profit from this monster ev stock i disagree i think tesla still has room to run for two reasons it s continuing to grow its business at a healthy clip and the ev industry as a whole is still barely past its historical starting line let s consider tesla s growth first in the fourth quarter its vehicle production rose by 70 year over year and total revenue spiked by 65 and that growth came even before some of its newest vehicle production capacity came online sure there s rising competition in the ev market but there should be plenty of room for newcomers to grow without them notably impeding tesla s growth this leads to my second point in 2021 just 9 of all new passenger car sales were evs according to data from canalys by 2030 the research firm estimates that percentage will balloon to 50 tesla is already a leader in the ev market which should position it to maintain an outsized portion of those growing sales tesla s stock isn t cheap by any measure so you would not be making a value play here but if you re looking for a growth stock that s already a leader in a fast growing industry it may be time to put tesla on your buy list 3 apple let s shift gears and talk about a great company that while not the high growth stock it once was still offers plenty of potential upside for investors given apple s aapl 2 19 ability to generate tons of cash and its long term performance in the market it s hard to argue against owning it consider that in the first quarter of apple s fiscal 2022 which ended dec 25 2021 the tech giant s revenue rose 11 year over year and net income was up 20 the company s services business has been a bright spot as well with sales increasing nearly 24 and while some people think that the company is finished innovating it continues to apply its slow and steady approach to new markets those efforts could pay off down the road for example apple is reportedly working on a mixed reality headset either augmented reality or virtual reality or even both that it could release as soon as this year the device could help apple tap into the metaverse an emerging tech trend in which people will in theory use avatars to spend time in persistent virtual shared environments bloomberg analysts have projected that the metaverse could become an 800 billion market by 2024 all apple has to do here is the same thing it has done for decades slowly grab a small slice of a massive tech trend as it emerges and it could end up benefiting hugely if you re looking for a stock that s a little safer right now but still want exposure to the tech sector apple could be just the equity for you the company pays a modest dividend is still achieving strong revenue and earnings growth and is far more stable than many other tech companies
standard chartered bank s regional head of financial markets for africa and the middle east mark price in this interview with eromosele abiodun speaks on the complexities of the financial market and global economic growth he also explores how nigeria can attract portfolio investments to grow the nation s economy you lead the financial markets business in one of the world s biggest emerging markets what was the journey like before you joined standard chartered bank before i joined standard chartered bank i had been to about 50 countries worldwide i lived most of my life in the united kingdom worked in sydney new york singapore and dubai the vast experience and viewpoints that i garnered from all those years and locations have played a massive part in my role in standard chartered bank standard chartered bank reported its highest operating profit since 2015 in africa and the middle east region how did the company achieve such a remarkable feat our record financial performance also establishes the progress made in the execution of our strategy that record shows the hard work commitment and continued cost discipline of the good people of standard chartered bank this has ensured that investments continue through the cycle there has been global inflation how do you think that is playing out for the nigerian economy inflation is quite interesting because i think it impacts countries differently based on the drivers of the economy nigeria is an oil based economy the increase in oil price has been a significant driver of inflation in oil importing countries oil but you would imagine that the case would be different in nigeria because of the production here however we are not necessarily seeing all the benefits with the rise of the price flow through the nigerian economy the central bank is doing its best to tame the inflation effects and we hope they can see so that there is an ease of pressure from the nigerian economy we also observed massive contraction of gdp activity in almost all countries in 2020 thankfully we saw a bounce back in 2021 we are hopeful to see that continue throughout 2022 i will like you to talk about portfolio investment how can a country like nigeria attract portfolio investments a few things make attracting investments difficult in terms of the mechanics of the investment there are good places to put money to work in nigeria there are good yields to be earned and reasonable access to buy my concern is what we have seen in terms of the reduced inflows so a prospective investor s concerns are not about how can i get my money in but how do i get my money out and how long will that take that space is more beneficial to longer term investors and that perhaps narrows the fields of people that want to invest for the amount of money that comes in also the cbn is more focused on making dollars available to the domestic economy and they have done quite well in making dollars available to those who want to repatriate however there has to be a balance at this point because portfolio investors have to wait a bit longer so whatever they have made in terms of returns gets eroded potential foreign investors will have to weigh all the possible scenarios that will look negative so coming into nigeria for now is possibly not happening there are surely structural impediments that need to be straightened out what role does interest rate play in attracting portfolio investments and unlocking interest rates interest rate means returns on investments a high interest rate means that there are higher yields and higher remuneration when you have high interest rates you see currency depreciation a mathematical formula links those two things in a free flow exchange rate environment there will be arbitrage potentials which means you can earn 10 per cent in interest rates beyond depreciation in your currency however in a more controlled exchange rate environment control mechanisms are at play which is very attractive to potential investors do you think the current external conditions are favourable for nigeria to access the eurobond at the moment all new issue bond markets are struggling many other capital markets worldwide are under pressure particularly with what is happening with russia and ukraine so it is currently not easy to raise money except in certain places worldwide i guess it is why nigeria announced a change of plans for the eurobond they understand that the high interest rates will accrue a significant debt burden for the country at this point how is

addis ababa ethiopia s government on thursday declared an indefinite humanitarian truce effective immediately saying it hoped to help hasten delivery of emergency aid into the tigray region where hundreds of thousands face starvation since war broke out in northern ethiopia in november 2020 thousands have died and many more have been forced to flee their homes as the conflict has expanded from tigray to the neighboring regions of amhara and afar prime minister abiy ahmed s government is committed to exert maximum effort to facilitate the free flow of emergency humanitarian aid into the tigray region it said in a statement to optimize the success of the humanitarian truce the government calls upon the insurgents in tigray to desist from all acts of further aggression and withdraw from areas they have occupied in neighboring regions it said the government of ethiopia hopes that this truce will substantially improve the humanitarian situation on the ground and pave the way for the resolution of the conflict in the northern ethiopia without further bloodshed the conflict erupted when abiy sent troops into tigray to topple the tigray people s liberation front tplf the region s former ruling party saying the move came in response to rebel attacks on army camps fighting has dragged on for over a year triggering a humanitarian crisis as accounts have emerged of mass rapes and massacres with both sides accused of human rights violations more than 400 000 people have been displaced in tigray according to the u n the region has also been subject to what the u n says is a de facto blockade the united states has accused abiy s government of preventing aid from reaching those in need while the authorities in turn have blamed the rebels for the obstruction nearly 40 percent of the people in tigray a region of 6 million people face an extreme lack of food the u n said in january with fuel shortages forcing aid workers to deliver medicines and other crucial supplies on foot there was no immediate reaction from the tplf to the government s announcement welcome news western nations have been urging both sides to agree to a cease fire with britain and canada hailing the truce declaration the uk welcomes the government of ethiopia s decision to announce an indefinite humanitarian truce and to ensure unimpeded access of aid into tigray we call on tigrayan authorities to reciprocate the british embassy in ethiopia said on twitter canada s embassy to ethiopia and djibouti said on twitter that the announcement was welcome news as aid is urgently needed in northern ethiopia diplomats led by olusegun obasanjo the african union s special envoy for the horn of africa have been trying for months to broker peace talks with little evident progress so far analysts said the truce was an important step but urged the government to follow up the announcement with action and ease humanitarian access to tigray the unconditional and unrestricted delivery of aid could also help create enough trust to pave the way for ceasefire talks and eventually dialogue said william davison the international crisis group s senior analyst for ethiopia ground to a halt more than 9 million people need food aid across afar amhara and tigray according to the u n s world food program but humanitarian organizations have been forced to increasingly curtail activities because of fuel and supply shortages wfp operations in the tigray region have ground to a halt with only emergency fuel stocks and less than one percent of the required food stocks remaining the agency said this week a tplf push into afar has worsened the situation driving up the need for emergency aid in the region the road from afar s capital semera to tigray s capital mekele is the only operational land route into tigray where the un estimates hundreds of thousands are living in famine like conditions the government previously declared a unilateral cease fire in tigray in june last year after the tplf mounted a shock comeback and retook the region from federal forces but fighting intensified in the second half of 2021 with the rebels at one point claiming to be within 200 kilometers of the capital addis ababa before reaching a stalemate
st george with a rather dismal outlook for utah s water supply continuing into 2022 state lawmakers put nearly 500 million toward water conservation measures of various types during the recent legislative session this includes efforts to meter secondary water sources and incentivize turf removal to drinking quality water development projects utah s population and economy are exploding but our water supply is dwindling brian steed executive director of the utah department of natural resources said in a press release from the washington county water conservancy district we have to protect conserve and develop our water doing nothing and running out of water isn t an option the bills are designed to help bolster water levels in reservoirs throughout the state by reducing demand via grass rebate programs additional metering of secondary water and watershed enhancement efforts statewide water storage is currently below 55 of capacity according to the utah division of water resources house bill 121 imposes water conservation requirements on state owned facilities it also incentives property owners to replace their non functional grass with more water efficient landscaping we re pretty excited about it said karry rathje the communications and government affairs specialist for the washington county water conservancy district however while the bill passed its implementation is still being worked out she said and won t be fully rolled out until 2023 it is anticipated that money for the turf removal incentives up to 5 million annually will come from the state s general fund and be administered through the division of water resources from there it would be granted to applying property owners through local water districts it is estimated that 60 of utah s drinking quality water is used for outdoor watering removal of non functional turf can help decrease that amount and save water overall further replacing turf with a more water efficient landscape also can save on outdoor water use by up to 70 this unprecedented investment in water conservation by our state leaders is music to our ears said zach renstrom general manager of washington county water conservancy district the water conservancy districts have made great strides in reducing water use throughout the state but the recent legislation will elevate our efforts the state is also investing 251 million into secondary water metering use of secondary water or irrigation quality water has not been widely metered measured across the state where it has such as in parts of northern utah like the weber water basin conservancy district a 20 30 reduction in outdoor watering has been tracked over the last 20 years if we know how much water is there we can plan better said rathje adding that while the metering issue largely applies to northern utah it is huge for the state of utah as a whole under recently passed legislation metering secondary water systems now is required under state law there are exceptions however this includes water with levels of turbidity that can actually prove harmful to metering equipment secondary water in washington county is not among the best quality south of the pah tempe hot spring due to the large number of minerals that spring dumps into the virgin river rathje said turbidity in washington county has been hard on meters she said despite this efforts are underway in washington county by various municipalities to better harness and measure their own secondary water use this includes additional water storage projects being eyed in the santa clara area according to a press release from prepare60 which is made up of central utah weber basin jordan valley and washington county water districts outside of the legislature utah s water conservancy districts have spent 355 plus million on conservation programs this has resulted in more than a 20 reduction in the state s per capita water use since 2000 despite

zelensky asks nato for weapons west adds pressure on russia this handout picture taken and released by ukrainian presidential press service on march 21 2022 shows ukrainian president volodymyr zelensky addressing ukrainian people during a broadcast speech brussels belgium president volodymyr zelensky pressed a nato summit thursday to flood weapons into ukraine and western allies responded with new sanctions against russia promises of military aid and discussion of expelling moscow from the international g20 body as battles raged across ukraine with television footage showing a large russian warship ablaze at dockside near the southern city of mariupol zelensky addressed the emergency nato summit and a g7 leaders meeting by video link he said the west should provide all the weapons we need to prevent the deaths of ukrainians from russian strikes from russian occupation kicking off a day of intense diplomacy us president joe biden made clear that the western alliance was listening nato has never been more united biden said and after zelensky said there was a real chance of russian president vladimir putin resorting to chemical warfare biden told reporters we will respond if he uses it biden noted that under his presidency the united states has pledged 2 billion in weapons to ukraine he announced a new commitment to more than 1 billion in humanitarian assistance as well as promising to welcome 100 000 of the nearly 3 7 million refugees fleeing the country after the united states announced new sanctions including targeting russian politicians biden said the west was in it for the long haul intent on increasing the pain on moscow biden intensified the effort to ostracize putin s russia with a call to exclude moscow from the g20 that was raised today biden told reporters adding that if the group of 20 countries does not agree then he would press for ukraine to be allowed to join in his address zelensky said that russia was using phosphorus bombs which cause severe burns conducting indiscriminate shelling of civilians and could resort to full scale use of chemical weapons ukraine has already lived through a month of heroic resistance a month of the darkest suffering he said to save people and our cities ukraine needs military assistance without restrictions barbarism on the ground long range russian strikes on the eastern city of kharkiv killed at least six civilians and wounded more than a dozen ukrainian authorities said at least four people including two children were killed in strikes elsewhere in the east lugansk governor sergiy gayday said accusing russian forces of using phosphorus on the village of rubizhne britain s itv network showed footage of the incendiary weapons dropping in a white haze overnight on the commuter town of irpin near kyiv the scale of civilian suffering was underscored when the un said more than half of the country s children have been driven from their homes by russian bombardment vladimir putin has already crossed the red line into barbarism british prime minister boris johnson said in brussels ukrainian forces claimed to be pushing russian troops back in some areas around kyiv they also claimed success in attacking one of the navy vessels used to bring russian forces in from the black sea video footage showed a ship in a ball of fire and smoke with other vessels that had been nearby heading away from the inferno nato reinforces eastern flank zelensky wants nato to help ukraine go on the offensive with more advanced fighter jets missile defense systems tanks armored vehicles and anti ship missiles nato members have supplied a steady stream of weapons including anti tank rockets which have helped to stall russia s advance but these are seen as essentially defensive the united states has so far ruled out sending airplanes or other large weapons systems to ukraine biden says he does not want to cross a line into what he says could become world war 3 pitting nuclear armed russia against nato however nato secretary general jens stoltenberg announced new deployments to eastern flank members romania hungary slovakia and bulgaria as well as bolstering chemical and nuclear defenses in case russia expands its attack beyond ukraine biden said that nato unity showed putin is getting exactly the opposite of what he intended grim milestone zelensky s appeal to nato came one month to the day after russian tanks rolled over the border acting on putin s plan to force pro western ukraine back into moscow s orbit since then thousands of civilians as well as thousands of soldiers from the two sides are believed to have been killed more than 10 million ukrainians have fled their homes and the month of war has displaced 4 3 million children more than half of ukraine s estimated child population of 7 5 million this is a grim milestone that could have lasting consequences for generations to come unicef chief catherine russell said un figures show that nearly 3 7 million ukrainians have fled abroad and more are now displaced inside ukraine after harrowing journeys out of cities like mariupol in the besieged southern port zelensky says nearly 100 000 people are trapped without food water or power and enduring fierce shelling by russian forces the city is a treasured prize for russia as it would enable a land bridge between russian annexed crimea and regions already controled by russian proxy forces in eastern ukraine intense fighting has made the city all but inaccessible ramzan kadyrov the warlord leader of russia s chechnya region claimed on thursday that his forces had taken control of city hall there meanwhile in zhytomyr a garrison town west of kyiv a russian strike flattened the school where vasiliy kravchuk s six year old son was meant to start next year every day it s 20 30 times we go to the basement to shelter it s difficult because my wife is pregnant i have a little son sobbed the 37 year old who before the war worked in tourism tarnishing russian gold while the moscow stock exchange partially reopened for the first time since the invasion the g7 summit in brussels vowed new action to destabilize russia s tottering economy the group of advanced economies and the eu pledged to block transactions involving the russian central bank s gold reserves to hamper any moscow bid to circumvent western sanctions russia s isolation on the world stage was underscored by a second non binding un general assembly resolution demanding an immediate halt to the war which was approved by 140 countries with 38 abstaining and five voting against

well known is that almost 80 of all african sovereign bonds are issued domestically 2 because domestic public debt markets constitute the backbone of domestic financial systems cgfs 2007 sustainable public debt is paramount to domestic financial stability acemoğlu et al 2022 boone et al 2022 against this background and despite the risk that the pandemic ends in a wave of sovereign defaults in both international and domestic sovereign debt markets kose et al 2021 there is no systematic work focused on describing sovereign defaults involving domestically governed debt imf 2021 given that debt jurisdiction i affects governments ability to restructure its debt gelpern and panizza 2021 ii is key to shaping the restructuring process gulati and weidemaier 2015 and iii affects the timing and conditions of market access chamon et al 2018 this lack of data hinders policy work on the prevention and resolution of sovereign debt crises imf 2021 3 in a pair of papers erce et al 2021a 2021b we bridge this gap by introducing a novel database that identifies sovereign defaults on domestic law debt instruments held by private creditors 4 the database systematically records domestic sovereign defaults that are identified on the basis of whether the law governing the debt instruments was local 5 the database documenting domestic law defaults their timing size and the details of the restructuring terms was challenging we reviewed several and diverse sources ranging from imf official documents to local news articles our efforts led to the identification of 76 sovereign default and restructuring episodes in 52 countries we built the database using a bottom up approach collecting information at the instrument level default events and aggregating it to obtain episode level variables these 76 default episodes are composed of 134 default events on different instruments bonds bank loans or deposits the sample spans four decades from 1980 to 2018 and covers events in all five continents the database collects finer details of each default event such as its timing the instrument and volume involved as well as the terms and restructuring methods adopted where available the database also reports net present value losses for creditors using our database we draw various lessons domestic law defaults are a global increasingly frequent phenomenon america and africa are the continents where most restructurings have occurred while domestic law defaults are more frequent in poor and middle income countries they also happen in advanced economies figure 1 combines our data with the database on foreign defaults maintained by tamon asonuma and christoph trebesch since the late 1990s domestic defaults have occurred more frequently than foreign ones while in the 1980s around 10 of default episodes involved domestic law debt in the 2000s 70 of defaults episodes did moreover governments operate selective defaults in contrast within the theoretical literature defaults are often modelled as affecting equally all creditors thaler 2021 or as discriminating in favour of domestic debt broner et al 2010 figure 1 domestic and foreign law defaults overtime defaults on bonded debt which are the most common form of domestic law defaults are increasing in size while as shown in table 1 they are smaller than external ones the median volume of domestic law bonds involved in recent restructuring episodes has reached 14 of gdp contrarily defaults on bank loans and deposits are rare nowadays likely reflecting the shift in governments funding sources table 1 volume of debt in default by instrument of gdp domestic debt restructurings often proceed fast but can be significantly protracted table 2 shows that in contrast to lengthier external default around 40 of domestic law defaults were resolved within six months this group includes events in which bonds included collective action clauses yet a non negligible fraction of episodes took a very long time to resolve one third of them lasted more than three years and 6 lasted over 12 years 6 table 2 duration of domestic law defaults months maturity extension is the most frequent form of restructuring maturity extensions feature in 75 of the episodes but vary greatly from case to case ranging from just a few months to 50 years amendments to the coupon structure are also frequent often involving a reduction of coupons and the exchange of variable rate coupons for fixed rate ones face value reductions are rare median npv losses are larger than those of external defaults table 3 reports summary statistics of npv losses for different categories of domestic debt and for external defaults as reported by asonuma and trebesch median npv losses are larger following domestic law defaults losses are largest when the government defaults on bank loans but also sizeable when cacs are used to restructure bonds table 3 creditors losses by instrument in default unilateral post default restructurings used to be the norm but a preference for a negotiated pre default approach is emerging since the 2000s most domestic debt restructurings have occurred pre default with debtor governments adopting a cooperative approach toward creditors see figure 2 governments were more aggressive in the 1980s and 1990s figure 2 pre and post default events and debtors stance conclusions in a world with public debt growing alarmingly fast acemoğlu et al 2022 boone et al 2022 the stylised facts drawn from our dataset convey important information and analytical material for policymakers in the need of finding policies to tackle debt distress these same stylised facts can also inform quantitative work existing quantitative work including domestic debt markets has had a hard time calibrating the models 7 our

all eyes were on sharm el sheikh this week as the sinai city hosted a two day summit between president abdel fattah al sisi israeli prime minister naftali bennett and abu dhabi crown prince mohammed bin zayed the three leaders sat for a highly publicized photo op after a day of talks on tuesday that were announced as centered on regional developments energy and food security the photo was presented as a show of unity between the three countries who have had a rocky relationship since the uae officially normalized relations with israel in 2020 supplanting egypt s historical role as the primary regional mediator and benefactor of relations with tel aviv the summit marked the first public meeting between the leaders of egypt israel and the emirates it was also the first time an israeli prime minister had stayed overnight in egypt in over two decades it also came amid a moment of geopolitical recalibration in the region as countries toe and sometimes openly flaunt new red lines being put forward by the west over relations with russia the invasion of ukraine has also sent grain and energy prices soaring threatening economies like egypt s that are particularly vulnerable to externalities there is also a shared concern between israel and several gulf countries over the accelerated pace of talks between the us and iran to restore the 2015 iran nuclear deal which the saudis emiratis and israelis had lobbied fiercely against due to the need to reintegrate tehran into the global economy to alleviate pressure on strained energy supplies however despite its seeming gravity the summit came together at the last minute according to an informed egyptian government official with the visits of bin zayed and bennett being organized at short notice in an emirati led initiative and while cairo based and gulf based political and diplomatic sources agreed that the agenda of the meeting focused on economic and regional security cooperation that will bring together the three countries along with saudi arabia and bahrain egypt remains quite skeptical of a broader regional security framework that will see its foreign policy aims further tied to its powerful neighbors at the root of the emirati led push for a new regional security arrangement is a concern over iran gulf based diplomatic sources agree who say that gulf countries and israel already have a plan in place in advance of an imminent signing of a new deal we are talking about a new regional order that is being designed post abraham accords in this new order israel will be fully integrated in the security scheme with the blessings of its old and new peace partners says a source who spoke on conditions of anonymity from a gulf capital and while the focus is on iran saudi arabia the emirates and israel have also grown concerned over the administration of us president joe biden s handling of regional affairs following reports earlier this month that the us was considering removing the iranian revolutionary guards corps from the us list of terrorist organizations bennett and israeli foreign minister yair lapid issued a joint statement saying that they refuse to believe that the united states would remove its designation as a terrorist organization for saudi arabia the frustration stems from the reluctance of the us president to deal directly with crown prince mohamed bin salman two weeks ago according to one of the informed regional sources mbs blocked a possible phone call between biden and saudi king salman bin abdelaziz he told the americans that the king is hospitalized and that he will consider scheduling the call himself once he gets a request from washington the source says it is not up to washington to decide who runs the kingdom mbs is there and it is not up to biden to decide who represents the king the gulf based source says the sharm el sheikh talks come shortly after the leaders of the three countries showed sympathy with russia which has faced widespread condemnation and sanctions from the west in the days after the invasion the saudis and the emiratis signed onto an arab league statement that did not condemn russia and called instead for diplomacy for escalation to be avoided and for the humanitarian situation to be considered the uae a non permanent member and the current president of the un security council also joined china and india in abstaining from a security council resolution demanding russia cease its invasion of ukraine while the resolution was vetoed by russia at the time senior emirati diplomatic adviser anwar gargash justified the abstention by saying that the uae believes that taking sides would only lead to more violence however saudi arabia and the united arab emirates joined 138 other nations to vote in favor of a united nations general assembly resolution demanding russia halt its invasion of ukraine and withdraw all troops according to a un diplomatic source they only voted in favor of the resolution that condemns the war on ukraine after firm talk from the us when the uae abstained in the security council a gulf based political source says the us ambassador in new york told her counterpart our soldiers are standing in abu dhabi monitoring the drones that could have taken down your capital you don t want these soldiers leaving the uae however the concession does not amount to the emirates and saudis falling completely in line with us policy objectives earlier this week saudi arabia which has not agreed to increase oil production despite reported us lobbying stated that it will not incur responsibility regarding any shortage of oil supply as its oil facilities are attacked by houthi terrorist militias the emirati foreign minister made a similarly defiant move in flying to moscow to meet his russian counterpart last week despite the increasing gulf israeli alignment coming to a head in sharm el sheikh egypt remains skeptical of the actionable items emerging from the summit and does not share the same anti iranian sentiment nothing big will come of the summit but we could not say no the egyptian official says yes all issues will be on the table including possible palestinian israeli talks and possible back channel talks between syria and israel but i am not sure that things can really happen any time soon on either front egypt and the uae have not exactly been seeing eye to eye on the pace of the normalization scheme the source adds honestly the uae has not been very transparent about what it does there egyptian sources have been very vocal regarding their dismay with the uae s position on many fronts most notably the support that abu dhabi has been lending to ethiopian prime minister abiy ahmed while egypt and ethiopia remain at loggerheads over the filling of the grand ethiopian renaissance dam and the potential downstream effects it may have on egypt s water politics the same sources have shared similar disappointment with the refusal of israel to use its good relations with ethiopia to intervene on egypt s behalf on the same issue the gulf based source agrees that there is significant tension with egypt it is true that the relations between the uae and israel are much closer today than between the uae and egypt but egypt cannot be excluded from regional calculations what s more egypt has maintained an ambivalent stance toward iran in recent years i think it is safe to say that when it came to iran we have always maintained quite an independent policy not just from that of the uae but also from the saudis we were often asked to issue some radical statements against iran but we would either issue some very carefully worded statements or not just issue anything at all a former high level government official previously told mada masr nonetheless egypt remains under outsized gulf influence given cairo s financial dependence on support from saudi arabia kuwait and the united arab emirates in this week alone as egypt has faced increasing tumult from the economic fallout of the war in ukraine devaluing its currency hiking interest rates and applying for a new loan from the international monetary fund adq an abu dhabi based wealth fund agreed with egypt to invest about 2 billion in the country by buying state held stakes in some companies including the country s largest listed bank bloomberg reported earlier this week part of the agreement with adq involves it buying about 18 percent of commercial international bank adq is buying stakes in four other companies listed on egypt s stock market including fawry for banking and payment technology services sae abu kir fertilizers chemical industries misr fertilizers production company and alexandria container cargo handling company even before the outset of the war in ukraine egypt was in talks to shore up its economic standing in the face of potential pressures in late january sisi embarked on a visit to the uae that was the first of several visits to a number of gulf capitals to try to secure direct financial cooperation agreements the saudi leg came in early march once the war in ukraine had broken out and as its financial repercussions were becoming clear no one in the gulf can bear egypt going through a severe economic crisis that leads to tensions like those caused by the food protests in algeria or morocco a government source told mada masr on the occasion of the visit egypt s political stability is not merely an internal affair that concerns the administration in cairo rather it is the concern of everyone especially the gulf whose support for cairo during the past eight years emerged out of this realization

beijing s crackdown on high profile market sectors like tech is upending share prices and forcing a radical reranking of china s really really rich as the government changes its economic focus to embrace enterprises that promote wider prosperity some billionaires even tumbled off the hurun global rich list which ranks the world s wealthiest individuals even as it focuses on those in china home to more billionaires than any other nation in late 2020 chinese regulators launched a crackdown on the country s tech giants in an effort to curb their influence and maintain control over assets such as big data that the government deemed critically important authorities moved to enforce an antitrust measure that had been largely ignored and fined alibaba jack ma s tech behemoth a record 2 8 billion according to the lawfare blog analysts say the shake up among china s richest goes beyond the impact of the crackdown which included sectors such as real estate internet tech and education the new rich list reveals how central government policies are elevating other sectors such as new energy and hardware manufacturing according to the 2022 list which hurun released last week the tech billionaires in china who were hit hard last year included ma huateng founder and ceo of china s internet conglomerate tencent ma saw his wealth drop to 52 billion as he slumped to the slot of the fourth richest billionaire in china and a ranking of number 28 globally jack ma ranked fifth among chinese billionaires this was the first time that the two entrepreneurs had not been in china s top three slots since 2015 and china shed 160 billionaires in 2021 accounting for half the world s total of 337 list laggards who are now mere multimillionaires china s billionaires have been hit hard in the past year with nine of the top 10 biggest wealth shrinkages and 160 drop offs said rupert hoogewerf hurun report chairman and chief researcher he added that many of china s biggest companies have lost as much as half their value the steepest drop in value since the global financial crisis in 2008 hoogewerf said that e commerce platforms real estate education generic drugs and vaping were the hardest hit sectors covid control measures tensions with the united states anti monopoly regulations and china s recently introduced push for common prosperity were behind the declines he added gary ting managing partner of the shanghai based venture capital fund kymco capital told voa mandarin that the rich list reflects two major economic policies one is more government control over the economy the other is suppression of the virtual economy and support of the real economy the virtual economy refers to ways of generating income that operate fully online and the real economy concerns the production purchase and flow of goods and services paul fang vice director of the shanghai institute for national economy agreed and told voa mandarin other promising sectors involve industries related to pandemic control artificial intelligence as well as a stronger health industry to cope with an aging population wang guo chen an assistant research fellow at the chuang hua institution for economic research in taipei said government subsidies are also behind the surge in sectors such as manufacturing and electric vehicles from the policy that encouraged the sales of home appliances and vehicles to people living in the countryside in 2008 to the push for electric cars in recent years government subsidies have been able to attract large scale private investment he told voa mandarin in a phone interview ting the venture capitalist said he expected beijing to relax its supervision of big tech companies to a certain extent this year citing the slowdown of china s economy and the goal of 5 5 gdp growth i think china s economy will perform worse than expected this year ting told voa mandarin so to achieve the gdp goal beijing might gradually loosen its control over tech companies the signs include the rise of the hang seng index in hong kong as well as didi s listing in hong kong chinese authorities targeted didi global a ride hailing company requiring it to resubmit a proposal after it pushed through a 4 4 billion u s initial public offering in june according to bloomberg which had reported didi s announcement in december that it planned to delist in the u s in favor of a listing in hong kong the hang seng move is now in regulatory limbo after chinese regulators found the company had fallen short on required measures to prevent security and data leaks and removed the didi app from chinese app stores despite losing some billionaires china s remaining 1 133 billionaires is almost twice the u s total of 716 the world s two largest economies account for 55 of the billionaires in the world with tesla s elon musk 205 billion topping the list amazon s jeff bezos 188 billion in second place and other u s residents occupying all but three of the top 10 slots zhong shanshan 72 billion the founder of bottled water company nongfu spring is china s richest man ranking 15th worldwide the second richest chinese billionaire and 23rd on the global list is bytedance founder zhang yiming 54 billion zeng yuqun 53 billion the founder of catl which specializes in the manufacturing of lithium ion batteries for electric vehicles is the third richest chinese billionaire and is 24th globally with assets growing by more than 15 billion last year
amsterdam a dutch publisher has said that it will cease publication of a bestselling book the betrayal of anne frank and remove it from bookstores in response to a report by historians that objects to its finding the book had claimed to identify the informant who alerted nazi police to the frank family s hiding place but the report s authors said the conclusions were based on faulty assumptions and careless use of sources the publisher ambo anthos which released the dutch translation of the book by rosemary sullivan a canadian author on jan 17 said tuesday that it would halt publication in response to the refutation by five prominent dutch historians based on the conclusions of this report we have decided that effective immediately the book will no longer be available ambo anthos which had apologized for the book last month wrote in a statement on its website we will call upon bookstores to return their stock the betrayal of anne frank received worldwide attention after its release bolstered by an appearance on the cbs news program 60 minutes of the self described cold case team led by a retired fbi investigator whose work formed the basis for the book the team accused arnold van den bergh a dutch jewish notary of pointing the nazi police to the location of the secret annex on prinsengracht 263 in amsterdam where the frank family and four other jews had been hiding for two years they were arrested on aug 4 1944 and deported to concentration camps where anne her mother and sister died only their father otto frank survived the war historians and other experts on world war ii and the holocaust very quickly expressed doubts about the finding questioning a central premise of its argument that the notary had lists of jewish hiding places that were compiled by the amsterdam jewish council an organization the occupying nazis had set up in 1941 pieter van twisk the lead researcher for the cold case project said in an interview with the new york times at the time that the evidence for the lists was circumstantial but circumstantial evidence is still evidence on tuesday night bart wallet a professor of jewish studies at the university of amsterdam summarized the findings of the refutation written by raymund schütz an expert on dutch notaries during the german occupation two experts on the amsterdam jewish council laurien vastenhout and bart van der boom and two other researchers petra van den boomgaard and aaldrik hermans we felt we had to step in because we owed it to our discipline wallet said for such a claim to be made he added the historical context had to be solid as a rock but he said this was not the case not at all it s clear that the argumentation doesn t hold up he concluded due to misinterpretation and tunnel vision the investigation wrongly identifies arnold van den bergh as anne frank s betrayer at the event where the report was released mirjam de gorter granddaughter of van den bergh had made an emotional public appeal to harpercollins which released the book in the united states with plans to publish it in more than 20 languages asking that the publisher issue a retraction and cease publication de gorter said that the investigators from the team approached her in 2018 without telling her that her grandfather was a main suspect even though as sullivan wrote in the book they were already seriously considering him as the betrayer with the help of family members de gorter said she discovered that during the summer of 1944 when the franks were betrayed van den bergh and his wife were in hiding in the town of laren at leemkuil 11 they were seen there by a friend gerard huijseen who noted visiting them in his wartime diary the van den bergh children had already been placed in hiding in october 1943 she said there was no need for my grandfather to save his family in the summer of 1944 she said they were already in hiding de gorter said she had shared this information with the team but they ignored her she said instead the book claimed that the family was living in amsterdam and that van den bergh had won his freedom by giving up addresses to the nazis my grandfather arnold van den bergh has been portrayed worldwide as an international scapegoat she said meanwhile anne frank s worldwide prominence is exploited in a particularly dishonest way in february the european jewish congress also called on harpercollins to rescind the book and to distance itself from the book s controversial historical claims ambo anthos had previously paused printing and distribution of the book and apologized after historians raised the first questions about its findings a more critical stance could have been taken here wrote tanja hendriks publisher and director of the company hendriks did not respond to requests for comment on wednesday the publisher s website now states we would once again like to offer our sincere apologies to everyone who has been offended by the contents of this book van twisk sullivan and the documentary filmmaker thijs bayens who was a member of the team that was assembled to identify anne frank s betrayer also did not respond to requests for comment the cold case team s lead investigator former fbi detective vince pankoke has previously issued a defense of the work however until now we have not been presented with any piece of evidence or any new information that had enough strength to challenge our conclusion he noted before the refutation was released the van den bergh scenario is in our opinion still the most viable theory about the betrayal of the

addis ababa ethiopia s government on thursday declared an indefinite humanitarian truce effective immediately saying it hoped to help hasten delivery of emergency aid into the tigray region where hundreds of thousands face starvation since war broke out in northern ethiopia in november 2020 thousands have died and many more have been forced to flee their homes as the conflict has expanded from tigray to the neighboring regions of amhara and afar prime minister abiy ahmed s government is committed to exert maximum effort to facilitate the free flow of emergency humanitarian aid into the tigray region it said in a statement to optimize the success of the humanitarian truce the government calls upon the insurgents in tigray to desist from all acts of further aggression and withdraw from areas they have occupied in neighboring regions it said the government of ethiopia hopes that this truce will substantially improve the humanitarian situation on the ground and pave the way for the resolution of the conflict in the northern ethiopia without further bloodshed the conflict erupted when abiy sent troops into tigray to topple the tigray people s liberation front tplf the region s former ruling party saying the move came in response to rebel attacks on army camps fighting has dragged on for over a year triggering a humanitarian crisis as accounts have emerged of mass rapes and massacres with both sides accused of human rights violations more than 400 000 people have been displaced in tigray according to the u n the region has also been subject to what the u n says is a de facto blockade the united states has accused abiy s government of preventing aid from reaching those in need while the authorities in turn have blamed the rebels for the obstruction nearly 40 percent of the people in tigray a region of 6 million people face an extreme lack of food the u n said in january with fuel shortages forcing aid workers to deliver medicines and other crucial supplies on foot there was no immediate reaction from the tplf to the government s announcement welcome news western nations have been urging both sides to agree to a cease fire with britain and canada hailing the truce declaration the uk welcomes the government of ethiopia s decision to announce an indefinite humanitarian truce and to ensure unimpeded access of aid into tigray we call on tigrayan authorities to reciprocate the british embassy in ethiopia said on twitter canada s embassy to ethiopia and djibouti said on twitter that the announcement was welcome news as aid is urgently needed in northern ethiopia diplomats led by olusegun obasanjo the african union s special envoy for the horn of africa have been trying for months to broker peace talks with little evident progress so far analysts said the truce was an important step but urged the government to follow up the announcement with action and ease humanitarian access to tigray the unconditional and unrestricted delivery of aid could also help create enough trust to pave the way for ceasefire talks and eventually dialogue said william davison the international crisis group s senior analyst for ethiopia ground to a halt more than 9 million people need food aid across afar amhara and tigray according to the u n s world food program but humanitarian organizations have been forced to increasingly curtail activities because of fuel and supply shortages wfp operations in the tigray region have ground to a halt with only emergency fuel stocks and less than one percent of the required food stocks remaining the agency said this week a tplf push into afar has worsened the situation driving up the need for emergency aid in the region the road from afar s capital semera to tigray s capital mekele is the only operational land route into tigray where the un estimates hundreds of thousands are living in famine like conditions the government previously declared a unilateral cease fire in tigray in june last year after the tplf mounted a shock comeback and retook the region from federal forces but fighting intensified in the second half of 2021 with the rebels at one point claiming to be within 200 kilometers of the capital addis ababa before reaching a stalemate

editor s note this whiskey was provided to us as a review sample by johnnie walker this in no way per our editorial policies influenced the final outcome of this review it should also be noted that by clicking the buy link towards the bottom of this review our site receives a small referral payment which helps to support but not influence our editorial and other costs johnnie walker needs no introduction their simple colored labels and iconic striding man logo has appeared on bottles of whisky worldwide since well before most of us were born the brand traces its origins to the kilmarnock grocery shop opened by john walker in 1820 while it was common for grocers to keep a stock of single malt whisky walker found that he could achieve more consistent quality through blending a small grocer could even cater to customers specific tastes by blending batches to order by the 1850s walker s name was attached to a product with growing regional popularity when john s son alexander inherited the business in 1857 whisky had become the core product and alexander spent the better part of the next three decades transforming his father s grocery business into a global spirits firm the 1860s were a great time to be in the whisk e y business at the beginning of the decade the legal prohibitions were relaxed on large scale blending of whiskies from various distilleries this allowed for the growth of whiskey blending as it is known today additionally the construction of railways across the isles enabled the easy transportation of goods within britain and granted small towns access to global ports the fact that johnnie walker s square bottle is easily recognizable on the shelf is a happy accident for their brand management team the original intent of the design was to maximize the number of bottles which could fit into a freight car in the first decades of the 20th century john walker s grandsons acquired major distilleries across scotland s whisky producing regions the first among these cardhu in 1893 supplied the backbone of the red and black label blends which were introduced in 1909 with the striding man mascot still in use today they joined their business with the distiller s company in 1925 which was acquired by guinness in 1986 in 1997 guinness merged with grand metropolitan to form today s global spirits giant diageo who shuttered the kilmarnock plant in 2012 to the protestations of the local residents and government but don t let anyone tell you that an old dog can t learn new tricks johnnie walker is getting in on the rye naissance in scotland with the recent release of their high rye blended scotch whisky while rye has long been a popular grain with north american whiskey makers it is something of an oddity in scotch especially at an assertive 60 of the mash bill this is toned down somewhat by blending notably with the cardhu distillate that serves as the backbone of johnnie walker black according to a prepared statement from master blender jim beveridge johnnie walker high rye blended scotch whisky continues our tradition of pushing the boundaries for what a scotch whisky can do our journey towards crafting something truly unique and fantastic was guided by johnnie walker black label and how flavors from rye whiskies present nicely in classic whisky cocktails the tasting experience features familiar johnnie walker notes that are expressed and emphasized like nothing we ve crafted before perfectly complementing our existing portfolio of products this gives me the impression that the blenders envision their high rye more as the foundation of a cocktail but i will be sampling it neat tasting notes johnnie walker high rye vital stats no age statement but it is mentioned that the barrels are american oak 90 proof average retail price of 36 for a standard 750ml bottle appearance golden color with a medium body nose big vanilla and pepper the spice tingles the nose a bit but after that sensation wears off i catch a bit of fruit that i m hesitantly describing as banana i m only hesitant because it smells like a real banana sweet but also vaguely starchy nothing like banana flavorings palate the rye is assertive with big pepper clove and allspice notes right at the outset these fade off into a bright juicy green apple sweetness which unexpectedly carries a faint hint of smoke that did not make itself known on the nose a really nice touch i think

we revise our bullish audusd target from 0 7350 to 0 7550 we would look to buy dips below 0 7300 and see the pair in a range between 0 7200 and 0 7600 second tier data indicators show rising inflationary pressures pointing to further risks of an earlier than expected hawkish turn in rba policy rhetoric meanwhile markets will likely continue to view aud as a clean expression of commodity price strength since our most recent update on aud on 2 march link the balance of drivers of aud price action has shifted very rapidly to glass half full fears of systemic market events related to russia sanctions have not realized sentiment around chinese assets has improved sharply following statements of support by local authorities on 16 mar and febemployment data surprised stronger than expected on 17 mar these factors have likely all played an important part in driving audusd through our 0 7350 target and to the highest level since nov 2021 but seem overshadowed by the broader tendency of markets to view aud as a proxy for commodity prices imm data in fact show that a large portion of highly persistent and often discussed aud short positions were liquidated in the week up to 15 mar seefigure10 ahead of many events that we list above on the domestic side another element that has helped aud is the fact that market s continue to see hawkish shifts in us monetary policy as a reason to anticipate similar developments from the rba despite ongoing pushback from the latter since 2 mar fed policy tightening expectations implied by ois in 2022 have increased from 132bp to over200bp and from 120bp to 180bp for the rba similarly to the us the recent increase in australian nominal yields appears to be driven by real yields which have accelerated above0 and have pushed the differential vs the usd equivalent back to the levels last seen in nov 2021 seefigure11 for the time being we think the positive thrust of both international and domestic factors is likely to persist all things equal this suggests that aud dips back towards the 200dmaaround 0 7300 will find buyers with the oct 2021 highs around 0 7550 as a near term target and potential for spikes as high as near the june 2021 highs around 0 7600 on the international front actual aud terms of trade have largely unwound the bulk of the strength seen at the onset of the ukraine war in late feb and in early mar but this is unlikely to be seen as a lasting challenge to aud strength as europe s frenzied quest to secure new energy sources is likely to channel expectations of further capacity expansion and investment in australia s growing lng industry the same applies to food exports with the current concerns about crop planting in ukraine likely suggesting that australia snet agricultural exporter role will remain a net source of support for the currency on the domestic front rba policy remains in focus as shown in figure12 markets are anticipating the rba to lag the fed in hiking rates in 2022 with the first full rate hike priced in by the 7 jun meeting markets also expect the rba tightening cycle to end with a higher terminal rate with limited pricing for rate cuts beyond the peak of the cycle this is consistent with more suppressed inflation expectations as 5 year aud inflation breakevens have not followed their usd equivalents higher in the past few weeks possible explanations include expectations that the rba will be more successful than thefed in pushing inflation lower over the medium term but also considerations about fxstrength easing the blow of rising commodity prices in domestic terms the still lower level of local cpi 3 5 yoy in q4 compared to near 8 last seen in the us and perhaps the lower frequency of australian inflation and wages data q1 cpi and wage growth data releases are due on 26 apr and 17 may respectively nevertheless recent data suggest that the risk remains in the direction of further hawkish developments the westpac consumer confidence indicator fell in march to the lowest level since sep 2020 with inflation concerns playing a key role in the decline while it certainly is notable that governor lowe did not discuss this specific data point in his comments on monday we think it merits attention especially with most in markets seeingfederal elections date still tbd but likely on 21 may as a strong obstacle against the rba hiking rates ahead of the 7 june rate decision 3 meetings from now while we acknowledge and fully understand the reasons that underpin these expectations we also see a risk that the rba might see further data prints in line with the narrative that emerged from the march consumer confidence indicator as the qualifying factor for the pervasive shift in inflationary psychology that governor lowe discussed earlier this week the melbourne institute inflation gauge for feb on 3 april and the mar employment report on 14 april will be in focus on this front and even if a sudden full rba u turn on policy patience and a pre election hike remain at this point still a far tail risk especially at the upcoming rate decision on 5 april the possibility of markets moving to further price in the us 5yr inflation breakeven au 5yr inflation breakeven possibility of a 50bp hike at the 7 june meeting from currently 35bp seems like relatively low hanging fruit with all this said our near term audusd target revision from 0 7350 to 0 7550 is a fairly moderate one why is that the main reason is that while many factors have indeed turned more constructive for aud or have potential to do so the hurdle of a large short position which we have repeatedly highlighted as a bullish factor for aud since early q1 seems much less pressing now than at any point since mid 2021 cad where imm net positioning data has been long since jan offers an important cautionary tale on this front as usdcad is still trading above 1 2500 even with a much more hawkish monetary policyand an equally supportive terms of trade backdrop

stavros lambrinidis it has not been able to up to now it s certainly trying but when it comes to cryptocurrency for example which is actually quite transparent once are you able to identify which is the tough part initially the transaction to see where it came from what happened the markets are already aware that we are setting up a major task force to stop that when it comes to gold reserves same thing so russia is going to try to wiggle out but it won t be able to and at the end of the day its economy is crashing as we speak and i think this is going to be the very sad the very dark legacy of mr putin on his own country and his own people the ruble has crashed 50 percent of its value has disappeared compared to the euro the stock markets are still not open inflation is skyrocketing in russia and people are losing money from their pockets from their salaries the oligarchs are running to hide and i think it s quite interesting there that very strange speech that mr putin gave a few days ago talking about these rich russian people that have to be self cleansed from russia you know reminding quite a bit stalin s language well i mean i m guessing that maybe some of these oligarchs are actually whispering to him in some ways that what he is doing is really detrimental to their interests certainly and probably to russia s as well the sanctions are biting already
as the november midterm elections get closer vulnerable democrats whose elections can decide the outcome of the house majority such as rep elaine luria d va continue to be put in the spotlight where their contradictions are coming back to haunt them luria in the past has contradicted herself in many areas such as accepting corporate pac money and school choice policies more recently she called implementing a stock trading ban for members of congress bullshit flip flopped on wanting to pay people a living wage by neglecting members of her own staff and comparing a measure to remove the critical race theory crt indoctrination scheme schools as trying to erase history as a candidate in 2018 luria said in an ad that she would listen to her constituents not corporate donors and not party leaders if elected to congress however at the beginning of 2021 luria was hit by roll call for pay off campaign debt using corporate pac money she said she d reject in fact the virginia pilot also wrote in 2018 luria said she wouldn t accept corporate pac money but she just took in more than 30 000 but it wasn t until last month when the left leaning washington post found that she took nearly 200 000 from corporate pacs after abandoning a pledge not to accept money from corporations at the end of 2020 the post pointed out that it is not unusual for candidates especially incumbents to take corporate pac money when running in tough elections but that it is unusual that she should take corporate money after previously swearing it off and breaking herself imposed pledge before furthermore in 2018 luria railed against school choice on the campaign trail and took the stance of many other democrats to oppose school choice still she reportedly sent her daughter to a private school in norfolk virginia that can cost more than 12 000 a year however in january an ethics watchdog filed a complaint with the office of congressional ethics oce asking for a probe into the congresswoman after a report surfaced stating she failed to disclose past corporate positions on her financial disclosure statements the complaint noted that luria served as the president and was an officer and director of tidewater montessori high school inc from 2015 to 2019 however she did not disclose this corporate position on her financial disclosure statements then in 2019 luria voted for the insider trading prohibition act to make it unlawful for anyone to trade while aware of having material or non public information and making it illegal to pass along that information to others after voting on the bill she wrote in a press release that banning insider trading is critical to ensuring a fair economy that works but only two years later luria was named one of the biggest traders on capitol hill and has routinely invested in stocks of companies she regulates when she was asked about her stance on banning members of congress from trading stock after house speaker nancy pelosi d ca publicly backed the idea she called it bullshit she shot back at the reporter questioning why would you assume that members of congress are going to be inherently bad or corrupt shortly after her comments a former adviser called the congresswoman s political judgment tone deaf additionally the congresswoman appears to have gone back and forth on the federal minimum wage throughout the years last year breitbart news reported that luria has flip flopped on the issue multiple times as a candidate luria opposed changing the federal minimum wage saying it could cause risk to small businesses but favored a localized minimum wage hike but like everything else despite her campaign position in 2019 she was an original co sponsor to a bill that would raise the minimum wage from 7 25 to 15 nationwide regardless of the local cost of living she was also an original co sponsor for the same bill again in 2021 however in 2019 she did not sign onto another bill that would raise the minimum wage to 15 nationwide saying the bill would allow the entire country to meet and exceed a 15 minimum wage but at different times depending on how quickly an area can absorb the wage increase nevertheless while luria as a candidate once said that everyone deserves a living wage it was revealed that the congresswoman did not think of that for her own staff a washington free beacon report revealed that at least two of her taxpayer funded congressional staffers earned less than a living wage in virginia it was reported that while the living wage in virginia is a yearly salary of 34 552 two of her staffer made below that 33 588 and 31 769 more recently luria criticized virginia s newly elected republican gov glenn youngkin and called measures he s put forth to remove the crt indoctrination scheme schools as trying to erase history she said the governor said we need to learn about all history we need to learn about all history but he s really tried to erase certain parts of virginia history from the curriculum however as breitbart news s breccan thies wrote crt is not based in history but rather a revisionist ideology that injects race based decision making into every aspect of history and modern life he noted that the clearest examples of crt are the fake history on display in the new york times 1619 project within which the founding of the united states was based in the maintenance of the institution of slavery luria who represents one of the more evenly split districts in virginia which is rated as a toss up from three different rating outlets is one of the top targets for republicans their congressional campaign arm and outside gop aligned groups luria is expected not to see any major challengers in the june 21 primary but could see potential

the natural gas market was awaiting word from president biden on thursday on plans to direct additional liquefied natural gas lng supplies to european union eu countries to curb their dependence on russian gas imports president biden reportedly was due to make an announcement friday during his trip to europe the president was in europe to coordinate with allies on all aspects of our response to russia s war against ukraine including imposing further severe costs on those enabling president putin s war of choice the white house said department of energy doe secretary jennifer granholm told reporters on thursday that with regard to increasing lng supply to europe i m going to allow the president to make that announcement and that be soon with respect to oil supplies we have called for an increase in our domestic oil supplies maryland lng exports the uk s u s ambassador karen pierce also said thursday during an interview on msnbc that the uk was working with the americans to get more lng into europe we ve come to an arrangement with the port of baltimore in maryland our trade secretary was there recently the lng terminal in baltimore will ship more lng to the uk and we ll ship it onto europe pierce did not specify whether she was referring to the cove point lng terminal in lusby md owned by dominion energy inc and brookfield asset management there are no other lng export terminals in the region canadian prime minister justin trudeau and european commission president ursula von der leyen also referenced cooperation on lng supply as a weapon against russia we will deepen our cooperation towards a net zero energy transition including by taking concrete steps in our energy cooperation to enhance security of supply and work to eliminate the eu and its member states dependence on russian energy the leaders said jointly on wednesday a dedicated working group on green transition and lng is being created to develop a concrete action plan on these matters and our officials will meet this week to further discuss enhancing energy related cooperation rystad energy analyst vinicius romano said thursday the market is keenly looking for direction from the meeting between the european council and u s president joe biden where a phase out plan to reduce eu energy dependence on russia eu energy security and energy affordability will be discussed romano added europe will have to choose between reaching its 80 storage target by nov 1 this year or expressively cutting russian imports in 2022 achieving both would be a challenging goal to reach this year how many lng projects are pending approval the u s natural gas industry meanwhile is urging the biden administration to accelerate the approvals of pending infrastructure projects to shore up global energy security in a letter to president biden on wednesday the interstate natural gas association of america american gas association independent petroleum association of america and the natural gas supply association praised the administration s decision to ban imports of russian oil lng and coal however significant work remains to achieve your administration s goal of ensuring that natural gas supply can keep up with domestic and global demand the lobbying groups said in addition to encouraging supply increases to meet today s challenges it is also essential to ensure that there is adequate natural gas infrastructure including lng terminals and pipelines so natural gas supply can reach those who need it the most both at home and abroad the groups cited 17 applications for additional u s lng capacity pending approval at the department of energy doe of which 14 also are awaiting approval at ferc additionally 15 applications for onshore natural gas pipeline projects are pending approval before the federal energy regulatory commission the letter said while we were encouraged by doe s recent actions to expedite approval of two applications to increase volumes at currently operating lng facilities we urge you to also push for expedited approval of the remaining pending applications at ferc and doe and with other federal permitting agencies thereby allowing the united states to continue strengthening its powerful global position on energy the energy organizations also highlighted the essential role of natural gas in the energy transition research has shown and experts agree that as we continue on our path to a lower emissions future and aim for net zero emissions by 2050 natural gas will play a critical role in meeting those targets they said not only does natural gas generation support growth of intermittent renewable resources it can also ease rising costs for consumers while guaranteeing reliable energy they need and want through this transition the expedited approval of these natural gas pipeline storage and lng projects along with continued investment in the production of natural gas are vital as we work towards the cleaner energy future we all want while continuing to support our allies as the war in ukraine rages on can putin make gas buyers pay in rubles granholm s comments on lng followed a meeting in paris of the energy ministers of the international energy agency iea member countries on thursday she shared the stage with iea executive director fatih birol birol addressed demands from russian president vladimir putin that unfriendly countries start paying for russian gas in rubles birol said if it is true i would consider it one of the other security threats made by russia this may factor into the kremlin s thinking as this will create an impetus to remove part of the sanctions or make them milder as for the oil markets iea member countries in early march agreed to release 63 million bbl of oil from their collective storage inventories in order to ease the impact of sanctions on russian oil exports birol said member countries are immediately ready to act and release additional volumes to the markets he added that the 63 million b d release represented only 4 of all the stocks we have all iea member countries proposed different policies with different timelines but with one single target reducing radically russian oil and gas exports rystad s romano said that it is unlikely that alternative currencies will be implemented in existing contracts requiring payments in rubles will force western companies to negotiate with sanctioned banks

last year plasencia 1865 released a year of the ox cigar in celebration of the ox being the chinese zodiac calendar symbol for the new year but that cigar was not offered to u s retailers this year the company decided to change that on feb 1 the chinese new year began and this year s symbol is the tiger plasencia 1865 along with davidoff drew estate maya selva and vegafina released cigars to celebrate the occasion and the cigars share some similarities beyond the use of tiger in the name each company chose to use red and gold colors which symbolize good fortune and wealth in chinese culture plasencia like most of the other companies also chose to package the cigars in eight count boxes a nod to eight being a lucky number in chinese culture as for the cigar the year of the tiger is a 6 1 4 x 54 nicaraguan puro that uses tobaccos that have been aged for up to 10 years for those unfamiliar plasencia 1865 is part of the larger plasencia tobacco empire which includes massive growing and cigar rolling operations in both honduras and nicaragua plasencia 1865 is the company that sells the plasencia branded cigars though the family makes cigars for a long list of third party companies this year s release is limited to 6 250 boxes though only 2 500 boxes are designated for u s stores the cigars showed up at international accounts in january which is when we bought our box and shipped to u s stores in late february note the following shows the various plasencia lunar new year vitolas some of these cigars may have been released after this post was originally published

this is a great cigar that falls short of the rarefied air i d call excellent but it s still something i have zero issues with the problems are two fold first there are minor construction issues during the course of the near three hour long cigar and those chip away at the cigar s score little by little and because the cigar was merely great and not excellent from a flavor perspective it wasn t able to get the points it needs that would cover up the minor construction issues if we took an approach of weighting construction issues against the time it took to smoke a cigar the plasencia would fare much better though the final third s construction issues were a bit more than just minor conversely this cigar benefits from the fact we don t factor price it s 40 into our scores in the

6 250 boxes of 8 cigars 50 000 total cigars number of cigars smoked for review 3 these cigars are remarkably cylindrical looking from an appearance perspective while that might sound odd few cigars actually resemble a perfect circle at the foot and these are pretty close that said it s not all perfect two cigars have noticeable soft spots albeit towards the midway point of the cigar which is not normally where i find these the wrapper is a pretty standard brown color with some noticeable veins including some that are a bit lighter in color and a medium amount of oil the aroma from the wrapper is medium in profile but not the most complex of sensations just some barnyard and oak smelling the foot reveals a sweeter array of flavors almonds fig oak a rum like aroma and small amounts of floral scents and acidity the acidity picks up on the cold draw joined by some white pepper gumball flavors earthiness and some orange the plasencia year of the tiger begins with cedar dry earthiness some lemon on the side of my tongue and then finishes with some coffee flavors while on each sample i smoke it takes a different amount of time eventually the profile settles on peanuts over cedar generic earthiness and coffee beans like the cold draw it s a very crisp profile it finishes with an herbal tinge along with lots of earthiness and cedar behind that there s meatiness a touch of a mild spice blend and some restrained acidity that builds on the tongue retrohales have even more peanut flavors though also more acidity some times the acidity presents itself as lemon other times it s more of an accent to a sharp earthiness at one point during the second cigar i realize that my mouth tastes like i just finished eating some mcdonald s french fries with ketchup about five minutes ago admittedly that s more of a novelty than the full story and the retrohales typically finish with flavors of peanuts in the nose along with earthiness and black pepper flavor is full body is medium full and strength is medium plus construction is great on one sample though one cigar needs a touch up the final cigar i smoke there s a small crack about three quarters of an inch from the top of the cigar if i don t cover it up with my lips it leaks some air or smoke depending on which part of the smoking process i m engaged in one cigar gets noticeably spicier in the second third or at least the second half of the second third though for the most part the three cigars are similar earthiness gets pretty close to the level of the nuttiness and it s tough to distinguish which one is the stronger of the two given how intertwined they end up being cedar remains but a toastier sensation is more impactful during the second third furthermore the spiciness has been replaced by a more distinct mixture of both red and black pepper the finish is toastier with nuttiness banana nut bread red pepper and at times cinnamon retrohales have a cleaner version of the nuttiness not toasty and more isolated from the other flavors along with herbal flavors a generic sweetness and a mild cinnamon flavor at times the rertrohale s finish is identical to the retrohale itself other times there s a sharper nuttiness added herbal flavors and red pepper flavor is full body is medium full and strength is picking up a lot it starts the second third around medium and is full by the end of the final third touch ups are needed on all three cigars in the second third always to correct an uneven burn despite this smoke production and draw remain fantastic to the point i don t really think about them unless i m forced to i m fully feeling the strength during the final third and while it might have me contemplating how much of my evening workout i want to do i am still very much enjoying the flavor of the plasencia year of the tiger while it s not quite like the first third the nuttiness is able to separate itself from the earthiness at least until the final inch when the earthiness gets stronger and harsher furthermore cedar remains black pepper picks up in intensity and there s a mayonnaise like creaminess the finish is led by nuttiness but an added mineral flavors that really change the complexion of the cigar in addition there s some herbal flavors that at times veer into a straw like flavor along with a very short but sharp dose of black pepper retrohales are much brighter than before with a big black pepper note over cedar earthiness and nuttiness there s a softening effect once the smoke has left my nostrils and the profile turns more peanut butter like with some added white pepper flavor and body are both full strength is very full unfortunately the minor touch ups from the earlier parts are now more consistent and more concerning as the year of the tiger needs help getting to the finish without going out final notes i was very surprised to see that plasencia 1865 described this cigar as medium strength in a press release the three cigars i smoked started medium but by the halfway point were definitely not medium i will say cigars affect people differently from a nicotine perspective and i m sure that plenty of people will find this cigar to be milder than say an opusx even if i might disagree there are very few hints that this cigar is going to get that strong during the first third it s not really until the halfway point that i even really notice the nicotine unless i m specifically paying attention to it for those wondering i didn t find the year of the ox to be anywhere near as strong and to answer the question more of you are probably curious about i preferred plasencia s year of the tiger over the year of the ox the cigar that had the small puncture in it was the worst of the bunch from a constructive perspective thanks to very uneven burns during the first and second thirds had i smoked the cigar without covering up the puncture things would have been much worse from as best i can tell it seemed like a vein in the binder was the culprit of the tiny hole it s a reminder about how the smallest things can go wrong and really affect the outcome of a cigar while these aren t the most unique cigar boxes of all time the packaging is very well executed it s well thought out it works together and there are small details like magnets for the lid and the box cover that make this seem a tad bit nicer than a standard painted box then again this is a 40 cigar so the packaging should be better than average if there was anything that i could nitpick it would be the foot band it says in pretty small font special edition handmade in nicaragua i m not sure it s particularly useful especially considering there are two other bands that said i think it looks better with the foot band than without once again nitpicking plasencia 1865 advertises on halfwheel cigars for this review were purchased by halfwheel site sponsor stogies world class cigars lists the plasencia year of the tiger but is

a man poses with a bag of wheat flour at a shop in kigali rwanda on march 23 2022 the price of wheat flour has risen significantly impacting the rwandan market by russia s invasion of ukraine as rwanda imports 64 of wheat from russia according to the rwandan prime minister simon wohlfahrt afp tribune news service president joe biden and the leaders of top u s allies are exploring how to keep russia s invasion of ukraine from causing a spike in global hunger as the war increasingly disrupts supplies of wheat and other goods from a region known as one of the world s breadbaskets the prospect of international food shortages is going to be real biden said thursday at a news conference in brussels after a g7 meeting that addressed the looming crisis which could also spark political instability in poorer nations biden said he s urging european and other nations to drop trade restrictions that could limit exports of food russian president vladimir putin s invasion last month has put at risk exports of wheat corn sunflower oil and other foods from russia and ukraine that account for more than 10 of all calories traded globally in north africa and the middle east which rely heavily on wheat from russia and ukraine that percentage is even higher white house officials have held multiple discussions over the past week with national security agriculture development and treasury officials to seek ways to prevent supply shortages and price hikes according to people familiar with the conversations at the summit biden said he raised the possibility of a significant major u s investment in food and other humanitarian assistance biden also said he and canadian prime minister justin trudeau discussed ways to boost wheat production in their countries and speed up exports the disruption of crucial food supplies has already prompted protests in iraq over food price increases that government officials blamed on the ukraine war egypt the world s biggest wheat importer turned to the imf for assistance wednesday as food and fuel price surges put pressure on public finances the fallout is reminiscent of the last major spike in global food prices that became a catalyst for the 2010 2012 arab spring which toppled long ruling governments in tunisia libya and egypt it also ignited syria s brutal civil war and the resulting refugee crisis in europe in egypt where increases in the price of government subsidized bread have been politically perilous the cost of offsetting higher wheat prices will run 2 6 billion or 0 6 of gross domestic product according to estimates by joseph glauber and david laborde of the international food policy research institute in yemen a country that depends heavily on international assistance the added cost will be about 840 million or 3 6 of gdp glauber previously the u s agriculture department s chief economist said the world has enough wheat and other grain in storage to avert shortages but tapping into reserves will only drive up costs the usda estimates the world has enough wheat from prior harvests to cover about a third of annual consumption with some of the stockpile held by private traders and some by governments the biden administration is calling on nations with government reserves to donate to un humanitarian efforts a u s official said and driven by higher world prices australia and india are expected to increase their wheat exports which would offset half the loss from ukraine and russia according to a u s agriculture department forecast this isn t a question of running out glauber said stocks will be drawn down to a lower level and you re going to see higher prices still cost increases stemming from the war and resulting sanctions on russia will without action push more than 40 million additional people into extreme poverty defined as subsisting on less than 1 90 a day according to an analysis published last week by the center for global development a non profit think tank whose funders include bloomberg philanthropies the war s impact comes on top of economic strain the covid pandemic has put on the world s poor particularly in africa and asia a united nations index of global food prices is up more than 40 over the past two years mark lowcock former un under secretary general for humanitarian affairs and emergency relief coordinator said billions of dollars in additional food aid will be needed to avert mass starvation in poorer nations in the short term for 2022 it might be in the low billions in the longer term a lot depends on how far grain production in other countries adjusts to compensate lowcock now a fellow with the center for global development said in an email these problems could turn out to be long lasting and ugly the food shock in ukraine looks devastating grain and sunflower oil in storage from last year s harvest can t be shipped because of fighting and port closures shelling and fuel shortages may interfere with spring planting and fertilizer farmers need to apply to the winter wheat crop as it emerges from dormancy infrastructure damage labor shortages and continuing conflict could also compromise the summer harvest and transportation of whatever is produced sanctions and disruption of black sea shipping routes also will limit russian exports beyond grain russia a key global supplier of fertilizers earlier this month instructed producers to halt exports russian ally belarus another leading fertilizer source is also being hit with sanctions efforts by governments to hoard food could worsen the situation hungary argentina turkey serbia and egypt have all imposed or threatened limits on food exports russia has limited exports of grain to some formerly soviet countries in what may be an attempt to control

the participation of denmark in all the key u s and nato interventions in 1991 2020 did not free the country from reputational risks due to the persistent problems of equipping the danish armed forces in accordance with the requirements of the north atlantic alliance the recent news about a growing shortage of ammunition and shells in the danish army only seems to lend further evidence to the established tradition of the danes lagging behind in terms of military capabilities chief of defence general flemming lentfer in an interview with danish radio stressed that given the available stocks of ammunition the danish army was not combat ready therefore in his opinion before planning the purchase of new equipment under a new potential multi year defence agreement danish parliamentarians need to provide the existing set of weapons with sufficient ammunition the ammunition shortage has suddenly become acute not least because in autumn 2021 the spanish firm expal previously a regular supplier of the danish army unexpectedly withdrew from the seven year contract with the danish armed forces earlier in 2020 the same spanish firm closed down the cartridge factory in jelling which had been producing ammunition for danish military personnel since 1676 and had been privatized by expal in 2008 the delay in the key five military projects under the 2018 2023 defence agreement including the full manning of the heavy mechanized 1st brigade in the amount of 4000 people known as the fist of the army dan hærens knytnæve and especially the scandal permeating the military intelligence service of denmark dan forsvarets efterretningstjeneste fe which allegedly carried out espionage against german dutch french swedish and norwegian colleagues in favor of the u s national security agency have not improved denmark s standing in the alliance either but it is the troubles within the fe namely the so called fe scandal which has undoubtedly grabbed most of the public and mass media s attention the highlights of this lengthy scandal were the arrest of four former and current surveillance officers of both the danish security and intelligence service dan politiets efterretningstjeneste pet and the fe including the former fe chief lars findsen on december 8 2021 who was later released from custody on february 17 2022 after successfully appealing his case and the former minister of defence claus hjort frederiksen being officially suspected on december 20 2021 for breaching the same paragraph as lars findsen of the danish criminal code dan straffeloven namely the extremely rarely used paragraph 109 known as treason paragraph related to revealing confidential data concerning national security or significant national economic interests abroad which has not been used by the courts since 1979 both cases continue to be investigated behind closed doors and the precise wording of charges apart from the mentioned paragraph 109 is still unknown moreover rather paradoxically despite being suspected for the de facto treason on national scale claus hjort frederiksen continues to participate in the foreign policy committee of the danish parliament both lars findsen and claus hjort frederiksen demand that the content of charges against them be made known to the public and in particular claus hjort frederiksen claims that the alleged state secrets are in reality newspaper articles public speeches and so on which are in public domain and could not be considered as breaching the obligation of professional secrecy dan tavshedspligt claus hjort frederiksen has in different interviews mentioned the cooperation between the us and danish intelligence services which allegedly made spying on foreign officials possible but in order to prove that claus hjort frederiksen s actions were criminal it has to be shown that his words confirmed the previous speculations about the presence of such intelligence cooperation the development of the scandal was also accompanied by pressure on key danish media and editors what does this scandal really mean for denmark s relations with key allies and denmark s democracy are there any significant implications whatsoever threat to democracy some accounts of the frictions with and within the fe are clearly emotionally and morally driven edward snowden also recently had the opportunity to speak his mind on the matter during the interview with the danish newspaper politiken according to him it is laughable to equate whistleblowing to treason he also added that the idea of betraying country to a newspaper or the public sounded nonsensical the starting point of the crisis within the fe is the historically unprecedented press release of the danish oversight committee dan tilsynet med efterretningstjenesterne tet in folketing published august 24 2020 which was a to large extent based on the information received from anonymous whistleblowers strongly criticized the fe for illegally gathering and exchanging data about danish citizens at least since 2014 and providing the oversight committee with misleading information as a result the now former defence minister trine bramsen had to dismiss lars findsen along with two other officials from their post in the fe the special research commission was also established december 21 2020 in connection with the outrageous press release which openly published the conclusion of its work on december 13 2021 according to the findings of the commission accusations and criticism put forward earlier by the oversight committee proved to be unjustified three of the four intelligence officers arrested on december 8 2021 were already released the same month but investigation of lars findsen s case is still in progress he is suspected for being connected to the three leaks which received extensive media coverage the key danish media citing anonymous sources during 2020 2021 brought to the public attention three dramatic cases involving the danish intelligence services the cooperation between the fe and the nsa on getting data from danish underwater cables and thus spying on top politicians and public servants in neighboring countries the warning from the fe to the danish government in september 2020 that the isis was kidnapping children from refugee camps in syria the danish government did not follow this warning until march 2021 and the fate of the danish operative ahmed samsam who was falsely accused in spain of being an isis fighter these three events contributed to the increasing tension within the triangle of intelligence services mass media and the government the editors and directors of the leading danish media such as berlingske media jp politikens hus weekendavisen and radio loud have been explicitly warned by the pet and the fe that the paragraph 109 applies not only to the leaked data but also to the information being published on newspaper pages most journalists perceived it as a direct intimidation at least 8 different journalists in january 2022 have participated in interrogations during the still ongoing investigation it is evident that a democratic system poses a serious dilemma for secret services on the one hand the presence of anonymous whistleblowers proves essential to uncovering the excesses of intelligence services and the government but on the other hand their activities undermine the effectiveness and principles of such services in this context the present investigation is directed precisely against the abuses of democracy by whistleblowers rather than against undemocratic actors claus hjort frederiksen is also of the opinion that the democratic control over intelligence services might have been a bit too rigorous and some details should have been kept away from the public scrutiny which could damage the credibility of the fe in the eyes of the american colleagues and the special relationship with the usa in general it should be noted that denmark is still part of the nine eyes arrangement and positioned at the center of the network of underwater cables connected to leading european powers so the portrayal of the scandal as a threat to democracy is not quite adequate the matter in question is the scope of democratic control over intelligence services activities and the degree of their transparency this leads to a kind of conundrum when democracy is trying to punish its own excesses and inefficiencies which in turn generates resistance from the democratic core including free press and media uncontrolled and unregulated whistleblowers within the fe and the pet who might eventually end up in similar situations like lars findsen or claus hjort frederiksen and cause legal frictions is something which should be dealt with and reformed denmark s alliance posture international reputation is a delicate but an intangible asset in alliance relations in some respects the current scandal is the continuation of the events which took place in 2013 2014 danmarks radio based on anonymous sources reports that the internal investigation under the codename operation dunhammer concluded in may 2015 revealed that the nsa had used the access to the danish submarine communication cables to spy on top politicians in sweden norway france and germany including angela merkel f w steinmeier and peer steinbrück the danish fe was aware of this at least since 2015 due to the internal investigation but neither took steps to prevent this nor informed the allies norway sweden and germany express staunch criticism of the event and demand to be fully informed of the ongoing investigation either way allies seem to downplay the controversies and not to voice accusations against each other even when it came to the industrial espionage of sweden s defence capabilities the development of a new gripen airfighters generation in particular the saab representatives first described the case as insignificant and then designated it as a disinformation attempt from foreign power the fe has so far not provided any comments on the matter and the real level of surveillance on foreign politicians and other probable targets remains uncertain denmark s own defence firm terma might have been the target of industrial espionage conducted with the help of the infamous programme xkeyscore it is also difficult to point out tangible political costs associated with that irresponsible behavior on the part of denmark within the alliance except that trine bramsen had to step down february 4 2022 as the defence minister despite trine bramsen being exposed to criticism for clumsily handling the fe case there is no clear connection between the two events her stepping down along with other shifts in the government composition were caused by the former transport minister benny engelbrecht being issued a vote of no confidence more broadly it is difficult to discern the consequences of the fe case for denmark s relations with nordic neighbors and key allies no punitive measures have been announced except the mentioned demands to share data under the investigation limits of secrecy the unresolved question remains how can intelligence services function effectively in an open and resilient parliamentarian democracy such as denmark one thing is certain though boundaries of secrecy and classified data will consistently be challenged particularly when the public became acutely aware of surveillance contact tracing and other dangers to personal freedoms during the covid 19 pandemic but at the same time only few would challenge the assertion that even democracies require watchful eyes the recent events in ukraine have made it all the more apparent the genuine issue is however not only to expose the excesses of intelligence services work it s still necessary and to a certain extent unavoidable but to maintain the shifting balance between democratic institutions and values which nordic and european countries pride themselves on and preserving the necessary capabilities of intelligence services while the results of the secret internal investigation within the fe launched in december will be shown only to selected officials by the end of this year strengthening the danish oversight committee established relatively recently in 2014 which has a much narrower remit as compared to its norwegian and swedish counterparts instead of continued reliance on unregulated and anonymous whistleblowers could already be a step in the right direction from our partner riac

president volodymyr zelensky pressed a nato summit thursday to flood weapons into ukraine and western allies responded with new sanctions against russia promises of military aid and discussion of expelling moscow from the international g20 body as battles raged across ukraine with television footage showing a large russian warship ablaze at dockside near the southern city of mariupol zelensky addressed the emergency nato summit and a g7 leaders meeting by video link he said the west should provide all the weapons we need to prevent the deaths of ukrainians from russian strikes from russian occupation kicking off a day of intense diplomacy us president joe biden made clear that the western alliance was listening nato has never been more united biden said and after zelensky said there was a real chance of russian president vladimir putin resorting to chemical warfare biden told reporters we will respond if he uses it biden noted that under his presidency the united states has pledged 2 billion in weapons to ukraine he announced a new commitment to more than 1 billion in humanitarian assistance as well as promising to welcome 100 000 of the nearly 3 7 million refugees fleeing the country after the united states announced new sanctions including targeting russian politicians biden said the west was in it for the long haul intent on increasing the pain on moscow biden intensified the effort to ostracize putin s russia with a call to exclude moscow from the g20 that was raised today biden told reporters adding that if the group of 20 countries does not agree then he would press for ukraine to be allowed to join in his address zelensky said that russia was using phosphorus bombs which cause severe burns conducting indiscriminate shelling of civilians and could resort to full scale use of chemical weapons ukraine has already lived through a month of heroic resistance a month of the darkest suffering he said to save people and our cities ukraine needs military assistance without restrictions barbarism on the ground long range russian strikes on the eastern city of kharkiv killed at least six civilians and wounded more than a dozen ukrainian authorities said at least four people including two children were killed in strikes elsewhere in the east lugansk governor sergiy gayday said accusing russian forces of using phosphorus on the village of rubizhne britain s itv network showed footage of the incendiary weapons dropping in a white haze overnight on the commuter town of irpin near kyiv the scale of civilian suffering was underscored when the un said more than half of the country s children have been driven from their homes by russian bombardment vladimir putin has already crossed the red line into barbarism british prime minister boris johnson said in brussels ukrainian forces claimed to be pushing russian troops back in some areas around kyiv they also claimed success in attacking one of the navy vessels used to bring russian forces in from the black sea video footage showed a ship in a ball of fire and smoke with other vessels that had been nearby heading away from the inferno nato reinforces eastern flank zelensky wants nato to help ukraine go on the offensive with more advanced fighter jets missile defense systems tanks armored vehicles and anti ship missiles nato members have supplied a steady stream of weapons including anti tank rockets which have helped to stall russia s advance but these are seen as essentially defensive the united states has so far ruled out sending airplanes or other large weapons systems to ukraine biden says he does not want to cross a line into what he says could become world war 3 pitting nuclear armed russia against nato however nato secretary general jens stoltenberg announced new deployments to eastern flank members romania hungary slovakia and bulgaria as well as bolstering chemical and nuclear defenses in case russia expands its attack beyond ukraine biden said that nato unity showed putin is getting exactly the opposite of what he intended grim milestone zelensky s appeal to nato came one month to the day after russian tanks rolled over the border acting on putin s plan to force pro western ukraine back into moscow s orbit since then thousands of civilians as well as thousands of soldiers from the two sides are believed to have been killed more than 10 million ukrainians have fled their homes and the month of war has displaced 4 3 million children more than half of ukraine s estimated child population of 7 5 million this is a grim milestone that could have lasting consequences for generations to come unicef chief catherine russell said un figures show that nearly 3 7 million ukrainians have fled abroad and more are now displaced inside ukraine after harrowing journeys out of cities like mariupol in the besieged southern port zelensky says nearly 100 000 people are trapped without food water or power and enduring fierce shelling by russian forces the city is a treasured prize for russia as it would enable a land bridge between russian annexed crimea and regions already controled by russian proxy forces in eastern ukraine intense fighting has made the city all but inaccessible ramzan kadyrov the warlord leader of russia s chechnya region claimed on thursday that his forces had taken control of city hall there meanwhile in zhytomyr a garrison town west of kyiv a russian strike flattened the school where vasiliy kravchuk s six year old son was meant to start next year every day it s 20 30 times we go to the basement to

reopened for the first time since the invasion the g7 summit in brussels vowed new action to destabilize russia s tottering economy the group of advanced economies and the eu pledged to block transactions involving the russian central bank s gold reserves to hamper any moscow bid to circumvent western sanctions russia s isolation on the world stage was underscored by a second non binding un general assembly resolution demanding an immediate halt to the war which was approved by 140 countries with 38 abstaining and five voting against by max delany with danny kemp and dmytro gorshkov

this page recaps the news from ukraine on thursday march 24 follow here for the latest updates and news from tuesday march 25 as russia s invasion continues president joe biden said russia should be kicked out of the group of 20 nations in retaliation for its invasion of ukraine a major step that would further isolate the kremlin and restrict russia s say in the global economy russia s membership in the group which represents the world s major economies was discussed during an emergency meeting with key u s allies biden told reporters thursday during a news conference at nato headquarters in brussels he noted that the decision on whether to boot russia from the group is up to other g 20 members if the other members decline to revoke russia s membership ukraine should be permitted to attend g 20 meetings biden said the g 20 includes not only western democracies but also tyrannical and authoritarian countries such as china and saudi arabia the group works to address major issues impacting the global economy the u s and other allies expelled russia in 2014 from a smaller group that represents industrialized nations after russia s annexation of crimea that alliance known at the time as the group of eight is now called the group of seven or g 7 the president s remarks came as the u s reinforced a united stand with allies in supporting ukraine one month into russia s invasion with added sanctions against the kremlin aimed at further crippling the country s economy the sanctions against more than 400 russian officials and entities came as russian president vladimir putin s economy has shrunk to half the size it was before the invasion according to the white house a senior administration official told reporters that independent assessments indicate russia s last 15 years of economic gains will evaporate this year and inflation will spike to 15 russia which had the world s 11th largest economy before the invasion will fall out of the top 20 according to the official at the same time the official said sanctions are cutting off all sources of potential growth including blocking russia from purchasing cutting edge technology biden also announced thursday he hopes to meet with ukrainian refugees while in europe giving away a part of his schedule that the white house had not announced biden said getting a first hand look at the effects of the war on ukrainians will reinforce his commitment to the u s playing a major role in helping both those inside and outside ukraine i plan on attempting to see those folks as well as i hope i m going to be able to see guess i m not supposed to say where i m going am i biden said but anyway i hope i get to see a lot of people latest movements mapping and tracking russia s invasion of ukraine news comes to you the latest

targeted by sanctions the u s treasury department unveiled thursday as ceo of sberbank gref 58 also oversees a large number of companies owned by sberbank in other industries the department said the russian stock market resumed limited trading thursday under heavy restrictions almost one month after prices plunged and the market was shut down following moscow s invasion of ukraine ukraine says moscow is forcibly taking civilians to russia ukraine accused moscow on thursday of forcibly taking hundreds of thousands of civilians from shattered ukrainian cities to russia where some may be used as hostages to pressure kyiv to give up lyudmyla denisova ukraine s ombudsperson said 402 000 people including 84 000 children have been taken against their will the kremlin gave nearly identical numbers for those who have been relocated but said they wanted to go to russia ukraine s rebel controlled eastern regions are predominantly russian speaking and many people there have supported close ties to moscow russian col gen mikhail mizintsev said the roughly 400 000 people evacuated to russia since the start of the military action were from the donetsk and luhansk regions in eastern ukraine where pro moscow separatists have been fighting for control for nearly eight years russian authorities said they are providing accommodations and dispensing payments to the evacuees ukrainian officials said that the russians are taking people s passports and moving them to filtration camps in ukraine s separatist controlled east before sending them to various distant economically depressed areas in russia poll shows americans support russian sanctions think biden should be tougher a majority of americans are supportive of the harsh sanctions on russia but believe biden needs to be tougher on the kremlin after its invasion of ukraine according to a poll commissioned by the associated press and norc released thursday the poll which surveyed 1 082 u s adults from thursday to monday found 56 of americans believe biden s response to russia hasn t been tough enough including a majority of 53 of democrats a very small percent about 6 said they thought biden had been too tough the poll shows across the board americans of both political parties were supportive of the harsh economic blows to russia the poll showed 68 were supportive of economic sanctions in general with 70 saying they supported the recent banning oil imported from russia which in turn caused gas prices to rise christal hayes biden china understands its economic future is tied to the west president joe biden said he is hopeful that chinese president xi jinping will not assist russia in its war against ukraine but declined to say whether he s seen any indications that china will intervene china understands that its economic future is much more closely tied to the west than it is to russia biden said and so i m hopeful that he does not get engaged biden pointed to his virtual meeting last week with xi in which the president said he made it clear to him him that he understand the consequences and would be putting himself in significant jeopardy biden said he made no threats to xi but pointed out the number of american companies that have pulled out of russia as a result of putin s barbaric behavior joey garrison biden us nato will respond if russia uses chemical weapons president joe biden said the united states and nato allies would respond to russia if they used chemical weapons we would respond we would respond if he uses it biden said during a press conference thursday the nature of the responses depend on the nature of the use biden would not expand on whether the united states has gathered specific intelligence on if russian president vladimir putin is using chemical weapons secretary of state antony blinken on wednesday said russian military forces committed war crimes in ukraine after hitting civilian targets when asked whether there could be a military response if putin uses chemical weapons biden said that nato would decide as a whole if they would cross that line rebecca morin biden says sanctions never deter defending us actions against putin president joe biden vigorously defended his administration s use of sanctions on russia arguing the financial penalties were never meant to deter putin from invading ukraine but are designed to provide sustained pain sanctions never deter biden said when pressed why u s sanctions have not stopped putin s course in ukraine you keep talking about that biden said it s the maintenance of sanctions and increasing the pain over the next year that will stop russia we have to demonstrate the purpose biden said the single most important thing is for us to stay unified and for the world to continue to focus on what a brut this guy is biden noted that putin was banking on nato being split when he invaded ukraine instead nato has never never been more united than it s been today biden declared thursday after an emergency meeting of the allies in brussels but putin can take anything for another month including the harsh sanctions so the alliance must not crack biden added joey garrison and maureen groppe u s to accept 100k refugees provide 1b in humanitarian assistance the u s will accept 100 000 ukrainian refugees and others fleeing russia s invasion and provide more than 1 billion in

was opened by nato secretary general jens stoltenberg according to a senior administration official who described the closed door gathering on condition of anonymity the official said zelenskyy also

getting out of the economic anarchy bt garvin karunaratne it is good news that we have reached an input of 1 billion aid from india and that china is considering and very likely to give a 2 5 b loan but this can bring us out of the economic mess we are in if only we act in a prudent manner it all depends on how we spend the funds we do not have to wonder far because if we closely copy the blueprint economic model of the days of premier dudley senanayake 1965 1970 days when we had no food gas and fuel queues we can be dead certain of victory that was also the one model we followed earlier too when we built the gal oya project spending dollars we had in 1950 1954 when my father in law had purchased his a 40 brand new as the first owner not from the company but from someone who had deposited money and waited long there were small allocations for valued imports in 1958 i waited for two months to buy a new peugeot 203 then we did not provide any foreign exchange for foreign studies or for foreign travel when i marched out of the administrative service and went abroad for study i was not given even a single dollar i had to earn live and study foreign exchange was a guarded item and we did not have private currency dealers buying and selling dollars emassing a profit the total intake of every bank was the property of the government and disposed as decided by the controller of foreign exchange of the central bank today unless we are strict and spend for essentials first and see to an era of no queues for food and essentials like cooking gas medicines and then detail a small allocation for fuel etc we will not win we have to forget skyscrapers bridges roads flyovers for the time being till we do not have to hear of deaths of common people in food and gas queues it is sad that four people have succumbed to deaths in queues by today 22 3 then very small allocations were given for non essentials like cars fridges grapes etc working as the additional government agent in kegalla in 1969 i knew of no food queues or any shortages of essentials like food including medicines our automobiles can easily guzzle out billions we have that many the rich have not one or two but fleets of vehicles and enjoy endless travel allowing the rich to revel while some citizens are confined to be in queues for days to buy a can of gas is a no no situation that needs never to happen my mind travels back to my days at matara as the government agent when the jvp struck on 5 thapril 1971 when the jvp actually controlled 90 of the district for close on three weeks no fuel bowsers could be expected till roads were opened up as the ga i was in charge only some ten officers out of some 400 reported for work and that included my assistant govt agent sugatadasa jayawickrema the two of us decided that we will impound all stocks of petrol and diesel all petrol shed were closed to the public told to issue only to army and police vehicles and on permits issued by either of us many big wigs in matara criticised us but we were very firm and did not give in if i had not made that decision the fuel would have run out and we would not have had any fuel for the army police and essential services like the distribution of essential food then the police withdrew the security at the katcheri closed the police station gates and barricaded the entrance with a large tree and were armed to the teeth with machine guns inside awaiting the enemy the jvp matara was saved by the gemunu watch volunteers running in katcheri jeeps with petrol found from my development funds ensuring security and essential food transport for the area near matara and the coast which we controlled at times if i had not controlled the use of available fuel the jvp would have had a walk over and we would not have lived to tell the tale casualties due to jvp bullets included my jeep driver major wettasinghe and the member of parliament for deniyaya sumanapala dahanayake sumanapala had to be moved to colombo that morning radio ceylon reported that the jvp had shot dead a casualty in the elpitiya hospital and i myself wrote out a fake bed ticket for sumanapala giving him a fake name so that if when passing a jvp held area sumanapala would be safe had i not impounded fuel stocks the ambulance would not have had fuel it is mandatory that we limit the use of fuel to produce electricity and for essential services there is no other way ahead permits have to be issued by the divisional secretaries to owners of motor vehicles for the essential travel like going to work and for schooling unless this is done the dollars will end in smoke one can also look to the manner in which mahatir muhammed responded when the east asian financial crisis hit east asia i quote from my book how the imf ruined sri lanka alternative programmes of success godages 2006 in 1997 the east asian financial crisis caused the death of many economies in east asia malaysia thailand indonesia korea succumbed and the malaise spread to russia brazil and argentina all these countries had their currencies trashed and their economies ruined prime minister mahatir muhhamed of malysia declared war with the imf by doing the exact opposite of the imf advice he effectively controlled the economy of his own country he was entitled to do it he imposed very strict controls every country earns foreign exchange through exports and services and remittances he grabbed this money and did not allow any foreign bank or anyone to spend on unnecessary imports he clamped severe restrictions on the use of foreign exchange this even went to the extent of stopping funds for malaysians studying abroad there was mayhem in student circles in london some of my students took leave of studies and flew home those who stayed back were compelled to do menial work in restaurants etc to pay themselves pg 238 it was only malaysia that faced the crisis without falling into debt thailand was given a loan of 17 1 billion korea 58 2 billion indonesia 39 9 billion their foreign debts commensurately increased by that amount in each case the imf insisted that the local economy should be further prise opened more to foreign investment this means that the doors are yet being wider and wider opened for foreign exploitation as professor stiglitz states the imf chose to squeeze the countries further thus driving their banks and corporations to deeper crisis and worsening investor confidence stiglitz imf policies make patient sicker the imf has come up with two aid schemes the highly improvised poor countries initiative hipc and supplemented with the multilateral debt relief initiative mdri both declare loans as paid up but open up the country more for foreign investment as carrasco of the university of ohio opines that the hipc is a program designed by creditors to protect creditor s interests leaving countries with unsustainable debt burdens foreign debt forgiveness repudiation university of iowa center for international finance debt 2007 the mdri is no better sri lanka is currently negotiating with the imf it is hoped that the imf will provide a chance for sri lanka to wipe out the food and fuel queues and subsequently provide a development agenda which is not yet on its books it is sad that the imf despite helping giving loans on strict conditions to some 80 odd countries cannot quote a single instance where any country has developed under their tutelage however it is hoped that this message will serve to open their eyes and enable them to speak of success these words come from someone who designed and implemented the largest and premier employment creation programme the world has known the youth self employment programme ysep of bangladesh created when he served as the commonwealth fund advisor to the ministry of labour and manpower in 1982 that happened in the face of an ilo programme that spent millions and failed to establish a self employment programme in tangail bangladesh in 1980 1982 the ysep has in its four decades 1982 2022 guided over three million youths to be commercially viable entrepreneurs it is hoped that the imf will kindly consider allowing sri lanka the chance to wipe out the food and fuel queues first and will also help the country to stand on its feet in development may i suggest that the imf detail that sri lanka should show the development starved world that it is possible to enable true economic development creating production locally bringing about employment and incomes for the people within a successful development programme such a programme will be a feather in the cap for the imf and will get into the history of successes in development like mahatir muhammed in malaysia in the days of the east asian financial conflict of 1997 and the youth self employment programme of bangladesh the sri lankan high commissioner in delhi his excellency milinda moragoda in his manifesto for mayor of colombo in 2011 refers to a scheme to solve the problems of youth unemployment in this regard he should seek to implement the youth self employment programme of bangladesh which incidentally was an amazingly successful scheme introduced to that country by a distinguished son of sri lanka dr garvin karunaratne who served bangladesh as an international consultant let me live in hope that the imf will get this message garvin karunaratne ph d michigan state university author of how the imf ruined sri lanka alternative programmes of success godages 2006 how the imf sabotaged third world development godages kindle 2017 how the imf s structural adjustment destroyed sri lanka godages 2022 23032022
economy the fact is said jennie as she twirled a little hat on her hand which she had been making over with nobody knows what of bows and pompons and other matters for which the women have curious names the fact is american women and girls must learn to economize it is n t merely restricting one s self to american goods it is general economy that is required now here s this hat costs me only three dollars all told and sophie page bought an english one this morning at madame meyer s for which she gave fifteen and i really don t think hers has more of an air than mine i made this over you see with things i had in the house bought nothing but the ribbon and paid for altering and pressing and there you see what a stylish hat i have lovely admirable said miss featherstone upon my word jennie you ought to marry a poor parson you would be quite thrown away upon a rich man let me see said i i want to admire intelligently that is n t the hat you were wearing yesterday oh no papa this is just done the one i wore yesterday was my waterfall hat with the green feather this you see is an oriole a what an oriole papa how can you expect to learn about these things and that plain little black one with the stiff crop of scarlet feathers sticking straight up that s my jockey papa with a plume en militaire and did the waterfall and the jockey cost anything they were very very cheap papa considering miss featherstone will remember that the waterfall was a great bargain and i had the feather from last year and as to the jockey that was made out of my last year s white one dyed over you know papa i always take care of my things and they last from year to year i do assure you mr crowfield said miss featherstone i never saw such little economists as your daughters it is perfectly wonderful what they contrive to dress on how they manage to do it i m sure i can t see i never could i m convinced yes said jennie i ve bought but just one new hat i only wish you could sit in church where we do and see those miss fielders marianne and i have counted six new hats apiece of those girls new you know just out of the milliner s shop and last sunday they came out in such lovely puffed tulle bonnets were n t they lovely marianne and next sunday i don t doubt there ll be something else yes said miss featherstone their father they say has made a million dollars lately on government contracts for my part said jennie i think such extravagance at such a time as this is shameful do you know said i that i m quite sure the misses fielder think they are practising rigorous economy papa now there you are with your paradoxes how can you say so i should n t be afraid to bet a pair of gloves now said i that miss fielder thinks herself half ready for translation because she has bought only six new hats and a tulle bonnet so far in the season if it were not for her dear bleeding country she would have had thirty six like the misses sibthorpe if we were admitted to the secret councils of the fielders doubtless we should perceive what temptations they daily resist how perfectly rubbishy and dreadful they suffer themselves to be because they feel it important now in this crisis to practise economy how they abuse the sibthorpes who have a new hat every time they drive out and never think of wearing one more than two or three times how virtuous and self denying they feel when they think of the puffed tulle for which they only gave eighteen dollars when madame caradori showed them those lovely ones like the misses sibthorpe s for forty five and how they go home descanting on virgin simplicity and resolving that they will not allow themselves to be swept into the vortex of extravagance whatever other people may do do you know said alisa featherstone i believe your papa is right i was calling on the oldest miss fielder the other day and she told me that she positively felt ashamed to go looking as she did but that she really did feel the necessity of economy perhaps we might afford to spend more than some others she said but it s so much better to give the money to the sanitary commission furthermore said i i am going to put forth another paradox and say that very likely there are some people looking on my girls and commenting on them for extravagance in having three hats even though made over and contrived from last year s stock they can t know anything about it then said jennie decisively for certainly nobody can be decent and invest less in millinery than marianne and i do when i was a young lady said my wife a well dressed girl got her a new bonnet in the spring and another in the fall that was the extent of her purchases in this line a second best bonnet left of last year did duty to relieve and preserve the best one my father was accounted well to do but i had no more and wanted no more i also bought myself every spring two pair of gloves a dark and a light pair and wore them through the summer and another two through the winter one or two pair of white kids carefully cleaned carried me through all my parties hats had not been heard of and the great necessity which requires two or three new ones every spring and fall had not arisen yet i was reckoned a well appearing girl who dressed liberally now a young lady who has a waterfall hat an oriole hat and a jockey must still be troubled with anxious cares for her spring and fall and summer and winter bonnets all the variety will not take the place of them gloves are bought by the dozen and as to dresses there seems to be no limit to the quantity of material and trimming that may be expended upon them when i was a young lady seventy five dollars a year was considered by careful parents a liberal allowance for a daughter s wardrobe 1 had a hundred and was reckoned rich and i sometimes used a part to make up the deficiencies in the allowance of sarah evans my particular friend whose father gave her only fifty we all thought that a very scant pattern yet she generally made a very pretty and genteel appearance with the help of occasional presents from friends how could a girl dress for fifty dollars said marianne she could get a white muslin and a white cambric which with different sortings of ribbons served her for all dressoccasions a silk in those days took only ten yards in the making and one dark silk was considered a reasonable allowance to a lady s wardrobe once made it stood for something always worn carefully it lasted for years one or two calico morning dresses and a merino for winter wear completed the list then as to collars capes cuffs etc we all did our own embroidering and very pretty things we wore too girls looked as pretty then as they do now when four or five hundred dollars a year is insufficient to clothe them but mamma you know our allowance is n t anything like that it is quite a slender one though not so small as yours was said marianne don t you think the customs of society make a difference do you think as things are we could go back and dress for the sum you did you cannot said my wife without a greater sacrifice of feeling than i wish to impose on you still though i don t see how to help it i cannot but think that the requirements of fashion are becoming needlessly extravagant particularly in regard to the dress of women it seems to me it is making the support of families so burdensome that young men are discouraged from marriage a young man in a moderately good business might cheerfully undertake the world with a wife who could make herself pretty and attractive for seventy five dollars a year when he might sigh in vain for one who positively could not get through and be decent on four hundred women too are getting to be so attached to the trappings and accessories of life that they cannot think of marriage without an amount of fortune which few young men possess you are talking in very low numbers about the dress of women said miss feathers tone i do assure you that it is the easiest thing in the world for a girl to make away with a thousand dollars a year and not have so much to show for it either as marianne and jennie to be sure said i only establish certain formulas of expectation and it is the easiest thing in the world for instance in your mother s day girls talked of a pair of gloves now they talk of a pack then it was a bonnet summer and winter now it is a bonnet spring summer autumn and winter and hats like monthly roses a new blossom every few weeks and then said my wife every device of the toilet is immediately taken up and varied and improved on so as to impose an almost monthly necessity for novelty the jackets of may are outshone by the jackets of june the buttons of june are antiquated in july the trimmings of july are passées by september sidecombs back combs puffs rats and all sorts of such matters are in a distracted race of improvement every article of feminine toilet is on the move towards perfection it seems to me that an infinity of money must be spent in these trifles by those who make the least pretension to keep in the fashion well papa said jennie after all it s just the way things always have been since the world began you know the bible says can a maid forget her ornaments it s clear she can t you see it a a law of nature and you remember all that long chapter in the bible that we had read in church last sunday about the curls and veils and tinkling ornaments and crimping pins and all that women always have been too much given to dress and they always will be the thing is said marianne how can any woman i for example know what is too much or too little in mamma s day it seems a girl could keep her place in society by hard economy and spend only fifty dollars a year on her dress mamma found a hundred dollars ample i have more than that and find myself quite straitened to keep myself looking well i don t want to live for dress to give all my time and thoughts to it i don t wish to be extravagant and yet i wish to be lady like it annoys and makes me unhappy not to be fresh and neat and nice shabbincss and seediness are my aversion i don t see where the fault is can one individual resist the whole current of society it certainly is not strictly necessary for us girls to have half the things we do we might i suppose live without many of them and as mamma says look just as well because girls did before these things were invented now i confess i flatter myself generally that i am a pattern of good management and economy because i get so much less than other girls i go with i wish you could see miss thorne s fall dresses that she showed me last year when she was visiting here she had six gowns and no one of them could have cost less than seventy or eighty dollars and some of them must have been even more expensive and yet 1 don t doubt that this fall she will feel that she must have just as many more she runs through and wears out these expensive things with all their velvet and thread lace just as i wear my commonest ones and at the end of the season they are really gone spotted stained frayed the lace all pulled to pieces nothing left to save or make over i feel as if jennie and i were patterns of economy when i see such things i really don t know what economy is what is it there is the same difficulty in my housekeeping said my wife i think i am an economist i mean to be one all our expenses are on a modest scale and yet i can see much that really is not strictly necessary but if i compare myself with some of my neighbors i feel as if i were hardly respectable there is no subject on which all the world are censuring one another so much as this hardly any one but thinks her neighbors extravagant in some one or more particulars and takes for granted that she herself is an economist i ll venture to say said i that there is n t a woman of my acquaintance that does not think she is an economist papa is turned against us women like all the rest of them said jennie i wonder if it is n t just so with the men yes said marianne it s the fashion to talk as if all the extravagance of the country was perpetrated by women for my part i think young men are just as extravagant look at the sums they spend for cigars and pipes an expense which has n t even the pretence of usefulness in any way it s a purely selfish nonsensical indulgence when a girl spends money in making herself look pretty she contributes something to the agreeableness of society but a man s cigars and pipes are neither ornamental nor useful then look at their dress said jennie they are to the full as fussy and particular about it as girls they have as many fine invisible points of fashion and their fashions change quite as often and they have just as many knick knacks with their studs and their sleeve buttons and waistcoat buttons their scarfs and scarf pins their watchchains and seals and seal rings and nobody knows what then they often waste and throw away more than women because they are not good judges of material nor saving in what they buy and have no knowledge of how things should be cared for altered or mendedif their cap is a little too tight they cut the lining with a penknife or slit holes in a new shirt collar because it does not exactly fit to their mind for my part i think men are naturally twice as wasteful as women a pretty thing to be sure to have all the waste of the country laid to us you are right child said i women are by nature as compared with men the care taking and saving part of creation the authors and conservators of economy as a general rule man earns and woman saves and applies the wastefulness of woman is commonly the fault of man i don t see into that said bob stephens in this way economy is the science of proportion whether a particular purchase is extravagant depends mainly on the income it is taken from suppose a woman has a hundred and fifty a year for her dress and gives fifty dollars for a bonnet she gives a third of her income it is a horrible extravagance while for the woman whose income is ten thousand it may be no extravagance at all the poor clergyman s wife when she gives five dollars for a bonnet may be giving as much in proportion to her income as the woman who gives fifty now the difficulty with the greater part of women is that the men who make the money and hold it give them no kind of standard by which to measure their expenses most women and girls are in this matter entirely at sea without chart or compass they don t know in the least what they have to spend husbands and fathers often pride themselves about not saying a word on business matters to their wives and daughters they don t wish them to understand them or to inquire into them or to make remarks or suggestions concerning them i want you to have everything that is suitable and proper says jones to his wife but don t be extravagant but my dear says mrs jones what is suitable and proper depends very much on our means if you could allow me any specific sum for dress and housekeeping i could tell better nonsense susan i can t do that it s too much trouble get what you need and avoid foolish extravagances that s all i ask by and by mrs jones s bills are sent in in an evil hour when jones has heavy notes to meet and then comes a domestic storm i shall just be ruined madam if that s the way you are going on i can t afford to dress you and the girls in the style you have set up look at this milliners bill i assure you says mrs jones we have n t got any more than the stebbinses nor so much don t you know that the stebbinses are worth five times as much as ever i was no mrs jones did not know it how should she when her husband makes it a rule never to speak of his business to her and she has not the remotest idea of his income thus multitudes of good conscientious women and girls are extravagant from pure ignorance the male provider allows bills to be run up in his name and they have no earthly means of judging whether they are spending too much or too little except the semi annual hurricane which attends the coming in of these bills the first essential in the practice of economy is a knowledge of one s income and the man who refuses to accord to his wife and children this information has never any right to accuse them of extravagance because he himself deprives them of that standard of comparison which is an indispensable requisite in economy as early as possible in the education of children they should pass from that state of irresponsible waiting to be provided for by parents and be trusted with the spending of some fixed allowance that they may learn prices and values and have some notion of what money is actually worth and what it will bring the simple fact of the possession of a fixed and definite income often suddenly transforms a giddy extravagant girl into a care taking prudent little woman her allowance is her own she begins to plan upon it to add subtract multiply divide and do numberless sums in her little head she no longer buys everything she fancies she deliberates weighs compares and now there is room for self denial and generosity to come in she can do without this article she can furbish up some older possession to do duty a little longer and give this money to some friend poorer than she and ten to one the girl whose bills last year were four or five hundred finds herself bringing through this year creditably on a hundred and fifty to be sure she goes without numerous things which she used to have from the stand point of a fixed income she sees that these are impossible and no more wants them than the green cheese of the moon she learns to make her own taste and skill take the place of expensive purchases she refits her hats and bonnets retrims her dresses and in a thousand busy earnest happy little ways sets herself to make the most of her small income so the woman who has her definite allowance for housekeeping finds at once a hundred questions set at rest before it was not clear to her why she should not go and do likewise in relation to every purchase made by her next neighbor now there is a clear logic of proportion certain things are evidently not to be thought of though next neighbors do have them and we must resign ourselves to find some other way of living my dear said my wife i think there is a peculiar temptation in a life organized as ours is in america there are here no settled classes with similar ratios of income mixed together in the same society going to the same parties and blended in daily neighborly intercourse are families of the most opposite extremes in point of fortune in england there is a very well understood expression that people should not dress or live above their station in america none will admit that they have any particular station or that they can live above it the principle of democratic equality unites in society people of the most diverse positions and means here for instance is a family like dr selden s an old and highly respected one with an income of only two or three thousand yet they are people universally sought for in society and mingle in all the intercourse of life with merchant millionnaires whose incomes are from ten to thirty thousand their sons and daughters go to the same schools the same parties and are thus constantly meeting upon terms of social equality now it seems to me that our danger does not lie in the great and evident expenses of our richer friends we do not expect to have pineries graperies equipages horses diamonds we say openly and of course that we do not still our expenses are constantly increased by the proximity of these things unless we understand ourselves better than most people do we don t of course expect to get a fifteen hundred dollar cashmere like mrs so and so but we begin to look at hundred dollar shawls and nibble about the hook we don t expect sets of diamonds but a diamond ring a pair of solitaire diamond ear rings begins to be speculated about among the young people as among possibilities we don t expect to carpet our house with axminster and hang our windows with damask but at least we must have brussels and brocatelle it would not do not to and so we go on getting hundreds of things that we don t need that have no real value except that they soothe our self love and for these inferior articles we pay a higher proportion of our income than our rich neighbor does for his better ones nothing is uglier than low priced cashmere shawls and yet a young man just entering business will spend an eighth of a year s income to put one on his wife and when he has put it there it only serves as a constant source of disquiet for now that the door is opened and cashmere shawls are possible she is consumed with envy at the superior ones constantly sported around her so also with point lace velvet dresses and hundreds of things of that sort which belong to a certain rate of income and are absurd below it and yet mamma i heard aunt easygo say that velvet point lace and cashmere were the cheapest finery that could be bought because they lasted a lifetime aunt easygo speaks from an income of ten thousand a year they may be cheap for her rate of living but for us for example by no magic of numbers can it be made to appear that it is cheaper to have the greatest bargain in the world in cashmere lace and diamonds than not to have them at all i never had a diamond never wore a piece of point lace never had a velvet dress and have been perfectly happy and just as much respected as if i had who ever thought of objecting to me for not having them nobody as i ever heard certainly not mamma said marianne the thing i have always said to you girls is that you were not to expect to live like richer people not to begin to try not to think or inquire about certain rates of expenditure or take the first step in certain directions we have moved on all our life after a very antiquated and old fashioned mode we have had our little old fashioned house our little oldfashioned ways except the parlor carpet and what came of it my dear said i mischievously yes except the parlor carpet said my wife with a conscious twinkle and the things that came of it there was a concession there but one can t be wise always we talked mamma into that said jennie but one thing is certain said my wife that though i have had an antiquated plain house and plain furniture and plain dress and not the beginning of a thing such as many of my neighbors have possessed i have spent more money than many of them for real comforts while i had young children i kept more and better servants than many women who wore cashmeres and diamonds i thought it better to pay extra wages to a really good trusty woman who lived with me from year to year and relieved me of some of my heaviest family cares than to have ever so much lace locked away in my drawers we always were able to go into the country to spend our summers and to keep a good family horse and carriage for daily driving by which means we afforded as a family very poor patronage to the medical profession then we built our house and while we left out a great many expensive commonplaces that other people think they must have we put in a profusion of bathingaccommodations such as very few people think of having there never was a time when we did not feel able to afford to do what was necessary to preserve or to restore health and for this i always drew on the surplus fund laid up by my very unfashionable housekeeping and dressing your mother has had said i what is the great want in america perfect independence of mind to go her own way without regard to the way others go i think there is for some reason more false shame among americans about economy than among europeans i cannot afford it is more seldom heard among us a young man beginning life whose income may be from five to eight hundred a year thinks it elegant and gallant to affect a careless air about money especially among ladies to hand it out freely and put back his change without counting it to wear a watch chain and studs and shirt fronts like those of some young millionnaire none but the most expensive tailors shoemakers and hatters will do for him and then he grumbles at the dearness of living and declares that he cannot get along on his salary the same is true of young girls and of married men and women too the whole of them are ashamed of economy the cares that wear out life and health in many households are of a nature that cannot be cast on god or met by any promise from the bible it is not care for food convenient or for comfortable raiment but care to keep up false appearances and to stretch a narrow income over the space that can be covered only by a wider one the poor widow in her narrow lodgings with her monthly rent staring her hourly in the face and her bread and meat and candles and meal all to be paid for on delivery or not obtained at all may find comfort in the good old book reading of that other widow whose wasting measure of oil and last failing handful of meal were of such account before her father in heaven that a prophet was sent to recruit them and when customers do not pay or wages are cut down she can enter into her chamber and when she hath shut her door present to her father in heaven his sure promise that with the fowls of the air she shall be fed and with the lilies of the field she shall be clothed but what promises are there for her who is racking her brains on the ways and means to provide as sumptuous an entertainment of oysters and champagne at her next party as her richer neighbor or to compass that great bargain which shall give her a point lace set almost as handsome as that of mrs crœsus who has ten times her income but papa said marianne with a twinge of that exacting sensitiveness by which the child is characterized i think 1 am an economist thanks to you and mamma so far as knowing just what my income is and keeping within it but that does not satisfy me and it seems that is n t all of economy the question that haunts me is might i not make my little all do more and better than i do there said i you have hit the broader and deeper signification of economy which is in fact the science of comparative values in its highest sense economy is a just judgment of the comparative value of things money only the means of enabling one to express that value this is the reason why the whole matter is so full of difficulty why every one criticizes his neighbor in this regard human beings are so various the necessities of each are so different they are made comfortable or uncomfortable by such opposite means that the spending of other people s incomes must of necessity often look unwise from our stand point for this reason multitudes of people who cannot be accused of exceeding their incomes often seem to others to be spending them foolishly and extravagantly but is there no standard of value said marianne there are certain things upon which there is a pretty general agreement verbally at least among mankind for instance it is generally agreed that health is an indispensable good that money is well spent that secures it and worse than ill spent that ruins it with this standard in mind how much money is wasted even by people who do not exceed their income here a man builds a house and pays in the first place ten thousand more than he need for a location in a fashionable part of the city though the air will be closer and the chances of health less be spends three or four thousand more on a stone front on marble mantels imported from italy on plate glass windows plated hinges and a thousand nice points of finish and has perhaps but one bathroom for a whole household and that so connected with his own apartment that nobody but himself and his wife can use it another man buys a lot in an open airy situation which fashion has not made expensive and builds without a stone front marble mantels or plate glass windows but has a perfect system of ventilation through his house and bathing rooms in every story so that the children and guests may all without inconvenience enjoy the luxury of abundant water the first spends for fashion and show the second for health and comfort here is a man that will buy his wife a diamond bracelet and a lace shawl and take her yearly to washington to show off her beauty in ball dresses who yet will not let her pay wages which will command any but the poorest and most inefficient domestic service the woman is worn out her life made a desert by exhaustion consequent on a futile attempt to keep up a showy establishment with only half the hands needed for the purpose another family will give brilliant parties have a gay season every year at the first hotels at newport and not be able to afford the wife a fire in her chamber in midwinter or the servants enough food to keep them from constantly deserting the damp mouldy dingy cellarkitchen the cold windy desolate attic devoid of any comfort where the domestics are doomed to pass their whole time are witnesses to what such families consider economy economy in the view of some is undisguised slipshod slovenliness in the home circle for the sake of fine clothes to be shown abroad it is undisguised hard selfishness to servants and dependents counting their every approach to comfort a needless waste grudging the roman catholic cook her cup of tea at dinner on friday when she must not eat meat and murmuring that a cracked second hand lookingglass must be got for the servants room what business have they to want to know how they look some families will employ the cheapest physician without regard to his ability to kill or cure some will treat diseases in their incipiency with quack medicines bought cheap hoping thereby to fend off the doctor s bill some women seem to be pursued by an evil demon of economy which like an ignis fatuus in a bog delights constantly to tumble them over into the mire of expense they are dismayed at the quantity of sugar in the recipe for preserves leave out a quarter and the whole ferments and is spoiled they cannot by any means be induced at any one time to buy enough silk to make a dress and the dress finally after many convulsions and alterations must be thrown by altogether as too scanty they get poor needles poor thread poor sugar poor raisins poor tea poor coal one wonders in looking at their blackened smouldering grates in a freezing day what the fire is there at all for it certainly warms nobody the only thing they seem likely to be lavish in is funeral expenses which come in the wake of leaky shoes and imperfect clothing these funeral expenses at last swallow all since nobody can dispute an undertaker s bill one pities these joyless beings economy instead of a rational act of the judgment is a morbid monomania eating the pleasure out of life and haunting them to the grave some people again think that nothing is economical but good eating their flour is of an extra brand their meat the first cut the delicacies of every season in their dearest stages come home to their table with an apologetic smile it was scandalously dear my love but i thought we must just treat ourselves and yet these people cannot afford to buy books and pictures they regard as an unthought of extravagance trudging home with fifty dollars worth of delicacies on his arm smith meets jones who is exulting with a bag of crackers under one arm and a choice little bit of an oil painting under the other which he thinks a bargain at fifty dollars i can t afford to buy pictures smith says to his spouse and i don t know how jones and his wife manage jones and his wife will live on bread and milk for a month and she will turn her best gown the third time but they will have their picture and they are happy jones s picture remains and smith s fifty dollars worth of oysters and canned fruit to morrow will be gone forever of all modes of spending money the swallowing of expensive dainties brings the least return there is one step lower than this the consuming of luxuries that are injurious to the health if all the money spent on tobacco and liquors could be spent in books and pictures i predict that nobody s health would be a whit less sound and houses would be vastly more attractive there is enough money spent in smoking drinking and over eating to give every family in the community a good library to hang everybody s parlor walls with lovely pictures to set up in every house a conservatory which should bloom all winter with choice flowers to furnish every dwelling with ample bathing and warming accommodations even down to the dwellings of the poor and in the millennium i believe this is the way things are to be in these times of peril and suffering if the inquiry arises how shall there be retrenchment i answer first and foremost retrench things needless doubtful and positively hurtful as rum tobacco and all the meerschaums of divers colors that do accompany the same second retrench all eating not necessary to health and comfort a french family would live in luxury on the leavings that are constantly coming from the tables of those who call themselves in middling circumstances there are superstitions of the table that ought to be broken through why must you always have cake in your closet why need you feel undone to entertain a guest with no cake on your teatable do without it a year and ask yourselves if you or your children or any one else have suffered materially in consequence why is it imperative that you should have two or three courses at every meal try the experiment of having but one and that a very good one and see if any great amount of suffering ensues why must social intercourse so largely consist in eating in paris there is a very pretty custom each family has one evening in the week when it stays at home and receives friends tea with a little bread and butter and cake served in the most informal way is the only refreshment the rooms are full busy bright everything as easy and joyous as if a monstrous supper with piles of jelly and mountains of cake were waiting to give the company a nightmare at the close said a lady pointing to a gentleman and his wife in a social circle of this kind i ought to know them well i have seen them every week for twenty years it is certainly pleasant and confirmative of social enjoyment for friends to eat together but a little enjoyed in this way answers the purpose as well as a great deal and better too well papa said marianne in the matter of dress now how much ought one to spend just to look as others do i will tell you what i saw the other night girls in the parlor of one of our hotels two middle aged quaker ladies came gliding in with calm cheerful faces and lustrous dove colored silks by their conversation i found that they belonged to that class of women among the friends who devote themselves to travelling on missions of benevolence they had just completed a tour of all the hospitals for wounded soldiers in the country where they had been carrying comforts arranging advising and soothing by their cheerful gentle presence they were now engaged on another mission to the lost and erring of their own sex night after night guarded by a policeman they had ventured after midnight into the dance houses where girls are being led to ruin and with gentle words of tender motherly counsel sought to win them from their fatal ways telling them where they might go the next day to find friends who would open to them an asylum and aid them to seek a better life as i looked upon these women dressed with such modest purity i began secretly to think that the apostle was not wrong when he spoke of women adorning themselves with the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit for the habitual gentleness of their expression the calmness and purity of the lines in their faces the delicacy and simplicity of their apparel seemed of themselves a rare and peculiar beauty i could not help thinking that fashionable bonnets flowing lace sleeves and dresses elaborately trimmed could not have improved even their outward appearance doubtless their simple wardrobe needed but a small trunk in travelling from place to place and hindered but little their prayers and ministrations now it is true all women are not called to such a life as this but might not all women take a leaf at least from their book i submit the inquiry humbly it seems to me that there are many who go monthly to the sacrament and receive it with sincere devotion and who give thanks each time sincerely that they are thus made members incorporate in the mystical body of christ who have never thought of this membership as meaning that they should share christ s sacrifices for lost souls or abridge themselves of one ornament or encounter one inconvenience for the sake of those wandering sheep for whom he died certainly there is a higher economy which we need to learn that which makes all things subservient to the spiritual and immortal and that not merely to the good of our own souls and those of our family but of all who are knit with us in the great bonds of human brotherhood the sisters of charity and the friends each with their different costume of plainness and self denial and other noble hearted women of no particular outward order but kindred in spirit have shown to womanhood on the battle field and in the hospital a more excellent way a beauty and nobility before which all the common graces and ornaments of the sex fade appear like dim candles by the pure eternal stars

the new york state comptroller thomas p dinapoli issued a press release on wednesday reporting that estimated bonuses for new york city s financial industry grew by 20 percent in 2021 to a record average of 257 500 per employee the wall st street sign is framed by the american flags flying outside the new york stock exchange friday jan 14 2022 in the financial district ap photo mary altaffer new york state s top fiscal officer issued his statement as part of the state s annual report it showed that the pretax profits from which cash payouts were made to wall street bankers totaled 45 billion in the first three quarters of the year the largest amount on record there were approximately 180 000 employees in the state s industry the same number as 2020 the numbers pop out and are higher than what had been projected dinapoli said of the report he also called it welcome news because the wall street employees account for 18 percent or nearly 15 billion of new york tax revenue even though they represent just 5 percent of the state s private sector workforce although the numbers for 2021 are not yet available the average annual income of wall street employees in 2020 was 483 370 or nearly five times the income of others in new york s private sector bonuses paid out to securities industry employees in 2020 were 213 700 an increase of 28 percent from the previous year the report says that fourth quarter 2021 wall street financial results have not yet been released but they are expected to show continued profitability which would represent the sixth consecutive year of growth in profits since 2015 profits are likely to reach the second highest level on record after 2009 which saw 61 4 billion the payout of massive bonuses to those who buy and sell financial assets and instruments for various wall street securities firms over the past two years is further proof that the capitalist elite has exploited the coronavirus pandemic to further enrich themselves while the rest of the population has been thrown into economic crisis and have faced the public health devastation of covid 19 trillions of dollars have been funneled to the big corporations and wall street through bailouts and the intervention of the federal reserve over the last two years while at least 1 million americans have succumbed to the virus and tens of millions more have been infected rapidly rising inflation meanwhile is undermining workers living standards as every section of the working class has been forced to return to their jobs over the past year to ensure the continued growth of corporate profits with the state and federal governments having removed any measures to stop the pandemic a recent state comptroller report said that the securities industry employees continue to work from home at rates that are two to three times greater than any other industry wall street has by far the highest share of employees able to work from home at 98 5 percent as dinapoli said wall street s soaring profits continued to beat expectations in 2021 and drove record bonuses however the comptroller warned that recent events are likely to drive near term profitability and bonuses lower he said that the markets are turbulent and recovery in other sectors remains sluggish and uneven dinapoli also pointed to russia s war in ukraine as a threat to wall street s ever rising indexes while the stock market has risen by 80 percent since february 2020 fueled by trillions of dollars in federal reserve bank asset purchases new york city s employment in the retail restaurant art and tourism industries is down by 10 26 20 and 34 percent respectively meanwhile for the working class wages have been effectively cut by the 40 year record inflation rate of 7 9 percent with the federal reserve raising interest rates to push down demand for wage increases and the cutoff of supplemental unemployment benefits by both democrats and republicans in congress and the white house workers are facing a combined assault on incomes and living standards wealth and income inequality in the us and around the world had already reached historic proportions prior to 2020 but they have been vastly accelerated during the pandemic according to the 2022 knight frank report on the super rich there was an increase in the number of ultra high net worth individuals uhnwi those with assets of 30 million or more of 9 3 percent to a total of 610 569 in 2021 the largest number of these individuals 233 590 people live in north america the world s richest person elon musk now claims a net worth which exceeds 270 billion thanks in large part to the continued inflation of the stock market the combined net worth of the six richest men in the world has topped 1 trillion equivalent to the gross domestic product of indonesia a country of 273 million the ever increasing wealth and number of billionaires the world over while hundreds of millions have gotten sick and millions have died from covid 19 is one side of the crisis and breakdown of the capitalist system another side is the growing danger of a nuclear armed world war posed by the us nato provoked russian invasion of ukraine in order to prevent the capitalist class from dragging the whole of society into a catastrophe the working class must mount an international struggle against war and take up the fight for socialism
