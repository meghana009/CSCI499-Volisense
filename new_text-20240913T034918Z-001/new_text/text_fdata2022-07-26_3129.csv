neiman marcus group ceo geoffroy van raemdonck noted on monday that recent market volatility has not impacted sales so far as the company continues to see healthy growth markets have been experiencing volatility in recent weeks as concerns over federal reserve rate hikes amid high inflation continue to worry investors ticker security last change change i dji dow jones averages 37735 11 248 13 0 65 sp500 s p 500 5061 82 61 59 1 20 i comp nasdaq composite index 15885 018605 290 08 1 79 fed officials have indicated that the central bank would likely raise rates by another 75 basis points at its upcoming meeting this week as a way to try to tame inflation which currently sits at 40 year highs we see the volatility and the volatility existing across all sectors including retail van raemdonck told cavuto coast to coast on monday right now we re not seeing this translating into our sales and we continue to see healthy growth why is inflation still so high and when will it start to cool historically what s really impacted luxury is big drop in our price big drop in the market and that s usually what drives the change in behavior he continued van raemdonck noted that customers who spend more than 10 000 a year account for almost half of the company s sales despite economic headwinds including high inflation they are very loyal to us and very engaged in luxury he said u s consumer confidence increased slightly in july surprising economists who had forecasted another decline as inflation continues to rage after sentiment reached the lowest point on record in june the university of michigan s consumer sentiment index released earlier this month rose to 51 1 this month up from a record low of 50 in june economists polled by refinitiv had expected a july reading of 49 9 for perspective the index was at 81 2 a year ago inflation reached a new 40 year high of 9 1 in june and the persistence of price increases continues to pummel americans budgets still the neiman marcus ceo noted that his customers have remained resilient van raemdonck noted that his sales are up 30 compared to pre covid levels in the last quarter and that sales of the company s top 20 brands are up 70 he attributed the bump to the company s differentiated business model where customers can engage with 3 000 sales associates in stores online and in a remote setting he noted that there has been strong demand for luxury shoes and handbags as well as a massive acceleration in mens items which he pointed out increased 60 compared to pre covid levels retail sales also rose last month in part propelled by increased spending on gas which hit a record high topping 5 mid month prices have since subsided and average around 4 58 according to aaa van raemdonck argued that the market has expanded and pointed to a couple of statistics if we look at the customers who spend more than 10 000 with us per year the one we recruited post covid is six years younger than the one we had pre covid which indicates that a younger generation is really significantly engaging in luxury he noted click here to read more on fox business and then we are also seeing new customers are spending in their first transaction somewhere around 20 more than pre covid and so i think they are really coming to the luxury providers and focusing on the luxury brands that we offer fox business breck dumas and megan henney contributed to this report

menafn dailyfx gold talking points last week was the first green weekly bar in gold since early june and this happened after a test of major support around current two year lows the fomc rate decision on wednesday is the big driver on the economic calendar and already gold prices are testing the first zone of resistance as taken from prior support the analysis contained in article relies on price action and chart formations to learn more about price action or chart patterns check out our dailyfx education section gold prices have seen prices continue to slide this summer with last week finally bringing on that test of key support in the 1700 area while prices did test below 1700 they didn t cross the swing low from last august instead buyers stepped in just before that price could be tested and that s so far led to a slingshot like retracement that support test happened last thursday and that was followed by a strong bullish response into last week s close thursday price action closed the daily bar as a bullish engulf and friday saw continuation as prices jumped straight into the first zone of resistance an area plotted from fibonacci levels at 1723 1733 so far through the weekly open that zone of resistance has helped to hold the highs but sellers haven t exactly taken advantage of the situation just yet gold daily price chart chart prepared by james stanley gold on tradingview gold longer term the trend in gold since june and bigger picture since april has been undeniably bearish gold tagged the 2 000 psychological level in mid april and that weekly bar finished as a bearish engulf sellers then had two phases in the move pushing down to 1785 support first which was followed by a four week retracement which was then followed by the sell off in june that propelled prices down to key support the reason for pointing this out is the potential for a retracement after last week s sell off ran into such a significant spot of support while the bearish trend remains attractive and the rationale for that continuing remains in force the bigger question is one of sentiment the bearish trend in gold had moved into oversold territory on the daily chart on july 5th and then for much of the next two weeks rsi diverged as price action set lower lows and rsi began to show higher lows now that we have the start of a retracement in that bearish move the big question is for how long it might continue and given technical context the door can remain open for prices to pullback to resistance at 1753 or perhaps even 1785 while remaining in the bigger picture bearish trend gold weekly price chart chart prepared by james stanley gold on tradingview gold shorter term was this pullback enough or is there more re load to go before bears can take over to the degree that a breach of support might come into the equation well given this week s economic calendar it would certainly appear that there is ample potential the wednesday fomc rate decision will be a big driver for macro markets and that includes both the us dollar and gold but there s also a us gdp release on thursday and on friday we get the fed s preferred inflation gauge of pce the expectation there is for an in line print of 4 7 and that s followed by the final read of university of michigan consumer sentiment so this week s economic calendar is loaded and from that batch of headline risk certainly exists the potential for new themes to get priced in here from a technical perspective on gold a breach of resistance turned support at 1712 opens the door for a run down to 1700 after which bearish breakout potential remains looking for a test of the august 2021 swing low at 1677 9 that support zone could remain a thorny area for price action as just below that 2021 swing low is another swing at 1673 3 for both of those levels to get taken out we ll likely need a forceful move in the us dollar and this is something that can also show up in stocks and other macro asset classes but it s especially visible in gold at the moment given the continued struggle at the fed to tame inflation on the topside of gold a breach of resistance from 1723 1733 opens the door for a move up to the secondary resistance zone plotted from 1751 1753 after which another confluent zone comes into the picture plotted between fibonacci levels at 1763 and 1771 gold four hour price chart chart prepared by james stanley gold on tradingview written by james stanley head of education and senior strategist for dailyfx com contact and follow james on twitter jstanleyfx

benefitted from the seasonal pick up in utilization in our robotics and well intervention operations in the north sea we have previously said 2022 was projected to be a transition year for helix with an especially challenging first half during the first half of 2022 we completed scheduled maintenance and regulatory inspections on six of our vessels including the q7000 in west africa the siem helix 1 transited back to brazil to complete rov support work prior to its contracted multi year decommissioning campaign at the end of the year we continued to de lever our balance sheet with the repayment of our 2022 convertible debt during the second quarter we closed on the acquisition of the alliance group of companies on july 1 and are excited to add the alliance team and their shelf decommissioning capabilities to our helix family we believe that we have positioned the company for a much stronger second half of 2022 and beyond the prospects for the offshore market are starting to reflect improved activity in line with current commodity prices and outlook with significant uncertainty behind us we have now issued full year guidance all markets we serve are showing signs of

decreased 0 1 million in the second quarter 2022 compared to the prior quarter our second quarter 2022 revenues saw a decrease due to lower utilization in west africa offset by improved utilization in the north sea and higher rates in the gulf of mexico utilization in west africa decreased as the q7000 commenced scheduled maintenance in namibia early in the quarter following its successful campaign in nigeria the north sea saw utilization improved seasonally with significantly improved utilization on both vessels gulf of mexico rates improved during the quarter and both vessels have now completed their scheduled regulatory inspections brazil revenues improved due to higher utilization on the siem helix 2 with the completion of its five year regulatory inspections during the prior quarter offsetting lower utilization on the siem helix 1 which completed its low revenue accommodations project overall well intervention vessel utilization held steady at 67 during the second quarter 2022 with the decrease in west africa utilization offset by strong utilization improvements in the north sea well intervention net loss from operations was 22 5 million an improvement of 9 2 million during the second quarter 2022 compared to the prior quarter primarily due to a shift of operations to higher margin projects during the quarter well intervention revenues decreased 26 0 million or 20 in the second quarter 2022 compared to the second quarter 2021 the decrease was primarily due to lower utilization in west africa and lower rates in our brazil unit offset in part by higher rates and utilization in the gulf of mexico and higher utilization in the north sea west africa utilization decreased as the q7000 commenced scheduled maintenance during the second quarter 2022 and our brazil operations had the siem helix 2 under its extended contract at lower rates and the siem helix 1 on an accommodations project at lower rates throughout most of the second quarter 2022 whereas both vessels were operating on legacy contracts at higher rates during the second quarter 2021 revenues in the gulf of mexico increased from the prior year with higher utilization and an increase in rates and integrated projects during the second quarter 2022 overall well intervention vessel utilization decreased to 67 during the second quarter 2022 compared to 72 during the second quarter 2021 well intervention net loss from operations increased 15 8 million in the second quarter 2022 compared to the second quarter 2021 primarily due to lower revenues offset in part by a net reduction in operating costs due to lower q7000 utilization and reduced charter costs in brazil robotics robotics revenues increased 12 5 million or 33 in the second quarter 2022 compared to the prior quarter the increase in revenues was due to seasonally higher vessel rov and trenching activities chartered vessel days increased to 370 days compared to 323 total vessel days and vessel utilization increased to

other selling general and administrative selling general and administrative expenses were 17 6 million or 10 8 of revenue in the second quarter 2022 compared to 14 4 million or 9 6 of revenue in the

www helixesg com non gaap financial measures management evaluates performance and financial condition using certain non gaap measures primarily ebitda adjusted ebitda net debt net debt to book capitalization and free cash flow we define ebitda as earnings before income taxes net interest expense gains or losses on extinguishment of long term debt gains and losses on equity investments net other income or expense and depreciation and amortization expense non cash impairment losses on goodwill and other long lived assets are also added back if applicable to arrive at our measure of adjusted ebitda we exclude the gain or loss on disposition of assets acquisition and integration costs and the general provision release for current expected credit losses if any net debt is calculated as long term debt including current maturities of long term debt less cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash net debt to book capitalization is calculated by dividing net debt by the sum of net debt and shareholders equity we define free cash flow as cash flows from operating activities less capital expenditures net of proceeds from sale of assets we use ebitda adjusted ebitda and

to analyze and evaluate financial and strategic planning decisions regarding future investments and acquisitions to plan and evaluate operating budgets and in certain cases to report our results to the holders of our debt as required by our debt covenants we believe that our measures of ebitda adjusted ebitda and free cash flow provide useful information to the public regarding our operating performance and ability to service debt and fund capital expenditures and may help our investors understand and compare our results to other companies that have different financing capital and tax structures other companies may calculate their measures of ebitda adjusted ebitda and free cash flow differently from the way we do which may limit their usefulness as comparative measures ebitda

in hollywood movies about money managers gone bad someone almost always winds up in jail the sad reality is that there are financial advisors who cheat investors every day and don t get caught even when they do pioneering research from colleen honigsberg a faculty fellow at the stanford institute for economic policy research siepr shows how some continue to work as financial advisors their past misconduct often unknown to investors the reason is because government oversight of financial advisors is highly fragmented as a result different investments such as stocks commodities or annuities are overseen by different federal and state regulatory bodies this enables advisors good and bad to choose their regulators and move among them with relative ease for example if advisors are expelled by the primary watchdog overseeing stockbrokers the financial industry regulatory authority finra they can often shift into selling derivatives which are regulated by the national futures association nfa or become life insurance brokers under state law in one of the study s most striking insights honigsberg an associate professor at stanford law school finds that the most corrupt financial advisors who remain in the profession often end up in insurance sales where state laws governing them tend to be lenient with more than half of americans now using a financial advisor mostly for retirement planning honigsberg and her co authors document how often advisors shift among industry regulators a practice known as regulatory arbitrage in their analysis covering a 10 year period they show for the first time that thousands of advisors with the worst track records under federal regulators became state registered insurance agents the authors suggest policy reforms at the federal and state level to prevent bad actors from exploiting regulatory loopholes however they note that reforms may be harder to enact in insurance where the insurance industry exerts significant influence over state lawmakers for example honigsberg and her collaborators show that 11 percent of state legislators are current or former insurance agents which they note is unusually high compared to other professions they also cite one study finding that up to half of all state insurance commissioners work in the industry after leaving government roughly one in 13 financial advisors have a black mark on their records according to research cited in the study that was conducted by amit seru a professor at stanford graduate school of business and a siepr senior fellow honigsberg notes that the rates are likely higher given that not all bad behavior gets detected there is a lot of misconduct in financial services and that misconduct can have really detrimental effects on people not just as it relates to their finances but also to other areas of their life honigsberg says studies suggest for example that victims experience health and relationship problems insurance sales as fallback for their study honigsberg and her collaborators built a novel dataset tracking 1 2 million finra registered advisors as they moved among federal and state regulatory bodies between 2010 and 2020 at the federal level they follow advisors registered with finra the commodities trading futures commission cftc and the securities and exchange commission sec they also collected data on state level insurance registrations they find that among former finra members who continue to work in financial services nearly 11 percent have a history of misconduct for example they were fired for improper behavior criminally sanctioned or paid to settle a customer dispute nearly 8 percent of ex finra members remaining in financial services had committed serious misconduct a subcategory that excludes cases involving customer settlements honigsberg and her co authors edwin hu and robert jackson jr both of new york university school of law also find that former finra advisors who committed wrongdoing but continued working under a different regulator were more likely to break the rules again than finra brokers with disciplinary records who stayed put of the former finra members with disciplinary records who become insurance agents or producers in industry parlance over 16 percent had a record of misconduct almost 12 percent had histories of serious misconduct these numbers are especially troubling honigsberg says as the lines between insurance products and traditional investments have blurred in the 12 years since congress legislated that annuities are not securities thus causing these products to fall under insurance regulation it s a well known secret within the industry that as the insurance model has shifted to broader more robust financial planning services advisors with a history of misconduct are moving to state regulatory regimes honigsberg says impactful research fraud in various contexts is a core theme in honigsberg s research for example she is working with daniel ho a stanford professor of law and political science and a siepr senior fellow on a project to reduce misreporting of environmental data senator elizabeth warren d mass has cited honigsberg s research in calling on finra which oversees broker dealers to make it harder for its members to expunge records of customer complaints and just last month honigsberg was appointed to serve on an sec investor advisory committee charged with helping to protect investors and bolster the integrity of u s securities markets according to honigsberg finra a self regulatory body that is overseen by the sec recently tightened rules for allowing members with misconduct on their records to remain as broker dealers she noted how such changes although important can be stymied by the current regulatory landscape finra may be tightening the net but they re acting alone honigsberg says unless you tighten the rules for all regulatory regimes simultaneously you risk individuals moving from one regulator to another rather than exiting the system entirely policy proposals honigsberg and her collaborators note that decentralized oversight of financial services makes a lot of sense the breadth of products and services are so broad and the needs and risk tolerances of clients vary widely still the researchers say there are practical steps policymakers can take to better protect consumers they include requiring regulators to
the country s income levels and theoretically spending have much room to grow another area of potential is china s plan to unify business standards and access within the country said dan wang shanghai based chief economist at hang seng bank china however it remains to be seen how china can effectively boost new growth drivers like consumption while controlling problems such as a potential fallout from the real estate industry beijing several economists expect that china will avoid a japan style stagnation if the right policies take effect china s gross domestic product barely grew in the second quarter while covid lockdowns stifled growth those restrictions have eased but covid controls remain an uncertain overhang while the country awaits a quarterly gathering of policymakers expected at the end of the month but even if covid restrictions ease china still has untapped growth potential for the next few years the economists said get dfw local news weather forecasts and entertainment stories to your inbox sign up for nbc dfw newsletters for one the country s income levels and theoretically spending have much room to grow china s per capita gdp in 2021 was less than a fifth of that in the united states and adjusted net national income per capita was about one seventh of that in the united states according to world bank data given the room for catch up is still there china s still going to maintain 4 to 5 growth in the next five to 10 years said larry hu chief china economist at macquarie he said there are uncertainties that could affect his estimates including whether china can shift from relying on investment to consumption for growth another area of potential is china s plan to unify business standards and access within the country said dan wang shanghai based chief economist at hang seng bank china once those barriers can be lifted that can increase income by a great deal she noted how current practice can favor a company from a local city over one from another province a stark example of these regional biases played out this year when different covid rules among provinces created inefficiency she pointed out wang said overseas demand and increased investment in manufacturing in china could support growth in the coming years much of the country s official economic narrative has emphasized the unexpected impact of covid and the russia ukraine conflict while pointing out that inflationary pressures are far higher in countries like the united states when asked whether china would face japan style economic stagnation bank of china chief researcher zong liang dismissed the possibility he said china has among other things kept control of its currency while japan s yen has fluctuated too quickly zong also pointed to china s investment and self reliance in tech innovation as for economic growth in the near term he expects stimulus announced in may to take effect in the third or fourth quarter and some benefit from increased trade under new regional free trade agreements however zong said china does face similar challenges to japan when it comes to the housing market beijing has tried to clamp down on speculation in the market in the last few years but an underlying more difficult problem for real estate is the aging population a problem that deserves our attention zong said in mandarin according to a cnbc translation consumption problem others however are less optimistic china has an even more extreme version of the japanese imbalances making it harder to rely on consumption for growth said michael pettis a finance professor at peking university in an email japan s economy has stagnated generally growing more slowly than the u s and china since the 1990s following the burst of a bubble in stocks and real estate japan grew rapidly in the 1970s and 1980s thanks to high growth in exports and infrastructure investment but by the early 1990s the country was increasingly investing in wasteful projects said pettis he said japan has not been able to turn to its consumers to drive growth primarily because the manufacturing sector has not been able to accept the needed transition to higher wages china won t necessarily follow japan s path if china can make substantial changes to its political institutions pettis wrote in april but he said the more likely scenario is that china doesn t enter a financial crisis or sharp economic crisis and instead is more likely to face a very long japan style period of low growth if nonproductive investment primarily in infrastructure and property is reduced and not replaced with an equivalent source of growth pettis estimated china s gdp would grow by no more than 2 or 3 annually in coming years covid drag for this year many investment banks have slashed their china gdp forecasts to below 4 in light of the country s zero covid policy economists can t resolve this issue said xu hongcai deputy director of the economics

increased state support the situation in japan may actually be a reason to warrant some more planning economy approach said zhu professor of finance and deputy dean at the shanghai advanced institute

by trevor hunnicutt washington reuters ahead of a crucial midterm election u s president joe biden is leaning heavily on one man moderate republican and federal reserve chair jerome powell to tackle the top issue worrying voters inflation for much of american history the president relying on stewardship of the world s largest economy from a federal reserve official appointed by the opposition political party would not be remarkable but hyper politicization in washington makes the biden powell relationship unusual and one likely to be tested in months to come white house officials believe the nov 8 midterm election for control of congress will be a referendum on biden s handling of consumer price spikes an issue powell has more tools to contain than the administration but the fed s painful medicine for inflation threatens to zap consumer demand and throw americans out of work the fed is expected to raise rates again on wednesday by 75 basis points furthering the central bank s shift away from ultra loose policies launched after the covid 19 pandemic joe biden and jay powell understand they need each other said sarah binder a political science professor at george washington university who studies relationships between presidents and the fed the fed needs the white house to be supportive of these policy choices that could throw the economy into a recession rates are now set above 1 5 up from near zero in march as the fed takes aim at consumer inflation exceeding 9 punishing the housing market and causing executives to reconsider investments and hiring biden s approval has fallen back to a record low of 36 reuters ipsos polling shows with voters more concerned about inflation than other policy issues powell s big challenge now is figuring out how far to go to contain inflation and whether to stick with aggressive rate hikes at the expense of spooking markets or causing a recession biden wed to powell s decisions after re upping the donald trump chosen lawyer as fed chair in november now has no choice but to wait for the results gary richardson a university of california irvine economics professor said the bipartisan approach is meant to shield the fed from political pressure but inflation tends to create a lot of trouble for incumbent politicians and that s been a constant over centuries it s going to be the same in november biden backs trump appointee after months of deliberations biden left the federal reserve s policy portfolio with powell even without a clear sense of how the official first picked and then bullied by trump would handle inflation powell a d c area native followed a well trod path to influence including stops on wall street the treasury and a centrist think tank biden s pick was mostly an endorsement of powell s prior experience and stewardship it was also a nod to biden s belief that the fed could stand apart from the polarization evidenced by judicial decisions and lock step congressional republican opposition to democratic bills the powell selection which was welcomed by financial markets also gives biden a scapegoat if something goes wrong analysts said both democrats and republicans are likely to pounce on powell if they perceive the slightest hint he is towing a political line if the fed chief is partisan he has shown little sign of it within the largely consensus driven fed in his first year as chair in 2018 powell continued the policy started under his predecessor janet yellen a democrat now serving as biden s treasury secretary of raising rates from near zero as the economy recovered from the 2007 09 great recession raising trump s ire by the next year the fed was cutting rates again on concerns over slowing growth a greater emphasis on employment and the belief that inflation may be too low the white house was aware that its fed nominees announced from november through january were undecided then about whether price hikes needed to be corrected with sharply tighter monetary policy one administration official said it is the primary job of the federal reserve to get inflation under control according to a white house official they are a well qualified and serious group with immense experience in retrospect the fed administration officials and most economists failed at anticipating inflation s persistence amid continued supply constraints and new issues like the ukraine war now the fed is set to be on a tightening trajectory not seen since former chair paul volcker s 1980s era battle with inflation my plan is to address inflation biden said before a private meeting with powell in may it starts with a simple proposition respect the fed and respect the fed s independence which i have done and will continue to do i hear that and i think blame avoidance said binder shifting the blame to the fed telling the fed this is your job blaming the other guy is a time honored practice in washington and the fed would not be immune to criticism regardless of the political affiliation of its chief and while it may not be biden s style other democrats not so keen on being congenial with republicans may find fault with powell for its part the administration hopes the steps it is taking to unclog ports cheapen trans ocean shipping and lower gasoline prices with strategic reserve releases for instance can make it easier for the fed to tamp down inflation without raising rates too high according to one person familiar with officials thinking solving the inflation problem without causing a growth problem reporting by trevor hunnicutt additional reporting by

when it comes to investing there are many things that can potentially ruin investor returns one of them is inflation this is because inflation has the potential to reduce the purchasing power of investments in other words the amount of money invested will be worth less because the cost of goods and services are higher to protect investments from being demolished by inflation it is important to invest in assets that will earn a rate of return that is greater than the value of inflation one asset class that has a proven record of outperforming inflation are alternative investments let us look at how alternative investments can help us beat the negatives of inflation what are alternative investments alternative investments are assets that are outside the traditional asset classes of stocks bonds and cash these non traditional assets can be commodities real estate hedge funds private equities private placements cryptocurrency etc why are alternative investments a good option for beating inflation 1 good for diversification alternative assets tend to be less correlated with traditional asset classes which means they can provide diversification benefits this is important because it means that when traditional assets such as stocks and bonds are struggling alternative investments may still be performing well as they are doing now 2 increases value during inflation alternative investments can be a great option for beating inflation because they often increase in value during periods of inflation this is because many alternative assets are hard assets such as real estate or commodities which increase in value when prices are rising one good example would be that property owners can increase rent to keep up with inflation which could bode well for real estate investment trusts reits 3 tax benefits alternative assets may also have tax benefits associated with them for example many alternative investments are structured as pass through entities which means that their profits and losses are passed through to the investor and taxed at the individual level this can result in a lower effective tax rate than the tax rate that would apply to a traditional taxable account 4 potential for higher returns lastly alternative investments offer investors the potential for higher returns than traditional assets such as stocks and bonds this is because they can be riskier which means there is a greater chance of losses but also a greater potential for gains for example a venture capital fund may invest in a portfolio of high growth start ups that could go to zero or could generate returns of ten times or more conclusion alternative investments can be a powerful addition to any portfolio to help offset inflation these investments can add diversification to help mitigate market volatility and instability alternative investments can also offer the potential for higher returns than traditional investments especially during times of uncertainty and high inflation media contact company name family business fund contact person douglas muir email send email phone 888 884 6442 address 101 plaza real south suite 216 city boca raton state fl 33432 country united states website www familybusinessfund com

a pick up zips along on new snow hill road paving joanne cole the select board last monday had three words for residents enjoying fresh paving on snow hill road and penney road slow down people on action items board members settled who among them will serve as liaison to which town committees and boards for the coming year did away with their own voting privileges as liaisons and took the candidate referendum committee off the chopping block for now the board also heard upbeat reports from department heads and the environmental resources committee as well as a status report on all of this season s planned paving meanwhile fallout from the board s june committee appointments continued in the form of letters from residents but the most consequential july 18 meeting item is likely to be the board s decision to have new gloucester participate in the m dash program this statewide program with four pilot towns five now counting new gloucester help residents age in place and in health read on new gloucester to join m dash program m dash stands for municipal data across sectors for healthy aging what it means is access to data and expert support translating that information into solutions and action with municipal government and community partners m dash s goal is to make maine communities more age friendly and more livable across the age spectrum consultant larry clifford explained to the board it is sponsored by the maine council on aging clifford said m dash collects town specific data from local regional and state resources and presents it in an accessible dashboard format to help identify healthcare social and other needs they then help the community connect with experts to develop action steps and connect with resources to implement the plans the data can be a bit of a surprise to the town clifford said for example he said the town of gray in effect said holy smokes there s no one here over the age of 80 people are leaving once they hit 80 gray is now exploring possible reasons why and possible solutions in eastport data showed aging housing stock clifford said leading to a program of low cost home repairs an example of m dash income and housing data from consultant larry clifford s presentation to the select board the work depends on strong active local engagement clifford stressed that usually takes the form of a 15 to 20 person task force comprising representatives from town government typically the manager or assistant manager parks rec the library the local livable community group or committee if any area housing agencies churches and other community groups and interested residents asked whether m dash would get input from the community as well as data from outside sources clifford turned to julie fralich who spearheads the volunteer group building livability in new gloucester or bling fralich described the comprehensive community survey bling has just put out you can complete it here which dovetails with m dash s work the survey will also shared through community groups print copies can be picked up at the library board members discussed whether a more open task force or an official town committee would be the better vehicle for the work and also who would represent the town with the town manager in transition in the end the board set aside any questions for later the value of participating and the need to sign on soon carried the day unanimously board liaisons to committees voting privileges as usual once select board members are seated for the coming year the board divvied up who would serve as liaison to which committees among changes tammy donovan will join peter bragdon on the budget committee and dustin ward will come off paul larrivee will join cip in place of donovan bragdon will join the environmental resources committee and larrivee will come off and larrivee will take up the economic development committee and bragdon will come off without fanfare the board unanimously agreed to relinquish voting rights as liaisons except for the foreclosure committee and capital improvement plan committee which have special status under town ordinances the board had given itself voting status on some committees in part in order to reach a quorum a practice that had increasingly come under scrutiny the liaison role is not defined in town policy the board is likely to address that as it reviews and revises bylaws for boards and committees board task list priorities a board task list comprising more than 40 items in process prompted a discussion of how best to use the time remaining before town manager christine landes departs her last day with new gloucester is august 23 priorities included completing a salary survey to inform staff compensation getting the town primed

in may for school board and select board elections previously the cable tv committee had both organized and produced candidate forums board members acknowledged the value of the forums all had participated in candidate referendum committee forums in the end they hesitated to abolish the committee without having an alternative in place members briefly discussed other possibilities a conversation that s likely to continue and let the committee stand environmental resources committee shares apparel recycling success lauren jordan of the erc gave the board the report they d asked

anne wilson continues to bring the sunshine regarding town finances this time the word amazing was used wilson described the town as all but awash in cash at the close of the 21 22 fiscal year revenues far exceeded budgeted expectations across several categories as wilson explained the town expected to need 1 1 million from the undesignated fund to cover expenses last year not only did the town not end up drawing any of the 1 1 million it added 100 000 to the kitty she said in other words 1 2 million to the good add to that some 615 000 in arpa funds on hand and we re in a very good

clear out has now been so extensive you can do doughnuts in there with a fire truck letters on committee appointments at the outset of the meeting the board heard a letter from resident charles gauvin requesting an apology and reinstatement to the land management planning committee making appointments at their june 27 meeting and with a motion pending to re appoint gauvin and john salisbury vice chair paul larrivee liaison to lmpc raised attendance issues saying it s been for various reasons whether being out of town or not choosing to work on the topic not wanting to be involved in the topic given a request from salisbury to meet remotely due to extended travel he appeared to be the out of town person leaving the implication that gauvin refused to work on the unnamed topic no reason for any refusal was shared both individuals offer tremendous value larrivee said but the committee is not getting any work completed neither gauvin and salisbury was reappointed in a july 17 letter to set the record straight gauvin requested an apology and reinstatement he said he d raised with the committee his belief that it was inappropriate and undemocratic for lmpc to unilaterally develop the town s marijuana policy without guidance from the elected select board or input from citizens a concern remedied by community survey results april and may lmpc meetings were cancelled due to others absences he said calling the board s handling of the matter arbitrary and capricious gauvin added that no attendance policy was communicated to him nor any notice that he was at risk of not being re appointed meanwhile concerns with board s appointment process and criteria were also raised by residents in an open letter to the board neither gauvin s letter nor the one from residents was discussed by the board at the july 18 meeting as the board reviews the town s by laws for boards and committees they will consider a possible attendance policy perhaps as soon as july 25 if time allows

increase in the company s net income from the three months ended march 31 2022 to the three months ended june 30 2022 was primarily due to an increase in net interest income of 2 6 million as a result of loan growth partially offset by an increase in the provision for loan losses of 1 3 million as a result of loan growth and an increase in non interest expense of 0 6 million as a result of increased business development activity the increase in average assets was largely the result of an increase in average loans held for investment and sale due to an increase in average interest

2022 as compared to three months ended june 30 2021 the increase in the company s net income from the three months ended june 30 2021 to the three months ended june 30 2022 was primarily due to an

increase in total loans held for investment partially offset by a 154 6 million decrease in cash and cash equivalents the 446 1 million increase in total loans held for investment between december 31 2021 and june 30 2022 was a result of 753 6 million in non ppp loan originations partially offset by 22 1 million in ppp loan forgiveness payoffs or charge offs and 285 4 million in non ppp loan payoffs and paydowns the increase in total liabilities from december 31 2021 to june 30 2022 was primarily attributable to an increase in federal home loan bank of san francisco fhlb advances of 60 0

during the periods indicated above were increases in average yields on interest earning deposits with banks and investment securities these increases were partially offset by declining loan yields over the same periods average loan yields decreased from 4 73 during the three months ended june 30 2021 to 4 53 during the three months ended march 31 2022 to 4 47 during the three months ended june 30 2022 these decreases were primarily due to changes in the macroeconomic environment which caused a majority of the company s fixed rate loans funded in the aforementioned quarters to recognize yields lower than those recognized in prior quarters the rates associated with the index utilized for a significant portion of the company s variable rate loans the united states 5 year treasury index were higher during the three months ended june 30 2022 as compared to the three months ended march 31 2022 and the three months ended june 30 2021 but a majority of these loans were not scheduled to reprice during the three months ended june 30 2022 also contributing to the downward trend in average loan yields new loan originations drove increases in the average daily balance of loans for each of the periods above which partially offset the aforementioned declining average loan yields additionally yields on ppp loans increased from 4 48 for the three months ended june 30 2021 to 27 85 and 23 33 for the quarters ended march 31 2022 and june 30 2022 respectively due to an acceleration of deferred fee accretion resulting from ppp loans being forgiven by the small business administration sba and repaid which also helped to offset declining average loan yields factors affecting interest expense and rates increased average daily balances of and increased rates paid on interest bearing liabilities during the three months ended june 30 2022 as compared to the quarters ended march 31 2022 and june 30 2021 drove the increase in interest expense during the most recent quarter as a result the cost of interest bearing liabilities also increased over each of the respective periods additionally the cost of funds decreased from 0 20 for the quarter ended june 30 2021 to 0 17 for the quarter ended march 31 2022 with an increase to 0 24 for the quarter ended june 30 2022 asset quality sba ppp all ppp loans had been forgiven paid off by the borrower or charged off as of june 30 2022 covid 19 deferments pursuant to federal guidance the company implemented loan programs to allow certain consumers and businesses impacted by the covid 19 pandemic to defer loan principal and interest payments at june 30 2022 two borrowing relationships with two loans totaling 0 1 million were on covid 19 deferment all but one of the loans that ended covid 19 deferments in the quarter ended june 30 2022 have returned to their pre covid 19 contractual payment structures with no risk rating downgrades to classified nor any troubled debt restructuring tdr of the loans that ended covid 19 deferments in the quarter ended june 30 2022 one is non accrual and returned to a pre covid 19 risk rating of classified as of june 30 2022 we anticipate that the remaining loans on covid 19 deferment will return to their pre covid 19 contractual payment status after their covid 19 deferments end allowance for loan losses at june 30 2022 the company s allowance for loan losses was 25 8 million as compared to 23 2 million at december 31 2021 the 2 6 million increase is due to a 3 2 million provision for loan losses recorded during the six months ended june 30 2022 partially offset by net charge offs of 0 7 million during the first six months of 2022 at june 30 2022 the company s ratio of nonperforming loans to loans held for investment decreased from 0 03 at december 31 2021 to 0 02 primarily due to a decrease in the company s nonperforming commercial secured loans loans designated as substandard decreased to 1 2 million at june 30 2022 from 10 6 million at december 31 2021 this resulted in a net reduction of 0 1 million in reserves related to classified loans that was offset by an increase in the provision related to loan growth that occurred during the first six months of 2022 there were no loans with doubtful risk grades at june 30 2022 or december 31 2021 a summary of the allowance for loan losses by loan class is as follows june 30 2022 december 31 2021 dollars in

for investment period over period is primarily due to a significant decline in classified loans and improvement in the risk level for retail commercial real estate loans partially offset by increased reserves based on economic conditions during the six months ended june 30 2022 the ratio of the allowance for loan losses to loans held for investment excluding ppp loans is considered a non gaap

related primarily to an overall decline in the effective yields on loans sold during the three months ended june 30 2022 compared to the three months ended june 30 2021 due to uncertainty surrounding

global stock market crash it was used by pehr g gyllenhammar who was the chief executive officer of volvo at the time cash is king was also used frequently throughout the global financial crisis in 2008 and it s certainly been thrown out during the time of coronavirus have you noticed a theme here how important is it to have cash on hand during times of uncertainty cash without question reigns supreme the reason it s the most valuable liquid asset an individual or business can possess liquidity is being able to meet your obligations without taking without incurring a loss in other words you can still carry out basic economic actions i m talking about buying selling paying off your debt or putting food on the table without using a credit card or taking out a loan the amount you have in a checking or savings account money market assets marketable equity securities stocks marketable debt securities bonds u s treasuries mutual funds exchange traded funds etfs automobiles items you own

following reasons and some tips on how to make this possible cash flow or the measure of the amount of money being transferred in and out of your business can ultimately make or break your organization regardless of how profitable your business is on paper explains peter daisyme is a previous due article while conceptually simple launching and executing a cash flow management strategy can be tricky even for financially experienced organizations but just how big of a deal is cash flow peter argues that it matters more than revenue it s hard to say that cash flow matters more than revenue since both are defining financial metrics for your organization he adds however revenue and even your net profit can be high while cash flow suffers and if your cash flow creeps too far into negative numbers you may never fully recover 2 can help your business scale then you re going to have invested in it i m referring to upgrading your technology purchasing property or hiring new employees often these are one time purchases so it makes more sense to use your existing assets instead of taking out a loan or line of credit and being stuck paying back interest for years to come as

month the problem it s the 15th and a client still hasn t paid you even worse you don t have enough money to cover the bill furthermore you can also grow your business by acquiring another sometimes

might miss out on the opportunity i can tell you from personal experience that this juggling act can be stressful let s say that your phone bill is due on the 18th of the month the problem it s the 15th and a client still hasn t paid you even worse you don t have enough money to cover the bill if you miss this payment you re going to be slapped with a late fee your service may also get turned off and let s not talk about those sleepless nights as you worry about paying your bills 4 reduce transaction and security costs for small businesses in particular it s imperative that you keep your costs as low as possible one way to achieve this is by having cash on hand not only reduces financial stress and anxiety it also ensures that you ll avoid unnecessary late fees because you paid the bill on time for small businesses in particular it s imperative that you keep your costs as low as possible one way to achieve this is by eliminating payment processing fees from wire transfers credit debit cards or gateways like paypal the most glaring starting point is only to accept cash payments business owners can t rely on a paycheck hitting their bank account every two weeks adds amanda if they aren t working they aren t making money if a hurricane takes you out for a week or longer you ve lost a lot of money 6 ensures surviving an economic downturn as we re continuing to witness external factors like covid 19 can lead to an economic downturn while this figure will probably increase as of august 31 2020 bills do not stop because of an emergency like a hurricane or global pandemic while your mortgage company may give you a short forbearance and that s a big maybe other service providers probably won t she states the truth is we re often on our own financially after emergencies and that s where savings can help as we re continuing to witness external factors like covid 19 can lead to an economic downturn while this figure will probably increase as of august 31 2020 yelp reported that 163 735 total u s businesses on yelp have closed since the beginning of the pandemic even if you re able to reopen which i hope you are you may have to adhere to new guidelines from organizations like the cdc for example cleaning and disinfecting the building installing a new ventilation system or putting up plexiglass dividers the importance of cash on hand for individuals cash on hand doesn t just apply to businesses it s also necessary for the average joe or jane 1 it s liquid the best thing about cash or any other liquid asset you own is that it s there when you need it for instance you might have been furloughed having cash on hand can give you a lifeline during these turbulent times it can also help you adapt without putting yourself into debt cash on hand doesn t just apply to businesses it s also necessary for the average joe or jane the best thing about cash or any other liquid asset you own is that it s there when you need it for instance you might have been furloughed because of the pandemic is your 10 year treasury bond going to pay for rent groceries or other necessary expenses 2 keeps your investments diversified diversification is an investment strategy where you own a variety of assets that will perform differently over time the answer is a resounding no while u s treasury bonds should be a part of your portfolio to had stability you can t touch it until it matures that makes it useless when you re in a pinch diversification is an investment strategy where you own a variety of assets that will perform differently over time clarifies due founder and ceo john rampton the idea is that it provides security and mitigates risk if an investment fails or underperforms you won t lose everything at the same a diversified portfolio shouldn t contain too many options adds rampton diversification is a protection against ignorance said warren buffett makes very little sense for those who know what they re doing 3 gives you psychological peace of mind if you ve invested for at least 10 years you have been through a stock market decline how to get rich without winning the lottery it hurts it s painful to watch your portfolio value decline even worse having to sell assets after a decline because you need the money and yes liquid assets like cash should certainly be a part of your diversified portfolio as it provides security and stability if you ve invested for at least 10 years you have been through a stock market decline states barbara friedberg mba ms author of it hurts it s painful to watch your portfolio value decline even worse having to sell assets after a decline because you need the money the psychological medicine of holding cash can t be underestimated adds friedberg imagine how you would feel even if you don t need any of the money in your investment portfolio for a long time if you saw the s p 500 index drop 20 percent or 30 percent and you didn t have any cash in your portfolio this type of experience causes fear to take over and investors to feel like they must do something she states and usually doing something involves selling stocks at the bottom 4 there are still cash only transactions for the last month i ve been self disciplined enough not to get takeout i finally decided to treat myself to pizza last weekend after i called in my order i remembered that my favorite pizzeria is still cash only thankfully i had cash in the house if not i would have had to hit up a nearby atm not the end of the world but that would have defeated the purpose of getting delivery 5 helps you avoid interest and fees if you recall businesses are responsible for late fees you are as well so another advantage using cash to make smaller purchases ensures that you stick to your budget or cave to impulse purchases for instance if you want to the grocery store with 50 to spend and that s all the cash you have then that s it but if you have your credit card you might make impulse purchases if you recall businesses are responsible for late fees you are as well so if you re a freelancer and a client has paid you you cannot pay your bills and if you don t have a cash cushion to get you by expect to be penalized moreover when you have cash available you won t have to rely on plastic or take a loan as a result you re avoiding debt as well as those hefty interest rates and that may even damage your credit score 6 covers the unexpected life is full of surprises some pleasant others not so much and it only gets worse when you don t if you use your card like when buying plane tickets at least you have the money to pay off the balance life is full of surprises some pleasant others not so much and it only gets worse when you don t have an emergency reserve to handle these unexpected expenses in fact even just 1 000 set aside would suffice our research suggests that keeping a cash buffer greatly reduces the risk that a family will miss a payment for rent mortgage or a recurring bill will be unable to afford enough food or will be forced to skip needed medical care within the next six months writes emily gallagher assistant professor of finance at the university of colorado boulder and a research fellow at the federal reserve banks of st louis and philadelphia if you don t have this buffer you may fall into debt or even withdraw funds from your retirement account because you lost your job or had a medical dental emergency in fact americans have racked up 45 billion in medical debt but it s just not emergencies that are unforeseen there will be times when costs may be higher than anticipated case in point getting a quote on a car repair or redoing your home s bathroom you could have been told it would cost 1 000 but it ends up costing you an additional 600 having cash on hand won t make this a stressful problem how much cash on hand should you have it s often advised that you should have between 3 to 6 months of living expenses in an emergency fund so if you need 3 000 to cover your most important expenses think mortgage utilities and food each month that means you ll need at least 9 000 saved but that will increase depending on other factors if you re married and have three children then you ll need even more cash on hand money under 30 has a handy emergency fund calculator to help determine how much you should have saved but what about business owners for companies the amount of cash they should hold depends on their industry s cyclicality the overall strength of their balance sheet and their funding needs explains matthew dilallo for the motley fool companies in highly cyclical industries with weak balance sheets and large capital spending programs should carry more cash than those in stable sectors with strong balance sheets and limited capital needs cash also gives these companies the flexibility to make acquisitions or other investments during periods of market turmoil he adds investors need to keep those things in mind when looking at a company s cash balance i know that s not helpful if you were looking for an exact amount but i think you should take dilallo s advice and figure this out with a financial advisor and if you re struggling to save cash start out small if possible put 100 a month to the side within a year you ll have 1 200 that might not sound like much but it s without question better than having no cash on

pay transparency laws are catching fire in legislative bodies around the country as we have previously reported these laws which target pay equity have gone into effect in a number of jurisdictions such as colorado and new york city in recent years new york state is one of the latest to pass such a bill on june 2 2022 that requires private employers in the state to publish salary or wage ranges in all job postings the bill which has been passed by the state legislature and awaits the signature of governor kathy hochul will become effective 270 days after it is signed with the bill effectively applying to very small businesses i e employers with four or more employees companies have reportedly asked governor hochul not to sign the bill into law without first limiting its application to larger businesses in the meantime here is what employers need to know about the law it applies to employers with four or more employees which means only the smallest of employers do not have to comply as well as temporary staffing firms which are also excluded it applies to any advertising for any job promotion or transfer opportunity that can or will be performed at least in part in the state of new york postings must contain either the actual compensation or a range of compensation for the opportunity a job description if a description exists and a general description of other types of compensation offered e g fringe benefits bonuses stock options or commissions range of compensation will mean the minimum and maximum annual salary or hourly range of compensation for the opportunity that the employer in good faith believes to be accurate at the time of posting postings for any opportunity paid solely on a commission basis will comply with the law provided it contains a general statement that compensation will be based on commission it requires employers to keep records needed to comply with the law which may include the history of compensation ranges and any job description for each opportunity it includes anti retaliation prohibitions protecting applicants or employees who for exercising any rights under the law for violations employers are subject to civil penalties of up to 3 000 aggrieved employees have no private right of action but can file a complaint with the new york commissioner of labor the state law is similar to the new york city pay transparency law currently scheduled to go into effect on november 1 2022 still it includes some additional items including the recordkeeping requirements and the need to include a job description in a posting if it already exists i e it does not have to be created for posting purposes notably because the state law like the city law applies to any job that can or will be performed in new york it appears to cover any posting for remote work even outside of new york because the job could be given to an applicant who resides in new york as a result the law could have an impact on an employer that does not otherwise have an office or other physical presence in new york it may seem a legal and practical stretch that this new york state law would have any real impact on an employer that has no physical presence in new york state however those companies that sell their products or services in new york or employ any new york based employees remote or brick and mortar should take heed of this law with the massive shift to remote work during and after the covid 19 pandemic many businesses have become multi jurisdictional employers often in ways that they may not recognize especially when a remote worker lives or moves to a state where the employer has no other connection employers with remote workers need to understand and apply various and often differing state laws that impact complex policies and practices including for example paid leave time sick safe time leave restrictive covenants and ever increasingly pay transparency these pay transparency laws come in a variety of shapes and sizes other jurisdictions already have pay transparency laws on the books that are similar to the new york state and city laws see e g washington colorado and jersey city nj elsewhere there are laws that require employers to disclose pay ranges not on postings but during the hiring process see e g connecticut nevada or to applicants on request see e g maryland connecticut and california going forward employers should expect to and will see more of these laws come into effect in other states and localities including rhode island in 2023 and ithaca new york in september 2022 as for new york state assuming that governor hochul were to sign the bill into law in the near future it would not become effective until mid april 2023 while that would seem to give plenty of time for new york employers to prepare for any change there is a good chance that long before then they will have come up against a similar law already in effect in another state or municipality thus it seems that it is never too late for new york and multi state employers to begin to review pay levels policies and practices review and change posting practices as needed for new hires transfers and promotions review and change job descriptions as needed for use in postings review requirements with managers and administrative personnel who may need to understand them and their impact conduct a pay equity audit a process that might naturally coincide with an assessment of compensation ranges for posting purposes whatever you do keep your eyes and ears open for new pay transparency law developments which are likely to occur quickly and anywhere including in places that an employer may wrongly assume is irrelevant

two years later regulation bi remains a tremendous priority for finra june 30th marked two years since the implementation of regulation best interest reg bi and the client relationship summary or form crs firm compliance with these new regulations remains a priority for finra having conducted more than 570 firm exams relating to reg bi through the end of 2021 in a recent episode of the finra podcast finra unscripted finra s meredith cordisco scott gilbert and nicole mccafferty offered candid remarks about what finra has learned during this initial two year review period including common problem areas and some of the best practices firms use to achieve compliance mr gilbert views reg bi as enhanc the more traditional suitability rules imposing four distinct obligations on broker dealers the disclosure obligation the care obligation the conflict of interest obligation and the compliance obligation specifically mr gilbert emphasized that finra will be doing a deeper dive with respect to the standard of care obligation for broker dealers and their registered reps this means an increased focus and scrutinization of what securities recommendations look like and whether they truly are in the best interest of the customer given the specific client profile importantly these reviews are all conducted in conjunction with the product specific rules at issue including finra rule 2330 variable annuities and finra rule 2360 options and how complex products may or may not be consistent with a client s investment profile not surprisingly finra s exams have found that firms that historically have had suitability issues now have issues relating to compliance with reg bi s care obligation these same firms have found themselves not only the subject of finra examinations but also finra arbitrations and for the first time ever an sec complaint sec brings first ever charges for violation of reg bi on june 15 2022 in a matter that could yield important rulings on the scope of reg bi the u s securities and exchange commission sec filed the first complaint in the u s district court for the central district of california for violation of reg bi the complaint filed against western international securities inc western and five of its registered representatives alleges that they violated reg bi in connection with the recommendations and sales of high risk illiquid and unrated debt securities known as l bonds issued by gwg holdings inc gwg specifically the sec alleges that western and the individual representatives recommended these bonds without understanding the risks associated with these securities and without a reasonable basis to believe that these investments were in the best interests of the investors many of whom were retirees or were on fixed incomes with moderate risk tolerances the sec claims that western and the registered representatives violated reg bi s care obligation by failing to exercise reasonable diligence care and skill to understand the risks associated with l bonds and recommending the l bonds without a reasonable basis to believe the bonds were in the best interests of their customers in addition the sec charged western with violating reg bi s compliance obligation alleging that western s policies and procedures were substantially copied from the sec s small entity compliance guide and contained no specific tailoring to western s particular business the sec s complaint provides a preview of what future reg bi suits might entail and confirms the sec s willingness to pursue individual registered representatives for reg bi violations losses stemming from investments in l bonds issued by gwg have already been the subject of multiple finra arbitrations though any potential recoveries in those matters seems unlikely in light of gwg s chapter 11 bankruptcy filing in april 2022 reg bi claims break into top 15 causes of action in finra arbitrations according to finra s recent dispute resolution statistics claimants in finra arbitrations have filed 37 reg bi claims against broker dealers and their registered representatives this year marking the first time that claims tied to reg bi have cracked the top 15 of finra arbitration claims while traditional suitability claims will still be asserted if the alleged wrongdoing predated reg bi it is clear that reg bi claims are trending upward and represent the future of customer arbitration cases other finra news finra tells us how it used its 2021 fine money on june 24 2022 finra issued its report on its use of 2021 fine money since 2017 finra has issued this fine spending report in an effort to make the sro s finances more transparent for 2021 finra issued 90 1 million in fines up from 57 million in 2020 however the year over year increase is largely attributed to the 57 million fine levied against trading app robinhood in june 2021 for allegedly misleading customers and allowing clients to engage in inappropriate options trading finra earmarked 30 million of the money it collected from robinhood to fund an education initiative that targets new investors who are trading on their own online and through mobile apps finra solicited input from firms investors and other stakeholders on effective ways to reach these new investors the report states in addition to the 90 1 million in 2021 fines the report also notes that finra collected another 37 6 million in what it refers to as fines eligible expenditures that are funded by reserves and excess operating results the total 127 7 million was allocated between capital initiatives 80 4 million and investor education programs 47 3 million capital expenditures include modernizing enforcement technology improving finra s data analytics capabilities strengthening market surveillance and modernizing securities industry infrastructure independent report on arbitrator selection process on june 29th finra published a report from independent counsel retained by finra s audit committee of the board of governors in connection with a case focused on the arbitrator selection process the report found no evidence of an improper agreement to remove certain arbitrators from arbitration cases as those that have been following this story will recall this report was prompted following a highly publicized decision from the georgia superior court that vacated an arbitration award after finding that one of the parties had manipulated the arbitrator selection process via an agreement with finra the purported agreement allowed arbitrators from an earlier case involving the counsel to be automatically stricken from the list of potential arbitrators in any case in which the same counsel appeared following an investigation that included 29 interviews the examination of more than 150 000 documents emails and telephone records the independent counsel concluded that there was no such agreement between the financial institution and finra the report also set forth a series of recommendations to better reflect the neutrality of the dispute resolution services forum and to further promote uniformity and consistency among the different drs regions the recommendations included i ongoing and mandatory staff training ii manual reviews for conflicts of interest iii ensuring that finra rules and the dispute resolution manual are consistent with publicly available documents iv requiring written explanations upon request whenever there is a causal challenge to the selection or removal of an arbitrator v procedural review of the algorithms used to determine if finra s current technology is still the most effective means in creating random computer generated arbitrator lists and vi other updates to the dispute resolution manual to clarify the staff roles and procedures notable enforcement matters and disciplinary actions underwriting brokerage firm national securities corporation nsc was sanctioned approximately 9 million for a wide range of alleged misconduct involving its underwriting activities the awc detailing finra s findings on this matter is available here most notably finra found that nsc attempted to artificially influence the market for the offered securities by entering into tie in agreements with branch managers whereby the manager s allocation was expressly conditioned on an agreement to purchase a specific number of shares in the aftermarket finra further found that nsc engaged in misconduct by agreeing to solicit customers receiving allocations to purchase additional shares in the aftermarket and by threatening to reduce allocations to representatives who would not agree to solicit their customers in the aftermarket according to finra nsc s misconduct violated rule 101 of the exchange act s regulation m which establishes a restricted period during which underwriters are prohibited from inducing bids or purchases of any offered security in the aftermarket in addition to nsc s alleged rule 101 violations finra s 9 million sanction resolves multiple other charges against nsc including allegations that the underwriter negligently omitted to tell investors about delays in the issuer s required public filings failed to obtain locates for more than 33 000 short sale transactions in violation of rule 203 b 1 of regulation sho under the exchange act failed to reasonably supervise one of its representatives who falsified information about customers assets and suitability in order to avoid nsc s internal rules and made inaccurate representations to finra regarding the sales of stock warrants notably finra had sanctioned nsc more than 663 000 in april alleging that the firm deceived investors about the price of shares in connection with a pre initial public offering the awc detailing finra s findings on this separate matter is available here whatsapp and private messaging over the past two months finra has fined one firm insight securities inc and one registered representative ramiro luis colon for engaging in business related communications on whatsapp in violation of the recordkeeping requirements in finra rule 4511 the fines levied by finra in the amount of 50 000 and 5 000 respectively come on the heels of recent reports that the sec too is cracking down on the use of private communications applications by investment banking employees back in december 2021 the sec levied fines against at least one financial institution for allegedly allowing its employees to use smartphone apps like whatsapp to circumvent recordkeeping requirements more recent news reports indicate that beginning around may 2022 the sec has been probing the personal mobile phones of certain employees at numerous financial firms to identify the potential use of unauthorized messaging platforms the recent finra disciplinary actions suggest that finra is taking cues from the sec and scrutinizing member firms for their employees usage of private messaging apps in the insight securities matter finra found that between 2016 and 2019 insight securities failed to capture review and retain thousands of business related communications sent and received through whatsapp as a result of the alleged violations insight securities consented to the imposition of a censure and a 50 000 fine the awc detailing finra s findings is available here as for ramiro luis colon finra found that he exchanged hundreds of communications with a single customer on whatsapp between 2018 and 2020 without authorization and in violation of his firm s written supervisory procedures as a result finra imposed a 30 day suspension from association with any finra member firm and a 5 000 fine the awc is available here notable finra arbitration awards options trading we

segment sales volume was down 17 000 tons compared to the second quarter of 2021 and down 10 000 tons from the first quarter of 2022 commenting on reported results mark w kowlzan chairman and ceo said results for the quarter were excellent as we once again improved our margins while continuing to experience significant cost inflation across the company as well as various supply chain challenges we had great execution of our previously announced price increases in both the packaging and paper segments demand in our packaging segment was solid with corrugated demand flat with last year s record second quarter which was up almost 10 versus the prior year along with demand out of our containerboard mills generating new second quarter production and sales volume records even with record production from our mills we still ended the quarter with weeks of containerboard inventory supply below our historical levels due to both internal and external demand needs the scheduled outages in our containerboard mills were performed very well but we had to postpone the scheduled outage at our international falls paper mill due to excessive flooding in the area just prior to the outage we have rescheduled this work to be completed in the third quarter employees across the company continued to do an outstanding job of meeting our customers needs and delivering on the numerous initiatives and projects to reduce costs and improve efficiencies across all of our facilities looking ahead as we move from the second and into the third quarter mr kowlzan added in our packaging segment although the majority of our previously announced price increases were recognized in the second quarter the remaining portion will be implemented during the third quarter in our paper segment we will continue implementing our previously announced price increases and earlier today we notified customers of an additional 60 per ton price increase on all paper grades effective with shipments beginning september 6th we began the third quarter with containerboard inventories below our target so we plan to build inventory ahead of the fourth quarter outage at our jackson mill for the first phase of the no 3 machine conversion to virgin linerboard with economic conditions continuing to be negatively impacted by broad based inflation and aggressive interest rate increases we see corrugated products growth as softening in the quarter but demand still firm as certain end markets work through their current supply of inventory we expect continued inflation in most all of our operating and converting costs to be the primary driver of our third quarter results higher gas purchased electricity and chemical prices along with higher labor costs are expected to be the key areas during the quarter continued rail service challenges along with rail fuel surcharges that typically lag diesel fuel prices by 30 60 days should also result in higher freight and logistics expenses and finally scheduled outage costs will be higher due to the international falls mill outage that was postponed from the second to the third quarter considering these items we expect third quarter

excluding special items we provide information regarding our use of non gaap financial measures and reconciliations of historical non gaap financial measures presented in this press release to the

are difficult to predict and quantify and may reflect the effect of future events we currently anticipate special items in the third quarter of 2022 to include accounting charges fees and expenses for paper to containerboard conversion related activities at the jackson al mill we do not currently expect any additional significant special items during the third quarter however additional special

the country s income levels and theoretically spending have much room to grow another area of potential is china s plan to unify business standards and access within the country said dan wang shanghai based chief economist at hang seng bank china however it remains to be seen how china can effectively boost new growth drivers like consumption while controlling problems such as a potential fallout from the real estate industry beijing several economists expect that china will avoid a japan style stagnation if the right policies take effect china s gross domestic product barely grew in the second quarter while covid lockdowns stifled growth those restrictions have eased but covid controls remain an uncertain overhang while the country awaits a quarterly gathering of policymakers expected at the end of the month but even if covid restrictions ease china still has untapped growth potential for the next few years the economists said get connecticut local news weather forecasts and entertainment stories to your inbox sign up for nbc connecticut newsletters for one the country s income levels and theoretically spending have much room to grow china s per capita gdp in 2021 was less than a fifth of that in the united states and adjusted net national income per capita was about one seventh of that in the united states according to world bank data given the room for catch up is still there china s still going to maintain 4 to 5 growth in the next five to 10 years said larry hu chief china economist at macquarie he said there are uncertainties that could affect his estimates including whether china can shift from relying on investment to consumption for growth another area of potential is china s plan to unify business standards and access within the country said dan wang shanghai based chief economist at hang seng bank china once those barriers can be lifted that can increase income by a great deal she noted how current practice can favor a company from a local city over one from another province a stark example of these regional biases played out this year when different covid rules among provinces created inefficiency she pointed out wang said overseas demand and increased investment in manufacturing in china could support growth in the coming years much of the country s official economic narrative has emphasized the unexpected impact of covid and the russia ukraine conflict while pointing out that inflationary pressures are far higher in countries like the united states when asked whether china would face japan style economic stagnation bank of china chief researcher zong liang dismissed the possibility he said china has among other things kept control of its currency while japan s yen has fluctuated too quickly zong also pointed to china s investment and self reliance in tech innovation as for economic growth in the near term he expects stimulus announced in may to take effect in the third or fourth quarter and some benefit from increased trade under new regional free trade agreements however zong said china does face similar challenges to japan when it comes to the housing market beijing has tried to clamp down on speculation in the market in the last few years but an underlying more difficult problem for real estate is the aging population a problem that deserves our attention zong said in mandarin according to a cnbc translation consumption problem others however are less optimistic china has an even more extreme version of the japanese imbalances making it harder to rely on consumption for growth said michael pettis a finance professor at peking university in an email japan s economy has stagnated generally growing more slowly than the u s and china since the 1990s following the burst of a bubble in stocks and real estate japan grew rapidly in the 1970s and 1980s thanks to high growth in exports and infrastructure investment but by the early 1990s the country was increasingly investing in wasteful projects said pettis he said japan has not been able to turn to its consumers to drive growth primarily because the manufacturing sector has not been able to accept the needed transition to higher wages china won t necessarily follow japan s path if china can make substantial changes to its political institutions pettis wrote in april but he said the more likely scenario is that china doesn t enter a financial crisis or sharp economic crisis and instead is more likely to face a very long japan style period of low growth if nonproductive investment primarily in infrastructure and property is reduced and not replaced with an equivalent source of growth pettis estimated china s gdp would grow by no more than 2 or 3 annually in coming years covid drag for this year many investment banks have slashed their china gdp forecasts to below 4 in light of the country s zero covid policy economists can t resolve this issue said xu hongcai deputy director of the economics policy commission at the china association of policy science that s according to a cnbc translation of his remarks in mandarin xu struck a pessimistic tone noting that monetary policy and fiscal policy may contribute little and that increasing their scale would only add to longer term problems troubles in china s massive real estate sector have also resurfaced this month with many homebuyers refusing to pay their mortgages until developers find the resources to finish constructing apartments more state support ultimately however china s economy may have to turn to its government for help after warning of the risks from excessive government support in his 2016 book china s guaranteed bubble author zhu ning said last month the best solution to unemployment and housing bubble problems is increased state support the situation in japan may actually be a reason to warrant some more planning economy approach said zhu professor of finance and deputy dean at the shanghai advanced institute of finance cannot think of a market based approach he said that just as japan built up its social safety net during a bubble period china should put more resources into ensuring three basic needs housing health care and education relieving chinese consumers of those costs could encourage them to spend zhu said

juana summers host a whole lot of people are scouring their budgets these days looking for anywhere they can squeeze out a few bucks aureli trujillo we ve canceled subscriptions such as amazon i think we also canceled hulu we re kind of on the fence on netflix right now violet olsick we stopped buying alcohol which isn t necessarily a bad thing but we started buying like the generic brand sodas you know small things like that robert hart we don t do a lot of driving and when we do drive we try to combine things for example if we have doctor s appointments we try to make sure that they get combined summers aureli trujillo ph violet olsick ph and robert hart ph like the rest of us they re dealing with 9 1 year over year inflation and it is not just regular americans making changes in the face of that historically high inflation so is the federal reserve this week it will again decide whether and how much to raise interest rates to try to bring inflation under control for a look at the stakes of that decision and everything roiling the economy in this moment we re joined by npr s chief economics correspondent scott horsley and npr business correspondent david gura hi there scott horsley byline good to be with you david gura byline hey juana summers inflation is raging right now and i have to imagine that most americans have never experienced anything like this in their lifetime before scott is it changing consumer behavior horsley we are starting to see people change their behavior a little bit and that s a change from what we were seeing earlier in the pandemic you know when the price of gas hit 5 a gallon last month people actually bought less gasoline and that s unusual ordinarily people will complain when the price of gas goes up but they typically pay whatever it cost to fill up their tank it s evident now there is a breaking point and it seems to be somewhere around 5 a gallon we re also seeing changes in what people spend at the supermarket you know early in the pandemic when people were having to eat all their meals at home some folks actually splurged and traded up to more expensive brands to replicate the restaurant experience they weren t having and now they re going in the opposite direction spending at the supermarket is still climbing but people are walking out with less food in their shopping carts in some cases they are trading down to generic store brands or shopping at cheaper outlets this isn t true throughout the economy though airline ticket prices are still climbing and yet people are buying more airline tickets spending at restaurants also continues to outpace restaurant prices but as the cost of things like food and energy and rent keeps climbing people are having to adjust their behavior summers another thing that a lot of people are feeling right now david is that their investment portfolios are just getting hammered is there a connection between inflation and all of those stock market crashes that we ve seen this year gura we have had so much volatility so you re picking on something i think a lot of people have noticed which is that markets have been really tumbling there have been days when we ve seen these kind of thousand point swings that s really radical and that s tough to stomach even if you re somebody who s invested for the long haul if you re a retiree juana this is a difficult time because portfolios are getting crushed and you know that you need that fixed income to live and it comes from those portfolios it s also a really tough time for people who are new to investing who might have downloaded an app like robinhood at the beginning of the pandemic and invested for the first time this has been a really rude awakening and there is a connection here to what scott knows so well covering economics and that s just the role that the fed is playing and how markets are reacting to it i mean there s this connection between inflation and these market crashes because the fed is hiking interest rates aggressively to bring down inflation what it s doing basically is it s raising borrowing costs for people for businesses as well and what the fed hopes will happen is that s going to slow down spending and bring down prices so to use a kind of tired metaphor here the fed is pumping the brakes on the economy in a way that we really haven t seen for decades and what that means is this era of cheap money that we d all gotten used to is over and that s made it a particularly volatile and difficult year for wall street so far summers david what do you mean when you say cheap money what is that gura so for a really long time the fed had pushed interest rates down they were near zero and you look at sort of what where you would had an opportunity to make money you couldn t make money really in a savings account because interest rates were so low so stocks were a place where that was happening and people had an inclination or a willingness to make bets on the future of companies particularly high growth companies or tech companies that s kind of dissipated now as these interest rates have gone up and we ve seen those tech companies getting really hard hit netflix is down more than 60 this year and meta facebook s parent company is down more than 45 so now there just isn t much of an appetite for investments that are seen as speculative summers one thing i want to talk about that i ve been thinking a lot about certainly is cryptocurrency david when you talked about speculative assets that was the first thing that came to my mind gura yeah i mean cryptocurrencies really grew in value last year kind of in kind of a crazy way it coincided with this big marketing blitz that companies made they were spending tens of millions of dollars on ads kind of leading up to the super bowl you remember that and we saw bitcoin really go up in value that kind of happened at the beginning of november of last year since then it s really dropped there s been this huge steep sell off and we were talking about how people got into investing for the first time with robinhood app a lot of people got into investing in crypto for the first time and they saw it as a volatile asset but the volatility was really only in one direction it just seemed like it kept going up and up and up and now there s been this really big crater i think it s kind of emblematic of where wall street is right now it s more conservatism prevailing on wall street companies are being cautious they re waiting to see what happens there s been 80 fewer companies that have gone public making their shares available to trade on the stock market they ve decided to hit pause they re waiting out this uncertainty and i think that that s you know a major takeaway from this moment people don t know what s going to happen that makes them a bit nervous and i think there s this bottom line there ve been a lot of bubbles that have been bursting and crypto is certainly one of them horsley the other place you really see the impact of those rising borrowing costs is in the housing market mortgage rates are about twice what they were this time last year as a result a typical monthly house payment has jumped nearly 750 this year that s putting houses out of reach for a lot of would be buyers and so builders are building fewer homes sales of existing homes are down the average selling price has still continued to climb across the country but in some of the hottest markets you are starting to see price cuts and it will take some time for these housing changes to show up in the inflation data but it will happen eventually summers scott how have these dramatic inflation numbers that we have all been watching and talking about affected the fed s actions horsley well you said it juana they are dramatic inflation topped 9 in june if you re under 40 you ve never seen prices climbing this fast so the fed is trying to as david says pump the brakes it does that by making it more expensive for people to borrow money it started boosting interest rates in march and those rate hikes have actually accelerated since then we expect the central bank to raise rates by another three quarters of a percentage point later this week that would match its increase back in june summers where do we expect rates to go from here horsley well they re probably going to go higher but the pace of those increases is still up in the air the fed is kind of taking it month by month as it sees how this all plays out i will say that we have gotten a little bit of reassuring news since the june meeting when the fed was really nervous that people s expectations for long term inflation might start to come unglued that s worrisome because if people think prices are just going to keep climbing at a rapid rate it can feed into the kind of wage price spiral we saw back in the 1970s since then though we ve seen some survey data showing that most people even though they re really worried about high inflation this year they think inflation is going to come down three to five years out so they still believe the fed s going to get control over this even if they are worried that the higher interest rates are going to cause a lot of pain along the way summers that was npr s chief economics correspondent scott horsley and business correspondent david gura thank you both for breaking this down for us horsley you re welcome gura thank you transcript provided by npr copyright npr

juana summers host a whole lot of people are scouring their budgets these days looking for anywhere they can squeeze out a few bucks aureli trujillo we ve canceled subscriptions such as amazon i think we also canceled hulu we re kind of on the fence on netflix right now violet olsick we stopped buying alcohol which isn t necessarily a bad thing but we started buying like the generic brand sodas you know small things like that robert hart we don t do a lot of driving and when we do drive we try to combine things for example if we have doctor s appointments we try to make sure that they get combined summers aureli trujillo ph violet olsick ph and robert hart ph like the rest of us they re dealing with 9 1 year over year inflation and it is not just regular americans making changes in the face of that historically high inflation so is the federal reserve this week it will again decide whether and how much to raise interest rates to try to bring inflation under control for a look at the stakes of that decision and everything roiling the economy in this moment we re joined by npr s chief economics correspondent scott horsley and npr business correspondent david gura hi there scott horsley byline good to be with you david gura byline hey juana summers inflation is raging right now and i have to imagine that most americans have never experienced anything like this in their lifetime before scott is it changing consumer behavior horsley we are starting to see people change their behavior a little bit and that s a change from what we were seeing earlier in the pandemic you know when the price of gas hit 5 a gallon last month people actually bought less gasoline and that s unusual ordinarily people will complain when the price of gas goes up but they typically pay whatever it cost to fill up their tank it s evident now there is a breaking point and it seems to be somewhere around 5 a gallon we re also seeing changes in what people spend at the supermarket you know early in the pandemic when people were having to eat all their meals at home some folks actually splurged and traded up to more expensive brands to replicate the restaurant experience they weren t having and now they re going in the opposite direction spending at the supermarket is still climbing but people are walking out with less food in their shopping carts in some cases they are trading down to generic store brands or shopping at cheaper outlets this isn t true throughout the economy though airline ticket prices are still climbing and yet people are buying more airline tickets spending at restaurants also continues to outpace restaurant prices but as the cost of things like food and energy and rent keeps climbing people are having to adjust their behavior summers another thing that a lot of people are feeling right now david is that their investment portfolios are just getting hammered is there a connection between inflation and all of those stock market crashes that we ve seen this year gura we have had so much volatility so you re picking on something i think a lot of people have noticed which is that markets have been really tumbling there have been days when we ve seen these kind of thousand point swings that s really radical and that s tough to stomach even if you re somebody who s invested for the long haul if you re a retiree juana this is a difficult time because portfolios are getting crushed and you know that you need that fixed income to live and it comes from those portfolios it s also a really tough time for people who are new to investing who might have downloaded an app like robinhood at the beginning of the pandemic and invested for the first time this has been a really rude awakening and there is a connection here to what scott knows so well covering economics and that s just the role that the fed is playing and how markets are reacting to it i mean there s this connection between inflation and these market crashes because the fed is hiking interest rates aggressively to bring down inflation what it s doing basically is it s raising borrowing costs for people for businesses as well and what the fed hopes will happen is that s going to slow down spending and bring down prices so to use a kind of tired metaphor here the fed is pumping the brakes on the economy in a way that we really haven t seen for decades and what that means is this era of cheap money that we d all gotten used to is over and that s made it a particularly volatile and difficult year for wall street so far summers david what do you mean when you say cheap money what is that gura so for a really long time the fed had pushed interest rates down they were near zero and you look at sort of what where you would had an opportunity to make money you couldn t make money really in a savings account because interest rates were so low so stocks were a place where that was happening and people had an inclination or a willingness to make bets on the future of companies particularly high growth companies or tech companies that s kind of dissipated now as these interest rates have gone up and we ve seen those tech companies getting really hard hit netflix is down more than 60 this year and meta facebook s parent company is down more than 45 so now there just isn t much of an appetite for investments that are seen as speculative summers one thing i want to talk about that i ve been thinking a lot about certainly is cryptocurrency david when you talked about speculative assets that was the first thing that came to my mind gura yeah i mean cryptocurrencies really grew in value last year kind of in kind of a crazy way it coincided with this big marketing blitz that companies made they were spending tens of millions of dollars on ads kind of leading up to the super bowl you remember that and we saw bitcoin really go up in value that kind of happened at the beginning of november of last year since then it s really dropped there s been this huge steep sell off and we were talking about how people got into investing for the first time with robinhood app a lot of people got into investing in crypto for the first time and they saw it as a volatile asset but the volatility was really only in one direction it just seemed like it kept going up and up and up and now there s been this really big crater i think it s kind of emblematic of where wall street is right now it s more conservatism prevailing on wall street companies are being cautious they re waiting to see what happens there s been 80 fewer companies that have gone public making their shares available to trade on the stock market they ve decided to hit pause they re waiting out this uncertainty and i think that that s you know a major takeaway from this moment people don t know what s going to happen that makes them a bit nervous and i think there s this bottom line there ve been a lot of bubbles that have been bursting and crypto is certainly one of them horsley the other place you really see the impact of those rising borrowing costs is in the housing market mortgage rates are about twice what they were this time last year as a result a typical monthly house payment has jumped nearly 750 this year that s putting houses out of reach for a lot of would be buyers and so builders are building fewer homes sales of existing homes are down the average selling price has still continued to climb across the country but in some of the hottest markets you are starting to see price cuts and it will take some time for these housing changes to show up in the inflation data but it will happen eventually summers scott how have these dramatic inflation numbers that we have all been watching and talking about affected the fed s actions horsley well you said it juana they are dramatic inflation topped 9 in june if you re under 40 you ve never seen prices climbing this fast so the fed is trying to as david says pump the brakes it does that by making it more expensive for people to borrow money it started boosting interest rates in march and those rate hikes have actually accelerated since then we expect the central bank to raise rates by another three quarters of a percentage point later this week that would match its increase back in june summers where do we expect rates to go from here horsley well they re probably going to go higher but the pace of those increases is still up in the air the fed is kind of taking it month by month as it sees how this all plays out i will say that we have gotten a little bit of reassuring news since the june meeting when the fed was really nervous that people s expectations for long term inflation might start to come unglued that s worrisome because if people think prices are just going to keep climbing at a rapid rate it can feed into the kind of wage price spiral we saw back in the 1970s since then though we ve seen some survey data showing that most people even though they re really worried about high inflation this year they think inflation is going to come down three to five years out so they still believe the fed s going to get control over this even if they are worried that the higher interest rates are going to cause a lot of pain along the way summers that was npr s chief economics correspondent scott horsley and business correspondent david gura thank you

india s two prominent economists arvind panagariya the former vice chairman of the niti aayog vice chairman and columbia university professor and poonam gupta the director general of the national council of applied economic research ncaer and a member of the prime minister s economic advisory council pmeac have in a policy paper batted for privatisation of all public sector banks except the state bank of india if the government was willing to listen to them they would even want the sbi to be privatised they said but we recognise that within the indian economic framework and political ethos emphasis ours no government will want to be without a single public sector bank in its portfolio panagariya and gupta are apostles of laissez faire so their advocacy for disinvestment of public sector banks hardly comes as a surprise if either of them were prime minister of india they would transfer all national assets to the private sector and shrink the government to skull and crossbones a lifeless symbol of warning to them not to cross limits however as far as their advocacy for bank disinvestment is concerned their argument stands on extremely infirm legs their first point is public sector banks are prone to fraud our question to them is will privatisation eliminate chances of fraud has there not been fraud in private banks arvind panagariya may please note we are not talking of the united states the capital of the empire of laissez faire where he teaches economics and where massive frauds took place in private financial institutions nearly 15 years ago frauds that destabilised the global financial system a destabilisation from which the world is yet to fully recover but of india do we not remember the fraud committed by rana kapoor the founder md and ceo of yes bank he was charged and jailed for advancing loans to a realty company and receiving a rs 400 crore worth property at a prime location in delhi from the company in his wife s name have we forgotten the fraud committed by chanda kochhar the ceo of icici bank she broke all rules to sanction rs 300 crore loan to videocon international electronics ltd promoted by venugopal dhoot who then transferred rs 64 crore to a company called nupower renewables pvt ltd owned by her husband deepak kochhar and this was not the only case of fraud against chanda kochhar the investigating agencies have discovered corrupt practices in sanction of several other loans during her tenure the second point panagariya and gupta make is that public sector banks have poor corporate governance do the cases of rana kapoor and chanda kochhar point to robust corporate governance in yes bank and icici bank they actually prove that as in public sector banks prudence diligence and efficiency can go missing in private banks if there is a nexus between the top management of the bank and wicked borrowers fortunately the scale of fraud in yes bank and icici bank was not so large as to push them into insolvency but in two recent cases of private banks the global trust bank and the laxmi vilas bank frauds were the norm leading to their collapse it is true that public sector banks had more npas non performing assets than private sector banks as in december 2017 gross npas as percentage of total advances in public sector banks stood at 13 5 while they were 3 8 in private sector banks the picture we get is that there are npas in both public and private banks only the scale is three times higher in public banks that calls for better governance and better risk management in public banks and better governance and better risk management can be brought about in public banks without privatising them the gross npas of public sector banks have already come down to 5 9 by march 2022 yet not just the apostles of laissez faire but also the modi government has been talking about privatising public sector banks while presenting the union budget for 2021 22 finance minister nirmala sitharaman announced the government s decision to privatise two public sector banks she did not name them she was expected to introduce a bill regarding that in the current monsoon session of parliament but she seems to have deferred it now prime minister modi s persona is identified with robust governance a governance that allows no corruption and efficiently delivers services if that is so why cannot his government improve the governance of the public sector banks how can it be that you run a behemoth of a government efficiently but you cannot run twelve banks efficiently after all good governance in banks means nothing but a set of practices that make it impossible for any corrupt or exuberant manager to oblige any unscrupulous borrower at the cost of the bank s finances it means merit based appointment of chairmen managing directors and chief executive officers it means market compliant salaries stock options and bonuses to attract the best brains for leadership it means appointment of directors who have integrity and specialist expertise and no political obligations it means honest audit it means that the quality management establishes strong credit risk assessment departments to evaluate the credit history of the promoter to demand adequate collateral security to detect any inflation of credit requirements with over invoicing to constantly monitor repayments to flag a default and to start recovery it also means that the government strengthens the surveillance and inspections through the rbi to track the graph of major loan accounts rs 100 crore and above in every bank as also to detect wicked promoters who draw credit from one bank to pay the loan of another bank the government has already set up an autonomous body the financial services institutions bureau earlier known as banks board bureau to appoint heads of public sector banks the industry body indian bank association is implementing several programmes for leadership development in public sector banks learning lessons from frauds the rbi has put in place severe internal controls in the banks and external controls by itself improvement in governance of public sector banks is happening the modi government has to facilitate and support it instead of selling them off arun sinha is an independent journalist and author
juana summers host a whole lot of people are scouring their budgets these days looking for anywhere they can squeeze out a few bucks aureli trujillo we ve canceled subscriptions such as amazon i think we also canceled hulu we re kind of on the fence on netflix right now violet olsick we stopped buying alcohol which isn t necessarily a bad thing but we started buying like the generic brand sodas you know small things like that robert hart we don t do a lot of driving and when we do drive we try to combine things for example if we have doctor s appointments we try to make sure that they get combined summers aureli trujillo ph violet olsick ph and robert hart ph like the rest of us they re dealing with 9 1 year over year inflation and it is not just regular americans making changes in the face of that historically high inflation so is the federal reserve this week it will again decide whether and how much to raise interest rates to try to bring inflation under control for a look at the stakes of that decision and everything roiling the economy in this moment we re joined by npr s chief economics correspondent scott horsley and npr business correspondent david gura hi there scott horsley byline good to be with you david gura byline hey juana summers inflation is raging right now and i have to imagine that most americans have never experienced anything like this in their lifetime before scott is it changing consumer behavior horsley we are starting to see people change their behavior a little bit and that s a change from what we were seeing earlier in the pandemic you know when the price of gas hit 5 a gallon last month people actually bought less gasoline and that s unusual ordinarily people will complain when the price of gas goes up but they typically pay whatever it cost to fill up their tank it s evident now there is a breaking point and it seems to be somewhere around 5 a gallon we re also seeing changes in what people spend at the supermarket you know early in the pandemic when people were having to eat all their meals at home some folks actually splurged and traded up to more expensive brands to replicate the restaurant experience they weren t having and now they re going in the opposite direction spending at the supermarket is still climbing but people are walking out with less food in their shopping carts in some cases they are trading down to generic store brands or shopping at cheaper outlets this isn t true throughout the economy though airline ticket prices are still climbing and yet people are buying more airline tickets spending at restaurants also continues to outpace restaurant prices but as the cost of things like food and energy and rent keeps climbing people are having to adjust their behavior summers another thing that a lot of people are feeling right now david is that their investment portfolios are just getting hammered is there a connection between inflation and all of those stock market crashes that we ve seen this year gura we have had so much volatility so you re picking on something i think a lot of people have noticed which is that markets have been really tumbling there have been days when

the country s income levels and theoretically spending have much room to grow another area of potential is china s plan to unify business standards and access within the country said dan wang shanghai based chief economist at hang seng bank china however it remains to be seen how china can effectively boost new growth drivers like consumption while controlling problems such as a potential fallout from the real estate industry beijing several economists expect that china will avoid a japan style stagnation if the right policies take effect china s gross domestic product barely grew in the second quarter while covid lockdowns stifled growth those restrictions have eased but covid controls remain an uncertain overhang while the country awaits a quarterly gathering of policymakers expected at the end of the month but even if covid restrictions ease china still has untapped growth potential for the next few years the economists said get southern california news weather forecasts and entertainment stories to your inbox sign up for nbc la newsletters for one the country s income levels and theoretically spending have much room to grow china s per capita gdp in 2021 was less than a fifth of that in the united states and adjusted net national income per capita was about one seventh of that in the united states according to world bank data given the room for catch up is still there china s still going to maintain 4 to 5 growth in the next five to 10 years said larry hu chief china economist at macquarie he said there are uncertainties that could affect his estimates including whether china can shift from relying on investment to consumption for growth another area of potential is china s plan to unify business standards and access within the country said dan wang shanghai based chief economist at hang seng bank china once those barriers can be lifted that can increase income by a great deal she noted how current practice can favor a company from a local city over one from another province a stark example of these regional biases played out this year when different covid rules among provinces created inefficiency she pointed out wang said overseas demand and increased investment in manufacturing in china could support growth in the coming years much of the country s official economic narrative has emphasized the unexpected impact of covid and the russia ukraine conflict while pointing out that inflationary pressures are far higher in countries like the united states when asked whether china would face japan style economic stagnation bank of china chief researcher zong liang dismissed the possibility he said china has among other things kept control of its currency while japan s yen has fluctuated too quickly zong also pointed to china s investment and self reliance in tech innovation as for economic growth in the near term he expects stimulus announced in may to take effect in the third or fourth quarter and some benefit from increased trade under new regional free trade agreements however zong said china does face similar challenges to japan when it comes to the housing market beijing has tried to clamp down on speculation in the market in the last few years but an underlying more difficult problem for real estate is the aging population a problem that deserves our attention zong said in mandarin according to a cnbc translation consumption problem others however are less optimistic china has an even more extreme version of the japanese imbalances making it harder to rely on consumption for growth said michael pettis a finance professor at peking university in an email japan s economy has stagnated generally growing more slowly than the u s and china since the 1990s following the burst of a bubble in stocks and real estate japan grew rapidly in the 1970s and 1980s thanks to high growth in exports and infrastructure investment but by the early 1990s the country was increasingly investing in wasteful projects said pettis he said japan has not been able to turn to its consumers to drive growth primarily because the manufacturing sector has not been able to accept the needed transition to higher wages china won t necessarily follow japan s path if china can make substantial changes to its political institutions pettis wrote in april but he said the more likely scenario is that china doesn t enter a financial crisis or sharp economic crisis and instead is more likely to face a very long japan style period of low growth if nonproductive investment primarily in infrastructure and property is reduced and not replaced with an equivalent source of growth pettis estimated china s gdp would grow by no more than 2 or 3 annually in coming years covid drag for this year many investment banks have slashed their china gdp forecasts to below 4 in light of the country s zero covid policy economists can t resolve this issue said xu hongcai deputy director of the economics policy commission at the china association of policy science that s according to a cnbc translation of his remarks in mandarin xu struck a pessimistic tone noting that monetary policy and fiscal policy may contribute little and that increasing their scale would only add to longer term problems troubles in china s massive real estate sector have also resurfaced this month with many homebuyers refusing to pay their mortgages until developers find the resources to finish constructing apartments more state support ultimately however china s economy may have to turn to its government for help after warning of the risks from excessive government support in his 2016 book china s guaranteed bubble author zhu ning said last month the best solution to unemployment and housing bubble problems is increased state support the situation in japan may actually be a reason to warrant some more planning economy approach said zhu professor of finance and deputy dean at the shanghai advanced institute of finance cannot think of a market based approach he said that just as japan built up its social safety net during a bubble period china should put more resources into ensuring three basic needs housing health care and education relieving chinese consumers of those costs could encourage them to spend zhu said

affecting both our performance and our cash generating potential we do not consider these measures to be a substitute for or superior to the information provided by gaap financial measures consistent with this approach we believe that disclosing non gaap financial measures to the readers of our financial statements provides useful supplemental data that while not a substitute for gaap financial measures can offer insight in the review of our financial and operational performance and enables investors to more fully understand trends in our current and future performance in assessing our business during the quarter ended june 30 2022 and prior periods presented we excluded items in the following general categories each of which are described below share based compensation expense we believe that providing non gaap measures excluding share based compensation expense in addition to the gaap measures allows for a more transparent comparison of our financial results from period to period we prepare and maintain our budgets and forecasts for future periods on a basis consistent with this non gaap financial measure further companies use a variety of types of equity awards as well as a variety of methodologies assumptions and estimates to determine share based compensation expense we believe that excluding share based compensation expense enhances our ability and the ability of investors to understand the impact of non cash share based compensation on our operating results and to compare our results against the results of other companies amortization of intangible assets we incur intangible asset amortization expense primarily in connection with our acquisitions of various businesses and technologies the amortization of purchased intangibles varies depending on the level of acquisition activity we exclude these various charges in budgeting planning and forecasting future periods and we believe that providing the non gaap measures excluding these various non cash charges as well as the gaap measures provides additional insight when comparing our gross profit operating expenses and financial results from period to period acquisition related costs and change in fair value of contingent consideration for business acquisition we incurred expenses and credits in connection with our acquisitions which we generally would not have otherwise incurred in the periods presented as a part of our continuing operations acquisition related costs include all incremental expenses incurred to effect a business combination fair value of contingent consideration is associated with our estimates of the value of earn outs in connection with certain acquisitions we believe that providing the non gaap measures excluding these costs and credits as well as the gaap measures assists our investors because such costs are not reflective of our ongoing operating results loss gain on investments we recognize losses gains related to our investments in various companies which vary depending on the operational and financial performance of the companies in which we invest these amounts include our losses earnings on equity method investments investment impairments and losses gains resulting from sales or other events related to our investments we believe that providing the non gaap measures excluding these items as well as the gaap measures assists our investors because such losses gains are not reflective of our ongoing operations non gaap income tax adjustment non gaap income tax adjustment primarily measures the income tax effect of non gaap adjustments excluded above and other events the determination of which is based upon the nature of the underlying items the mix of income and losses in jurisdictions and the relevant tax rates in which we operate each of the non gaap financial measures described above and used in this press release should not be considered in isolation from or as a substitute for a measure of financial performance prepared in accordance with gaap further investors are cautioned that there are inherent limitations associated with the use of each of these non gaap financial measures as an analytical tool in particular these non gaap financial measures are not based on a comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles and many of the adjustments to the gaap financial measures reflect the exclusion of items that are recurring and may be reflected in the company s financial results for the foreseeable future we compensate for these limitations by providing specific information in the reconciliation included in this press release regarding the gaap amounts excluded from the non gaap financial measures in addition as noted above we evaluate the non gaap financial measures together with the most directly comparable gaap financial information additional supplemental financial information constant currency in addition logitech presents percentage sales growth in constant currency to show performance unaffected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates percentage sales growth in constant currency is calculated by translating prior period sales in each local currency at the current period s
