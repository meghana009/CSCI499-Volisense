maurie backman the motley fool some people figure they ll manage just fine in retirement on social security alone those same people often get a rude awakening the reality is that social security will only replace about 40 of your pre retirement income if you re an average wage earner but most seniors need about twice that much money to live comfortably and that 40 figure doesn t account for social security cuts which are at this point very much on the table that s why it s so important to build savings ahead of retirement and if you have the option to participate in a 401 k plan you may want to jump on it 5 of americans save in a 401 k but is that the best retirement account for you the great thing about 401 k s is that they offer much higher annual contribution limits than iras plus many companies that sponsor 401 k s also offer matching incentives which means free money for your account that can lead to more retirement wealth but signing up for a 401 k won t do the trick in helping you attain financial security in retirement rather you ll need to fund that plan consistently and if you ve been doing so for many years you may be curious as to how your savings balance compares to that of the average american to that end vanguard has an answer and it might inspire you to ramp up your savings or pat yourself on the back for a job well done how does your 401 k balance stack up in 2021 the average 401 k balance for vanguard plan participants was 141 542 according to vanguard s 2022 how america saves report the median balance however was much lower at just 35 345 whenever you have a median that s well below an average it means more people have less than the average than more in this case that 35 345 may be more indicative of how much americans have saved in their 401 k s than the 141 542 average don t miss out on free money 3 reasons to contribute to your company s plan should you be happy with your retirement savings balance let s imagine your 401 k balance is comparable to that of the average american if you re in your 20s you re in fabulous shape but if you re in your 50s not so much the reality is that looking at a broad average in the context of 401 k s isn t necessarily going to help you all that much other than perhaps satisfy a point of curiosity instead of fixating on what the average american has saved think about your personal savings balance and whether it s on track to help you meet your goals as a general rule it s a good idea to close out your career with about 10 to 12 times your ending salary saved up so if you re in your 40s earning 100 000 a year you may want to aim for a 1 2 million nest egg or higher since your salary could conceivably grow a lot between now and when you wrap up your career if at this point you have less money socked away than what the average american has you may want to push yourself to save more not because your balance lags compared to the average but because it lags compared to where you need to be remember everyone s retirement needs are different and the pace at which different people save can differ as well so it s important to focus on your own needs and objectives it s also definitely worth noting that in 2021 401 k balances grew by 10 compared to 2020 but that doesn t necessarily mean workers started socking away a lot more money weatherproof stock here s what to buy as the market falls and inflation rises rather that substantial growth most likely came as a result of stock market gains this year as many of us are painfully aware stocks are down significantly so 401 k balances may at this point be down from where they were last year therefore a good bet for you may be to focus on your savings rate rather than your actual balance retirement plan balances can fluctuate based on market performance but if you want to retire with plenty of money do your part to keep ramping up your contributions especially as your earnings increase offer from the motley fool the 18 984 social security bonus most retirees completely overlook if you re like most americans you re a few years or more behind on your retirement savings but a handful of little known social security secrets could help ensure a boost in your retirement income for example one easy trick could pay you as much as 18 984 more each year once you learn how to maximize your social security benefits we think you could retire confidently with the peace of mind we re all after simply click here to discover how to learn more about these strategies the motley fool has a disclosure policy the motley fool is a usa today content partner offering financial news analysis and commentary designed to help people take control of their financial lives its content is produced independently of usa today

jetblue nasdaq jblu today issued the following statement regarding the revised frontier spirit nyse save merger agreement we continue to believe jetblue s proposal is decisively superior to the frontier transaction even considering its revised terms and it continues to offer spirit shareholders significantly more value more cash more certainty and more regulatory protections jetblue offers 33 50 per spirit share in cash a very significant 38 1 premium to the implied market value of the amended frontier transaction also importantly the incremental 2 00 per spirit share offered by frontier are effectively being paid by spirit shareholders through their ownership in the combined company therefore resulting in only approximately 1 of incremental economic value we will more thoroughly review and assess the revised terms of the frontier spirit merger agreement and we intend to continue our vote no campaign against the inferior frontier transaction at the special meeting since our initial proposal was made public on april 5 spirit s share price performance has reflected its shareholders overwhelmingly positive view of our offer and their confidence in our ability to achieve regulatory clearance of the transaction an outcome which remains supported by outside regulatory experts analysis the conflicted spirit board continues to rely on a series of mischaracterizations to justify an inferior deal about the regulatory situation that is at odds with the views of outside experts that our transaction can get done about the northeast alliance despite the overwhelming facts supporting its pro competitive nature and about the impact of the changing industry environment including competition for pilots adding to these misrepresentations the spirit board is now claiming they have served their shareholders by accepting a revised frontier proposal an act which does not change the fundamental superiority of our transaction agreeing among other things in exchange for underwhelming financial concessions to weaken spirit shareholders governance in the combined company through less board representation forward looking statements statements in

stocks racked up more gains on wall street friday as the s p 500 had its best day in two years and just its second week of increases in the last 12 to provide a bit of relief from the market s brutal sell off this year the benchmark index rose 3 1 per cent with technology and banks leading the broad rally the s p 500 notched a 6 4 per cent gain for the week erasing the brutal loss it took a week earlier though it s still close to 20 per cent below its record set early this year the dow jones industrial average rose 2 7 per cent and the tech heavy nasdaq ended 3 3 per cent higher both indexes also posted a weekly gain that more than made up for their losses last week stocks rallied this week as investors speculate the federal reserve may not have to be as aggressive about raising interest rates as earlier thought as it fights to control inflation the gains are a reprieve from wall street s tumble through most of the year caused by the fed s and other central banks slamming into reverse the monetary support put into markets through the pandemic in hopes of beating down punishingly high inflation central banks have raised interest rates and made other moves that hurt prices for investments and threaten to slow the economy enough to cause a recession many economists predict further moves it has been a good week said randy frederick managing director of trading and derivatives at charles schwab it s rare at least in 2022 we ve had only a couple of weeks where we ended up net positive it looks pretty similar to what we saw right around the end of may and that one of course fizzled out the s p 500 rose 116 01 points to 3 911 74 the dow climbed 823 32 points to 31 500 68 the nasdaq rose 375 43 points to 11 607 62 consumer sentiment at record low parts of the u s economy are still red hot particularly the jobs market but some discouraging signals have emerged recently a report on friday confirmed sentiment among consumers sank to its lowest point since the university of michigan began keeping records hurt in particular by high inflation another lowlight this week suggested the u s manufacturing and services sectors aren t as strong as economists thought such weakening data raise worries about the strength of the economy but they also can be good for financial markets as paradoxical as that may seem they could mean less consumer demand fuelling inflation which would ultimately mean the federal reserve doesn t have to raise rates so aggressively and interest rates drive trading for everything from stocks to cryptocurrencies we have seen a cooling off in a lot of areas certainly gasoline purchases are down housing prices appear to be cooling across the board frederick said to me all of this speaks to the fact what the fed is doing now appears to at least be having some impact now whether or not it s sufficient to bring inflation down i don t think we know yet
on friday june 24 a hasty one day virtual summit of the brazil russia india china south africa will occur hosted by xi jinping the date is important because on monday june 26 two of the three intrinsically pro western leaders from the bloc narendra modi from new delhi and cyril ramaphosa from pretoria travel in person to germany to be hosted at the g7 summit by olaf scholz xi announced the meeting at the end of may just after german chancellor olaf scholz visited pretoria the earlier ambition was to have a post covid in person brics brics the term brics an acronym for brazil russia india china and south africa was first used in 2001 by jim o neill then an economist at goldman sachs the strong economic growth of these countries combined with their important geopolitical position these 5 countries bring together almost half the world s population on 4 continents and almost a quarter of the world s gdp make the brics major players in international economic and financial activities summit which logically would have been in september that was the case in 2017 in xiamen the last time the brics met in china but in recent weeks a sense of panic must have arisen in beijing and perhaps moscow as the realisation dawned that two brics could well be wheeled and dealed by the g7 the two could thus continue spalling the construction industry terminology refers to a process spalling in which mainly due to the freezing thawing cycle a wall s masonry and bricks crack crumble flake and even pop out of the wall after all a sleazy deal with the west was struck in geneva on june 17 when imperialist powers at the world trade organisation wto world trade organisation the wto founded on 1st january 1995 replaced the general agreement on trade and tariffs gatt the main innovation is that the wto enjoys the status of an international organization its role is to ensure that no member states adopt any kind of protectionism whatsoever in order to accelerate the liberalization global trading and to facilitate the strategies of the multinationals it has an international court the dispute settlement body which judges any alleged violations of its founding text drawn up in marrakesh wrecked a vision expressed rhetorically by both modi and ramaphosa that waivers would be allowed on intellectual property for covid 19 medicines but the unity of imperialist states whose leaders have been captured by big pharma openly led by the british germans swiss and norwegian and behind the scenes supported by the u s french canadians and japanese mean the sub imperial indians and south africans could be brought back within the fold so on june 24 the brics line of march may be established after a period of drift division and decay within the group the third western wayward brics capital is brasilia thanks to brazil s highly unreliable trumpian president jair bolsonaro though he should be replaced by former president lula da silva 2003 10 if current polls hold firm until the october 2 election the stakes are highest for putin who on june 22 complained to the virtual brics business forum businessmen of our countries are forced to develop their business under difficult conditions where western partners neglect the basic principles of market economy free trade as well as the inviolability of private property note his complaint that imperialism has gone rogue which is also reflected in the way more than 300 billion of russian state assets kept in western banks were frozen if russia is doing weekly physical damage of 4 5 billion to ukraine those frozen funds would obviously be useful for reparations but then putin will have yet more weaponry to accuse the west of hypocrisy when applying sanctions and after all with soaring energy prices his oil and gas export revenues are at record highs as a result said putin russia is actively redirecting its trade flows and external economic contacts towards reliable international partners above all the brics countries and beyond trade there are monetary opportunities to de dollarise together with brics partners we are developing reliable alternative mechanisms for international settlements we are exploring the possibility of creating an international reserve currency based on the basket of brics currencies cynics would quickly point out that over the past eight years two other international financial initiatives the never used contingent reserve arrangement supposedly providing 100 billion in the five countries hard currency stocks as an alternative lender to the imf imf international monetary fund along with the world bank the imf was founded on the day the bretton woods agreements were signed its first mission was to support the new system of standard exchange rates when the bretton wood fixed rates system came to an end in 1971 the main function of the imf became that of being both policeman and fireman for global capital it acts as policeman when it enforces its structural adjustment policies and as fireman when it steps in to help out governments in risk of defaulting on debt repayments as for the world bank a weighted voting system operates depending on the amount paid as contribution by each member state 85 of the votes is required to modify the imf charter which means that the usa with 17 68 of the votes has a de facto veto on any change the institution is dominated by five countries the united states 16 74 japan 6 23 germany 5 81 france 4 29 and the uk 4 29 the other 183 member countries are divided into groups led by one country the most important one 6 57 of the votes is led by belgium the least important group of countries 1 55 of the votes is led by gabon and brings together african countries and a brics credit ratings agency were merely hot air the talk left walk right of brics role in global finance is seen not only in its vigorous financial support for the international monetary fund during the 2010s but more recently in the decision by the brics new development bank supposedly an alternative to the world bank world bank wb the world bank was founded as part of the new international monetary system set up at bretton woods in 1944 its capital is provided by member states contributions and loans on the international money markets it financed public and private projects in third world and east european countries it consists of several closely associated institutions among which 1 the international bank for reconstruction and development ibrd 189 members in 2017 which provides loans in productive sectors such as farming or energy 2 the international development association ida 159 members in 1997 which provides less advanced countries with long term loans 35 40 years at very low interest 1 3 the international finance corporation ifc which provides both loan and equity finance for business ventures in developing countries as third world debt gets worse the world bank along with the imf tends to adopt a macro economic perspective for instance it enforces adjustment policies that are intended to balance heavily indebted countries payments the world bank advises those countries that have to undergo the imf s therapy on such matters as how to reduce budget deficits round up savings enduce foreign investors to settle within their borders or free prices and exchange rates to declare a freeze on its russian portfolio in early march since otherwise it would not have retained its western credit rating of aa within that status however fitch soon downgraded the bank s prospects reporting the negative outlook on ndb s rating is primarily driven by the risk that in the context of the russia ukraine war the presence and role of russia as a large shareholder in ndb 19 of capital as of end 2021 leads to a downward revision in addition ndb s country exposure to russia 13 of loans as of end 2021 70 of which is to the sovereign poses downside risks to the bank s credit risk profile and solvency ironically putin succeeded in abiding by international financial rules aside from shifting contract terms for payment of russian exports of oil and gas which he insisted be made in rubles to raise the russian currency s value that aside while acting as a rogue sub imperialist when it came to the savage invasion of west leaning ukraine putin unlike his predecessor boris yeltsin has always been a loyal sub imperialist when respecting russia s foreign debt repayment obligations brics expansion and global implosion the brics have been spalling and indeed falling when compared with high expectations expressed for the bloc a decade ago if they attempt to reconstitute on june 24 or in subsequent weeks how might that take shape assume a revived coherent project of putin protection or a restated multipolarity is not possible given the inexcusability of russia blatant militarism when the brics have always postured about peaceful resolution of conflict there is an alternative to rebuilding the wall expansion given the chaos in the bloc a curious fluidity exists in ideological adherence such that beijing announced two potential new brics members centre left but imf occupied and protest rich argentina and saudi arabia led by the notorious mohammed bin salmon whose family has for decades been a close ally of washington thus giving us bricsasa and if joe biden s u turn on saudi arabia pulls mbs mbs mortgage backed securities see abs back to the west then waiting in the wings according to chinese officials are egypt indonesia kazakhstan united arab emirates uae nigeria senegal and thailand in 2021 the brics bank already approved new members uae bangladesh egypt and uruguay no matter how unlikely the combination so the discussion of expansion could result in an ideological and functional member mishmash beyond any logical comprehension last month at the brics foreign ministers meeting xi made the main opening speech and he didn t mention russia s invasion of ukraine with that sort of top down signalling plus no mention whatsoever of ukraine in a brics think tank conference in late april true to form the ministers offered this milquetoast statement on the main topic of immediate concern to the world the ministers recalled their national positions concerning the situation in ukraine as expressed at the appropriate fora namely the unsc and unga they supported talks between russia and ukraine they also discussed their concerns over the humanitarian situation in and around ukraine and expressed their support to efforts of the un secretary general un agencies and icrc to provide humanitarian aid in accordance with un general assembly resolution 46 182 as washington london berlin and other western regimes wave around more billions of dollars worth of sophisticated armaments headed for use to defend eastern ukraine from further russian annexation foreign minister sergey lavrov announced the situation has deteriorated to

nukes by either putin or wannabe muscular nato nato north atlantic treaty organization nato ensures us military protection for the europeans in case of aggression but above all it gives the usa

in 1949 in washington but became less prominent after the end of the cold war in 2002 it had 19 members belgium canada denmark france iceland italy luxembourg the netherlands norway portugal the uk the usa to which were added greece and turkey in 1952 the federal republic of germany in 1955 replaced by unified germany in 1990 spain in 1982 hungary poland and the czech republic in 1999 leaders one is boris johnson who still may desperately need to avoid eviction from 10 downing street in coming months by appearing tough on ukraine but another is biden who off the cuff last month in an asian summit press conference radically changed washington s long standing strategic ambiguity policy on one china so as to commit to a u s military defense of taiwan against beijing s ongoing threats though such rhetorical moves are often dismissed as gaffes but that s one of just two potential ways the west brics might well push the human race to extinction with the other being a climate holocaust given that putin s main cape town based exploration ship last november discovered what it claims are 500 billion barrels of oil and gas offshore antarctica so if the russians really do explore extract and combust those fossil fuels against new international treaty talks hosted and led by germany which we can anticipate putin will hold in low regard such a large carbon bomb would mean extinction for most life on planet earth within coming decades what better way to advance that agenda than russia bringing the other four bics into a new fossil energy alliance yet another of putin s desperation search for economic allies during this era of intense sanctions imperial germany visits sub imperial south africa but a different energy relationship is also in play at least in south africa as europe tries to seduce south africa german chancellor olaf scholz met president cyril ramaphosa in pretoria in late may mainly to lobby lobby lobbies a lobby is an entity organized to represent and defend the interests of a specific group by exerting pressure or influence on persons or institutions that hold power lobbying consists in conducting actions aimed at influencing directly or indirectly the drafting application or interpretation of legislative measures standards regulations and more generally any intervention or decision by the public authorities for a pro west stance on the russia ukraine conflict following brief stopovers in dakar senegal and abuja nigeria west africa possesses major fossil fuel deposits which scholz wants since he needs to halt methane gas imports from russia s nordstream pipeline as soon as possible berlin s vulnerability to moscow gyrations worsened dramatically once western sanctions started to bite scholz s predecessor angela merkel had profoundly misjudged putin encouraging more trade investment and finance hoping not only for gas supplies but a tighter russia european alliance it was a vain naïve fantasy given not only the easily triggered putin s expansionary ambitions backed by nuclear weapons but also his fury over a blatantly broken promise made to mikhail gorbachev and boris yeltsin in the early 1990s by her predecessor helmut kohl and u s leaders george h w bush and bill clinton that the north atlantic treaty organisation would not expand east of germany now due to berlin s increasingly urgent need for replacement gas sources industrial germany s fossil addiction will result in massive infrastructure capital costs to accommodate new demand this will in turn benefit mainly western oil companies operating in west africa especially france s total and uk dutch firm shell but it will leave the continent with stranded assets that could later in the 2020s result in carbon border adjustment mechanism climate sanctions as south africa especially faces from europe there is no major german oil firm but to illustrate pressures imposed on africa to expand self destructive fossil infrastructure frankfurt based hms bergbau last year bought a majority stake in botswana coal company maatla its ceo jacques badenhorst then lobbied transnet ceo portia derby to complete a major coal rail line extension to the botswana border originally the cost of rehabilitating the tracks was a whopping 50 billion when it was the first strategic integrated project priority of the presidential infrastructure coordinating commission picc in the 2012 national development plan transnet tried purchasing 1040 locomotives to pull the three kilometre long coal trains but the notorious gupta brothers corruption of the transport parastatal included ill advised vendor china south rail chosen by derby s predecessors siyabonga gama and brian molefe reversing the unjustified mark up costing tens of billions of rands is now derby says the most critical underestimation she made in arresting her firm s decline the picc 1 project appeared derailed not because climate change considerations prevailed but instead due to transnet s operational troubles and cable theft so rather than 80 million tonnes of coal exported from richards bay annually as projected the current level is below 60 million hms bergbau s interest interest an amount paid in remuneration of an investment or received by a lender interest is calculated on the amount of the capital invested or borrowed the duration of the operation and the rate that has been set remains for botswana to export its coal an estimated 220 billion tonnes five times south africa s reserves and a so called carbon bomb in the making including now to germany currently only a few thousand tonnes make their way weekly from botswana to the maputo port over a creaky 1400km route via zimbabwe instead of the more logical 850km to richards bay this is where scholz remains a pernicious ally for as he explained during the press briefing to ramaphosa himself formerly a coal tycoon the west s anti russian sanctions strenuously opposed by pretoria will prevent europe s import of putin s coal starting in september this will work because there are a lot of suppliers all over the globe that are willing and ready to sell their coal to those countries that have got them so far from russia and obviously there are some as south africa for instance where we will do so scholz and ramaphosa smiled gratefully to each other for the sake of future generations very survival and continental solidarity ramaphosa should now be closing south africa s coal mines and offering workers and communities just transition compensation after all germany is supposedly financing such a strategy via an 8 5 billion concessional below market loan to decarbonise eskom but as cynics point out eskom ceo andre de ruyter plans to use 44 of such funding for new infrastructure based on importing so called mozambican blood methane even though that would release ch4 emissions via leakage that over the next twenty years will be 85 times more potent a greenhouse gas than co2 from burning coal scholz s closest european colleague french president emmanuel macron visited ramaphosa a year ago to persuade him that total s methane gas processing plant in cabo delgado required thousands of south african and rwandan troops for protection against further islamic guerrilla attacks then the world s fourth largest methane gas field might soon supply the eskom grid but the climate justice charter movement now calls for a european reversal of the eskom deal and ngos groundwork and the south durban community environmental alliance are fighting de ruyter s proposed 3000mw richards bay methane gas power plant in the courts cynics also remind that on april 14 ramaphosa visited durban after flooding killed 500 people he sounded genuinely ready to u turn south africa s own fossil addiction this disaster is part of climate change it is telling us that climate change is serious it is here we no longer can postpone what we need to do and the measures we need to take to deal with climate change in effect though scholz is fighting that logic to win ramaphosa over he invited him to join the g7 annual summit at a former nazi linked castle in germany s bavarian alps on june 26 28 there scholz and johnson will continue refusing requests by ramaphosa and modi for a waiver of intellectual property on covid 19 vaccines and treatment the g7 will continue stalling on vitally necessary greenhouse gas emissions cuts the west s role in the war against ukraine will intensify leading to yet higher fossil fuel prices gifting big oil even higher profits the underlying imperial sub imperial tension this conjuncture especially in relation to brics tug of war between rogue and loyal sub imperialists reminds of brazilian dependencia analyst ruy mauro marini during the 1960s 1970s he described the antagonistic cooperation of brazilian elites in relation to the united states as a subimperial imperial division of labour brasilia was the region s deputy sheriff protecting both globalising and home based corporations for africa s leading political economist prior to his 2018 death samir amin marini s theory addresses a very real problem raised here that of inequality in peripheral development but as noted above the brics mortar is obviously crumbling e g in bizarre sino indian himalayan border battles since 2017 xi s 2015 speech at the brics summit in ufa russia included promises to boost the centripetal force of brics nations tap their respective advantages and potentials and carry out cooperation in innovation and production capacity but the centrifugal forces of the world economy took over as the spinning globe left the bloc ever less connected even the hallmark of brics economics rising intra brics and international trade as a share share a unit of ownership interest in a corporation or financial asset representing one part of the total capital stock its owner a shareholder is entitled to receive an equal distribution of any profits distributed a dividend and to attend shareholder meetings of gdp gdp gross domestic product gross domestic product is an aggregate measure of total production within a given territory equal to the sum of the gross values added the measure is notoriously incomplete for example it does not take into account any activity that does not enter into a commercial exchange the gdp takes into account both the production of goods and the production of services economic growth is defined as the variation of the gdp from one period to another suddenly reversed from the 2008 peak falling steadily before the 2020 crash recall too that indian and brazilian elections in 2014 won by rightwing hindu nationalist modi and 2018 by the far right trump of the tropics bolsonaro contributed to the spalling in 2019 the latter s foreign minister even suggested to his brics counterparts that they should engage in punitive sanctions against venezuela another reflection of the unseemly descent into political incoherence was also evident in brasilia in 2022 where just as russia began the ukraine invasion the country s vice president military leader hamilton mourão appealed for a counter invasion if the west simply lets ukraine fall moldova will be next then the baltic states just like hitler s germany did in the late 1930s bolsonaro scolded him because the week before during a moscow visit he expressed his government s solidarity with putin meanwhile in south africa the presidency of the classically populist talk left walk right jacob zuma ended in early 2018 he had repeatedly claimed pretoria s ascent to brics membership in 2010 was the reason the west arranged to have him replaced by his deputy president cyril ramaphosa even by poisoning he regularly claimed the switch a palace coup within the ruling party occurred five months before south africa hosted the brics leadership one sign of residual hopes there was the summit promise that a brics vaccine center would be set up in johannesburg possessing a high functioning pharmaceutical industry and extensive generic drugs production capacity as covid 19 hit no such facility had been established through china and russia were extremely quick to market their own vaccines but not willing to share intellectual property with brazil india or south africa or to join the wto lobby indeed if the brics were meant to genuinely challenge western domination of multilateralism how was it that during the 2010s everything they tried failed in 2011 2012 an even more neoliberal leader was imposed by the european union at the international monetary fund christine lagarde replacing dominique strauss kahn and at the world bank the united states replaced a notorious neocon robert zoellick with a jejune neolib jim yong kim in both cases without a unified brics posing alternative candidates in 2015 the imf s recapitalisation did indeed give the brics a much greater share of the vote just short of the 15 percent required to veto the institution s policies and loans a share held traditionally only by the united states but when china s imf voting share increased by 37 percent brazil s by 23 percent india s by 11 percent and russia s by eight percent this was not mainly at the west s expense those countries that lost vast shares included nigeria and venezuela 41 percent each and even south africa 21 percent were there not meant to be alternative institutions especially to challenge western domination of financial multilaterals and credit rating systems from the brics fortaleza meeting in 2014 the contingent reserve arrangement cra would have provided short term emergency funding but it turned out first that it gave the imf even more leverage leverage this is the ratio between funds borrowed for investment and the personal funds or equity that backs them up a company may have borrowed much more than its capitalized value in which case it is said to be highly leveraged the more highly a company is leveraged the higher the risk associated with lending to the company but higher also are the possible profits that it may realise as compared with its own value because only 30 of the borrower s cra quota could be accessed before getting an imf structural adjustment structural adjustment economic policies imposed by the imf in exchange of new loans or the rescheduling of old loans structural adjustments policies were enforced in the early 1980 to qualify countries for new loans or for debt rescheduling by the imf and the world bank the requested kind of adjustment aims at ensuring that the country can again service its external debt structural adjustment usually combines the following elements devaluation of the national currency in order to bring down the prices of exported goods and attract strong currencies rise in interest rates in order to attract international capital reduction of public expenditure streamlining of public services staff reduction of budgets devoted to education and the health sector etc massive privatisations reduction of public subsidies to some companies or products freezing of salaries to avoid inflation as a consequence of deflation these saps have not only substantially contributed to higher and higher levels of indebtedness in the affected countries they have simultaneously led to higher prices because of a high vat rate and of the free market prices and to a dramatic fall in the income of local populations as a consequence of rising unemployment and of the dismantling of public services among other factors imf package second in the hour of greatest need mid 2020 when south africa s leaders felt compelled to take a 4 3 billion imf loan in spite of hard wired austerity conditionality that reversed the fiscal stimulus there was no sign of the cra one brics institution did emerge with western credit rating agency rating agency rating agencies rating agencies or credit rating agencies evaluate creditworthiness this includes the creditworthiness of corporations nonprofit organizations and governments as well as securitized assets which are assets that are bundled together and sold to investors as security rating agencies assign a letter grade to each bond which represents an opinion as to the likelihood that the organization will be able to repay both the principal and interest as they become due ratings are made on a descending scale aaa is the highest then aa a bbb bb b etc a rating of bb or below is considered a junk bond because it is likely to default many factors go into the assignment of ratings including the profitability of the organization and its total indebtedness the three largest credit rating agencies are moody s standard poor s and fitch ratings ft moody s approval the ndb it was initiated to finance infrastructure with greater potential environmental sensibilities but never achieved the lofty goals of becoming a green bank set by two early consultants who had both been world bank chief economists joseph stiglitz and nicholas stern in its south african portfolio indeed there was not a single ndb loan in the period 2016 22 that could be considered free from corruption most importantly there was no ideological deviation from predatory neoliberal financial capitalism when brics delegations entered the bretton woods institutions as xi himself explained his own country s approach at the world economic forum in 2017 any attempt to cut off the flow of capital technologies products industries and people between economies and channel the waters in the ocean back into isolated lakes and creeks is simply not possible we must remain committed to developing global free trade and investment promote trade and investment liberalisation pushing the flow of capital back into the lakes and creeks the sub imperial brics extremely contradictory modes of antagonistic cooperation within global capitalism as witnessed in the run up to the 2022 explosion certainly do not excuse the impulses of the imperialist powers to establish nato military capacity on russia s immediate borders but the dynamics of such geopolitics do correlate to the uneven development of the global system as a whole an overarching problem for the likes of putin is his own capitalist class reaching limits to the accumulation of capital as typically happens in a semi peripheral economy based on export of raw materials suffering highly volatile prices marx s general theory of uneven development updated especially by city university of new york scholar david harvey accounts for geopolitical tensions during a devaluation devaluation a lowering of the exchange rate of one currency as regards others process in which excess capital exposed to global capital flows must either be defended or left to collapse due to uncompetitiveness in his book the limits to capital harvey explained under threat of devaluation each regional alliance seeks to use others as a means to alleviate its internal problems the struggle over devaluation takes a regional turn but the regional differentiations are rendered unstable thereby the core problem for leaders then is that regional alliances founder on the rock of international competition and the impulsion to equalise the rate of profit profit the positive gain yielded from a company s activity net profit is profit after tax distributable profit is the part of the net profit which can be distributed to the shareholders the semi periphery becomes the layer of the global power structure which first takes these problems on the chin again harvey described how not only would northern rust belt deindustrialisation suffer from recessions and broader downturns so too would emerging economies with more instability this was especially in the wake of 1990s era washington consensus liberalisations the opening up of global markets in both commodities commodities the goods exchanged on the commodities market traditionally raw materials such as metals and fuels and cereals and capital created openings for other states to insert themselves into the global economy first as absorbers but then as producers of surplus capitals russia s rise up the commodity super cycle from 2002 14 before the 2015 oil and minerals price crash reflected a shift from 1990s era capital flight by oligarchs to russia s hosting fully fledged overaccumulated capital it was at that point in the 2010s predicted harvey back in 2003 that such economies then became competitors on the world stage albeit in the form of what might be called subimperialisms each developing centre of capital accumulation sought out systematic spatio temporal fixes for its own surplus capital by defining territorial spheres of influence to deal with economic crisis at home it s logical then that putin seeks more active territorial expansion options the last time 2021 the imf published a review of the overaccumulation of russian capital which is termed the output gap reflecting excess capacity its economists were blunt assessing the amount of spare capacity in the economy is critical for economic policymaking particularly in a crisis where there is an urgent need for supportive macroeconomic policies spare capacity as measured by the gap between actual and potential output the output gap gives policymakers an indication of the extent to which fiscal policy can used to stimulate the economy the lockdown supply shock is estimated to have reduced potential gdp by nearly 2¾ in 2020 in 2021 potential real gdp rebounds as the lockdown is lifted but is weighed down the impact of the decline in investment during the crisis on the productive capital stock sensitivity analysis suggests the finding of a large and persistent output gap the results suggest that the negative output gap in 2020 is likely to be in the range of 2 3 percent and is likely to be as large if not larger in 2021 making it clear that such excess capacity and resulting devaluation in the ukraine is on his mind putin himself remarked on the kiev economy in his invasion announcement speech he included choice words about devalued capital especially since the 2014 coup sectors including machine building instrument engineering electronics ship and aircraft building have been undermined or destroyed altogether there was a time however when not only ukraine but the entire soviet union took pride in these companies in 2021 the black sea shipyard in nikolayev went out of business its first docks date back to catherine the great antonov the famous manufacturer has not made a single commercial aircraft since 2016 while yuzhmash a factory specialising in missile and space equipment is nearly bankrupt the kremenchug steel plant is in a similar situation this sad list goes on and on neither the brics nor the g7 offer an alternative to a system where driven by overaccumulation of capital mostly derived from china s extremely productive east coast factories territorial tensions to accept or reject such devaluation only worsen a wide variety of historical and political features are typically cited to explain why russia s trajectory of regional expansion represents a major threat but those won t be complete with contemplating the dynamics of uneven development especially because they aren t a matter just of putin s rogue sub imperial stance they are hard wired into the world system and the brics and other semi peripheral sites are just some of the more extreme cases
sign up for daily news updates from cleantechnica on email or follow us on google news a little over 10 years ago i wrote my first articles about tesla here on cleantechnica in particular i wrote about the coming tesla model s and then the beginning of model s deliveries on june 22 2012 i thought i d take the opportunity of this momentous birthday to take a look at what has changed in those 10 years first of all though let s go a little further back while my first tesla articles were about the model s already being sold out in november 2011 and model s prices coming out in december 2011 other cleantechnica writers covered tesla s early collaboration with toyota in may 2010 and july 2010 tesla provided the guts for the well loved toyota rav4 ev ironically more than a decade later we still lack a truly homegrown rav4 ev additionally in october 2011 charis michelsen wrote about the ingenious idea of packing the model s with small mass market panasonic batteries there are a few concepts here worth revisiting first of all there has always been tremendous interest in fun exciting innovative tesla vehicles there have also been critics all along that way claiming the opposite that there wasn t enough consumer demand for electric cars and tesla would go bankrupt as a result it s interesting to just reflect on that fact and all the claims we ve seen along the way while recognizing how much tesla production and sales have grown in that time secondly there s no doubt that tesla could have simply become an under the hood electric powertrain producer that supplied legacy oems in theory that could have been a decent business naturally it wouldn t have led to anything close to the scale and influence tesla reached 5 years ago let alone today also it would not have aligned with tesla s core mission accelerating the transition to electric transport and sustainable energy as much as possible it might have accelerated the transition somewhat making it easier and cheaper for legacy automakers to include hybrid and fully electric options but it would not have put pressure on automakers regulators or politicians to get truly serious about massively competitive compelling popular electric vehicles the ceos of legacy oems who didn t want to accelerate the transition who wanted to slow down the transition would have remained in the driver s seat and that would have been a disaster ironically it was the basically cynical compliance ev approach of toyota and daimler that helped tesla to survive and grow at that young age for some fun and a throwback to a different ev era see my 2019 article 50 ways to slow the electric vehicle revolution a complete idiot s guide which is an update to my 2016 article 22 ways to delay the electric car revolution one of the biggest things that has changed in the 10 years since the model s came out is that legacy automakers have gone from coming up with all kinds of reasons why evs are not the future and seeding so much concern about them among consumers to now actually trying to produce the best electric cars on the market i don t think there s an automaker today that doesn t realize the future of the auto industry is electric heck 21 of new vehicle sales in europe and 31 in china are now sales of plugin vehicles and full electrics have been quickly increasing their share of those pies in short we ve gone from almost no automakers wanting to build electric vehicles to everyone wanting to lead in electric vehicles naturally you aren t the leader if you haven t led the model s is still one of the premier electric cars on the market if not the premier ev technologically at least there s a lot more debate about this now also it s still packed with thousands of little batteries also incidentally the first model s to cross 1 million miles just recently achieved that milestone the batteries have reportedly held up phenomenally however the owner has gone through 7 electric motors and is on his 8th perhaps the most disappointing thing about that is the first motor lasted the longest by far 778 000 kilometers whereas the following 6 lasted only about 200 000 kilometers 124 000 miles each and tesla has indicated they don t seem to have any solution to lengthen the motor s lifespan right off the bat in 2012 there was a lesson many would have been wise to learn about then it s often not a great idea to bet against elon musk musk won a 1 million bet with auto journalist dan neil when the model s came to market because neil had been convinced the model s could be built within the technical specifications mr musk laid out before the end of 2012 and it wasn t even close the model s arrived in june musk donated 1 million to charity despite winning the bet thinking of the billions upon billions upon billions of dollars that have gone into shorting tesla stock over the years the early model s bet seems particularly relevant that s not to say musk doesn t get anything wrong there s a significant list of predictions musk has been wrong on as well however when it comes to betting against tesla vehicles tesla engineering and tesla business success i can t say i d ever advise that just in terms of tesla itself the biggest changes in the past decade have been the fact that tesla achieved its dream of producing a low ish cost mass market electric car the tesla model 3 and even a more mass market electric crossover suv the tesla model y honorable mentions would be tesla full self driving but we ll wait for that to really hit its robotaxi level target the introduction of the tesla semi and tesla cybertruck though again we need to wait for their market arrival and the massive scale and rapid growth of its factories and battery production though really those are just the other side of the coin from the model 3 and model y across the industry aside from the shift toward electric powertrains there s also been a mandatory shift to make cars more connected good over the air updates being the pinnacle of that there s great improvement in infotainment systems which tesla still leads in unless you count a couple of chinese automakers that are at more or less the same level some say better some not and there s a race toward full autonomous driving that is heating up i m sure there are plenty of other things that people can note but these are the changes that stand out to me from the past decade the final point i d put extra emphasis on is transportation emissions policy across the world in europe and china and more locations gradually policymakers have required that automakers get serious about reducing emissions there were concerted pushes from the largest automakers in the world for several years to pressure policymakers into weakening these policies rather than strengthening them tesla made it clear that electric cars could be extremely competitive exciting mass market any policymakers who weren t sure whether to accept the excuses of legacy automakers for why they couldn t transition quickly to electric cars and why consumers didn t want them had those concerns exploded by the popularity of tesla and especially its high volume tesla model 3 the company and its breakthrough product gave policymakers across the world the conviction that the auto industry could indeed do more that all started with the great design engineering production and popularity of the tesla model s ten years ago oh yeah and how about them hydrogen fuel cell cars have a tip for cleantechnica want to advertise want to suggest a guest for

bear market what bear market as equities stage a strong rally to end the week powell still talks tough but equities brush off rate worries bond markets see fresh buying as yields fall on recession probabilities rising equity markets rallied into the end of the week as positioning finally got the boost it needed from a reduction in bond yields this was enough to send equity markets higher and help the riskier side of the market receover more ground lost this year worries though can not be totally put to one side as the risk barometer for this generation bitcoin failed to participate and held onto the 20 000 for dear life the weekend has been a harsh environment for bitcoin previously so we will have to keep an eye on screens over the weekend why should we bother you ask well correlations since the start of the year bitcoin has been highly correlated to the main indices nasdaq and s p 500 spx see below bitcoin has begun to break away and move significantly lower so it remains to be seen if it is still a leading indicator for risk sentiment bitcoin blue versus s p 500 red and nasdaq green the situation remains pretty grim though despite market soothsayers trying to paint a positive picture on friday they were merely reacting to price action and crafting the narrative to fit the action we were told that the university of michigan sentiment reading contained some good news let s go throgh it then and see where it is source financialjuice com hmm it doesn t appear to be in there sentiment is worsening in fact this was the lowest reading in history it looks more and more likely a recession is imminent and consumers are reacting accordingly there is some element of contra indicator in sentiment readings as in the old adage buy when everyone is panicking but no one is panicking just yet they are merely gloomy people are still buying with spending about to drop and inflation still surging we have an incredibly poor environment for risk assets but we were told the reduction in inflation expectations within the michigan sentiment survey was the main reason for friday s rally to recap 1 year expectations moved lower from 5 4 to 5 3 wow excuse the sarcasm but come off it that is well within the margin of error in any survey and just to remind you the michigan survey has 600 respondents the rally was clearly due to light equity positioning and the likelihood of a recession doing the fed s job for it and bringing inflation back down this rally has all the classic hallmarks of a bear market rally ahead of the half year end earnings season then is set up to be ugly with a surging dollar energy and commodity prices hitting earnings as well as those old favorites supply chain issues inflation and sentiment like what we have just witnessed do not make for happy corporate earnings no way out of this one corporate earnings are going lower a lot lower ceo s and cfo s are growing increasingly gloomy and they are the ones that will be giving guidance during earnings conference calls as a reminder earnings estimates have been continually upgraded repeat upgraded by wall street analysts reality is due to hit home already energy stocks have turned with xle being down 25 from the early june highs another 20 lower and xle energy would be flat for the year the percentage is small compared to mega tech weighting in the s p but this could see panic selling as the only bellwether sector nears a nadir with oil prices close to dipping under 100 earlier this week oil stocks could have peaked xle chart daily this week s rally was due to the bond market finally calming down this year bond market volatility move index has moved excuse the pun from 60 to over 140 so it is still high but has retraced a bit this week the bond market is uncertain because the fed is uncertain and has changed tack several times this year the latest being the panic 75 basis point leak to the press move index daily s p 500 spy forecast we have now just about closed the gap on the weekly chart up to 389 but the rally can last a bit longer and can stretch up to 415 we doubt it will beak there but that is still 10 higher than current levels we also have the bullish divergence playing out from the rsi spy chart daily earnings week ahead nike nke will give some guidelines as to consumer demand which soared during the pandemic bed bath and beyond is a former meme stock if the retail army can rouse themselves and push it either way source benzinga pro economic releases
24 june 2022 according to data from global investment trading platform capital com 38 of trades placed by its clients so far this quarter are short which is 15 higher compared to the same period last year this may suggest that traders have been getting more bearish as the year goes on although of course as a total group most are still favouring the long side of the market given the size of market slides across all sorts of asset classes this year it is perhaps not surprising that more traders are choosing to short sell to perhaps position themselves to profit from further market weakness or even hedge other investments once again it is the nasdaq 100 that has proved to be the most popular market with traders this week volatility always attracts traders and we still continue to see sizeable swings in global stock indices only last week the nasdaq traded down to its lowest levels since november 2020 the last few days have seen something of a bounceback but at the moment opinion seems split as to whether this is a sustainable recovery or just another dead cat bounce before the market slides lower once more the area that has seen the largest jump in short trades is commodities this may suggest for some traders at least there is a level of comfort in trying to call the top in the great commodity bull run that has persisted for at least the last couple of years of course a fall in commodities would be welcome by many economies around the world as it would help to slow the rise of inflation after the nasdaq index the next two most traded markets on capital com over the past week have been in the energy grouping crude oil and natural gas during june west texas crude has travelled from above 120 a barrel back towards 101 although lacking any firm direction these sort of swings provide plenty of day to day volatility to attract shorter term traders natural gas has been more volatile again compared to crude oil with geopolitical developments an important driver for this market recently as europe tries to find alternatives to russia for its energy requirements this month us natural gas has dropped by 38 in under three weeks it remains to be seen whether we have seen an important top in this market for now or whether this is just another buying opportunity before the price races higher once more
the u s supreme court has overturned the roe v wade ruling that has secured constitutional protections for abortion in the u s for nearly 50 years while this decision does not affect saskatchewan s access to abortion services it has many worried about the stability of these rights in canada unfortunately the efforts to undermine roe v wade we know that those efforts don t always respect borders and that those efforts are transnational said heather hale executive director of saskatoon sexual health i think there really are some opportunities for us in canada to take steps to improve abortion access in canada the historic ruling a draft of which was leaked last month has the potential to claw back abortion access across the country by allowing individual states to restrict or outright ban the procedure angie kells executive director of saskatoon abortion support network a group of volunteers who assist people before during and after abortion says she does not believe canadians are at risk of having their right to abortion overturned but we certainly have ongoing issues with respect to accessing abortion she said barriers exist and governments are not moving to remove those barriers kells says one of those barriers is that not all saskatchewan doctors will prescribe the abortion pill known as mifegymiso in canada and not all pharmacies will stock or fill a prescription for it she also says access to surgical abortions in northern saskatchewan is needed right now these can only be accessed in regina and saskatoon hale says steps need to be taken against misinformation surrounding abortions there are also inconsistencies between saskatoon and regina concerning referrals and the period in which an individual can get a surgical abortion angie kells says she created the saskatoon abortion support network because people in saskatchewan were having trouble accessing the service submitted by angie kells are u s citizens coming north dakota is among the states that have trigger laws which will ban abortion within 30 days andra broussard executive director at the options pregnancy centre in regina says saskatchewan could see north dakota residents cross the border to get abortions i would say that it is definitely possible abortion is still something that women will be looking for so being that we re close i m sure women will come here to find it broussard said the centre provides counselling free pregnancy tests and information about abortion and adoption to women and girls who are pregnant or think they re pregnant i know that people will do their best to support women when they come and that s really all that we can do broussard said as an insured service saskatchewan funds hospital and physician costs related to abortion services for eligible beneficiaries saskatchewan would not normally provide non emergency services or surgeries for out of country patients saskatchewan ministry of health in an interview with cbc news network s power politics in may karina gould federal minister of families children and social development was asked whether american women would be allowed to get an abortion in canada i don t see why we would not she told host vassy kapelos if they people come here and need access certainly you know that s a service that would be provided however on friday the saskatchewan ministry of health had a different view as an insured service saskatchewan funds hospital and physician costs related to abortion services for eligible beneficiaries saskatchewan would not normally provide non emergency services or surgeries for out of country patients the ministry said in a statement tammi kromenaker owner and clinical director of red river women s clinic in fargo n d says while she expected the supreme court s decision she s still shocked red river is the only abortion provider in north dakota the clinic has been making plans and has secured a location in neighbouring moorhead minn for a new clinic so that it can still provide abortions for people in the fargo region kromenaker says she does not believe many north dakotans would travel to saskatchewan for abortions not everybody has a passport and you certainly couldn t get one in a timely manner she said it takes time and then you know to make the trip and get there i just don t think it s something that most north dakotans would consider however kromenaker says the clinic could use donations from saskatchewan residents there are a lot of steps that folks can take who want to support us with opportunities for people of all resource levels to pitch in so we need your help we re not used to asking for help but we need it help your north dakota neighbour u s states have come to saskatchewan for abortions before hale said this isn t a brand new thing but certainly will be an option folks will be looking at when assessing their options heather hale executive director of saskatoon sexual health says saskatchewan needs fewer barriers to abortion access submitted by heather hale frances stang president of the saskatchewan pro life association says the group would severely frown on americans crossing the border for abortion services our health care is publicly funded and as taxpayers i don t think that we should have to subsidize women that are from another country seeking abortions in canada because we don t believe that we as taxpayers should be actually funding any abortion learning from the u s nicole sarauer deputy leader of the saskatchewan ndp says the province can learn from what s happening in the u s right now what their decision to overturn roe v wade in the states shows us is that the fight for reproductive rights and access to abortion services is never over and we need to continue being as vigilant as possible in ensuring that these rights don t get rolled back in canada sarauer said on a person level sarauer says the court s decision concerns her it s really scary it worries me for my future for the future of my children when these rights in particular rights to bodily autonomy are reversed nicole sarauer deputy leader of the saskatchewan ndp called the u s supreme court s decision scary cbc when asked whether she expects to see an influx of americans seeking abortion services in saskatchewan she said she supports it but the province has its own problems of course if those from out of country wish to come here to get abortion services i have no issue with that at all she said but my main concern right now frankly is how limited access to abortion services already is for canadians especially those in saskatchewan we are seeing a government who slow walked approving the abortion pill and slow walked the ability for pharmacies to bill for that sort of service we re seeing a government who has shown no interest in increasing access to abortion clinics in saskatchewan sarauer is also critical of the provincial government s decision to shut down the saskatchewan transportation company stc which she said was vital for many who live in rural and remote communities to be able to access health care services such as abortion cbc news asked the provincial government to comment on what canadians can take from the roe v wade decision and whether an influx of americans seeking abortion services can be expected the province responded a us supreme court ruling has no legal impact on women s reproductive rights in canada saskatchewan will continue to follow the canada health act

author amitrajeet a batabyal menafn the conversation why are some nations rich and others poor can the governments of poor nations do something to ensure that their nations become rich these sorts of questions have long fascinated public officials and economists at least since adam smith the prominent scottish economist whose famous 1776 book was titled an inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations economic growth matters to a country because it can raise living standards and provide fiscal stability to its people but getting the recipe consistently right has eluded both nations and economists for hundreds of years as an economist who studies regional national and international economics i believe that understanding an economic term called total factor productivity can provide insight into how nations become wealthy growth theory it is important to understand what helps a country grow its wealth in 1956 massachusetts institute of technology economist robert solow wrote a paper analyzing how labor otherwise known as workers and capital otherwise known as physical items such as tools machinery and equipment can be combined to produce goods and services that ultimately determine people s standard of living solow later went on to win a nobel prize for his work one way to increase a nation s overall quantity of goods or services is to increase labor capital or both but that doesn t continue growth indefinitely at some point adding more labor only means that the goods and services these workers produce is divided between more workers hence the output per worker which is one way of looking at a nation s wealth will tend to go down similarly adding more capital such as machinery or other equipment endlessly is also unhelpful because those physical items tend to wear out or depreciate a company would need frequent financial investment to counteract the negative effect of this wear and tear in a later paper in 1957 solow used u s data to show that ingredients in addition to labor and capital were needed to make a nation wealthier he found that only 12 5 of the observed increase in american output per worker the quantity of what each worker produced from 1909 to 1949 could be attributed to workers becoming more productive during this time period this implies that 87 5 of the observed increase in output per worker was explained by something else total factor productivity solow called this something else technical change and today it is best known as total factor productivity total factor productivity is the portion of goods and services produced that is not explained by the capital and labor used in production for example it could be technological advancements that make it easier to produce goods another way to understand total factor productivity it s best to think of total factor productivity as a recipe that shows how to combine capital and labor to obtain output specifically growing it is akin to creating a cookie recipe to ensure that the largest number of cookies that also taste great are produced sometimes this recipe gets better over time because for example the cookies can bake faster in a new type of oven or workers become more knowledgeable about how to mix ingredients more efficiently will total factor productivity continue to grow in the future given how important total factor productivity is to economic growth asking about the future of economic growth is basically the same as asking whether total factor productivity will continue to grow whether the recipes will always get better over time solow assumed that tfp would grow exponentially over time a dynamic explained by the economist paul romer who also won a nobel prize for his research in this field romer argued in a prominent 1986 paper that investments in research and development that result in the creation of new knowledge can be a key driver of economic growth this means that each earlier bit of knowledge makes the next bit of knowledge more useful put differently knowledge has a spillover effect that creates more knowledge as it spills out despite romer s efforts to provide a basis for the assumed exponential growth of tfp research shows that productivity growth in the world s advanced economies has been declining since the late 1990s and is now at historically low levels there are concerns that the covid 19 crisis may exacerbate this negative trend and further reduce total factor productivity growth recent research shows that if tfp growth falls then this can negatively affect living standards in the u s and in other rich countries a very recent paper by the economist thomas philippon analyzes a large amount of data for 23 countries over 129 years finding that tfp does not actually grow exponentially as solow and romer had thought instead it grows in a linear and slower progression philippon s analysis suggests that new ideas and new recipes do add to the existing stock of knowledge but they don t have the multiplier effect previous scholars had thought ultimately this finding means that economic growth used to be quite fast and is now slowing down but it s still occurring the u s and other nations can expect to get wealthier over time but just not as quickly as economists once expected

britton s d record high prices for unleaded gasoline are getting much of the attention from the public and politicians across the country right now but an even bigger financial impact is being felt by truckers and farmers in south dakota who are paying far more at the pump than usual for diesel fuel employees and business owners in both industries rely heavily on diesel fuel to do their jobs and the high prices are pinching their incomes and profits industry experts say that higher fuel prices in trucking and farming are often passed on to consumers who are already paying more for a wide range of goods and foods at a time when inflation is pushing up prices as diesel prices continue to shoot up both trucking industry associations are calling for national legislation to help reduce the financial toll on truckers and farmers are looking for ways to keep costs down and minimize their financial risk operators in both industries are seeking ways to reduce spending on fuel and to cut back on fuel use when possible as of june 21 the average diesel price in south dakota was 5 39 per gallon below the national average but up almost 42 compared to a year ago according to the american automobile association the highest recent national average price was 5 81 on on june 19 a mid june report from the u s energy information administration showed on highway diesel prices ranging from a low of 5 37 in the gulf coast region to a high of 6 88 in california the midwest average price was in the middle at 5 63 advertisement high costs for diesel fuel are also adding to growing financial uncertainty for south dakota farmers who already faced delayed planting from storm damage in some portions of the state and drought conditions elsewhere that continue to threaten crops and livestock off road diesel which is not taxed and is used for agricultural and industrial purposes has also topped 5 a gallon meaning farmers are paying more than ever to run tractors combines and sprayers and to transport equipment or goods i ve been farming for about 36 years and i don t remember fuel ever being this expensive said scott vanderwal president of the south dakota farm bureau a truck makes its way south on highway 37 between mitchell and ethan in this file photo mitchell republic file photo tough financial road for truckers the average 18 wheel tractor trailer s fuel tank holds between 120 and 150 gallons and some rigs have two tanks with today s inflated prices truck drivers are paying about 700 to 900 per tank to fill up from empty forcing some to spend almost 2 000 for one day of driving corey stabnow a 23 year veteran of the trucking industry and owner of thunderfoot xpress in britton drove in mid june to california to pick up a load of honeybees to transport to north dakota this trip i m running right now will probably be close to 6 000 in fuel a year ago i could do this route for a little over said stabnow stabnow started his business in 2011 and recalled that diesel prices then were in the upper 3 per gallon range a fraction of the current prices at the pumps this is the highest i ve ever seen in the industry he said advertisement stabnow said he tries to combat the higher costs by finding the lowest prices along his routes beforehand and he tries to avoid fueling up in where he knows costs are high he said he s trying to avoid the pumps in california where diesel is currently averaging 6 99 per gallon according to the american automobile association with more money being spent on shipping and delivery and inflation sitting at 8 6 as of may some of the higher transportation costs may be transferred to consumers the american trucking association said in a june 2 blog post according to the ata inflation and costs will continue to rise unless the price of diesel fuel falls fuel surcharges added to delivery costs aim to help cover unforeseen price increases though many truckers don t receive payment until 30 days or more after delivery leaving them to cover costs with reserve funds or operate on lines of credit additionally these charges often don t fully cover the increases only around 60 to 70 of the increase the increased costs have the potential to be devastating to small trucking companies the american trucking association reported that 97 of trucking companies run 20 or fewer trucks and many in south dakota are locally owned and operated logan schaunaman is one of these owner operators he began his business schaunaman trucking out of sisseton in november 2021 as a solo operator fuel prices have gone up around 1 50 since he started leaving him with at least a 1 000 bill each time he fills up lately he s had to fill up twice a week for the loads he carries without diesel i can t move said schaunaman rates have gone up too so it compensates for higher fuel prices too drivers at larger firms are somewhat protected from higher fuel costs schaunaman said owner operators are probably a little more difficult to keep running at this time whereas bigger companies probably have contracted fuel so they contract fuel at a price that isn t going to move where owner operators have to fluctuate with the prices going up and down he said during the harvest of 2020 it cost vanderwal about 585 to fill the tank of his diesel combine at his farm in volga eight miles west of brookings at the current price of diesel it would cost him nearly double that amount this year more than 1 000 and the tank lasts about one day advertisement a farmer sprays his corn crop on the outskirts of lennox just southwest of sioux falls on june 20 rising diesel fuel prices have added to a series of challenges for south dakota farmers this spring stu whitney south dakota news watch farmers strategize to keep fuel costs down jack davis a south dakota state university extension agent who specializes in crop business management said corn farmers spent about 26 an acre in fuel to plant and harvest crops in 2021 and the record going back to 2008 was 35 an acre in 2012 under current market conditions farmers could pay more than 50 an acre for diesel for a thousand acre farm that s about 25 000 more a year if it stays this high said davis fertilizer is also more expensive under inflationary conditions with less oil being imported and refined since russia s invasion of ukraine in february high costs and supply concerns are felt by other industries but agriculture has less market flexibility to mitigate the damage according to vanderwal we re price takers said the third generation family farmer who raises soybeans and does custom cattle feeding we don t have the ability to pass on our costs when the price for diesel and fertilizer go up we just have to absorb that and hope that the crop markets are high enough to make up for it one silver lining for farmers is that commodity prices are soaring with corn selling at 7 85 a bushel on june 20 up from 6 15 on the same date last year soybeans remain strong at 17 02 a bushel the highest price since 2012 for walt bones a former state secretary of agriculture who runs a diversified crop and livestock operation in parker just southwest of sioux falls seeing a vibrant market on the back end means less gloom and doom even with an operation that uses more than a thousand gallons of diesel a day during spring planting and fall harvest i ve always said that in ag our margin is pretty fixed said bones this year s recipient of the governor s ag ambassador award some years we might handle a lot more money to make the same amount of money this year it appears that even with all the costs and inflation out there some of that can be transferred to what we re getting paid for our stuff advertisement taking advantage of the market means forecasting what commodities will be worth at harvest time and in some cases locking in prices in advance the problem is that as input costs such as fuel prices shift even the best planning becomes speculative there are external things you can t predict said heather gessner an extension field specialist at sdsu when is ukraine going back into the world market and exporting all the things they used to export if i knew i would pull out my crystal ball and share it with everybody the best farmers and ranchers can do is figure out their break even price and use marketing tools that are available to manage their risk bones a fourth generation producer points to the negative aspects of market volatility such as a sinking stock market but also notes that farmers can use price trends and cycles to their advantage there are opportunities to potentially lock in a higher price for what they sell and lower for what we use for inputs bones said volatility does present people with opportunities if you know your costs and play it to your advantage there s an old saying you never go broke making a profit three grain bins near parkston suffered heavy damage from high winds from a severe thunderstorm that moved through the area on may 12 2022 adam thury mitchell republic for many farmers though the challenges of this spring go beyond market numbers radical weather swings made normal operations a problem including a derecho that struck eastern south dakota on may 12 with winds that exceeded 100 mph on vanderwal s property in volga the roof flew off the bale barn and one of the damaged trees fell on a house sporadic rain showers also caused delays with spring planting and partially flooded crops were an issue in the northeast part of the state it s been a rough spring said vanderwal we finished planting corn just before memorial day and beans seven or eight days later we usually like to be done with everything between the 15th and 20th of may scott vanderwal vanderwal who also serves as vice president of the american farm bureau federation blames policy stances from president joe biden s administration as partly to blame for rising fuel costs he d like to see less restrictions and more impetus for american oil and gas companies to activate their permits to perform onshore drilling it s not a good thing to rely on other countries for energy supplies especially countries that might turn out to be your enemies said vanderwal it would be nice if the administration would reach out to energy producers and let them do what they do best advertisement biden sent a june 15 letter to u s oil refining companies asking them to increase production saying that historically high refinery profit margins being passed directly onto american families are not acceptable still most forecasts call for gas prices to keep rising this summer in late june biden also asked congress to suspend imposition of federal taxes on gasoline and diesel fuel until september to lower fuel costs for drivers the president s push for renewable energy to phase out fossil fuels makes it difficult to persuade oil and gas producers to ramp up production said bones while ethanol and biodiesel are positive steps a shift to electric vehicles seems a long way off from the perspective of corn farmers or cattle producers in the upper midwest he added when you have a big job to do whether it s harvesting or planting or transportation it helps to run on gas said bones it seems that electric vehicles have a place but i don t think it s out here in flyover country this article was produced by south dakota

right understand one thing no they re just gonna have to that s the top shelf you see is the myth of kristen that s the first medication in medication abortion that is one pill that is swallowed and it is progesterone hormone receptor blocker because i bet you do did you say and then you need second medicine crystal that is he prostaglandin that helps the cervix open little bit and it helps the uterus which is muscle contract to push the pregnancy out anything we did okay since democrat joe biden became president the food and drug administration has removed major obstacle for women seeking abortion pills eliminating longstanding requirement that they pick up the medication in person mail delivery is also now allowed nationwide however republican lawmakers in states such as south dakota texas kentucky arkansas ohio tennessee and oklahoma have moved to restrict access to abortion pills in recent months total of 19 states require medical clinician to be physically present when abortion pills are given to patient yes ma am as long as you re 11 weeks unless the choice of whether you do the procedure or the appeal okay yes ma am thank you they also want to elect presidential candidate who would work to reverse the fda decision that brought an access to the pills advertisement is taking plan b the same as getting an abortion doctors weigh in share copy link copy related video above a legal battle over medical abortions could be the nextthe supreme court voted friday to overturn roe v wade the 1973 court case that made abortion legal across the country now with abortion likely to be banned in many states people are wondering if that means that access to birth control iuds and emergency contraception will also be affected in 2021 a study showed that 24 of women ages 22 to 49 years old had used emergency contraception in their lifetime per the centers for disease control and prevention rumors have swirled that one form of emergency contraception called plan b is next on the chopping block but that hasn t happened yet so what exactly does plan b do again and is it the same thing as the abortion pill spoiler it s not obstetrician gynecologists dr jennifer lincoln md and dr jessica shepherd md are explaining plan b and how it s different from the abortion pill what is plan b plan b one step frequently referred to as the morning after pill is a type of emergency contraceptive that you can purchase over the counter at a pharmacy for around 50 it s one pill taken orally that contains 1 5 milligrams of levonorgestrel a synthetic form of the hormone progesterone according to the fda the purpose of plan b is to stop you from getting pregnant after having unprotected sex or after you think your contraception has failed it prevents pregnancy by delaying ovulation it can also prevent a fertilized egg from implanting in the uterus but experts warn that it shouldn t be your main way of preventing pregnancy emergency contraception should not be used as a regular method of birth control shepherd said and for future reference plan b can be safely used again after another instance of unprotected sex or birth control failure is plan b the same thing as an abortion no plan b is not abortion taking plan b prevents pregnancy by delaying ovulation and if fertilization does occur plan b may prevent a fertilized egg from attaching to the uterus per the fda however if a fertilized egg is implanted prior to taking plan b the drug will not work and pregnancy proceeds normally the cdc defines abortion as the termination of an established pregnancy what is the abortion pill and how does it work if you opt for a medication abortion you ll actually take two different pills mifepristone and misoprostol on day one you ll take mifepristone per planned parenthood mifepristone blocks the body s progesterone a hormone that is needed to continue a pregnancy in its early stages it causes the pregnancy to stop progressing shepherd said on day two or three you will usually take four misoprostol pills this medication softens the cervix and causes the uterus to contract shepherd explained this will expel the embryo from the uterus why do people confuse plan b and the abortion pill lincoln said that one of the main reasons why people think that plan b is the same thing as abortion is because the packaging states it could prevent the implantation of an embryo however this is a hypothetical that has never been proven she said plus some people believe that pregnancy begins at fertilization not at implantation she adds but organizations such as the national institutes of health trusted source and the american college of obstetricians and gynecologists say that pregnancy occurs only after a fertilized egg is implanted in the uterus according to healthline implantation at the beginning of pregnancy happens about a week after fertilization shepherd said the blastocyst a tiny group of cells that will later become the fetus embeds itself into the wall of the uterus and that s when experts say you re technically pregnant is plan b going to be illegal as of right now no states have banned plan b or made it illegal however there have been talks among lawmakers who are considering putting stricter measures in place it all comes down to how the law is interpreted and whether or not it can be expanded to include the pill or other forms of emergency contraception thirteen states currently have trigger bans that can go into effect now that roe is overturned but these bans do not include emergency contraceptives or in vitro fertilization ivf brent crane the house state affairs committee chairman has said that he would hold a hearing about banning emergency contraception due to reports of complications causing health concerns for the mom according to the idaho statesman meanwhile justice clarence thomas recently hinted that a woman s right to birth control protected under griswold v connecticut could be under threat next in future cases we should reconsider all of this court s substantive due process precedents including griswold lawrence and obergefell he wrote when should i take plan b plan b should be taken by 3 days or 72 hours of unprotected sex lincoln said but it works better the sooner you take it how long is plan b s shelf life plan b has a shelf life of about four years if it s stored properly per plan b one step regardless it s always good practice to check the box for the expiration date before purchase what if i can t find plan b if you can t get your hands on a plan b consider other options that could buy you more time and might be even more effective ella another form of emergency contraception is especially helpful for women with a higher bmi ella is effective for people with a bmi of up to 35 instead of plan b s 26 according to healthline but it requires a prescription so it might not be the best option if you re running short on time ella is better in that you have up to 5 days or 120 hours after unprotected sex to take it lincoln said ella may prevent pregnancy even before ovulation begins shepherd added shepherd pointed out that you can also get a copper iud inserted into your uterus as a form of emergency contraception here are some additional stats plan b 87 5 effective per plan b s website ella 97 9 to 99 1 effective per ella s website copper iud 99 effective per cleveland clinic what are the side effects of plan b compared to the abortion pill some common but temporary side effects of taking plan b include nausea dizziness fatigue headaches breast tenderness bleeding between periods or heavier menstrual bleeding and lower abdominal pain or cramps according to mayo clinic but if you vomit within two hours after taking plan b consult with your doctor to see if you should take another dose the side effects are slightly different from the abortion pill you can expect bleeding and cramping which is normal to expel the pregnancy lincoln said you might also experience nausea chills and fever for a short period according to planned parenthood does emergency contraception affect future fertility emergency contraception does not impact your chances of getting pregnant in the future there is no risk to future fertility when using birth control long term or using ecp and data has substantiated this now repeatedly shepherd said there is also no evidence that taking emergency contraception raises your risk of breast cancer where can i buy plan b plan b can be purchased over the counter at drugstores or pharmacies to purchase ella you ll have to ask your doctor for a prescription still lincoln notes that both ella and plan b can be sent to you from mail order birth control companies it s best to have them on hand before you need them so there are no barriers to you taking them asap she said should i stockpile plan b now that roe v wade has been overturned many women wonder if they should be buying plan b in bulk just in case they need it in the future it s unnecessary to stock up in bulk like people did with toilet paper back in 2020 this will lead to lack of access when people need it most lincoln said instead get yourself one or two so you have them if you or a friend needs them but don t go overboard

in reality it is not about solving the problem of war but about eliminating the problem of putin russians understand war from a clausewitzian perspective war is the continuation of politics by other means so by setting the objectives the west can now claim putin did not achieve them if the goal is to totally destroy ukraine then you have to do exactly what the west is doing now this interview comes to us through the kind courtesy of the swiss journal zeitgeschehen im fokus in it jacques baud brings us up to date on the ukraine situation while providing us with great insights in his usual inimitable way he is in conversation with thomas kaiser thomas kaiser zeitgeschehen im fokus tk you cannot recognize switzerland in a certain sense everything that was of importance to the state is being thrown away almost hand over fist what s your view jacques baud jb we are indeed in a state of hysteria and it is unbelievable how people forget the fundamental principles of the rule of law this is a fundamental problem you forget your own foundations your own identity regardless of who is fighting each other it is not our fight and it is an advantage not to be involved in the fight because that creates the opportunity to develop better solutions and help defuse the problem tk a neutral state could make a positive contribution here jb yes but that is exactly what switzerland is not doing this prevents switzerland from finding a balanced objective and impartial solution this is a key point nota bene for the international community as a whole not only for switzerland the difference is only that switzerland should be neutral tk how is that relevant jb this neutrality could be exploited not to take sides but to help solve the problem regardless of who is guilty or innocent these are different things it s like an arbitrator it doesn t matter what the referee thinks about a participant whether he finds him sympathetic or not he must keep the same distance from both participants switzerland should be in this situation but it does take advantage of it i don t mean financially of course but intellectually legally and morally the problem is that switzerland forgets that it is not a warring party in this conflict tk if you listen to the swiss government or even to the narrative of some lawmakers this neutral stance is completely blurred even if they claim the opposite is repeatedly jb it is also interesting thatwhat i think about putin has nothing to do with the assessment of the situation that is the business of the ukrainians i have said this several times if i were ukrainian i probably would have taken up arms but that is not the point i as swiss will not give up my swissness in order to help ukraine i don t have to become a ukrainian but i have to look at the big picture i have as swiss to bring a less passionate but more constructive point of view tk where then might switzerland s role in this conflict lie jb we are in the situation of this onlooker but our response is to give weapons so that ukraine fights for a ukrainian it is legitimate to want to fight but for a swiss or another european our role is to try to limit the damage when zelensky was looking for a mediator he turned to turkey china and israel he did not choose a european union country or even switzerland he understood that switzerland is no longer an independent partner tk isn t that the result of current swiss foreign policy jb yes it shows the nature of the problem we have to make a difference between what we think about putin and what we want to achieve politically these are two different things in addition i always ask myself if are we so keen to blame the aggressor tk yes this question really does arise jb paradoxically everything we give to ukraine today only highlights the help and compassion we have not given to those who have been unjustly attacked by the west in the middle east and elsewhere this will have consequences in the future many have noticed this with the refugees the blond blue eyed refugees are gladly helped the others are not maybe we can understand this even if we cannot approve of it tk is this not the well known double standard jb yes it is it also doesn t mean that you have to be in favor of russia that has nothing to do with it if you look at justitia she is blind and holds a scale in her hand that is exactly what is missing today western countries are partial and biased the same applies to the european union these principles were established by montesquieu voltaire and rousseau in the 18th century our woke culture has forgotten them we let our feelings guide us and we follow them that is the problem tk does that mean that the principles of the rule of law have disappeared jb the rule of law means that decisions are not based on feelings or intuitions but on the basis of facts that is why modern states have intelligence services this is about supporting decision making based on facts and not on the basis of divine inspiration this is a fundamental difference between enlightened governance and despotic obscurantism fighting a dictatorship does not entitle us to forget the principles of the rule of law since the balkan war the west seems to believe that the end justifies the means it is irrelevant what individual ministers think as persons they are allowed to hate putin that is their right as citizens feelings cannot be the basis of their policy here i would like to refer to henry kissinger he said in 2014 that s what henry kissinger said not putin or lukashenko it behaves like a monarch like louis xiv who was guided by a divine inspiration tk so the swiss government s decision making is more based on emotions than on reason jb it is not the only one unfortunately this management by twitter that has the upper hand in the entire western world at the moment is absolutely inappropriate obviously things don t get better as a result we close the doors we do not communicate anymore diplomacy has stalled tk reacting before you know the details is common practice jb yes after the missile attack on civilians at the kramatorsk train station on april 8 the swiss minister of foreign affairs summoned the russian ambassador at that time however only few details of the attack were known nevertheless the russians were accused today factual evidence such as the serial number of the missile the direction of the launch the type of missile and the strategy tend to indicate a ukrainian responsibility the fact that the political leadership is unable to take distance to the events is extremely disturbing tk without distance it is probably extremely difficult to judge a situation adequately jb but if you want to condemn something first you need an international and impartial commission of inquiry to find out what happened what we are doing tends to exclude any possibility of dialogue and that prevents the formulation of a crisis management strategy tk so the citizen and the state cannot have the same approach jb the citizen can believe what he wants what the ordinary citizen thinks is completely up to him he can mean what he wants about putin about russia he can hate people if he wants to but a state and state media cannot afford that tk why not jb ukraine s interest is to protect its citizens from an aggression switzerland s interest should not be to support a war but to support achieving a peaceful solution switzerland s role should not be to blame or condemn today switzerland decided the second largest number of sanctions against russia but it didn t apply any sanction against the us the uk or israel it has been known for a long time that ukrainian militias commit war crimes and crimes against humanity switzerland has not condemned them currently many ukrainian war crimes are beginning to be denounced by western witnesses and humanitarian workers like the revelation of natalia usmanova censored by reuters and der spiegel which tells that it was ukrainian militias and not russians who prevented civilians from escaping through humanitarian corridors tk this means that the west is promoting crises jb yes in 2014 a similar mechanism was observed western experts and media downplayed the ukrainians resistance to regime change it had to be shown that the maidan revolution was democratic so they built the myth of a ukrainian army that was victorious against the rebels after the defeat of the government in donetsk the excuse of a russian intervention had to be invented to justify western propaganda this is how the first minsk agreements came about september 2014 immediately after kiev broke the signed agreement to launch the anti terrorist operation ato this led to a second defeat at debaltsevo and the second minsk agreement february 2015 once again the ukrainian defeat was attributed to russian intervention therefore western experts continue to claim that these agreements were signed between ukraine and russia which is not true the minsk agreement was signed between kiev and representatives of the self proclaimed republics of lugansk and donetsk tk what is the current assessment of the war situation jb today we can see that russia on the other hand is waging a war on the battlefield as a result who will win we don t know but what has been observed in mariupol and the donbas since mid april tends to suggest that ukrainian troops have been abandoned by their leadership this observation is also made by western volunteers who have left the battlefield due to the shortcomings of the ukrainian command and are reporting this in the media tk what does this mean specifically regarding russian war objectives jb russia started with a limited objective after that the decision was made to go further it wanted to demilitarize the threat over donbas based on the first success it wanted to start negotiations on the neutrality of ukraine this was a new objective which was defined later putin saw a chance to achieve his goal through negotiations if ukraine did not accept it he would adjust the objective accordingly the ukrainians don t want negotiations so russia is proceeding incrementally until ukraine agrees to a negotiated settlement tk what were the original war aims jb on february 24 putin clearly stated the two war aims demilitarization and denazification to end the threat against the russian speaking population in the donbas moreover putin stated that he did not seek to take over all of ukraine tk has ukraine seriously engaged in a negotiated settlement jb on february 25th zelensky hinted that he was ready to negotiate with russia the european union then showed up on february 27th with a 450 million euro arms package to spur ukraine to fight on march 7th with the goal of demilitarization and denazification nearly achieved and ukraine having made no progress in negotiations russia added that kiev must recognize the return of crimea to russia and the independence of the two donbas republics it made clear that its position could change if ukraine did not want to negotiate tk has ukraine responded to this jb after the capture of mariupol the situation in ukraine weakened and on march 21st zelensky made an offer that was accommodating to russia but as in february the eu came back two days later with a second package of 500 million euros for weapons the uk and the us subsequently put pressure on zelensky to withdraw his offer negotiations in istanbul subsequently stalled tk to what extent has russia changed its goals jb at the end of march the goal of denazification was achieved with the capture of mariupol and removed it from russia s objectives as part of negotiations on april 22nd the russians adjusted their goal the ministry of defense announced that the new goal was to take control of the southern part of ukraine up to transnistria where the russian speaking never felt being well treated what the russians are actually doing is to turn their operational successes into a strategic success tk does this mean that the russian targets reported by the media never existed jb that s right he never said he was going to take the city in two days he never said he wanted to overthrow president zelensky he never said he wanted to take over all of ukraine he never said he was aiming for a victory on may 9th he never said he wanted to declare that victory at the may 9th parade he never said that he wanted to declare war on may 9th in order to trigger a general mobilization the narrative that russia is losing the war against ukraine is based on these claims tk what should come out of the military action at the end jb of course we do not know what is going on in vladimir putin s mind but obviously there is a logic the west is not making it easier for the ukrainians and the russians are moving ahead some provinces have already decided to introduce the ruble as currency so things are slowly moving towards the recreation of some kind of novorossiya tk what do you mean by novorossiya and how should it look territorially jb after the abolition of the official language law in 2014 not only the lugansk and donetsk oblasts rose up but the entire russian speaking south of ukraine as a result in october 2014 the unified forces of novorossiya were formed with units from the self proclaimed republics of only lugansk and donetsk survived the other republics have been brutally suppressed by the kiev s paramilitary forces today the russians are using the revival of the novorossiya as an incentive for the ukrainians to go to the negotiation table if they don t want russia will increase the pressure tk does russia have a chance of success in this way jb nothing is certain what can be said however is that moreover it is clear that the ukrainian conduct of operations has not been effective it seems that the ukrainian military has lost confidence in its authorities as it did in 2014 tk how do we know this jb the testimonies of western volunteer fighters who have returned from ukraine confirm that the ukrainian leadership is weak it seems that the which overestimates the performance of ukrainian forces one gets the feeling that the political leadership is more satisfied with the messages conveyed by the west than with the actual results on the battlefield of course the western media uses the civilian and military casualty figures given by ukraine to claim ukraine s victory and russian upcoming defeat tk what conclusions can we draw from this whole situation jb tk german chancellor scholz has said very clearly russia must not win the war with that the war will continue jb that is childish the operational situation shows that ukraine is in a very difficult situation i do not know whether russia will win or lose this war but i do know that on the political level the situation may be different this is debatable and the future will tell from a western perspective it is certainly a political defeat for russia however for the rest of the world this may not be the case in fact the new eurasian bloc that will emerge from this conflict will be a significantly stronger contender for the west we are used to see the fate of the world revolving around the west by isolating russia politically from the west you push it into the asian bloc in the long run this could give russia an advantage over europe and the united states tk you said that ukraine cannot win the war is that because it is too weak militarily jb there is almost no ukrainian military left so to speak most of the ukrainian army is encircled in the donbas and is being incrementally neutralized by the russian coalition the ukrainian government just started moving territorial units from the west of the country to the donbas this has increased tensions especially in the areas of the hungarian and romanian minorities whose people do not appear keen to fight against the russians we see demonstrations of mothers and wives in the west of the country and in kiev tk obviously western countries behave as if they do not want peace no one urges caution before anything is known for sure conclusions are drawn condemnations are made weapons are supplied the war is kept alive what do you think of the announced increase in arms deliveries jb regarding weapons there are several things to consider first by international community i mean primarily organizations like the un or the eu whether a country pursues this policy like the u s or poland that is their decision but the purpose of an international organization is not to support international conflicts second even u s intelligence agencies admit they don t know however it is clear that all these weapons disappear before they arrive at the front there are reports of a rise in crime in kiev in fact western countries are fueling what the global organized crime index calls one of the largest arms trade markets in europe tk so what do the weapons bring to ukraine jb that s the third aspect to look at this idea is the result of the fact that the west has determined the objective of the russians zelensky is demanding additional weapons because the ukrainian army has already lost hundreds of battle tanks and artillery pieces the few dozen supplied by the west will not change the situation as in 2014 tk how can ukraine finance these weapons or will the supplier states bear the cost out of solidarity jb the weapons are provided to ukraine on the basis of the lend lease law this is a form of leasing that was introduced at the beginning of world war ii to supply weapons to united kingdom and the ussr in other words ukraine will have to pay back for the weapons it receives moreover ukraine is accumulating huge debts to international financial institutions such as the imf and the world bank the paradox is that because of western rhetoric about a country that is doing well and on the verge of defeating russia these institutions are reluctant to cancel its debt tk so the weapons supplied and the volunteer foreign fighters have no impact on the course of the war jb they have only limited impact remember that in afghanistan the taliban were able to prevail against the western forces even though they were much more powerful the afghans had almost no heavy weapons at most small arms neither the number of weapons nor their quality is decisive for victory the biggest weakness of the ukrainian armed forces is leadership tk why is that jb the ukrainian military leadership is bad because it is not able to integrate all parameters needed for planning and conducting battles it makes the same mistakes as nato forces in afghanistan this is not surprising since the latter train the former besides you have to master these weapons to get the most out of them tactically they were developed for professional soldiers trained for months not for casual soldiers trained in two weeks that is completely unrealistic tk do i understand you correctly the efficiency of these delivered weapons is very low and leads to more destruction in ukraine jb for example slovakia has supplied ukraine with the s 300 air defense system which as far as i know has been moved to the vicinity of nikolaev within a very short time it was destroyed by the russians the russians know very well where this equipment is and where the weapons depots are in zaporizhzhia were stored brand new weapons from the west the russians destroyed the depot with a missile with pinpoint accuracy a few howitzers are ineffective because the russians can destroy them very fast the ukrainians of course have to get these systems to the front as quickly as possible they have to do that by rail the ukrainians have electric railroads in the western part of the country the russians destroyed most of the electric substations of the network and the main railroads today no electric locomotives are running on the network anymore as a result they have to bring weapons such as tanks to the frontline by road one by one using transporters the problem is that these destructions affect not only military logistics but also the economic life of the country tk how did russia react to these arms deliveries jb if that is what we want whether it is what the west wants or not i don t know but if this is the goal this is the way to go also it is said that russia currently has the largest inventory of javelin missiles in the world i don t know if that is true but it suggests that a large part of the weapons supplied by the west are not getting to ukrainian fighters tk the gepard tank that the germans want to supply has been decommissioned in the bundeswehr there is also no more ammunition for it in the bundeswehr stocks isn t that a point you mentioned earlier jb the gepard is an antiaircraft tank based on the chassis of the leopard 1 main battle tank it is a vehicle whose development goes back to the 1970s it is a good weapon system but it is no longer suited to modern threats a weapon system also means logistics maintenance and special training for the crews and mechanics furthermore to be effective such a system must be integrated into a command and control system however all of this cannot be accomplished in a matter of weeks basically these weapon systems only draw russian fire tk do western countries have any hope that all this will help accomplish something jb one thing is for sure it doesn t do anything the british made a study of the weapons they had supplied to the ukrainians the results are extremely weak and disappointing as for volunteer fighters the picture is also disappointing a british volunteer fighter who returned from ukraine speaks of cannon fodder of the fighters sent to the front the british themselves realized that it was a waste of life and resources that is why boris johnson started back pedaling after urging young people to fight in ukraine so everything that is being done only serves to continue the war without bringing a solution or decisively winning over russia tk so it is not a matter of helping the ukrainian army jb in theory yes in practice no ukraine already has enormous logistical problems with its troops in the donbas it can hardly supply them with weapons and ammunition and now they are creating a new problem with weapons that cannot be repaired the mechanics are not trained to do this nor are the crews trained to operate the equipment moreover in the systems supplied by the west the instructions and user manuals are in german english or french but not in ukrainian this sounds so trivial but it is a problem that is why i say germany also wants to stoke the crisis this is the attitude of german politicians like scholz baerbock etc they want to fight putin to the last ukrainian that makes no sense tk but if it is so obvious why is the west going this way jb the goal is not to help ukraine but to fight putin in the english language media many analysts confirm that the west is waging a war against russia through ukraine this is called a proxy war this is the point we are not helping ukraine everything else is a lie if i were ukrainian i would condemn putin as much as ursula von der leyen or even ignazio cassis because instead of playing a mediating role these politicians are satisfying their own ambitions by fueling the war in an unhealthy way tk guterres has let it be known that the war would stop if russia would stop the war jb a war always has two parties and in our case there are even three we have russia ukraine and the so called international community that is the western world it is clear that if the war is to be ended it needs both parties not just one to this end negotiations are underway in turkey but they are not really moving forward why has ukraine withdrawn its own proposals so it is clear the solution is not only on the russian side tk one has the impression that history is repeating itself jb yes today we are in a similar situation as in 2014 the west does not want to talk to putin because he is a dictator and the west urges zelensky not to make any concessions dialogue is therefore impossible the west hides behind the illusion of a ukrainian victory but the likelihood of it occurring is diminishing as time goes on even though on a strategic and media level russia appears to have lost tk what should ukraine have done jb one only has to read the minsk agreements to understand that their implementation essentially depends onin ukraine these reforms however requirewith the autonomists kiev however has never taken these steps and the west has never tried to get the ukrainian authorities to do so tk france and germany were the guarantors of the minsk agreements what have they done to ensure that these agreements are implemented jb no the western states have not taken up their responsibility in any way russia has now reacted to an armed conflict that has been going on since 2014 and started with the abolition of the official language law in february 2014 european states did nothing to bring peace that is why putin does not want to talk about war because the war started in 2014 with the minsk agreements a solution was found that is the situation guterres is a politician and the problem is we don t have any space in the un or in our country for politicians to express a balanced opinion tk are these developments intentional jb the whole conflict is the result of a scenario carefully worked out by the west its basic components were laid out in 2019 in two papers published by the rand corporation the pentagon think tank entitled and these describe the sequence of events that led to the russian offensive in february 2022 in addition to that promises were made to ukraine that it would become a member of nato if it instigated a war that led to russia s defeat as oleksiy arestovych explained in an interview with a ukrainian television station in march 2019 as zelensky noted on cnn on march 21 2022 as a matter of fact that is why they prepared for it militarily and economically this explains why they are withstanding the sanctions and pressure better than expected this is also the reason why the west is using its imagination to elaborate new sanctions or new methods to impose them such as abandoning the principle of unanimity in the eu we have entered a phase of cockfighting between the west and russia as a result the problem is that international institutions are no longer fulfilling their role as arbiters but have become parties to the conflict tk but then the eu won the nobel peace prize a few years ago where is the commitment to peace jb obama got it too and obama was the american president who kept his country at war from the first day of his mandate to the last he started three wars and the number of air strikes increased tenfold compared to his predecessor i don t think anybody takes the nobel prize seriously anymore at this point it is purely political tk mr baud thank you for talking to us

version 1 0 june 2022 preface purpose this note provides country of origin information coi and analysis of coi for use by home office decision makers handling particular types of protection and human rights claims as set out in the introduction section it is not intended to be an exhaustive survey of a particular subject or theme it is split into 2 parts 1 an assessment of coi and other evidence and 2 coi these are explained in more detail below assessment this section analyses the evidence relevant to this note that is information in the coi section refugee human rights laws and policies and applicable caselaw by describing this and its inter relationships and provides an assessment of in general whether one or more of the following applies a person is reasonably likely to face a real risk of persecution or serious harm that the general humanitarian situation is so severe that there are substantial grounds for believing that there is a real risk of serious harm because conditions amount to inhuman or degrading treatment as within paragraphs 339c and 339ca iii of the immigration rules article 3 of the european convention on human rights echr that the security situation is such that there are substantial grounds for believing there is a real risk of serious harm because there exists a serious and individual threat to a civilian s life or person by reason of indiscriminate violence in a situation of international or internal armed conflict as within paragraphs 339c and 339ca iv of the immigration rules a person is able to obtain protection from the state or quasi state bodies a person is reasonably able to relocate within a country or territory a claim is likely to justify granting asylum humanitarian protection or other form of leave and if a claim is refused it is likely or unlikely to be certifiable as clearly unfounded under section 94 of the nationality immigration and asylum act 2002 decision makers must however still consider all claims on an individual

in syria is such that there are substantial grounds for believing there is a real risk of serious harm because there exists a serious and individual threat to a civilian s life or person by reason of indiscriminate violence in a situation of international or internal armed conflict as defined in paragraphs 339c and 339ca iv of the immigration rules 2 consideration of issues 2 1 credibility 2 1 1 for information on assessing credibility see the instruction on assessing credibility and refugee status 2 1 2 decision makers must also check if there has been a previous application for a uk visa or another form of leave asylum applications matched to visas should be investigated prior to the asylum interview see the asylum instruction on visa matches asylum claims from uk visa applicants 2 1 3 in cases where there are doubts surrounding a person s claimed place of origin decision makers should also consider the need to conduct language analysis testing see the asylum instruction on language analysis official sensitive start of section 2 1 4 the information in this section has been removed as it is restricted for internal home office use official sensitive end of section 2 2 exclusion 2 2 1 all sides in the conflict have been responsible for serious human rights abuses see protagonists and nature and level of violence decision makers must consider whether there are serious reasons for considering whether one or more of the exclusion clauses is applicable each case must be considered on its individual facts and merits 2 2 2 if the person is excluded from the refugee convention they will also be excluded from a grant of humanitarian protection which has a wider range of exclusions than refugee status 2 2 3 for further guidance on the exclusion clauses see the asylum instruction on exclusion under articles 1f and 33 2 of the refugee convention humanitarian protection and the instruction on restricted leave official sensitive start of section the information in this section has been removed as it is restricted for internal home office use official sensitive end of section 2 3 convention reason s 2 3 1 a severe humanitarian situation and or a state of civil instability and or where law and order has broken down which might exist in some places outside of government control do not of themselves give rise to a well founded fear of persecution for a refugee convention reason 2 3 2 in the absence of a link to one of the 5 refugee convention grounds necessary to be recognised as a refugee the question to address is whether the person will face a real risk of serious harm in order to qualify for humanitarian protection hp 2 3 3 however before considering whether a person requires protection because of the general humanitarian and or security situation decision makers must consider if the person faces a reasonable degree of likelihood of persecution for a refugee convention reason where the person qualifies for protection under the refugee convention decision makers do not need to consider if there are substantial grounds for believing the person faces a real risk of serious harm and a grant of hp decision makers are must consult the country policy and information note cpin on syria returnees prior to making any decisions regarding hp 2 3 4 for further guidance on the 5 refugee convention grounds see the asylum instruction assessing credibility and refugee status 2 3 5 for further guidance on humanitarian protection see the asylum instruction humanitarian protection 2 4 risk a general risk on return 2 4 1 in the country guidance case of kb failed asylum seekers and forced returnees syria cg ukut 426 iac 20 december 2012 heard 6 7 march 2012 7 august 2012 and promulgated on 20 december 2012 the upper tribunal ut found that in the context of the extremely high level of human rights abuses currently occurring in syria a regime which appears increasingly concerned to crush any sign of resistance it is likely that a failed asylum seeker or forced returnee would in general on arrival face a real risk of arrest and detention and of serious mistreatment during that detention as a result of imputed political opinion that is sufficient to qualify for refugee protection the position might be otherwise in the case of someone who notwithstanding a failed claim for asylum would still be perceived on return to syria as a supporter of the assad regime paragraph 32 2 4 2 based on the available country evidence there are not very strong grounds supported by cogent evidence to depart from the findings in kb as such it is considered likely that most forced returnees would in general on arrival face a real risk of arrest and detention and of serious mistreatment during that detention that would qualify them for refugee protection for more information see the country policy and information note syria returnees b security situation 2 4 3 there continues to be an armed conflict in syria with the involvement of multiple international state and non state actors however overall levels of violence have decreased in recent years following the government of syria re taking control of most of the country the available evidence indicates that the levels of violence in idlib aleppo ar raqqa al hasakah deir ez zor hama and dar a governorates are such that a person returning to one of these areas would be at real risk of serious harm by reason of indiscriminate violence 2 4 4 paragraphs 339c and 339ca iv of the immigration rules which set out that a real risk of serious harm as a serious and individual threat by reason of indiscriminate violence in a situation of international or internal armed conflict only apply to civilians who must be non combatants this could include former combatants who have genuinely and permanently renounced armed activity 2 4 5 even where there is not in general a real risk of serious harm by reason of indiscriminate violence in a situation of armed conflict decision makers must consider whether there are particular factors relevant to the person s circumstances which might nevertheless place them at risk the more a person is able to show that they are specifically affected by factors particular to their personal circumstances the lower the level of indiscriminate violence required for them to be at a real risk of serious harm 2 4 6 therefore a person may still face a real risk of serious harm even where generally there is not such a risk if they are able to show that there are specific reasons over and above simply being a civilian for being affected by the indiscriminate violence 2 4 7 in september 2021 the united nations high commissioner for human rights published its first official death toll for the syrian conflict since 2014 the un stated that it had compiled a list of 350 209 individuals who had been killed between march 2011 and march 2021 this figure was published alongside a caveat that the total is a minimum verifiable number and is certainly an under count of the actual number of killings see overall conflict statistics 2 4 8 since the conflict in syria began in 2011 a number of different armed groups have taken part in hostilities both for and against the state s armed forces throughout more than a decade of hostilities government forces see pro government forces have besieged opposition held areas blocked humanitarian aid shelled areas controlled by armed opposition or where the opposition are present and inflicted heavy loss of life and destruction of property there have been reports of pro government forces carrying out indiscriminate airstrikes which repeatedly struck civilian sites including hospitals markets schools and farms many of which were included in un deconfliction lists the use of chemical weapons by the regime forces has also been reported see timeline and nature and level of violence 2 4 9 there have also been reports of non state armed opposition groups continually systematically targeting civilians journalists and health service providers including through killings arbitrary detention enforced disappearances torture and other ill treatment deaths of civilians have been attributed to various different groups including haya tharir al sham see haya tharir al sham hts daesh see daesh and syrian democratic forces sdf see nature and level of violence 2 4 10 the syrian army has regained control of virtually all of the country see timeline and control of territory following major aerial and ground offensives carried out by regime and pro regime forces initiated in december 2019 to recapture areas of northwest syria a ceasefire was brokered between syrian forces supported by russia and turkish backed rebels in march 2020 following the ceasefire hostilities between regime forces and opposition groups dropped significantly resulting in a two fold decrease in reported civilian fatalities however sporadic clashes and daily shelling barrages by the regime continued in northwest syria until the end of the 2020 and into 2021 see nature and level of violence 2 4 11 throughout 2021 there were continued reports of violence across syria with levels of violence gradually increasing as the year went on and civilians continued to suffer the direct and indirect consequences of the armed conflict see main incidents of violence between 2020 and 2021 2 4 12 idlib remained the epicentre of violence with the highest number of security incidents in 2021 other governorates in the north west and north east of syria including aleppo deir ez zor al hasakah ar raqqah and hama also experienced some of the highest numbers of security events in 2021 along with dara a governorate in the south see security events in each governorate in 2021 2 4 13 when comparing the numbers of security events for definitions of the various security events see security events in each governorate in 2021 and fatalities in each governorate in 2021 to those that took place in 2020 most governorates experienced a decline in 2021 damascus deiz ez zor homs lattakia and tartous were the only governorates that experienced a slight increase in number of fatalities both civilian and combatants compared to 2020 with ar raqqah deiz ez zor hama homes quneitra and tartous experiencing a slight increase in security events see 2020 and 2021 comparison available evidence indicates that there was a decrease in the overall numbers of civilian deaths in 2021 compared to 2020 with 1 271 civilian deaths and 1 980 civilian deaths respectively see main incidents of violence between 2020 and 2021 and fatalities in each governorate in 2021 2 4 14 for guidance on considering serious harm where there is a situation of indiscriminate violence in an armed conflict including consideration of enhanced risk factors see the asylum instruction humanitarian protection 2 4 15 for further guidance on assessing risk see the instruction on assessing credibility and refugee status 2 5 certification 2 5 1 where a claim is refused it is unlikely to be certifiable as clearly unfounded under section 94 of the nationality immigration and asylum act 2002 2 5 2 for further guidance on certification see certification of protection and human rights claims under section 94 of the nationality immigration and asylum act 2002 clearly unfounded claims country information section 3 updated 12 april 2022 3 background 3 1 map 3 2 demography 3 2 1 estimates of syria s population vary according to different sources the united nations population fund estimated that syria had a population of 18 3 million in june 2021 however according to an estimate published by the cia world factbook as of july 2021 syria had a population of 20 384 316 with 56 1 of the total population living in urban areas 3 2 2 in june 2020 worldpop published the following map showing the population density in syria 3 3 circumstances that led to war 3 3 1 in march 2021 the bbc published an article entitled why has the syrian war lasted 10 years which stated even before the conflict began many syrians were complaining about high unemployment corruption and a lack of political freedom under president bashar al assad who succeeded his father hafez after he died in 2000 in march 2011 pro democracy demonstrations erupted in the southern city of deraa inspired by uprisings in neighbouring countries against repressive rulers when the syrian government used deadly force to crush the dissent protests demanding the president s resignation erupted nationwide the unrest spread and the crackdown intensified opposition supporters took up arms first to defend themselves and later to rid their areas of security forces mr assad vowed to crush what he called foreign backed terrorism the violence rapidly escalated and the country descended into civil war 3 4 timeline 3 4 1 the council on foreign relations cfr which describes itself as an independent nonpartisan membership organization think tank and publisher published an article in march 2021 entitled syria s civil war the descent into horror below are extracts from the article giving a broad outline of the conflict in syria as it unfolded and what the situation on the ground was at the time of writing the arab spring began in december 2010 with the self immolation of a tunisian fruit vendor decrying corruption his act prompted protests in tunisia and then across the middle east and north africa which forced longtime strongmen in tunisia egypt and yemen to step down inspired by these previously unthinkable events fifteen boys in the southwestern city of deraa syria spray painted on a school wall the people want the fall of the regime they were arrested and tortured demonstrators who rallied behind them clashed with police and protests spread many protesters were calling for something more modest than regime change the release of political prisoners an end to the half century old state of emergency greater freedoms and an end to corruption assad responded to protesters immediately offering just token reforms while directing security services to put down the protests with force anti regime protests soon spread from deraa to major cities such as damascus hama and homs events in deraa offered a preview of what was to come elsewhere the syrian army fired on unarmed protesters and carried out mass arrests both targeting dissidents and indiscriminately sweeping up men and boys human rights monitors reported torture and extrajudicial executions were frequently reported at detention centers then in late april 2011 the syrian army brought in tanks laying siege to deraa the civilian death toll mounted and residents were cut off from food water medicine telephones and electricity for eleven days amid international condemnation the regime offered some concessions but it also repeated the deraa response in other places where there were protests at far greater length and cost leading some regime opponents to take up arms in july 2011 defectors from assad s army announced the formation of the free syrian army fsa and soon after they began to receive shelter in turkey yet the fsa outgunned by the regime struggled to bring its loose coalition under centralized command and control fsa militias often didn t coordinate their operations and sometimes had competing interests reflecting their varied regional backers with resources scarce they preyed at times on the very populations they were charged with protecting 3 4 2 the same source further stated both assad s forces and rebel groups have regularly targeted civilians in areas outside of their control the deaths of some 1 400 civilians from chemical weapons deployed by the assad regime in the summer of 2013 mobilized world powers to dismantle the regime s chemical arsenal however in the years since the syrian government has employed devastating conventional arms that have also caused massive civilian casualties the regime has made regular use of sieges and aerial bombardment these collective punishment tactics serve dual purposes analysts say they raise the costs of resistance to civilians so that they will pressure rebels to acquiesce and they prevent local committees from offering a viable alternative to the regime s governance in 2018 the un humanitarian agency said more than one million people lived in areas that were besieged or otherwise beyond the reach of aid despite a un security council resolution in 2014 aimed at securing humanitarian aid routes aid became politicized as assad would grant un convoys permission to distribute food and medicine in government held areas while denying them access to rebel held areas and rights advocates charged the regime with targeting medical facilities and personnel 3 4 3 the cfr report continued the regime captured the last rebel held enclave of eastern aleppo in december 2016 after a prolonged siege and bombardment the city syria s economic powerhouse had been contested since 2012 and its capture marked a stark reversal of fortune for the opposition in 2013 rebels had nearly encircled the regime controlled western part of the city but the campaign also demonstrated how dependent assad has become on his foreign backers both the russian air force and shiite militias as his own forces have weakened scores of civilians were massacred in the battle s last days in what a un spokesperson called a complete meltdown of humanity with their defeat in aleppo rebels were isolated to northern idlib province parts of the south and small enclaves around damascus and homs the civil war entered a new stage in october 2019 after u s president donald j trump removed the roughly one thousand u s troops supporting kurdish fighters on the syria turkey border the surprise move cleared the way for turkey s erdogan to launch a military operation there aiming to push kurdish forces away from the border turkish troops and their syrian rebel allies seized towns and villages causing hundreds of thousands of people to flee the sdf turned to the syrian government for help allowing regime soldiers to re enter areas that had been held by the kurds for years russian troops also entered the region to support the syrian government with the assistance of their foreign backers assad s forces besieged and bombarded the rebels final redoubts in syria s northwest in late 2019 imperiling hundreds of thousands of civilians by december the regime and its allies advanced into idlib where russia backed forces launched a devastating air campaign and clashes resumed between the regime and turkish forces seeking to protect their opposition posts in the area a cease fire agreement signed by ankara and moscow in january quickly collapsed as regime forces captured cities along the strategically significant m5 highway which connects damascus and aleppo hostilities between the regime and the turks intensified in february 2020 when syrian government forces killed turkish troops in direct combat for the first time spurring turkey to retaliate with strikes against dozens of regime targets the fighting endangered idlib s population which ballooned to three million as government authorities offered rebel fighters and civilians the choice of surrendering risking conscription or arrest or being bused north to the province the heightened violence resulted in the war s largest mass displacement to date with some nine hundred thousand people forced from their homes a march 2020 cease fire agreement between moscow and ankara has largely quelled the fighting despite violations on both sides 3 4 4 the same source concluded a decade after the uprising that sparked the war syria is still mired in low level conflict political instability and economic turmoil the 2020 cease fire has stemmed violence in the turkey controlled northwest while the regime controls most of the rest of the country with help from russia and iran at the same time israel has increasingly bombed targets in syria said to belong to iran linked militias including hezbollah a u s air strike targeted an iraq based militia in syria just weeks after the inauguration of president joe biden in 2021 though the violence has waned civilians are now suffering an economic crisis more than 80 percent of the population lives in poverty syrians have been the main victims of international sanctions including the u s caesar act which is meant to pressure the regime to reform though having little apparent effect on assad the sanctions have discouraged states such as the united arab emirates from normalizing relations with syria 3 4 5 for timelines of events syria in general and the conflict see the bbc s syria profile timeline cnn s syrian civil war fast facts timeline and the chronology section of the european asylum support office s easo july 2021 report entitled syria security situation section 4 updated 12 april 2022 4 protagonists 4 1 pro government forces a syrian forces 4 1 1 in july 2021 easo published a report citing various sources entitled syria security situation which stated the syrian armed forces consist of the syrian arab army saa the navy the air force the intelligence services and the national defense forces militia bashar al assad acts as the commander in chief of the saa and the armed forces operational control of the forces was maintained by the chief of staff of the syrian armed forces as of 2020 the syrian armed forces were estimated to have 169 000 military personnel of which 130 000 were serving in the saa the us department of intelligence estimated in a report covering the period between july and september 2020 that the saa had between 4 000 and 10 000 troops deployed in north east syria between the cities of manbij aleppo governorate and tal tamr hasaka governorate the saa comprises of five main corps the 1st 2nd 3rd 4th and 5th corps each consisting of divisions and led by a major general the 4th and 5th corps were created under russian initiative after september 2015 the two corps operated either under joint russian syrian command 4th corps or explicit russian command 5th corps apart from the five main corps the saa also has several semi independent units the republican guard the special forces and the 4th armoured division which also fall under the command of the chief of staff the saa is said to rely often on key praetorian units such as the republican guard the 4th armoured division and the special forces for offensive operations these units are reportedly mainly composed of alawites loyal to the gos and reported to have receive preferential access to modern weapons the 4th division is described to be made up of elite forces although in practice it is a collection of loosely affiliated units reportedly under the command of the president s brother maher assad b pro government militias 4 1 2 in december 2019 easo published a report citing various sources entitled syria actors which stated after the beginning of the civil war in 2011 the syrian government organized a network of auxiliary pro government militias to supplement the army s combat capabilities and structural deficiencies the use of militias in syria is legally possible under article 10 of the military service law which permits the use of auxiliary forces and other forces that are necessitated by circumstances to fight alongside the saa the pro government militias were at first organised as popular committees from local communities controlled or loyal to the regime to defend their towns and neighborhoods against opposition forces and comprised mainly of shia and alawite individuals additionally the regime also relied on a network of criminal gangs of alawites linked with the assad family who were mobilised and armed to suppress the early protests by 2012 the government took steps to consolidate these militias under its control and incorporated them under an umbrella network set up with iran s assistance called the national defense forces ndf the ndf were reported to be quite inclusive of all the groups that are willing to fight on the side of syrian government for instance incorporating in their ranks sunnis from damascus and aleppo estimations of ndf s fighting strength vary with sources indicating that during their peak in 2014 2015 they had between 80 000 to 100 000 fighters while figures from 2017 assess their capacity to be more than 100 000 soldiers at least one battalion of about 1 000 1 500 women was reported to serve in the ndf mainly in non combat positions c hezbollah 4 1 3 in march 2017 cfr published an article entitled who s who in syria s civil war which stated the lebanese shia movement was established during the country s civil war and expanded its support by putting up a guerrilla resistance to israel in subsequent years its involvement in syria s civil war though has implicated the group in assad s killing of civilians and political repression eroding its popularity in the arab world in syria it has galvanized a mostly sunni opposition that now sees hezbollah as a sectarian partisan and a beachhead of iranian domination of the country hezbollah has sent military advisors and eventually its elite forces and ground troops to fight in syria its forces in syria numbered between four thousand and eight thousand at the start of 2016 says iiss and with syria s infantry weakened they have been vital to rolling back opposition forces and holding territory cleared by russian air strikes like its syrian and iranian allies it has suffered from heavy battlefield losses and estimates of fatalities range upwards from a thousand hezbollah militants have primarily fought sunni opposition forces particularly along the southwestern border syria shares with lebanon 4 1 4 easo stated in december 2019 that hezbollah fighters assisted the syrian government in military operations in many areas of the country since 2012 although they confirmed their presence only in 2013 they were involved in defending or recapturing of druze shia alawite sunni and christian villages around the syrian city al qusayr as well as several shia dominated suburbs of damascus like sayyida zeinab as of june 2018 the number of hezbollah fighters in syria was estimated to be between 7 000 and 10 000 the majority of which were reported to be deployed along the lebanese syrian border in areas inhabited by shias and near their headquarters in lebanon according to christopher kozak of isw lebanese hezbollah was the primary actor securing the syrian lebanese border presence of hezbollah fighters in other areas of the country including around the cities of homs and damascus and in deir ez zor governorate has also been reported d foreign shia militias 4 1 5 the april 2017 report published by the cfr stated iranian military advisors and hezbollah militants have been reinforced by other shia militants primarily from afghanistan iraq and pakistan some of the iraqi militias are offshoots of the popular mobilization fronts fighting to retake iraqi territory captured by the islamic state the afghan fighters are largely refugees who have long resided in iran and were recruited by iran s revolutionary guard corps with offers of citizenship or payoffs their original aim was to defend shia holy sites that they believe would be wiped out if sunni militants toppled assad s government foremost among them is the tomb of sayyida zainab the prophet mohammed s granddaughter in a southern damascus suburb but as pro assad syrian forces have been depleted by defections and casualties these foreigners have come to a broader defense of the assad regime ranging across syria s frontlines against opposition groups their ranks have been estimated to be as high as twenty five thousand they have proven vital to the regime s ground fighting particularly in the battle for aleppo they have primarily clashed with sunni led opposition forces particularly over the contested populous western spine of the country 4 1 6 easo stated in december 2019 apart from the

ally in the arab world and tehran entered the conflict fearing that any successor to the assad regime led by the country s sunni majority would align with its rival saudi arabia as the civil war has dragged on its fears have shifted to the threat of anarchy in syria which would foster conditions in which sunni jihadi groups could thrive it has focused most of its efforts in the country s west where opposition groups most directly threatened the regime iran has helped keep the assad regime economically afloat even while it was bearing the weight of international sanctions for its nuclear program early on it dispatched military advisors and later members of its elite quds force and revolutionary guard soldiers their first major deployment abroad they numbered up to two thousand at the start of 2016 according to iiss like hezbollah iran had concealed the depth of its military involvement until mounting funerals made it apparent to the public it is reported to have suffered several hundred casualties 4 1 8 in december 2019 easo stated since 2012 iran has supplied assad s troops with irgc advisors a network of shia foreign fighters from the lebanese hezbollah and various militias

supervision us ambassador james jeffrey the special representative for syrian engagement and special envoy for the global coalition against daesh assessed in a may 2019 statement that iran retained thousands of ircg qf advisors in syria which provide leadership for over 10 000 iranian backed proxies from third countries the us congress appointed syria study group noted in a september 2019 report that the iranian military presence in syria was at its height in 2015 and has since decreased gradually according to the israeli chief of staff gadi esenkot 3000 members of the irgc were deployed to syria by 2016 and iran was building a force of up 100 000 shia fighters shiite fighters from pakistan afghanistan and iraq apart from providing the syrian government with troops and training iran has

groups and isil f russia 4 1 10 the april 2017 report published by the cfr stated moscow s ties to syria long predate the civil war and it provided the assad regime with a diplomatic shield at the united nations after the start of the uprising then in december 2015 it intervened militarily focusing on supporting assad s campaign in the west and north particularly in its bid to recapture rebel held eastern aleppo russia has deployed fighter jets and attack helicopters in population centers providing government aligned ground forces close air support to retake territory activists and monitoring groups have accused russia of bombarding such population centers as east aleppo as part of a scorched earth strategy meant to deplete rebels and encourage civilians to evacuate or capitulate allegations include the use of bunker buster bombs which wreak particular destruction on shelters and medical facilities built underground to withstand bombardment 4 1 11 the easo report published in july 2021 stated russia intervened militarily in the syrian conflict in september 2015 in support of the syrian government and is credited with changing the tides of war in assad s favour

april 2017 report published by the cfr stated the fsa was the main group to emerge when the regime first cracked down on protestors though it was led by defected army officers and comprised many former syrian army conscripts its name was something of a misnomer with just scarce resources its leadership could never centralize command and control over the many militias that had affiliated with it and many of those groups began operating as criminal outfits the fsa received light arms and later artillery including antiaircraft equipment from its regional backers it also received some nonlethal aid from the united states but washington has often been reluctant to arm even the groups it has vetted out of fear that heavy weaponry might fall into the hands of islamist and jihadi groups 4 2 2 in october 2019 the turkish state news agency anadolu stated the fsa formed a legitimate military backbone of the opposition with the syrian flag and was positioned as the military wing of the syrian provisional government established in march 2013 the fsa became active in most of the country until 2015 and fought on the fronts of aleppo idlib raqqa deyrizor haseke hama latakia homs and damascus dera kuneytra suveyda the support of the russian and iranian backed foreign terrorist groups to the bashar assad regime caused the fsa to lose strength on all fronts in 2016 4 2 3 the

area the group uses the brand of the free syrian army fsa the umbrella armed group formed by the anti government opposition in 2011 and is made up of moderate but also islamist factions these factions include feilaq al sham considered the main actor in the nlf and turkey s closest rebel partner according to a syrian muslim brotherhood official interviewed by the international crisis group feilaq al

significantly impacted its capacity and territorial control in march 2019 the group dissolved and remaining fighters joining factions of the sna several sources indicate that turkey provides weapons and salaries to nlf although the support received is not considered to be substantial by its fighters following clashes with hts that took place in the beginning of 2019 nlf lost control over territory in idlib and subsequently ceded the civil administration and surrounding areas in idlib to hts following an agreement between the groups 4 2 6 the bbc further stated that in october nlf merged with other rebel groups in northern syria and rebranded itself to become part of the syrian national army sna under the command of the syrian interim government s sig ministry of defence i

al bab and jarablus and operation olive branch afrin district areas in northern aleppo governorate and in the operation peace spring area between tall abyad raqqa governorate and ras al ain hasaka governorate the factions that comprise the sna are hostile towards the gos presence in south aleppo governorate and sdf forces controlling areas in the province but follow turkey s order in conducting military operations against either according to a january 2021 report by syrian researcher khayrallah al hilu the sna has not fought against the gos in any of the three areas under its control it has engaged in military operations led by turkey against the sdf or outside of syria the sna reportedly has between 30104 to 40105 distinct armed groups in its composition in october 2019 the merger between the sna and the national liberation front nlf a turkey backed alliance of opposition armed groups that is present in the idlib area under the syrian national army banner was announced by the so called syrian interim government while nominally the sna is a unified structure that sits under the formal supervision of the so called syrian interim government s ministry of defence the constituent groups each answer directly to turkey and maintain its pre national army form several sources assessed that the sna does not function as a unified military structure with each faction acting largely independent from another the total strength of the sna was estimated by syria expert charles lister in a middle east institute article to be around 35 000 fighters whereas the us defense intelligence agency assessed the turkish backed armed groups consists of between 22 000 and 50 000 fighters j hayat tharir al sham hts 4 2 8 in july 2021 easo stated hay at tahrir al sham or

factions operating in idlib significantly weakening their position hts is comprised of several armed factions including jabhat fatah al sham also known as jabhat al nusrah and previously as the al nusrah front ansar al sham and ajnad al sham among others depending on the source hts s strength is evaluated to be between 7 000 and 10 000 fighters ts has created several civilian bodies in the territory under its control including a governance body responsible for civilian functions the syrian salvation government a court system that applies sharia law and an extensive prison system the

also cooperated with turkey during the gos offensive on idlib in 2019 and early 2020 and in its aftermath hts has largely accepted the march 2020 ceasefire of hostilities in the idlib area brokered by turkey and russia and has been active in precluding other hard line anti gos factions in the area from violating it the coi assessed that between july 2019 and january 2020 the gos offensive had eroded the military and political control of hts increased turkish presence in idlib and high ranking defections from the group have further weakened hts position despite these setbacks hts has

russia claimed air strikes on isil targets isil lost territorial control in syria in march 2019 and has since operated as a covert network syria and iraq represent the core area for isil which isil operate as a single front former special envoy for the global coalition to defeat isis james jeffrey assessed in december 2020 that isil activity in syria is focused on gos held areas in the badia desert syrian central desert south of the euphrates and east of palmyra where it manages to intermittently hold some terrain the same source further noted that isil was also maintaining a low level insurgency along the euphrates river in north east syria the un security council noted in a february 2021 report that isil uses the areas of the syrian desert in deir ez zor governorate as a safe haven and base for launching attacks against gos and sdf forces a march 2021 analysis by the institute for the study of war isw wrote that isil controls several small swaths of territory in the mountainous areas of the syrian central desert badia from where it launches attacks on gos forces as detailed below north east of rahjan towards ithriya hama governorate jabal haiyan and jabal abu

multi ethnic force comprising of kurds arabs and other ethnic groups created in 2015 to support the us led coalition in the war against isil the sdf is dominated by the kurdish people s protection units ypg who helped establish the sdf in october 2015 provides its core fighting forces and largely ensures its leadership according to international crisis group the sdf generally accepts that the ypg is its core fighting force which maintains command and control the kurdish people s protection units were established in 2012 as the military wing of the kurdish democratic union party pyd a syrian branch of the pkk they are divided into two groups the people s protection units yekîneyên parastina gel ypg and the women s protection units yekîneyên parastina jinê ypj the stated goal of the ypg and ypj is to protect the kurdish people and their cultural political and social existence 4 2 12 easo further stated that the sdf is led by a general commander who is allegedly elected by the military council which plays the role of the highest military authority of the sdf and is made up of representatives from each military group in the sdf according to information provided by the combined joint task force operation inherent resolve the sdf is a broad spectrum security apparatus that conducts counterinsurgency operations patrols checkpoint operations detention operations and clearance patrols various sources estimate sdf s strength to be around 60 000 fighters despite ypg s media claims that its forces comprise of around 50 000 fighters omran center for strategic studies estimated it to be more between 20 000 and 30 000 fighters 4 2 13 in a report entitled syria targeting of individuals published in march 2020 easo citing various sources stated sdf was neither in alliance with the syrian opposition nor the government but it was nevertheless largely dependent on the gos which funded certain state institutions in the area and paid salaries to state employees in october 2019 the gos and the kurdish controlled sdf announced an agreement that allowed the gos troops to be deployed along the border with turkey to assist kurdish forces in repelling the turkish offensive christopher kozak of isw assessed in november 2019 that the sdf are still in control on the ground in kurdish controlled territories and there has not been a governance handover to the

government from power such as the free syrian army fsa branded factions and islamist groups turkey s main objective in syria has been to prevent the syrian kurdish people s protection units ypg from establishing an autonomous area along syria s northern border with turkey the us congressional research service us crs stated that turkey maintains military forces in northern syria as part of a broader campaign targeting kurdish fighters as of march 2020 turkey fielded between 3 000 to 4 000 troops in syria although the number constantly fluctuates in 2020 and early 2021 it maintained military outposts and troops in idlib governorate northern aleppo governorate and in the area between tal abyad and ras al ain in 2020 turkey engaged in military confrontations with gos forces in north east and north west syria as well as with kurdish forces section 5 updated 12 april 2022 5 nature and level of violence 5 1 overall conflict statistics 5 1 1 on 24 september 2021 at the 48th session of the human rights council the united nations high commissioner for human rights michelle bachelet gave an oral update on the extent of conflict related deaths in syria before september 2021 the last official death toll 191 369 issued by the un was in 2014 when the situation in syria grew more complex and dangerous affecting the uns capacity to maintain the required standards of quality and verification 5 1 2 on 24 september 2021 michelle bachelet stated before outlining the figures that result from this work i would like to emphasize that we followed a strict methodology our numbers include only those people identifiable by full name with an established date of death and who died in an identified governorate any information that did not include these three elements was excluded and exhaustive review was carried out to prevent duplicate records on this basis we have compiled a list of 350 209 identified individuals killed in the conflict in syria between march 2011 to march 2021 over one in every 13 was a woman 26 727 women in all almost one in every 13 was a child 27 126 children to be exact the greatest number of documented killings was recorded in the governorate of aleppo with 51 731 named individuals killed other locations with very heavy death tolls were rural damascus with 47 483 deaths homs with 40 986 deaths idlib with 33 271 deaths hama 31 993 deaths and tartus which lost 31 369 people we assess this figure of 350 209 as statistically sound based as it is on rigorous work but it is not and should not be seen as a complete number of conflict related killings in syria during this period it indicates a minimum verifiable number and is certainly an under count of the actual number of killings the records that we have received with only partial information and which were therefore excluded from our analysis indicate the existence of a wider number of killings that as yet have not been fully documented tragically there are also many other victims who left behind no witnesses or documentation as to their deaths and whose stories we have not yet been able to uncover 5 1 3 the syrian observatory for human rights sohr which describes itself as an independent and impartial uk based human rights organisation has been monitoring the death toll throughout the conflict on 1 june 2021 the sohr published an article which stated that over 606 000 people have been killed across syria since the beginning of the conflict information regarding sohr methodology can be found on the organisation s about us webpage 5 1 4 another organisation the syrian network for human rights snhr which describes itself as an independent human rights organization that monitors and documents human rights violations in syria stated that as of 14 june 2021 228 099 civilians had been killed since march 2011 with 87 77 being killed at the hands of the syrian regime forces and iranian militias for methodology information see the snhr working methodology document on about snhr section on the snhr website 5 1 5 as shown above the death toll of the syrian conflict ranges from between 200 000 to 600 000 people with the higher end of the scale accounting for between 2 and 3 of syria s current population based on the two estimates found in demography different sources report in different ways the number of fatalities caused by the conflict some sources distinguish between the number of civilians and combatants killed whereas others do not while others focus only on battle related deaths it should be noted that variations in figures could be due to the complex nature of the conflict and different organisations inability to access verify and document data 5 2 map of syrian governorates with populations 5 2 1 the below map showing the population density of each of syria s governorates was published by worldpopulation review the name of each governorate was added to the map by cpit 5 3 control of territory 5 3 1 on 14 october 2021 the armed conflict location and event data project s acled a disaggregated data collection analysis and crisis mapping project published the below infographic the most up to date infographic available at the time of writing that indicates who is in control of territory across the country and highlights the key developments in the conflict between the second and third quarter of 2021 note the infographic refers to the syrian democratic forces sdf as the qsd increased armed clashes and exchanges of shelling between qsd and turkish backed opposition forces under operation peace spring led to a change in status in suluk sub district from inactive in q2 of 2021 to active in q3 sur sub district in deir ez zor recorded a decrease in islamic state attacks against qsd forces during the third quarter of 2021 which led to a change in status for this sub district from active in q2 of 2021 to inactive in q3 islamic state militants continued their attacks against regime forces and affiliated militias in the homs countryside thus remaining active in q3 of 2021 the increase in attacks by unidentified armed groups likely to be former opposition rebels against regime forces in izra and dael sub districts in dar a province led to a change in status for these sub districts from inactive in q2 of 2021 to active in q3 these attacks have since decreased following a reconciliation agreement between regime forces and former opposition rebels in the southern dar a countryside in the last week of september 5 4 main incidents of violence between 2020 and 2021 a 2020 5 4 1 the march 2021 united states department of state ussd report for human rights practices in syria covering events in 2020 stated regime and proregime forces continued major aerial and ground offensives initiated in 2019 to recapture areas of northwest syria killing thousands of civilians and forcing nearly one million persons to flee before the brokering of a ceasefire in march which largely held through the remainder of the year the assault involving the use of heavy weapons devastated the civilian infrastructure in the affected areas and exacerbated an already dire humanitarian situation syrian and russian airstrikes repeatedly struck civilian sites including hospitals markets schools settlements for internally displaced persons and farms many of which were included in un deconfliction lists the un commission of inquiry for syria found it probable that the regime its russian allies and other proregime forces committed attacks marked by war crimes that may amount to crimes against humanity during these attacks regime linked paramilitary groups reportedly engaged in frequent violations and abuses including massacres indiscriminate killings kidnapping of civilians extreme physical abuse including sexual violence and unlawful detentions regime aligned militias including hizballah repeatedly launched attacks that killed and injured civilians russian forces were implicated in the deaths of civilians resulting from airstrikes characterized by the un commission of inquiry for syria as indiscriminate and resulting in the widespread destruction of civilian infrastructure particularly during support of the regime s military campaign in northwest syria these airstrikes destroyed hospitals shelters markets homes and other integral civilian facilities damaging medical supplies and equipment and shutting down vital health care networks and followed a well documented pattern of attacks with serious and deleterious humanitarian and civilian impact 5 4 2 the same source further stated that armed terrorist groups such as al qa ida linked hayat tahrir al sham hts committed a wide range of abuses including unlawful killings and kidnappings unlawful detention extreme physical abuse deaths of civilians during attacks described by the un commission of inquiry for syria as indiscriminate and forced evacuations from homes based on sectarian identity despite the territorial defeat of isis in 2019 the group continued to carry out unlawful killings bombings and kidnappings sometimes targeting civilians the carnegie corporation assessed that isis benefited from a security vacuum left by the various military forces reducing activity due to the covid 19 pandemic turkish supported syrian armed opposition groups in northern syria committed human rights abuses reportedly targeting kurdish and yezidi residents and other civilians including the arbitrary arrest and enforced disappearance of civilians torture sexual violence forced evacuations from homes looting and seizure of private property transfer of detained civilians across the border into turkey the cutting of water to civilian populations recruitment of child soldiers and the looting and desecration of religious shrines elements of the syrian democratic forces a coalition of syrian kurds arabs turkmen and other minority groups that included members of the kurdish people s protection units reportedly engaged in human rights abuses including arbitrary detentions acts of corruption and restrictions on freedom of assembly 5 4 3 in may 2021 acled published a report citing various sources entitled syria 10 years on which stated acled data show that while conflict levels in northwest syria plummeted when compared to those in 2019 the idleb enclave remained one of the most unstable regions in the country in 2020 nearly a third of all organized political violence events recorded in the country in 2020 occurred in idleb meanwhile discontent in the southern provinces notably in dar a remained a source of violence in the south the islamic state is remained active in central and eastern syria throughout the year carrying out attacks in urban hubs as well as in the syrian desert lastly israel expanded the scope of its airstrikes in syria in 2020 in response to iranian entrenchment in the southern and central provinces the year 2020 began with a military campaign by regime and allied forces against the last stronghold of the opposition and islamist factions in northwest syria the offensive initially launched in mid december 2019 resulted in significant regime advancements and the displacement of nearly one million civilians the escalation of fighting in northwest syria brought about a confrontation between russian backed regime forces and turkish troops the most significant confrontation since turkey s direct military intervention in syria in 2016 the deadly round of hostilities was triggered by an airstrike that targeted a turkish position in idleb s balyun area killing 33 turkish soldiers turkey responded by launching a counter offensive aimed at reversing regime advances turkey s use of drones caused significant losses to the regime and allied militia fighters shortly after a ceasefire agreement was signed between turkey and russia on 5 march 2020 the ceasefire agreement and subsequent decline in hostilities contributed to a decrease in civilian fatalities in 2020 acled records a two fold decrease in reported fatalities from violence targeting civilians across syria in 2020 at over 1 980 fatalities for the year this can largely be attributed to a reduction in fatalities in northwest syria 5 4 4 the same source further stated while hostilities between regime forces and opposition groups in northwest syria have significantly dropped since march 2020 sporadic clashes and daily shelling barrages by the regime continued until the end of the year and into 2021 attacks by regime forces and loyal militias against rebel factions and islamist factions like hayat tahrir al sham hts increased again in mid 2020 coinciding with the resumption of russian airstrikes in idlib these actions breached the ceasefire agreement intended to prevent further regime advancement in northwest syria b dec 2020 jan 2021 5 4 5 on 18 february 2021 the un sc published a report on the political humanitarian and security related developments in syria

right understand one thing no they re just gonna have to that s the top shelf you see is the myth of kristen that s the first medication in medication abortion that is one pill that is swallowed and it is progesterone hormone receptor blocker because i bet you do did you say and then you need second medicine crystal that is he prostaglandin that helps the cervix open little bit and it helps the uterus which is muscle contract to push the pregnancy out anything we did okay since democrat joe biden became president the food and drug administration has removed major obstacle for women seeking abortion pills eliminating longstanding requirement that they pick up the medication in person mail delivery is also now allowed nationwide however republican lawmakers in states such as south dakota texas kentucky arkansas ohio tennessee and oklahoma have moved to restrict access to abortion pills in recent months total of 19 states require medical clinician to be physically present when abortion pills are given to patient yes ma am as long as you re 11 weeks unless the choice of whether you do the procedure or the appeal okay yes ma am thank you they also want to elect presidential candidate who would work to reverse the fda decision that brought an access to the pills advertisement is taking plan b the same as getting an abortion doctors weigh in share copy link copy related video above a legal battle over medical abortions could be the nextthe supreme court voted friday to overturn roe v wade the 1973 court case that made abortion legal across the country now with abortion likely to be banned in many states people are wondering if that means that access to birth control iuds and emergency contraception will also be affected in 2021 a study showed that 24 of women ages 22 to 49 years old had used emergency contraception in their lifetime per the centers for disease control and prevention rumors have swirled that one form of emergency contraception called plan b is next on the chopping block but that hasn t happened yet so what exactly does plan b do again and is it the same thing as the abortion pill spoiler it s not obstetrician gynecologists dr jennifer lincoln md and dr jessica shepherd md are explaining plan b and how it s different from the abortion pill what is plan b plan b one step frequently referred to as the morning after pill is a type of emergency contraceptive that you can purchase over the counter at a pharmacy for around 50 it s one pill taken orally that contains 1 5 milligrams of levonorgestrel a synthetic form of the hormone progesterone according to the fda the purpose of plan b is to stop you from getting pregnant after having unprotected sex or after you think your contraception has failed it prevents pregnancy by delaying ovulation it can also prevent a fertilized egg from implanting in the uterus but experts warn that it shouldn t be your main way of preventing pregnancy emergency contraception should not be used as a regular method of birth control shepherd said and for future reference plan b can be safely used again after another instance of unprotected sex or birth control failure is plan b the same thing as an abortion no plan b is not abortion taking plan b prevents pregnancy by delaying ovulation and if fertilization does occur plan b may prevent a fertilized egg from attaching to the uterus per the fda however if a fertilized egg is implanted prior to taking plan b the drug will not work and pregnancy proceeds normally the cdc defines abortion as the termination of an established pregnancy what is the abortion pill and how does it work if you opt for a medication abortion you ll actually take two different pills mifepristone and misoprostol on day one you ll take mifepristone per planned parenthood mifepristone blocks the body s progesterone a hormone that is needed to continue a pregnancy in its early stages it causes the pregnancy to stop progressing shepherd said on day two or three you will usually take four misoprostol pills this medication softens the cervix and causes the uterus to contract shepherd explained this will expel the embryo from the uterus why do people confuse plan b and the abortion pill lincoln said that one of the main reasons why people think that plan b is the same thing as abortion is because the packaging states it could prevent the implantation of an embryo however this is a hypothetical that has never been proven she said plus some people believe that pregnancy begins at fertilization not at implantation she adds but organizations such as the national institutes of health trusted source and the american college of obstetricians and gynecologists say that pregnancy occurs only after a fertilized egg is implanted in the uterus according to healthline implantation at the beginning of pregnancy happens about a week after fertilization shepherd said the blastocyst a tiny group of cells that will later become the fetus embeds itself into the wall of the uterus and that s when experts say you re technically pregnant is plan b going to be illegal as of right now no states have banned plan b or made it illegal however there have been talks among lawmakers who are considering putting stricter measures in place it all comes down to how the law is interpreted and whether or not it can be expanded to include the pill or other forms of emergency contraception thirteen states currently have trigger bans that can go into effect now that roe is overturned but these bans do not include emergency contraceptives or in vitro fertilization ivf brent crane the house state affairs committee chairman has said that he would hold a hearing about banning emergency contraception due to reports of complications causing health concerns for the mom according to the idaho statesman meanwhile justice clarence thomas recently hinted that a woman s right to birth control protected under griswold v connecticut could be under threat next in future cases we should reconsider all of this court s substantive due process precedents including griswold lawrence and obergefell he wrote when should i take plan b plan b should be taken by 3 days or 72 hours of unprotected sex lincoln said but it works better the sooner you take it how long is plan b s shelf life plan b has a shelf life of about four years if it s stored properly per plan b one step regardless it s always good practice to check the box for the expiration date before purchase what if i can t find plan b if you can t get your hands on a plan b consider other options that could buy you more time and might be even more effective ella another form of emergency contraception is especially helpful for women with a higher bmi ella is effective for people with a bmi of up to 35 instead of plan b s 26 according to healthline but it requires a prescription so it might not be the best option if you re running short on time ella is better in that you have up to 5 days or 120 hours after unprotected sex to take it lincoln said ella may prevent pregnancy even before ovulation begins shepherd added shepherd pointed out that you can also get a copper iud inserted into your uterus as a form of emergency contraception here are some additional stats plan b 87 5 effective per plan b s website ella 97 9 to 99 1 effective per ella s website copper iud 99 effective per cleveland clinic what are the side effects of plan b compared to the abortion pill some common but temporary side effects of taking plan b include nausea dizziness fatigue headaches breast tenderness bleeding between periods or heavier menstrual bleeding and lower abdominal pain or cramps according to mayo clinic but if you vomit within two hours after taking plan b consult with your doctor to see if you should take another dose the side effects are slightly different from the abortion pill you can expect bleeding and cramping which is normal to expel the pregnancy lincoln said you might also experience nausea chills and fever for a short period according to planned parenthood does emergency contraception affect future fertility emergency contraception does not impact your chances of getting pregnant in the future there is no risk to future fertility when using birth control long term or using ecp and data has substantiated this now repeatedly shepherd said there is also no evidence that taking emergency contraception raises your risk of breast cancer where can i buy plan b plan b can be purchased over the counter at drugstores or pharmacies to purchase ella you ll have to ask your doctor for a prescription still lincoln notes that both ella and plan b can be sent to you from mail order birth control companies it s best to have them on hand before you need them so there are no barriers to you taking them asap she said should i stockpile plan b now that roe v wade has been overturned many women wonder if they should be buying plan b in bulk just in case they need it in the future it s unnecessary to stock up in bulk like people did with toilet paper back in 2020 this will lead to lack of access when people need it most lincoln said instead get yourself one or two so you have them if you or a friend needs them but don t go overboard

and using third party sellers non public data to compete with them ii the foregoing exposed amazon to a heightened risk of regulatory scrutiny and or enforcement actions iii amazon s revenues derived

prior to the ipo from march 4 2021 through march 11 2021 china held its annual two sessions parliamentary meetings where the two main political bodies of china meet discuss and reveal plans for china s policies involving the economy military trade diplomacy education the environment and other issues unbeknownst to investors until after the ipo chinese government leaders in attendance at the two sessions meetings had proposed and ultimately adopted stringent regulations governing the educational industry with material adverse repercussions for first high school education s business operations and financial prospects specifically the first high school education class action lawsuit alleges that the ipo s registration statement made inaccurate statements of material fact because defendants failed to disclose the following adverse facts that existed at the time of the ipo i that the new rules regulations and policies to be implemented by the chinese government following the two sessions parliamentary meetings were far more severe than represented to investors and posed a material adverse threat to first high school education and its business ii that contemplated chinese regulations and rules regarding private education were leading to a slowdown of government approval to open new educational facilities which would have a negative effect on first high school education s enrollment and growth and iii that as a result the registration statement s representations regarding first high school education s historical financial and operational metrics and purported market opportunities did not accurately reflect the actual business operations and financial results and trajectory of first high school education at the time of the ipo and were materially false and misleading and lacked a factual basis soon after the ipo media reports stated that attendees of the two sessions conference had proposed stricter regulations to rein in the for profit education industry such as regulations aimed at enhancing teacher quality limiting fee scams reducing market abuse and reducing the stress that for profit educational companies had placed on students in the chinese educational system on may 12 2021 news reports revealed that the impending government crackdown on for profit educational companies in china would be much more drastic and far reaching than previously publicly known sources stated that anticipated rules would include measures such as banning on campus tutoring classes prohibiting tutoring services during weekend hours and the imposition of industry wide fee limitations then on may 14 2021 china s state council announced rules that it would further tighten regulations on compulsory education and training institutions according to an article on fitchratings com titled legal changes in private education in china rising risks for k 12 education companies higher education providers benefit the new rules aim to prohibit profit making in compulsory education and expose k 12 school operators to heightened regulatory risks and their revenue growth may slow until they obtain more clarity on how the changes will be implemented thereafter on july 23 2021 china unveiled a sweeping overhaul of its education sector banning companies that teach the school curriculum from making profits raising capital or going public these drastic measures effectively ended any potential growth in the for profit tutoring sector in china two months later on september 28 2021 first high school education revealed that its first half of 2021 revenue was rmb231 9 million a year over year increase of only 24 8 a steep drop from the 30 5 year over year revenue increase for the first nine months of 2020 and the 32 5 year over year

file photo abortion rights supporters and anti abortion demonstrators protest outside the united states supreme court in washington u s june 21 2022 reuters evelyn hockstein file photo by lawrence hurley and andrew chung washington reuters the u s supreme court on friday overturned the landmark 1973 roe v wade ruling that recognized women s constitutional right to abortion a decision condemned by president joe biden that will dramatically change life for millions of women in america and exacerbate growing tensions in a deeply polarized country the court in a 6 3 ruling powered by its conservative majority upheld a republican backed mississippi law that bans abortion after 15 weeks of pregnancy the vote was 5 4 to overturn roe with conservative chief justice john roberts writing separately to say he would have upheld the mississippi law without taking the additional step of erasing the roe precedent altogether the reverberations of the ruling will be felt far beyond the court s high security confines potentially reshaping the battlefield in november s elections to determine whether biden s fellow democrats retain control of congress and signaling a new openness by the justices to change other long recognized rights the decision will also intensify debate over the legitimacy of the court once an unassailable cornerstone of the american democratic system but increasingly under scrutiny for its more aggressively conservative decisions on a range of issues the ruling restored the ability of states to ban abortion twenty six states are either certain or considered likely to ban abortion mississippi is among 13 states with so called trigger laws to ban abortion with roe overturned for related graphic click in a concurring opinion that raised concerns the justices might roll back other rights conservative justice clarence thomas urged the court to reconsider past rulings protecting the right to contraception legalizing gay marriage nationwide and invalidating state laws banning gay sex the justices in the ruling written by conservative justice samuel alito held that the roe decision that allowed abortions performed before a fetus would be viable outside the womb which occurs between 24 and 28 weeks of pregnancy was wrongly decided because the u s constitution makes no specific mention of abortion rights women with unwanted pregnancies in large swathes of america now may face the choice of traveling to another state where the procedure remains legal and available buying abortion pills online or having a potentially dangerous illegal abortion justice brett kavanaugh in a concurring opinion appeared to nix an idea advocated by some anti abortion advocates that the next step is for the court to declare that the constitution outlaws abortion the constitution neither outlaws abortion nor legalizes abortion kavanaugh wrote kavanaugh also said that the ruling does not let states bar residents from traveling to another state to obtain an abortion or retroactively punish people for prior abortions sad day biden condemned the ruling as taking an extreme and dangerous path it s a sad day for the court and for the country biden said at the white house the court has done what it has never done before expressly take away a constitutional right that is so fundamental to so many americans empowering states to ban abortion makes the united states an outlier among developed nations on protecting reproductive rights the democratic president added biden urged congress to pass a law protecting abortion rights an unlikely proposition given its partisan divisions biden said his administration will protect women s access to medications approved by the u s food and drug administration including pills for contraception and medication abortion while also combating efforts to restrict women from traveling to other states to obtain abortions britain france and some other nations called the ruling a step backward although the vatican praised it saying it challenged the world to reflect on life issues new zealand prime minister jacinda ardern said the decision was a loss for women everywhere watching the removal of a woman s fundamental right to make decisions over their own body is incredibly upsetting she said in a statement u s companies including walt disney co at t nyse t and facebook parent meta platforms inc said they will cover employees expenses if they now have to travel for abortion services damaging consequences a draft version of alito s ruling indicating the court was ready to overturn roe was leaked in may igniting a political firestorm friday s ruling largely tracked this leaked draft the constitution makes no reference to abortion and no such right is implicitly protected by any constitutional provision alito wrote in the ruling roe v wade recognized that the right to personal privacy under the constitution protects a woman s ability to terminate her pregnancy the supreme court in a 1992 ruling called planned parenthood of southeastern pennsylvania v casey reaffirmed abortion rights and prohibited laws imposing an undue burden on abortion access friday s ruling overturned the casey decision as well roe was egregiously wrong from the start its reasoning was exceptionally weak and the decision has had damaging consequences and far from bringing about a national settlement of the abortion issue roe and casey have enflamed debate and deepened division alito added the court s three liberal justices stephen breyer sonia sotomayor and elena kagan issued a jointly authored dissent whatever the exact scope of the coming laws one result of today s decision is certain the curtailment of women s rights and of their status as free and equal citizens they wrote as a result of friday s ruling from the very moment of fertilization a woman has no rights to speak of a state can force her to bring a pregnancy to term even at the steepest personal and familial costs the liberal justices added the ruling empowered states to ban abortion just a day after the court s conservative majority issued another decision limiting the ability of states to enact gun restrictions the abortion and gun rulings illustrated the polarization in america on a range of issues also including race and voting rights overturning roe was long a goal of christian conservatives and many republican officeholders including former president donald trump who as a candidate in 2016 promised to appoint justices to the supreme court who would reverse roe during his term he named three to the bench all of whom joined the majority in the ruling asked in a fox news interview whether he deserved some credit for the ruling trump said god made the decision crowds gathered outside the courthouse surrounded by a tall security fence anti abortion activists erupted in cheers after the ruling while some abortion rights supporters were in tears i m ecstatic said emma craig 36 of pro life san francisco abortion is the biggest tragedy of our generation and in 50 years we ll look back at the 50 years we ve been under roe v wade with shame hours later protesters angered by the decision still gathered outside the court as did crowds in cities from coast to coast including new york atlanta chicago denver los angeles and seattle house of representatives speaker democrat nancy pelosi a democrat denounced the decision saying that a republican controlled supreme court has achieved that party s dark and extreme goal of ripping away women s right to make their own reproductive health decisions the number of u s abortions increased by 8 during the three years ending in 2020 reversing a 30 year trend of declining numbers according to data released on june 15

right understand one thing no they re just gonna have to that s the top shelf you see is the myth of kristen that s the first medication in medication abortion that is one pill that is swallowed and it is progesterone hormone receptor blocker because i bet you do did you say and then you need second medicine crystal that is he prostaglandin that helps the cervix open little bit and it helps the uterus which is muscle contract to push the pregnancy out anything we did okay since democrat joe biden became president the food and drug administration has removed major obstacle for women seeking abortion pills eliminating longstanding requirement that they pick up the medication in person mail delivery is also now allowed nationwide however republican lawmakers in states such as south dakota texas kentucky arkansas ohio tennessee and oklahoma have moved to restrict access to abortion pills in recent months total of 19 states require medical clinician to be physically present when abortion pills are given to patient yes ma am as long as you re 11 weeks unless the choice of whether you do the procedure or the appeal okay yes ma am thank you they also want to elect presidential candidate who would work to reverse the fda decision that brought an access to the pills advertisement is taking plan b the same as getting an abortion doctors weigh in share copy link copy related video above a legal battle over medical abortions could be the nextthe supreme court voted friday to overturn roe v wade the 1973 court case that made abortion legal across the country now with abortion likely to be banned in many states people are wondering if that means that access to birth control iuds and emergency contraception will also be affected in 2021 a study showed that 24 of women ages 22 to 49 years old had used emergency contraception in their lifetime per the centers for disease control and prevention rumors have swirled that one form of emergency contraception called plan b is next on the chopping block but that hasn t happened yet so what exactly does plan b do again and is it the same thing as the abortion pill spoiler it s not obstetrician gynecologists dr jennifer lincoln md and dr jessica shepherd md are explaining plan b and how it s different from the abortion pill what is plan b plan b one step frequently referred to as the morning after pill is a type of emergency contraceptive that you can purchase over the counter at a pharmacy for around 50 it s one pill taken orally that contains 1 5 milligrams of levonorgestrel a synthetic form of the hormone progesterone according to the fda the purpose of plan b is to stop you from getting pregnant after having unprotected sex or after you think your contraception has failed it prevents pregnancy by delaying ovulation it can also prevent a fertilized egg from implanting in the uterus but experts warn that it shouldn t be your main way of preventing pregnancy emergency contraception should not be used as a regular method of birth control shepherd said and for future reference plan b can be safely used again after another instance of unprotected sex or birth control failure is plan b the same thing as an abortion no plan b is not abortion taking plan b prevents pregnancy by delaying ovulation and if fertilization does occur plan b may prevent a fertilized egg from attaching to the uterus per the fda however if a fertilized egg is implanted prior to taking plan b the drug will not work and pregnancy proceeds normally the cdc defines abortion as the termination of an established pregnancy what is the abortion pill and how does it work if you opt for a medication abortion you ll actually take two different pills mifepristone and misoprostol on day one you ll take mifepristone per planned parenthood mifepristone blocks the body s progesterone a hormone that is needed to continue a pregnancy in its early stages it causes the pregnancy to stop progressing shepherd said on day two or three you will usually take four misoprostol pills this medication softens the cervix and causes the uterus to contract shepherd explained this will expel the embryo from the uterus why do people confuse plan b and the abortion pill lincoln said that one of the main reasons why people think that plan b is the same thing as abortion is because the packaging states it could prevent the implantation of an embryo however this is a hypothetical that has never been proven she said plus some people believe that pregnancy begins at fertilization not at implantation she adds but organizations such as the national institutes of health trusted source and the american college of obstetricians and gynecologists say that pregnancy occurs only after a fertilized egg is implanted in the uterus according to healthline implantation at the beginning of pregnancy happens about a week after fertilization shepherd said the blastocyst a tiny group of cells that will later become the fetus embeds itself into the wall of the uterus and that s when experts say you re technically pregnant is plan b going to be illegal as of right now no states have banned plan b or made it illegal however there have been talks among lawmakers who are considering putting stricter measures in place it all comes down to how the law is interpreted and whether or not it can be expanded to include the pill or other forms of emergency contraception thirteen states currently have trigger bans that can go into effect now that roe is overturned but these bans do not include emergency contraceptives or in vitro fertilization ivf brent crane the house state affairs committee chairman has said that he would hold a hearing about banning emergency contraception due to reports of complications causing health concerns for the mom according to the idaho statesman meanwhile justice clarence thomas recently hinted that a woman s right to birth control protected under griswold v connecticut could be under threat next in future cases we should reconsider all of this court s substantive due process precedents including griswold lawrence and obergefell he wrote when should i take plan b plan b should be taken by 3 days or 72 hours of unprotected sex lincoln said but it works better the sooner you take it how long is plan b s shelf life plan b has a shelf life of about four years if it s stored properly per plan b one step regardless it s always good practice to check the box for the expiration date before purchase what if i can t find plan b if you can t get your hands on a plan b consider other options that could buy you more time and might be even more effective ella another form of emergency contraception is especially helpful for women with a higher bmi ella is effective for people with a bmi of up to 35 instead of plan b s 26 according to healthline but it requires a prescription so it might not be the best option if you re running short on time ella is better in that you have up to 5 days or 120 hours after unprotected sex to take it lincoln said ella may prevent pregnancy even before ovulation begins shepherd added shepherd pointed out that you can also get a copper iud inserted into your uterus as a form of emergency contraception here are some additional stats plan b 87 5 effective per plan b s website ella 97 9 to 99 1 effective per ella s website copper iud 99 effective per cleveland clinic what are the side effects of plan b compared to the abortion pill some common but temporary side effects of taking plan b include nausea dizziness fatigue headaches breast tenderness bleeding between periods or heavier menstrual bleeding and lower abdominal pain or cramps according to mayo clinic but if you vomit within two hours after taking plan b consult with your doctor to see if you should take another dose the side effects are slightly different from the abortion pill you can expect bleeding and cramping which is normal to expel the pregnancy lincoln said you might also experience nausea chills and fever for a short period according to planned parenthood does emergency contraception affect future fertility emergency contraception does not impact your chances of getting pregnant in the future there is no risk to future fertility when using birth control long term or using ecp and data has substantiated this now repeatedly shepherd said there is also no evidence that taking emergency contraception raises your risk of breast cancer where can i buy plan b plan b can be purchased over the counter at drugstores or pharmacies to purchase ella you ll have to ask your doctor for a prescription still lincoln notes that both ella and plan b can be sent to you from mail order birth control companies it s best to have them on hand before you need them so there are no barriers to you taking them asap she said should i stockpile plan b now that roe v wade has been overturned many women wonder if they should be buying plan b in bulk just in case they need it in the future it s unnecessary to stock up in bulk like people did with toilet paper back in 2020 this will lead to lack of access when people need it most lincoln said instead get yourself one or two so you have them if you or a friend needs them but don t go overboard

the one in clay was necessary workers package products at amazon s new distribution center in clay new york on thursday june 23 2022 rick moriarty tns amazon s clay site attracting 200 workers a week amazon employs 1 500 people at its new fulfillment center in clay new york and has plans to double that number by the end of 2022 katrina tulloch tns will more automation replace future workers tns amazon s opening of a huge distribution center near syracuse n y comes as the company is facing two looming challenges that could impact its operations for years to come the first and most immediate problem is that the company built too many warehouses during the coronavirus pandemic when consumer online purchasing soared e commerce sales slowed earlier this year as consumers ventured back to brick and mortar stores amazon said it suddenly found itself with more warehouse space than it needs the second challenge is a potential shortage of workers to fill its warehouses once demand returns vox s recode reported recently that according to leaked amazon internal research the company is worried it could run out of people to hire in its u s warehouses by 2024 at least in certain markets yet in clay just north of syracuse the retail giant is hiring hundreds of workers and expanding its service area from central new york into neighboring states the 3 8 million square foot warehouse opened here in april months behind schedule yet since then it s already hired 1 500 full time workers officials said thursday and it plans to double that workforce by fall in time for the holiday shopping season in other markets amazon is subleasing portions of its warehouse space and pausing the opening of half a dozen sites that bad news along with amazon s plummeting stock value has forced the nation s second largest employer to make sudden changes that are costing the company billions of dollars at the same time the retailing giant is pushing ahead toward its longer term goals quicker delivery of more goods in more markets that s one of the reasons the site here so far is booming talked this week with industry experts about amazon s challenges and what that means for one of onondaga county s newest and biggest employers here s what they said amazon doubled its warehouse space to more than 410 million square feet during the pandemic the clay warehouse is a part of that effort 3 8 million square feet inside a five story building that aims to pump out as many as 150 000 items a day just as amazon was finishing construction in clay sales slowed way down in the first three months of 2022 amazon reported a loss of 3 84 billion its first quarterly loss since 2015 a year ago it reported a profit of 8 1 billion for the first quarter in response the company reportedly is planning to sublet 10 million square feet of warehouse space and terminate some warehouse leases early because of an excess of space in new york new jersey southern california and atlanta but it kept moving ahead in clay after pushing back the opening and hiring dates three times the company finally started hiring in april and held its grand opening on thursday in other places amazon put some of its new warehouses on hold the company is delaying the opening of six distribution centers all similar to the one in clay for one to two years said marc wulfraat president of mwpvl international a global supply chain and logistics consulting firm the warehouses being mothballed are in sioux falls south dakota davenport iowa shreveport louisiana rockford and clarksville tennessee and bexar county texas he said just the opposite is happening in clay though wulfraat said amazon has moved forward with the opening of its clay site for two reasons first construction at the clay facility was further along than it was at the six warehouses that are being mothballed and second the clay warehouse is the only fulfillment center amazon has to serve a wide swath of upstate new york stretching to buffalo watertown binghamton and utica the company is building a center in gates near rochester but it has not been completed plans to build one in grand island near buffalo ran into local opposition in 2020 amazon is on a years long push to provide customers with next day delivery and the only way to do that is to open fulfillment centers close to where its customers live wulfraat said they needed capacity in northern new york he said they don t have one in buffalo and rochester isn t open yet so opening the one in clay was necessary it wasn t something you want to delay irfaan hafeez amazon site leader in clay said the center also serves parts of massachusetts and connecticut and will eventually serve other states we want to grow and not just in upstate new york he said amazon workers join and leave the company at stunning rates even before the pandemic the turnover rate among hourly workers was as high as 150 percent or about 3 percent of its warehouse workers every week according to an investigation by the new york times in 2021 that constant churn is business as usual for amazon but if it continues it could literally run out of workers to operate its expanded network of warehouses the company s own researchers have warned amazon s internal research report concluded that if it continues that trend the company will deplete its available labor supply in the u s by 2024 facilities in phoenix arizona and the inland empire region of california running out of workers even sooner according to the recode report yet so far hundreds of workers in central new york are applying each week for open spots in clay amazon said thursday it has hired 1 500 people for the clay facility and has plans to double that number by the time the holiday shopping season starts in october hafeez said the company has had no problem attracting applicants and is adding 200 workers a week to its workforce in clay we re thrilled to be able to bring great jobs to this community said jennifer cruickshank head of new york public policy and community engagement for amazon looking at a large hiring banner on the front of the building she said hopefully that banner will stay up for a while because we ve got so many opportunities here so many types of jobs for the people of this community many are attracted to the pay and a full suite of benefits such as health insurance 401 k match tuition assistance all our front line employees who are full time earn more than 16 per hour with some earning even more than that hafeez said that hiring comes as the syracuse metro area is experiencing one of its tightest labor markets on record the area s unemployment rate was just 3 2 percent in may the lowest for any may going back to 1990 with the area having regained nearly all the jobs it lost during the pandemic so amazon is trying to hire at a time when most people in the area who want a job already have one i certainly think it s possible that they ll run out of people to hire said gretchen purser an associate professor of sociology at the maxwell school of citizenship and public affairs at syracuse university even if the company reaches its hiring goals in clay it could have trouble maintaining that staffing level because of its notoriously high turnover rates said risa lieberwitz professor of labor and employment law at cornell university s school of industrial and labor relations amazon has a problem with high rates of turnover nationally so it stands to reason it may have that problem in clay she said lieberwitz said the company loses workers at such an alarming rate primarily because its warehouses are incredibly stressful places to work with associates under constant computerized surveillance to make sure they meet strict production quotas new york lawmakers recently passed legislation that would limit the use of production quotas in the warehouse industry a bill widely viewed as targeting amazon gov kathy hochul has not said if she will sign it up until now the company has actually viewed its high turnover rate as a positive lieberwitz said amazon doesn t want people to stay too long because they might want to start making demands she said but in tight labor markets where workers have other employment options high turnover will hurt the company she said amazon is also known for its aggressive anti union stance which has helped to keep unions out of its warehouses preventing workers from having the opportunity to bargain collectively for better pay and working conditions she said to avoid running out of workers in clay and elsewhere amazon needs to improve working conditions and agree not to actively oppose unionization efforts lieberwitz said people need to feel safe with breaks and not feel like they are under constant surveillance she said people want to be and deserve to be treated with respect not everyone believes the company s staffing troubles will last however while the unusually tight labor market may make it harder for the company to fill jobs in the short run amazon could solve the problem within a few years by increasing automation at it warehouses said marshall van alstyne a business professor at boston university and a leading expert on network business models amazon s warehouse in clay is highly automated with thousands of robots constantly moving products around the building but humans still perform many routine tasks like pulling items from storage shelves packaging them and loading them onto trucks for shipment if they can increase automation by having robots pick up

stocks rallied this week as pressure from rising treasury yields lets up somewhat and investors speculate the federal reserve may not have to be as aggressive about raising interest rates as earlier thought as it fights to control inflation the gains are a reprieve from wall street s tumble through most of the year caused by the fed s and other central banks slamming into reverse on the tremendous support fed into markets through the pandemic in hopes of beating down punishingly high inflation central banks have raised interest rates and made other moves that hurt prices for investments and threaten to slow the economy enough to cause a recession more such moves are sure to come it has been a good week said randy frederick managing director of trading derivatives at charles schwab it s rare at least in 2022 we ve had only a couple of weeks where we ended up net positive it looks pretty similar to what we saw right around the end of may and that one of course fizzled out the s p 500 rose 116 01 points to 3 911 74 the dow climbed 823 32 points to 31 500 68 the nasdaq rose 375 43 points to 11 607 62 smaller company stocks also rallied the russell 2000 rose 54 06 points or 3 2 to 1 765 74 parts of the u s economy are still red hot particularly the jobs market but some discouraging signals have emerged recently a report on friday confirmed sentiment among consumers sank to its lowest point since the university of michigan began keeping records hurt in particular by high inflation another lowlight this week suggested the u s manufacturing and services sectors aren t as strong as economists thought such weakening data raise worries about the strength of the economy but they also can be good for financial markets as paradoxical as that may seem they could mean less upward pressure on inflation which would ultimately mean the federal reserve doesn t have to raise rates so aggressively and interest rates drive trading for everything from stocks to cryptocurrencies we have seen a cooling off in a lot of areas certainly gasoline purchases are down housing prices appear to be cooling across the board frederick said to me all of this speaks to the fact what the fed is doing now appears to at least be having some impact now whether or not it s sufficient to bring inflation down i don t think we know yet

copper has entered a bear market which may indicate a stronger chance that recession is coming has entered a bear market which may indicate a stronger chance that is coming the metal which is an economic barometer fell 24 from its peak in may 2021 on friday advertisement copper has just tipped into a bear market and it s happened before each recession in the last 30 years which could indicate another economic downturn may be underway it s used in everything from electrics and electronics to construction meaning it s intertwined with the underlying global economy the benchmark london metal exchange copper price has now fallen 24 from its peak above 10 700 a tonne in may 2021 friday to trade at 8 255 a ton a fall of more than 20 from a previous peak is the technical definition of a bear market recessionary fears have picked up speed fueled by rapidly rising interest rates and red hot inflation with some of the world s biggest banks including goldman sachs morgan stanley and citi increasing their expectations of a recession hitting the us economy as the cost of food fuel and housing continue to squeeze the consumer copper is on track for a 19 decline in the three months from march to june making this its worst quarterly performance since the first quarter of 2020 which witnessed the depths of the coronavirus crisis these moves suggest that the market s sensitivity to recession risks has stepped up jane foley rabobank senior fx strategist said advertisement nomura a leading japanese investment bank also predicted the us economy would tip into a recession this year the fed lifted the benchmark interest rate three times faster than usual by 0 75 percentage points earlier this month as the us struggles in its war with inflation it was responding to data from the us consumer price index that showed inflation rose by 8 6 through may driven by a surge in energy prices most recently federal reserve chair jerome powell fanned the flames on the chance of recession saying it is not an intended outcome but is certainly a possibility at the same time he declined to rule out a 100 basis point interest rate hike while expressing his unconditional commitment to fighting inflation stocks have tumbled into bear market territory as have cryptocurrencies as investors have ditched assets that stand to lose from an environment of higher rates and inflation meanwhile dr copper which earned its nickname from what some believe is its tendency to gauge the health of the economy is suggesting those fears could become more of a reality given that it s fallen into a bear market in the run up to each of the last four recessions dating back to 1990 as the chart below shows advertisement for example the dotcome bubble burst in the early weeks of 2001 triggering a recession that would last through the remainder of that year but copper had already peaked in september 2000 and had already lost roughly 20 when the stock market started to tumble and economic growth slowed the market has become concerned about a slowing in global growth driven by fears surrounding chinese output and the headwinds to growth in europe rabobank s foley added bank of america strategists said it was worth noting how copper behaved in the last aggressive rate hike cycle of 1979 80 which also ended in recession copper did not decline wile rates were rising but the metal ultimately came under pressure when the economy contracted hence increased recession risks do matter they said read more buy these 13 cheap stocks that will outperform in a recession fuelled bear market according to morningstar advertisement
georgia power co wants to raise customer bills 12 over the next three years to pay for system improvements and higher costs and allow higher profits the company said friday in a rate filing with state regulators the filing kicks off a rate case before the georgia public service commission with the five commissioners likely to vote on the plan in december and new rates taking effect in january changes are likely before any vote a residential customer who uses 1 000 kilowatt hours of electricity per month pays georgia power an average of 128 a month now chief financial officer aaron abramovitz said friday under the plan that would rise by 14 32 in 2023 reaching a total of 16 29 over the three year period but those aren t the only price increases georgia power s 2 3 million customers could face next year the public service commission has already approved plans for the company to increase rates by 3 78 a month as soon as the first of two new nuclear units being built at plant vogtle come on line the company also will file next year to recover the cost of the coal and natural gas it uses to fuel its power plants and georgia power president and ceo chris womack acknowledged friday that the company is likely to file in february 2023 to raise bills to pay more for fuel but pledged to work with commissioners to mitigate and minimize the impact to our customers all that could lead to bills rising more than 15 for customers in 2023 alone too many georgians already struggle to pay their power bills said liz coyle executive director of consumer advocacy group georgia watch this new rate increase would add a significant burden to household budgets as has been traditional with regulated monopoly utilities georgia power s shareholders at the atlanta based southern co would be protected from risk and guaranteed a profit georgia power would collect an additional 2 8 billion over three years compared to a 1 77 billion cumulative increase in the current three year rate plan the company says it needs more money to keep making improvements to the transmission and distribution grid retire old coal plants acquire electricity from new sources and upgrade customer facing computer systems it wants nearly 100 million more each year just to cover inflation for what it has to buy and spend it s that balance recognizing for us to continue to make investments in our system to the reliability and resiliency that we need to operate the system and for a state that is growing in customers that have some growing expectations womack said about 750 million over three years would go to retire coal fueled power plants and buy power from natural gas plants solar and other sources of that amount about half would go to pay down the book value of the closed plants those moves are key parts of the company s long term generating plan which commissioners are likely to approve next month some parts of the rate case are aimed at paying for that integrated resource plan the company would collect 400 million over three years to cap or excavate ash ponds at coal fueled power plants environmentalists want all the ash excavated and reburied in lined landfills which could cost even more the company also says it needs more money because it has used up tax benefits from a previous federal tax cut that held down rates by 220 million a year georgia power is also seeking to raise its target return on equity a number that helps drive company profits from 10 5 to 11 the utility argues that it should get a higher rate of return because of what other utilities make and the current state of financial markets that would cost customers an additional 94 million a year some costs would go down georgia power says it needs to collect less to pay for storm damage because it has now paid for the costs of recovering from prior storms and less to pay for operations and maintenance as it closes older power plants the proposal is heavily frontloaded with only small increases sought in 2024 and 2025 company officials said that would actually mean lower rate increases overall because if they deferred some of the total request until later years rates would have to climb even higher to collect the same amount of money in a shorter time what we re trying to present here what we re requesting is the lowest cost option for customers understanding that this is just the start of this process abramovitz said

author amitrajeet a batabyal menafn the conversation why are some nations rich and others poor can the governments of poor nations do something to ensure that their nations become rich these sorts of questions have long fascinated public officials and economists at least since adam smith the prominent scottish economist whose famous 1776 book was titled an inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations economic growth matters to a country because it can raise living standards and provide fiscal stability to its people but getting the recipe consistently right has eluded both nations and economists for hundreds of years as an economist who studies regional national and international economics i believe that understanding an economic term called total factor productivity can provide insight into how nations become wealthy growth theory it is important to understand what helps a country grow its wealth in 1956 massachusetts institute of technology economist robert solow wrote a paper analyzing how labor otherwise known as workers and capital otherwise known as physical items such as tools machinery and equipment can be combined to produce goods and services that ultimately determine people s standard of living solow later went on to win a nobel prize for his work one way to increase a nation s overall quantity of goods or services is to increase labor capital or both but that doesn t continue growth indefinitely at some point adding more labor only means that the goods and services these workers produce is divided between more workers hence the output per worker which is one way of looking at a nation s wealth will tend to go down similarly adding more capital such as machinery or other equipment endlessly is also unhelpful because those physical items tend to wear out or depreciate a company would need frequent financial investment to counteract the negative effect of this wear and tear in a later paper in 1957 solow used u s data to show that ingredients in addition to labor and capital were needed to make a nation wealthier he found that only 12 5 of the observed increase in american output per worker the quantity of what each worker produced from 1909 to 1949 could be attributed to workers becoming more productive during this time period this implies that 87 5 of the observed increase in output per worker was explained by something else total factor productivity solow called this something else technical change and today it is best known as total factor productivity total factor productivity is the portion of goods and services produced that is not explained by the capital and labor used in production for example it could be technological advancements that make it easier to produce goods another way to understand total factor productivity it s best to think of total factor productivity as a recipe that shows how to combine capital and labor to obtain output specifically growing it is akin to creating a cookie recipe to ensure that the largest number of cookies that also taste great are produced sometimes this recipe gets better over time because for example the cookies can bake faster in a new type of oven or workers become more knowledgeable about how to mix ingredients more efficiently will total factor productivity continue to grow in the future given how important total factor productivity is to economic growth asking about the future of economic growth is basically the same as asking whether total factor productivity will continue to grow whether the recipes will always get better over time solow assumed that tfp would grow exponentially over time a dynamic explained by the economist paul romer who also won a nobel prize for his research in this field romer argued in a prominent 1986 paper that investments in research and development that result in the creation of new knowledge can be a key driver of economic growth this means that each earlier bit of knowledge makes the next bit of knowledge more useful put differently knowledge has a spillover effect that creates more knowledge as it spills out despite romer s efforts to provide a basis for the assumed exponential growth of tfp research shows that productivity growth in the world s advanced economies has been declining since the late 1990s and is now at historically low levels there are concerns that the covid 19 crisis may exacerbate this negative trend and further reduce total factor productivity growth recent research shows that if tfp growth falls then this can negatively affect living standards in the u s and in other rich countries a very recent paper by the economist thomas philippon analyzes a large amount of data for 23 countries over 129 years finding that tfp does not actually grow exponentially as solow and romer had thought instead it grows in a linear and slower progression philippon s analysis suggests that new ideas and new recipes do add to the existing stock of knowledge but they don t have the multiplier effect previous scholars had thought ultimately this finding means that economic growth used to be quite fast and is now slowing down but it s still occurring the u s and other nations can expect to get wealthier over time but just not as quickly as economists once expected
new york business wire jetblue nasdaq jblu today issued the following statement regarding the revised frontier spirit nyse save merger agreement we continue to believe jetblue s proposal is decisively superior to the frontier transaction even considering its revised terms and it continues to offer spirit shareholders significantly more value more cash more certainty and more regulatory protections jetblue offers 33 50 per spirit share in cash a very significant 38 1 premium to the implied market value of the amended frontier transaction also importantly the incremental 2 00 per spirit share offered by frontier are effectively being paid by spirit shareholders through their ownership in the combined company therefore resulting in only approximately 1 of incremental economic value we will more thoroughly review and assess the revised terms of the frontier spirit merger agreement and we intend to continue our vote no campaign against the inferior frontier transaction at the special meeting since our initial proposal was made public on april 5 spirit s share price performance has reflected its shareholders overwhelmingly positive view of our offer and their confidence in our ability to achieve regulatory clearance of the transaction an outcome which remains supported by outside regulatory experts analysis the conflicted spirit board continues to rely on a series of mischaracterizations to justify an inferior deal about the regulatory situation that is at odds with the views of outside experts that our transaction can get done about the northeast alliance despite the overwhelming facts supporting its pro competitive nature and about the impact of the changing industry environment including competition for pilots adding to these misrepresentations the spirit board is now claiming they have served their shareholders by accepting a revised frontier proposal an act which does not change the fundamental superiority of our transaction agreeing among other

perhaps more than any other woman marjorie dannenfelser is responsible for the fall of roe vs wade the president of susan b anthony pro life america a nonprofit group that works to end abortion in the united states by electing antiabortion politicians dannenfelser has dedicated her adult life to outlawing abortion in 2016 she played a key role in getting president trump to commit to appoint u s supreme court justices who oppose abortion the los angeles times asked dannenfelser 56 about the fall of roe her antiabortion journey and her strategy for outlawing abortion nationwide this interview has been edited for clarity and length susan b anthony pro life america president marjorie dannenfelser with former president trump andrew harnik associated press after decades working in antiabortion politics you are watching roe vs wade fall in what sense is this a historic moment it s the culmination of almost 50 years of work there was no certainty that this moment would come at all but every single time there s a failure or a setback this movement has grown and that is a marker of an authentic human rights movement it draws more in difficulty than it does in success sometimes you ve written no other issue however worthy carries a moral weight equal to that of the unborn child in the womb how did you get from being a pro choice republican to believing that abortion is about human rights not women s rights i grew up in fairly polite society you just didn t think or talk about this issue i think that polite society has kept the harsh reality of that human rights violation away from the public eye and from one individually so i never thought about it i knew that i would have if i needed one i just considered it part of living but that ability to keep what an abortion is out of your thoughts out of your mind when i approach the reality of what the object of the abortion is and then what happens in an abortion i mean it is really hard to ignore the reality of a procedure that tears a small human apart limb from limb it s that imagining the too horrible to imagine that finally set my thoughts in process in college at duke i started pre med and ended up in philosophy i had a lot of friends who were very pro life they showed a movie on campus the silent scream narrated by dr bernard nathanson a prolific abortionist who changed his mind to being pro life he showed an abortion through a sonogram and you could see what was happening i remember i was like that is just insulting i am not going to watch that but i had these conversations with people peppering me with difficult questions what happens in an abortion what is the object like if you re getting your appendix out that s the object if you re getting your tonsils taken out that s the object what is the object in an abortion taking stock of the last few decades how was roe undone what were the key turning points how pivotal was 2016 when you got president trump to commit to nominating justices who opposed abortion all of a sudden in jan 22 1973 there is a need for a huge movement because every single pro life law has been wiped off the books by the supreme court so we required some sort of strategy quick without any grass roots just a handful of people so that first wave was figuring out oh we need a movement and what do we do in the second wave the movement started to grow it built pregnancy help centers trying to reach women to help them at that moment in their lives there were all sorts of education campaigns the organic movement grew and grew but silently in communities and towns and churches all over the country then in 2012 came the third wave we decided to very strategically put this at the center of politics prove the case that this is not only the right thing to do but the politically smart thing to do by drawing a contrast between what the other side has achieved absolute abortion on demand up into the end paid for by everybody versus what our candidates were advocating for some compromise like a 20 week limit such a limit has massive support in every demographic except for the most hardcore left we started to ask presidential candidates to make a pledge of action with the pledge it became a primary debate among all the republican primary candidates who s the most pro life that s exactly what you want then when it came to trump the commitment from him because there was so much doubt about who he was and what he would do was vital it really came down to a letter from him to me in the pro life movement pledging what he would do concretely if he were the president of the united states so many people didn t take it seriously because nobody thought he was gonna win but he did you attribute part of your success to compromise promoting 20 week limits but surely your ultimate goal isn t compromise it s to outlaw abortion across the united states you ve spoken privately with possible republican presidential contenders including trump about a federal ban now the door is open so of course we will walk through it after nearly 50 years this is an opportunity to allow the people to speak through their laws through their elected representatives and so every legislature in the country including congress is now entrusted with this really heavy moral weight to get it right and so we will be as ambitious for life and for mothers in every single state as consensus will allow we will build broad support for the most protective laws for unborn children and assistance for their mothers in every single state that s about 30 states where it s in play and 20 where there s very little chance and it would require federal legislation but it s the same approach for the u s congress which is not alabama it s very complicated and it requires a president and a congress that can utter the word compromise what do you say to the many women who will now take to the streets to protest upset that the government is making a decision for women that violates their bodily autonomy peace is going to be found when we as a country serve women as they deserve to be served we don t make them choose or we don t influence them to choose one over the other we serve both woman and child and serving them both is going to require a lot out of us i believe that we can do it together we now face abortion outlawed or severely restricted in 26 states with women traveling to blue states or managing their own abortions how do you expect the battle to play out in the coming weeks and months i expect there will be immediate trigger laws or formerly passed laws that will be allowed to go into effect right away it might take a few days but there will be certainly quite a number of states that ll have laws on the books that reflect what the state actually voted on but then there are about eight states where it s going to be far more protracted in kansas there s a constitutional restriction on pro life laws so we have a ballot initiative in august asking the question will kansans be allowed to make their own law on this issue with polls showing about six out of 10 americans oppose overturning roe do you anticipate that there ll be a major backlash for republicans in november no not based on that that statistic tells you very little because the american public doesn t understand what roe is also the polls show that people want restrictions that roe does not allow during the debates when these elections center around what the will of the people is then we win the majority of democrats think that abortion should be restricted to just the first trimester that is absolutely completely contradictory of roe v wade there is only one place that the abortion lobby will allow its candidates to go and that is every abortion up until the end paid for by you and me that s it but have you really won the argument with the public your critics argue that your victory was achieved by pushing a president who did not win the popular vote to appoint supreme court justices roe was a conversation ended a complete cap on the ability to do something by the supreme court that was not winning over anybody s opinion that was saying your opinion counts for nothing now is a moment when your opinion counts for something and when you look at what we know about what people think already we know that most of the argument is already won abortion after the first trimester is rejected in certainly every battleground state but your aim is to see abortion banned across america in states such as california and new york well if you think that every abortion is the death of a child like i do you definitely want to save every child and serve every mother among antiabortion groups is there consensus on the path forward what are the key debates within your movement there is more unity in this movement now than i ve ever seen but there used to be one front in this battle now there are 51 and if you include the territories even more and so the wheels of democracy are spinning in each state there s a different blueprint on the national and state level i have a job to do and that is answering the question how ambitious can we be here and what do we need to do to reach that ambition do you think states should do more to criminalize abortions by prosecuting people who help women travel to other states or access medication abortions what about prosecuting women themselves never will i support prosecuting women susan b anthony talked about the evil that abortion is and that the answer is to get to the root causes the root causes are the people that are feeding off our misery the people who exploit our situation for money and the people who circumvent the law by sending pills in the mail that is a rico violation and those are the people that we will go after when you conspire to break the law you deserve to be penalized you deserve to have your medical license taken away you deserve to have your corporate privileges suspended that will never be on the back of the woman who needs and deserves more than she s receiving from this group of people who give her one thing when she s in crisis a pill and a lonely room with no help no doctor supervision no real plan for what will happen if she hemorrhages you ve done all this work to stop women from getting abortions what are you doing to help women in red states who get pregnant and may not have the financial resources and support to care for their children we ve been working on a particular program for the last few years i ve talked to so far 22 governors about the need to meet women where they are and make sure that we are comprehensive in how we serve them what we ve done so far with our allies in four states and hope to do in 30 in four years is comprehensive and massive inventories to make sure that women and children in the first two years of the child s life have access to seven different points of care they include serving her if she is addicted serving her if she has no housing serving her and her child if she has no healthcare or childcare serving what her particular needs are without taking the life of her child affirming her life and affirming the life of her child by believing in her and helping her build instead of undermining her life this story originally appeared in los angeles times

june 14 2022 chris hill today we ve got morgan housel doing what he does best looking at financial history and drawing lessons for today motley fool money starts now i m chris hill and i am joined by motley fool senior analyst bill mann thanks for being here bill mann hey chris how re you hill i d be doing better if the market was going higher but in that sense i have a lot of company don t i we would all be doing a little bit better if the market was going higher mann yes exactly i guess the good news is that you re not necessarily wondering what you have done wrong hill no that is true so that is some solace i wanted to get your thoughts on just stepping back i mean sure we could talk about oracle s earnings if you really want to but i m more interested in bill mann s big picture view of where things are right now because something jason and i had talked about yesterday was the level of pessimism in the market right now i don t want to say it s unfounded because when you have smart people like jamie dimon coming out and saying i think there is an economic hurricane coming and the only question is how bad it s going to be and by the way we re going to be doing x y and z with our balance sheet we are going to be more conservative if there s a lot of pessimism out there at least it s grounded in something let s stick with pessimism for just one second do you look at the commentary do you look at the reaction and some of the comments from maybe not jamie dimon but noted investors do you think it s in line with your thinking because there are some people out there saying hey look this is bad and i think it s going to get a lot worse mann it s amazing to me that you bring up jamie dimon in his comments right out of the gate because jamie dimon joined a ceo roundtable he s told the story a number of times in his early teens one of the first things that he did was the ceo roundtable they all got together and talked about what s this next year going to look like jamie dimon went through the process and you would think that ceos know more than anybody else he just had some researchers go back and say ok they have done this for every single year let s go back and see how accurate they were in their prognostications chris you would not be surprised to hear that they were not very accurate they were not very good at prognosticating the people who you would think and they re in a semi private room they re not talking to the public they re talking to each other they re not very good about prognosticating now i look at what s happening now and yes jamie dimon came out and he said i see a hurricane coming he is at a structurally important bang up financial institution so yes he sees the sheet music that s being handed to him but if we were better at prognosticating do you think that the s p 500 would have only been allocated 2 to energy companies in 2021 if we were good at seeing what was coming we re not we re not good at seeing what s coming hill sorry to get personal but are you doing anything with your cash right now something jason and i talked about yesterday was putting money to work slowly i ll just say in my own financial life earlier this year when the market dropped what i thought was a decent amount i looked at some of the really stable sustainably profitable businesses that their shares looked like they were on sale to me and in some cases they were companies like microsoft and johnson johnson and apple and that sort of thing i thought ok i m going to buy some more shares of those to a company they ve basically fallen further i don t know i m one of those people who s like i think i m holding on to my cash for right now what are you doing with your money mann i actually have been investing one thing that s really important to recognize is that the price you pay is a form of risk the higher the price of any company if you can buy it at 10 a share versus 20 a share it is essentially the same company if you buy something at a higher price you are essentially even if it doesn t feel like it at the moment taking on more risk the inverse of that is now that you have companies that are down 60 70 80 some of them are dramatically the same companies some of these companies should have never been priced as high as they were and will probably never come back but what s happening right now somebody who lives in an emerging market would be very comfortable with what s happening right now because everything s getting sold every asset class bonds are being sold sovereigns are being sold commodities are being sold and stocks are being sold that is something that people in developing markets are very happy about but they re comfortable with that type of indiscriminate selling suggests to me that we should in fact be looking at the other side of the risk equation and buy i think it s really easy for people to say well the stock s down 90 so therefore it must be cheap some of these companies are never coming back but i have a hard time believing that berkshire hathaway which i had bought some a few weeks ago is really that deeply impacted or mastercard or google or domino s pizza these are companies that are incredible at making money over the cycle and news flash we have not cured the economic cycle over the cycle these companies will continue to make a lot of money the last i checked that s the point of investing hill it s tuesday morning as you and i are having this conversation i think it s reasonable to say that if not all eyes are on the federal reserve most eyes are on the federal reserve the meeting and the likelihood of a rate hike coming later this week are you watching that and if not what are you watching to give you a better sense of where the economy is going in the near term mann i mean i think it s interesting what s happening and what we re going through right now is fairly unprecedented in some ways right now goes over the last decade but also what s happening right now is the last four days or the last six months our economy is obviously struggling but we re also seeing inflation usually when you have an economy that s struggling in the way that ours is now both united states and globally the federal reserve or central banks are going to step in and add liquidity but because we ve got an inflationary environment and it is dangerous they are having to continue to raise rates which does not bode well for asset pricing but asset pricing ultimately at the end of the day is not the horse that leads the economic cart i mean it is actually the opposite so for me what we re seeing right now is the backslide not just of two years of an incredible amount of liquidity being put into the market but almost 15 years going back to 2008 i mean we ve gone through a decade in which sovereign debt around the world in 2020 17 trillion of it traded at a negative rate which meant that if you held the debt you paid for the privilege this is prior to 2015 that was a unicorn sighting so we are coming out of what has been one of the strongest economic periods in world history not just our lifetimes i m talking a thousand years of actual centralized financial systems it just bears remembering that when you come out of something that s weird those weird things are going to happen on the backside i ve been buying stocks i m not particularly convicted about it if you were to tell me that the market was going to go down another 40 i d say nah people are out there still spending six figures on a weird picture of a monkey that s got some code behind it so who really knows but i do know right now that the fed is fighting something that was a natural outcome of some real financial stress and at the end of it we will hit an equilibrium hill last thing and then i ll let you go you had mentioned that some of these companies are not coming back you and i have talked before on this show about the spacs that just littered the markets last year and the year before certainly now we look at some of them as public companies and think now ok yeah you probably shouldn t have mann you were a money grab hill this was money grabbing and you probably have no business being in the public markets i forget who said it but i heard someone say recently that asked the question the rhetorical question who in god s name would go public in this environment right now are ipos something that you look at as a positive sign somewhere whether it s later this year or into 2023 because it really does seem like we went through a long stretch of time where we didn t really collectively ask the question about any company going public why are they going public we just thought oh ok here s a company going public it seems like bill we re in an environment right now where if a company were going public that would be the first thing we would ask like really you re going public now in this mann the crazy thing is i don t really care that much about ipos just because i like them so much i think i like so much understanding how a management team is going to interact and behave as a publicly traded entity i don t care what people say it is an entirely different experience to have the public facing you on a quarter by quarter basis from when you were a private company the thing is chris there are hundreds of spacs that have been stood up as buckets of money that they have an egg timer they have to continue to bring companies public you re going to see additional companies come public i actually think that it is a little bit more of a target rich environment now you may see companies that are coming public through spacs because there is a mutually agreed but not expressed desperation between the two like we need the money you have the money let s do a thing and we ll deal with the consequences later you re going to see more companies come public i tend to think of times like the spac bubble so many companies coming public you have to remember that they re not doing that for the benefit of investors they re doing it at a point in time in which it is good for them the fact that it is a much more difficult time to go public may actually mean that it is a better time to be on our side of the ledger and be buyers of stocks hill i m sorry but your spac analogy just immediately brought to mind bartenders as last call and two people just look at each other and all right why don t we go home together mann i m sorry we haven t been stupid enough yet but there s just enough time hill bill mann always great talking to you thanks for being here mann thanks chris hill in the wake of stocks falling this year we decided to look back at other market crashes from history a few years back morgan housel joined alison southwick and robert brokamp to talk about the speculative boom that caused the great depression and how those lessons apply for investors today alison southwick let me set this stage for you it s the roaring 20s in the wake of world war i the nation s wealth more than doubled this means that a lot of people had enough money to become full blown consumers they could buy newfangled things like electric refrigerators and radios and lest we forget the model t in this prosperous america you could have anything except alcohol of course but the party didn t stop suddenly so today morgan joining us for our series this month looking at market crashes in the u s and why not start with the big one that great crash black tuesday but before we get into the actual crash what was life like leading up to the great depression morgan housel whenever people talked about what caused the great depression what caused the crash of 1929 it s always easy to point to one thing but then what caused that one thing that you can always keep going back in time and say what really caused all this to happen if we are talking about the great depression i d like to start with world war i something really important happened in world war i frederick lewis allen is a great historian who wrote history in the 1920s and 1930s he made this point that during world war i to finance the war they sold liberty bonds to average everyday americans not just wealthy people but everyday americans were buying liberty bonds to finance the war it was the first time that most americans had any experience with stockbrokers because stockbrokers up until that point only dealt with wealthy people and aristocrats and now it was every day trained conductors and farmers going in and talking to a stock broker to buy these liberty bonds because there s such a push of patriotism to buy these bonds because of that not only did people get their first taste of what it was like to work at a stockbroker but stockbrokers had to learn all kinds of new skills to sell to these average everyday people and high pressure sales tactics had like a needle there in security and get them to buy something that they really didn t need but the salesmen s job was to convince them that you needed this it was set up in the late nineteen teens this early dynamic of main street s affiliation with wall street that had no relationship before that that s where i think the seeds of the great depression were ultimately planted getting everyday people who didn t have a lot of money and had no sophistication no training or education getting them involved with wall street southwick but then they had no place to get educated either housel yeah southwick you re just going to have to trust this stockbroker guy housel that s the first seeds that were planted and then after world war i all the troops came home devastating period for the war and the economy instantly falls into a really deep recession really bad high deflation really high unemployment in the early 1920s frederick lewis makes this really interesting point i think that between the war and then the recession when people came home the people just got tired of being tired after like seven years of everything going wrong there was a period in the early and mid 1920s when people just said i m ready to have fun again we ve been dealing with a decade of everything going wrong between war and the recession i m ready to let loose and have fun again it was almost like the spark that he wrote about that in the early 1920s people were just ready to have fun and just let loose and a few other things happened at the same time that s really important leading up to the great depression just continue on with the stories of really awful things happening 1921 there was a really awful famine in russia and the united states wanted to do something about it the u s government set an artificially high price for the price of wheat and told farmers as much wheat as they can grow we will buy it from you at this inflated price the price of wheat at the time was i think 0 40 a bushel and the government said we will buy as much as you can grow at a 1 a bushel so that they can send it to russia to help break the famine you had all these farmers that overnight basically were minting money and planting as much wheat and corn as they could and making a fortune doing it by selling it the government it was so lucrative to be a farmer back then during this time because of these inflated prices that they had what were called suitcase farmers which were people from chicago and minneapolis who were maybe they were lawyers or insurance salesmen that would take the train into iowa and buy a small farm and grow wheat they come in with their suitcase maybe farmers on the weekend go home because you can make so much money doing it farming was such a big part of the economy back then that in the early 1920s when that started it was just a huge stimulus to the overall economy this big farming surplus was going on at the same time that you had people that were just ready to get back into having fun and helping grow the economy again and so it was like almost overnight in the early 1920s the us economy just took off like a rocket ship part of that was coming out of this recession in the early 1920s and then you combine that with this big farming stimulus and it was just boom off to the races because of the psychology at the time frederick lewis allen writes a lot about this at the time that these people were so ready to have fun again that you mix that excitement with that much extra money that was flowing around it was just a boom time in the 1920s and you mix optimism with a lot of money and people start making really bad decisions robert brokamp then if you also add in debt because a lot of people didn t have necessarily all the money to buy these new consumer goods or these investments but there were people who were willing to lend on money to do that back then the margin requirement to borrow money to buy investments was only 10 percent so if you want to buy a thousand dollars worth of stock you only need to put down a hundred bucks all that thing had to do is drop 10 percent and then you ve lost all the equity in that investment housel also during this period in 1920s two of i think the most important inventions of the 20th century the car and the radio were coming online for average everyday people and that just added to the sense of optimism of what we could do as a country what our potential was that completely changed american life in the span of a few years the car and the radio then you add all that together you have people who for the first time ever have connections to stockbrokers you have this big economic boom from farming then you have all this optimism coming from the airplane and the 1920s making a lot of people know the booming twenties or roaring twenties it was a great time for a lot of people that just led to a lot of excitement and over optimism and so led to in the late 1920s probably the biggest stock bubble that we ve ever seen that really took place in just like a year or two is really like 1928 and early 1929 that the market just went straight up just went parabolic and day after day after day stock prices for all companies were just going straight up and increased by several multiples just in the late 1920s to create a bubble that it s hard to measure it because earnings and whatnot weren t measured back then but probably much bigger than the 1999 stock bubble just completely detached from reality by 1929 southwick let s get to the actual bursting of the bubble housel what s interesting too is that it didn t happen in one day we talk about the crash of 1929 but that played out over a week and is basically three days in october of 1929 when the market fell about 12 each day consecutively i think putting that together rather than all happening at once having it spread out a little bit gave investors at the time i don t think it was asked traumatic as we would expect it to be today because it happened slower than say the crash of 1987 it just played out slowly and people were so accustomed to prosperity and rising stock prices that the 30 percent decline that happened in october was it a big deal of course did stockbrokers jump out the window literally yes there were accounts of that happening but i think people were so shocked and a 30 decline in the grand scheme of things isn t that huge in three days it s big but it s not that big a deal stock prices fell 20 percent in the us in 2011 there was still a pretty big sense of optimism at the time and herbert hoover who was president and andrew mellon who was secretary of treasury at the time made a big push in the media and newspapers to say business is sound the fundamentals are strong this is a temporary break as they called it back then but we re going to pull through this everything is ok and i think people bought it at the time as the month kept playing out into november and december of 1929 things stabilized and recovered a little bit and the big idea was that was it that was tough but things are going to move on and things are going to keep going there s a little bit of a rally after that but people really had no idea what was still to come southwick apparently yes so what was still to come and how are we going to suffer here housel even by mid 1930 most economists thought by looking around and what was happening that we were in a pretty bad recession but nothing more than that a pretty severe recession but nothing of historic terms it was the summer of 1930 and as we moved into 1931 that the banking system started cracking which was caused a lot by two things one all these investors with margin debt who were buying from banks were now defaulting on the debt that they were borrowing but also wheat prices and corn prices started plunging so then farmers who had been a big driver of the economic boom of the 1920s and had leveraged up with all debt to buy farm equipment whatnot were defaulting at record rates too back then the federal reserve worked in a different way they didn t bail out banks like they do today and more importantly the big thing was there was no fdic insurance so if your local bank was going down your life savings was going with it that began the bank runs of the early 1930s which is where things really started getting out of hand it peaked in 1932 and there was starting a wave of bank failures in 1932 and the big one actually was a bank in austria called creditanstalt in vienna that was a huge bank in austria and it failed overnight and no one really saw it it coming there have been some economists who ve mapped this how it happened after creditanstalt failed in vienna then it spread to paris and then spread to london and then eventually spread to new york there was a bank called the knickerbocker trust in the united states that failed in new york and after that the curtain just came down southwick knickerbocker that s like the most perfect name for a failing bank in 1920s you couldn t write that housel after the banks started failing that s where things started getting really ugly in the united states now we re into 1932 so we re three years after the crash of 1929 which i think to me that s probably the biggest misconception of the great depression is that there was a crash in 1929 and then boom welcome to the great depression and it wasn t the first couple of years played out slowly over a period of many years if you think about the 2008 financial crisis the worst of that was really contained in literally a 90 day period in late 2008 september october and november and then it was pretty much over the great depression played out over three years and what i think did the opposite of what the 1920s did is that people just got accustomed to pessimism their hope vanished after you ve just been beaten up consistently for three years people just lose all their optimism and all their faith that feeds on itself because if businesses and employees and investors don t have any optimism and don t have any confidence then it s really hard to get them southwick nothing goes up housel the stock market bottomed in mid 1932 unemployment in the economy bottomed in 1933 four years after the crash southwick how do we recover how do we get out of this housel this is where things could get political and a lot of people still disagree with this 90 years later but franklin roosevelt is elected in 1932 and started with the new deal there s that element of it of economic stimulus from the new deal just changing tactics and whatnot there s also a thing with all recessions that if prices get low enough stock prices housing prices labor prices if things get low enough then it s attractive to get back in business every investment every business opportunity is attractive at some price and prices got ridiculous low and 1930s everywhere the price of labor the price of food by 1932 stock prices were down 89 from their 1929 peak so just completely obliterated but there are still a lot of good companies out there southwick you talked about the fdic did that come out of this what other legislation or regulation came out following the depression to keep this from happening again because it s obviously never going to have an again housel not going to let it southwick no it s only going to happen over the next three episodes of this podcast not this bad of course housel the few big ones besides fdic insurance one was the sec and a lot of the reason that the market grew so high in the 1920s is because fraud and bad behavior in the stock market was rapid one of the big actors during the 1920s who made a fortune ripping people off in the stock market was joseph kennedy jfk s father he made a fortune in the 1920s bringing together groups of investors and then they would corner a stock and put out false information and since they had a corner they could drive up the price and then once a rise in prices got other people excited then they would dump their shares back on them there was all this misbehavior in the stock market that was perfectly legal back then even though they were really taking advantage of vulnerable people with that came the sec and the punch line of the story is you know who the first chairman of the sec was joseph kennedy southwick same guy brokamp what was fdr s quote about that housel i forget brokamp something along the lines if you want to catch a bank robber you got to put him in charge something along those lines housel that was the other big thing besides the fdic was the sec southwick as we re winding down here what is your takeaway for investors what s one good lesson from the great depression that our listener should takeaway housel there is a lawyer during the great depression named benjamin roth who kept a really incredible diary he was a lawyer but he was an amateur investor too and an amateur economist a really smart guy his son published the biography i think five years ago it s called the great depression a diary it s really fascinating just to see a layman s perception of what happened during the depression he constantly writes about 1932 and 1933 he uses the same phrasing over and over again he says everyone knows stocks are cheap but nobody has any cash to buy them he just talked about it all over the place he says not just stocks he s talking about buildings and real estate and his neighbourhood there s a warehouse down the street that s selling for nothing but nobody has any cash to buy it he writes about the sense of all this opportunity that s lost and if anyone had any cash during that period they can mint a fortune there was just an opportunity laying right in front of them but no one had any cash saved up to me i used to write a blog right about this quite a bit when i was here at the motley fool people really discount cash as an asset when things are going well cash doesn t earn a good return why would you want to earn cash put your money to work it s not doing anything for you the value of cash is what it can do for you when things turn down and things eventually will that s what you earn your return on cash and so i ve always held more cash than i think any financial advisor would say is necessary but that s why i do it and i think i m earning a good return on my cash i m just not going to realize that return until things get hairy again hill as always people on the program may have an interest in the stocks they talk about that the motley fool may have formal recommendations for or against so don t buy or sell stocks based solely on what you hear i m chris hill thanks for listening we ll see you tomorrow

company offers private banking and wealth management solutions including advisory investment financial planning succession planning and trust services and financing and lending and multi shore platform solutions credit suisse has a history of business dealings with russian oligarchs or ultra high net worth business leaders possessing significant political influence for example an article published by financial times on february 7 2022 entitled credit suisse securitizes yacht loans to oligarchs and tycoons cited a recent investor presentation for a synthetic securitization deal in which credit suisse sold off 80 million worth of risk related to a 2 billion portfolio of loans backed by assets owned by certain of the bank s ultra high net worth clients the securitization deal which disclosed that in 2017 and 2018 credit suisse experienced 12 defaults on yacht and aircraft loans a third of which were related to u s sanctions against russian oligarchs press reports at the time indicated that russian billionaires oleg deripaska arkady rotenberg and boris rotenberg had to terminate private jet leases with credit suisse in those years beginning in or around october 2021 russia commenced a major military build up near the russo ukrainian border in apparent preparation for an invasion of ukraine although the russian government repeatedly denied it had plans to invade or attack ukraine the u s later released intelligence of russian invasion plans including satellite photographs showing russian troops and equipment near the russo ukrainian border in november 2021 as russia s military buildup on the russo ukrainian border continued the company entered the securitization deal just months later on february 24 2022 russian military forces invaded ukraine in the immediate aftermath of the invasion western governments including among others the u s canada and the european union imposed significant sanctions on russia the sanctions included inter alia measures targeting russia s ultrawealthy oligarchs by denying them access to the global financial system and by in some cases authorizing the seizure of certain of their high value assets located outside of russia barely a week after the commencement of the russian invasion and the retaliatory sanctions imposed by western nations news outlets reported that credit suisse had requested non participating investors who received information about the company s loan portfolio to destroy and permanently erase any confidential information that credit suisse provided to them regarding the securitization deal the complaint alleges that throughout the class period defendants made materially false and misleading statements regarding the company s business operations and compliance policies specifically defendants made false and or misleading statements and or failed to disclose that i credit suisse had deficient disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting ii credit suisse s practice of lending money to russian oligarchs subject to u s and international sanctions created a significant risk of violating rules pertaining to those sanctions and future sanctions iii the foregoing conduct subjected the company to an increased risk of heightened regulatory scrutiny and or enforcement actions iv the securitization deal concerned loans that credit suisse made to russian oligarchs previously sanctioned by the u s v the purpose of the securitization deal was to offload the risks associated with these loans and mitigate the impact on credit suisse of sanctions likely to be implemented by western nations in response to russia s invasion of ukraine vi credit suisse s request that non participating investors destroy documents related to the securitization deal was intended to conceal the company s noncompliance with u s and international sanctions in its lending practices vii the foregoing once revealed was likely to subject the company to enhanced regulatory scrutiny and significant reputational harm and viii as a result the company s public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times on march 28 2022 the u

private jets owned by clients potentially including sanctioned russian individuals in the letter house oversight chair carolyn maloney and rep stephen lynch chair of the subcommittee on national security questioned credit suisse s request that hedge funds and other non participating investors destroy documents related to yachts and private jets owned by the bank s clients given the timing of

stocks racked up more gains on wall street friday as the s p 500 had its best day in two years and just its second winning week in the last 12 to provide a bit of relief from the market s brutal sell off this year the benchmark index rose 3 1 percent with technology and banks leading the broad rally the s p 500 notched a 6 4 percent gain for the week erasing the brutal loss it took a week earlier though it s still close to 20 percent below its record set early this year the dow jones industrial average rose 2 7 percent and the tech heavy nasdaq ended 3 3 percent higher both indexes also posted a weekly gain that more than made up for their losses last week stocks rallied this week as pressure from rising treasury yields lets up somewhat and investors speculate the federal reserve may not have to be as aggressive about raising interest rates as earlier thought as it fights to control inflation the gains are a reprieve from wall street s tumble through most of the year caused by the fed s and other central banks slamming into reverse on the tremendous support fed into markets through the pandemic in hopes of beating down punishingly high inflation central banks have raised interest rates and made other moves that hurt prices for investments and threaten to slow the economy enough to cause a recession more such moves are sure to come it has been a good week said randy frederick managing director of trading derivatives at charles schwab it s rare at least in 2022 we ve had only a couple of weeks where we ended up net positive it looks pretty similar to what we saw right around the end of may and that one of course fizzled out advertisement the s p 500 rose 116 01 points to 3 911 74 the dow climbed 823 32 points to 31 500 68 the nasdaq rose 375 43 points to 11 607 62 smaller company stocks also rallied the russell 2000 rose 54 06 points or 3 2 percent to 1 765 74 parts of the u s economy are still red hot particularly the jobs market but some discouraging signals have emerged recently a report on friday confirmed sentiment among consumers sank to its lowest point since the university of michigan began keeping records hurt in particular by high inflation another lowlight this week suggested the u s manufacturing and services sectors aren t as strong as economists thought such weakening data raise worries about the strength of the economy but they also can be good for financial markets as paradoxical as that may seem they could mean less upward pressure on inflation which would ultimately mean the federal reserve doesn t have to raise rates so aggressively and interest rates drive trading for everything from stocks to cryptocurrencies we have seen a cooling off in a lot of areas certainly gasoline purchases are down housing prices appear to be cooling across the board frederick said to me all of this speaks to the fact what the fed is doing now appears to at least be having some impact now whether or not it s sufficient to bring inflation down i don t think we know yet advertisement one nugget in the consumer sentiment report could carry particular weight for markets it showed consumers expectations for inflation over the long run moderated to 3 1 percent from a mid month reading of 3 3 percent that s crucial for the fed because expectations for higher inflation in the future can trigger buying activity that inflames inflation further in a self fulfilling vicious cycle last week the fed hiked its key short term rate by the biggest margin in decades and said another such increases could be coming though they wouldn t be common over the last week investors have been modestly ratcheting back their expectations for how high the fed will hike interest rates into early next year that s helped yields in the treasury market recede the yield on the two year treasury which tends to move with expectations for the fed s actions dropped back to 3 06 percent from more than 3 40 percent in the middle of last week the yield on the 10 year treasury which forms the bedrock for the world s financial system rose to 3 13 percent on friday from 3 07 percent late thursday but it also has moderated after hitting 3 48 percent last week it started the year just a bit above 1 50 percent advertisement a separate economic report on friday showed sales of new homes unexpectedly accelerated last month but the trend for housing has largely been lower because it s at the leading edge of the fed s hikes more expensive mortgage rates are hurting the industry and a separate report earlier this week showed sales of previously occupied homes slowed last month rising mortgage rates pushed lendingtree the online marketplace that helps people find mortgages and other loans to warn friday that it expects to report
