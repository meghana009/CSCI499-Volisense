overall structure of the ktc the korea trade commission ktc is a quasi judicial agency in the ministry of trade industry and energy established under the act on the investigation of unfair international trade practices and remedy against injury to industry unfair trade investigation act utia for the purpose of protecting domestic industries from unfair international trade practices such as dumping subsidised importation and the infringement of ip rights the ktc is composed of one chairperson and eight commissioners and is supported in its administrative work by the office of trade investigation which consists of four divisions trade remedy policy division damage determination division dumping investigation division and unfair trade investigation division among the four the unfair trade investigation division handles unfair trade activities resulting from ip infringement the functions of the unfair trade investigation division are i to investigate unfair international trade practices such as the infringement of ip rights violation of rules of origin and other practices liable to disrupt good order in international trades and ii to investigate the impact of international trades on the competitiveness of domestic industries trade remedy measures trade remedy tr measures are means for protecting domestic industries under the wto agreements the utia and the customs act in cases where domestic industries are suffering or are likely to suffer serious injuries as a result of unfair international trade practices the injured parties may file a petition with the ktc seeking i levy of anti dumping duties ii imposition of countervailing duties iii implementation of safeguard measures or iv investigation of unfair international trade practices according to the statistics on tr measures there have been 598 petitions 180 for anti dumping duties 34 for safeguard measures and 384 for unfair international trade practice investigations filed for tr measures through may 2021 and the ktc decided to take tr measures for 294 petitions 133 for anti dumping duties 22 for safeguard measures and 139 for unfair international trade practice investigations figure 1 organisation of the ktc investigation of unfair international trade practice among the above tr measures the fourth type of tr measure i e investigation of unfair international trade practices is used against the exporting or importing of ip infringing goods as explained in detail below types of unfair international trade practices unfair international trade practices are defined under article 4 1 of utia as follows i infringement of ip rights by importing goods violating ip rights into korea selling such imported goods domestically exporting goods violating ip rights or manufacturing such goods domestically for export ii false or misleading markings of origin by exporting or importing goods whose marks of origin are false misleading damaged or modified or goods subject to origin markings but whose origins are not marked iii false or exaggerated markings of quality of exported imported goods and iv disrupting export import by exporting or importing goods significantly different from those detailed in the contract to cause disputes figure 2 investigation procedure procedure for unfair international trade practice investigation anyone may file a petition for the investigation of unfair international trade practices with the ktc within two years from the occurrence of the act of unfair international trade the ktc may also undertake an ex officio investigation if necessary when there is a reasonable suspicion of unfair international trade practices the petitioner should show that i the petitioner s ip rights remain valid and in force ii the petitioner s ip rights have been infringed by the respondent iii the respondent has conducted activities corresponding to the unfair trade practices e g exporting importing etc and iv the activities were conducted within two years prior to the filing of the petition any party who violates an order for temporary relief or corrective measures shall be punished by imprisonment of up to three years or a fine not to exceed 30 million won circumstantial evidence may be sufficient for initiating the investigation by the ktc since more concrete evidence on the infringing activities can be later supplemented by the request of the ktc to the korea customs service kcs the ktc shall decide whether to commence the investigation within 20 days from the date of filing article 5 of the utia in case there appears to be irrevocable harm or a likelihood of irrevocable harm caused by unfair trade activities the kitc may issue temporary relief in the form of cease and desist orders including injunctions against export manufacturing import sales of imported products and seizure exclusion orders against the products parts raw materials and or manufacturing facilities article 7 of the utia in this connection in order to discourage frivolous requests for temporary relief the petitioner is required to post a bond equivalent to the value of the expected sales amount of the infringing goods for a period of six months upon the grant of temporary relief article 8 of the utia the ktc shall promptly complete the investigation within six months from the commencement decision but the investigation period may be extended twice for up to four months i where a lawsuit or patent trial associated with the unfair international trade act under investigation is pending ii where the petitioner or the respondent requests an extension by presenting justifiable ground s and iii in other cases deemed necessary to extend the period for unavoidable reason s article 9 of the utia therefore it normally takes six to 10 months from commencement to reach a final decision corrective measures and penalties if there is a finding of unfair international trade practice the ktc may issue an order for corrective measures and or impose penalty surcharges the corrective measures include i cease and desist orders to stop activities of unfair international trade practice ii orders to prohibit entry into the market and destroy goods in stock iii orders to publish an apology advertisement iv orders to publicise the ktc s corrective orders and v other necessary measures to correct unfair international trade practices article 10 of the utia any party who violates an order for temporary relief or corrective measures shall be punished by imprisonment of up to three years or a fine not to exceed 30 million won approximately 26 115 article 40 2 of the utia the ktc may impose upon the relevant actors i a penalty surcharge not exceeding an amount equivalent to 30 of the annual transaction amount averaged for the recent three years when the unfair international trade practices involve activities of infringement of ip rights false or exaggerated markings of quality and disrupting export import and ii a penalty surcharge not to exceed 300 million won when the unfair international trade practices involve false or misleading markings of origin article 11 of the utia any party who objects to the ktc s disposition may raise an objection to the ktc within 14 days from the notification of such disposition in case of temporary relief or within 30 days from the notification of such disposition in case of corrective measures and penalty surcharge the ktc shall render a decision within 60 days from the opposition and this period may be extended for up to 30 days if the decision cannot be made due to unavoidable circumstances such as submissions of new evidence during the investigation the party who raises an objection may file an administrative appeal before the administrative court separately from the objection article 14 of the utic however the ktc decision is enforceable unless the court hearing the administrative action renders an order suspending the enforcement of the ktc decision until the outcome of its decision in the pending appeal case advantages of the ktc proceedings for ip infringement the ktc proceedings are often quick simple and cost effective since the petitioner can obtain the decision within about 10 months from the date of the commencement of the investigation in particular the ktc proceedings can be useful to secure early relief against the trafficking of goods infringing ip rights across the border although the rights holder may eventually have to initiate court proceedings to recover damages the ktc s corrective measure of a cease and desist order will have the same effect as a preliminary injunction and if it is not lifted during the appeal process will have the same effect as a permanent injunction once the ktc finds infringement of ip rights with respect to the accused goods an order of the ktc to prohibit entry into the market of the infringing goods can be effectuated to other parties dealing in the same goods regardless of the name of the provider importer or seller thereof through the simple procedure of having the ktc acknowledge that the goods dealt in by these entities are identical to the infringing goods in practice the ktc requests the kcs to provide information on the imported amount of the accused goods during its investigation therefore such information is useful in determining the amount of monetary damages in a future main action the customers of the accused product who wish to receive a stable supply of such goods will be definitely affected by the prompt and strong effect of the ktc decision example cases here are some example cases involving ip rights infringement for which an investigation of unfair international trade practice was carried out and an order for corrective measures was issued by the ktc bath stool case patent and design infringement the petitioner the owner of a patent and a design right on a bath stool filed a petition for an unfair international trade practice investigation with regard to the respondent s activities of importing from taiwan bath stools allegedly infringing its patent and design rights the ktc decided to initiate the investigation and carried out a review of relevant documents evidence as well as on site inspections for about four months the ktc found that the respondent s activities constituted the unfair international trade practice of infringing the petitioner s patent and design rights and issued an order to cease the export import of the accused goods destroy the accused goods and publicise the ktc s disposition of corrective measures january 30 2018 gel pen case copyright infringement the petitioner is a copyright holder for fruits rabbit characters which are rabbit figures featured with fruit shaped ears and the respondents imported from china gel pens characterised by rabbit figures with fruit shaped ears the ktc conducted an investigation for six months and rendered a decision that the respondents importation of gel pens constituted an unfair international trade practice by infringing the petitioner s copyright the ktc ordered the respondents to cease export import of the accused goods and publicise the ktc s disposition of corrective measures and also imposed penalty surcharges december 11 2019 snack case trademark infringement the petitioner owns a registered trademark for a snack formed by a combination of two words written in a unique font type the respondents manufactured a similar snack in korea and exported same to vietnam under similar trademarks the ktc carried out an investigation for six months and

constituted unfair international trade practice the ktc ordered the respondents to cease exporting the goods as well as manufacturing the goods for the purpose of exportation destroy the goods in stock and publicise the ktc s disposition of corrective measures and also imposed penalty surcharges february 6 2020 click here to read all the chapters from asia pacific ip focus 2021 kye young lee

by nectar gan and steve george cnn the chaotic us withdrawal from afghanistan has presented beijing with a propaganda boost with chinese state media capitalizing on the crisis to trumpet the supposed decline of america and taunt taiwan with threats of invasion the jingoistic rhetoric coincided with air and naval drills launched tuesday by the chinese military which sent fighter jets and warships near taiwan in response to what it called the repeated collusion in provocation by washington and taipei in recent years china s ruling communist party has sought to present the us as a fading global power and now the return of the taliban to the streets of the afghan capital is being touted by state media as the death knell of us hegemony the fall of kabul marks the collapse of the international image and credibility of the us a commentary from state news agency xinhua said monday following the blows of the global financial crisis and the covid 19 pandemic the decay of the american hegemony has become an undisputed reality its failure in afghanistan is another turning point in that spiral fall it added the global times a state run nationalist tabloid meanwhile has repeatedly played up what it described as the unreliability of us commitment to its allies suggesting the self governing island of taiwan could face the same fate as afghanistan in the event of conflict with china taiwan and mainland china have been governed separately since the end of a civil war more than seven decades ago in which the defeated nationalists fled to taipei but the chinese communist party views taiwan a democratic island of around 24 million people as an inseparable part of its territory despite having never controlled it once a war breaks out in the taiwan straits the island s defense will collapse in hours and the us military won t come to help the global times said in an editorial monday arthur ding an international relations professor at national chengchi university in taipei called beijing s propaganda messaging on afghanistan cheap psychological warfare noting it was intended to convey the us alleged unreliability especially to taiwan s more receptive opposition supporters who favor closer ties with beijing for decades an uneasy status quo governed cross strait relations but under president xi jinping china has increased military activity around the island in response to what it considers to be growing calls for formal independence perhaps unsurprisingly discussions have broken out across taiwanese social media in recent days as to how the government in taipei would respond in the event of a chinese invasion and whether the us would indeed come to the island s defense so much so that on tuesday taiwan s premier publicly stressed the island would not collapse like afghanistan if invaded in a press conference premier su tseng chang appeared to confront the chinese threats directly saying taiwan s leaders are not afraid of being killed or imprisoned by powerful countries that want to swallow up taiwan using force politicians in taiwan s ruling democratic progressive party ddp also dismissed attempts to draw parallels between taiwan and afghanistan saying such comparisons are inherently fraught if we re going to make afghan comparisons taiwan survived that moment 40 years ago us troops left taiwan in 1979 after recognizing the prc wen lii a local ruling party official wrote on twitter referring to china by abbreviation of its official name the people s republic of china so no taiwan is not afghanistan he added kolas yotaka spokesperson for taiwan s presidential office said the lazy comparisons ignore the realities of both countries and show little regard for the immense human suffering facing many in afghanistan today despite formally switching diplomatic recognition from taipei to beijing the us has remained a staunch ally of taiwan supplying the island with defensive weaponry under the terms of the decades old taiwan relations act including a proposed 750 million arms sale announced earlier this month in april us president joe biden dispatched an unofficial delegation to taiwan in a show of support for the island according to a senior administration official and a state department spokesperson the state department also announced in april that the agency had issued new guidelines for us government interaction with taiwan counterparts to encourage us government engagement with taiwan that reflects our deepening unofficial relationship on tuesday china s people s liberation army pla conducted joint fire assault and other drills using actual troops off the southwest and southeast of taiwan according to a statement from the pla s eastern theater command recently the us and taiwan have repeatedly colluded in provocation and sent serious wrong signals severely infringing upon china s sovereignty and severely undermining peace and stability in the taiwan strait the statement said it is a solemn response to external interference and provocations by taiwan independence forces though many have speculated the abrupt announcement of the pla drills was likely timed to accompany beijing s propaganda messaging on afghanistan carl schuster a former director of operations at the us pacific command s joint intelligence center said the scale of the drills suggested some degree of prior planning rather than being tied to a specific event the cnn wire 2021 cable news network inc a warnermedia company all rights reserved cnn s brad lendon contributed reporting
hancock county there s a growing feeling in people s guts according to the leader of the county s board of commissioners that the national covid 19 guidance getting passed down from experts should be done away with in favor of a more localized approach john jessup president of the hancock county commissioners shared his thoughts on the subject as mt vernon s school board indicated its intention to stick with its original sources of direction monday night we all pick our own experts jessup said including the current u s president and presidents before him choosing dr anthony fauci an immunologist serving as the director of the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases and the chief medical adviser to the president fauci supports practices like masking quarantining and vaccinating in the fight against covid 19 as do the centers for disease control and prevention indiana health department the hancock county health department and hancock regional hospital when dr fauci stands up on tv and feeds us all these lines of bull that we ve been hearing for 18 months we get that feeling in our gut jessup said at the school board meeting it s a spiritual thing you feel it in your gut something ain t right here something ain t right about what we re doing to our children something ain t right about what we re doing to our economy he added he didn t have that feeling when dr dan stock a noblesville based functional medicine physician spoke at mt vernon s board meeting earlier this month about what he described as the futility of masking quarantining and vaccinating against the novel coronavirus and i m not defending him or saying his studies are better than others but i didn t have that feeling in my gut jessup continued adding he felt stock made sense and raised issues he had been wondering about it s not that he feels federal and state guidance shouldn t be considered jessup told the daily reporter after the meeting but that he wishes to choose local experts he knows and trusts and that he feels many others in the community do too all these people including myself love the community he said we love hancock county and even though we re going to make mistakes from time to time our mistakes are going to have less of a negative impact than the mistakes that are going to be made by people in indianapolis people in washington that don t love our community he didn t provide specific examples of what he feels are fauci s failings but that he feels the practices the doctor has advocated throughout the pandemic have lacked consistency i feel like over time he s lost a lot of credibility in a lot of people s minds jessup said reiterating that much of the state and federal directives have created feelings in people s guts that the guidance isn t right and doesn t make sense but they re the experts we just have to go along with this stuff and do it even though there s something telling us this doesn t make the most sense in the world

recovery to pick up speed through to 2022 hipple said that savvy long term investors would shy away from oil and gas majors unless and until they fully acknowledge the climate crisis these investors understand that the oil majors are still investing tens of billions in unnecessary oil and gas infrastructure ignoring the iea findings that no additional infrastructure is possible to meet a 1 5

revenues for their earnings a concept that is irreconcilable to the demands of the climate emergency we frankly just don t think these are very good businesses david moss head of european equities at bmo global asset management told cnbc s street signs europe on friday european energy majors are currently generating very strong cash flow following a sustained rebound in oil prices moss said but noted that many are choosing to keep spending relatively tight rather than invest in future production projects with the oil companies we still just don t think they represent good long term businesses moss said they don t generate consistent returns on capital or cash flow albeit at the moment they look to be in a pretty good place not everyone is as downbeat on the outlook for the oil and gas industry however rohan reddy analyst at global x a new york based provider of exchange traded funds says there are currently a number of positive signs for energy majors citing rising stock prices an upswing in second quarter earnings and increased shareholder distributions right now the energy sector is the best performing one within the s p 500 and many european markets and even though some of the big majors like bp and shell have lagged the broader energy sector we think right now that s just due to hesitancy around the delta variant reddy told cnbc on aug 11 we think there is going to be a lot more investors starting to pile into to some of those big energy names

the following lecture was delivered at the socialist equality party us 2021 summer school held august 1 through august 6 by eric london a writer for the world socialist web site and author of agents the fbi and gpu infiltration of the trotskyist movement all of the major reports to the school will be published on thewswsin the coming days introduction on january 6 2021 the president of the united states transformed the white house into the command center of a fascistic plot to overturn the results of the election this was the reactionary crescendo of a presidential administration unlike any other in american history for the first three years of his term donald trump danced back and forth over the blurred line that separates the formal trappings of bourgeois parliamentarism from personalist dictatorship he attempted to force his democratic and republican rivals to bend to his will by threatening to unleash his supporters and trigger social chaos president donald trump speaks from the south lawn of the white house on the fourth day of the republican national convention thursday aug 27 2020 in washington ap photo alex brandon he was tolerated and even encouraged by finance capital because his movement was a battering ram for extreme political reaction against the working class he moved from crisis to crisis like a mad pyrotechnic sitting on a mountain of dynamite directing the entire political establishment further and further to the right in his last year in office trump stopped dancing to and fro over the line of dictatorship and resolved to cross it definitively the coronavirus pandemic triggered a series of crises that forced his hand his popularity never high to begin with fell to new lows from the spring of 2020 to january 2021 as deaths piled up as the economy shut down and as social discontent exploded onto the streets trump was engaged in an ongoing effort to invoke the insurrection act impose martial law and remove whatever legal and political restraints remained on his actions he now aims to transform the republican party into a fascist party under his personal control the democrats in alliance with the military and intelligence agencies have worked to control social opposition to his policies while pressuring him from the right on foreign policy what the world socialist web site wrote throughout this period has been proven correct trump s plot was stopped for the time being not by the democrats but by the intervention of the military which said it would not accept martial law not yet the democratic party opposed making any mass appeal because doing so would trigger demands for social reform even when the democratic party s entire congressional delegation was huddled in the basement of the us capitol their appeals for salvation were still made in private to the military alone they will not defend democratic rights even when their lives depend on it the military for its part did not intervene in defense of democracy but to maintain stability and law and order the institution which is pulling out of iraq and afghanistan dripping in the blood of over a million civilians becomes kingmaker at home when the chairman of the joint chiefs mark milley said we re the guys with the guns this was not just a statement of fact about the present balance of power but a warning for the future the democrats have pushed the military forward as chief arbiter of political power in a court of law it would not be difficult to prove that trump possesses the intent the mens rea to carry out a coup after all he states his aims openly and on a regular basis nevertheless after having watched these events take place before their very eyes and after having listened to trump s own words the political representatives of the affluent middle class scoff at the suggestion that dictatorship was even a remote possibility they neither see evil nor hear evil but that doesn t stop them from speaking it twenty years ago they shrugged off the clinton impeachment scandal as unimportant and described the 2000 election crisis as a tempest in a teapot today they raise a number of pathetic arguments the state is far too strong the social order far too stable for a coup to take place trump is too stupid too much of an improviser to organize one a coup takes place only if it follows the script of past coups to the line like a stage production the set must feature tanks in the streets the assassination of heads of state a march on rome in their pathological complacency and their desperate desire to be rescued from the class struggle they become hostile to alerting the working class of the dangers of the coup even when the coup s directors producers and the star himself recycle scenes from hitler s theater and recite his soliloquies this is the response of a social layer that has nothing to add to the progressive development of humankind thirty years ago the petty bourgeois left declared farewell to the working class and concluded that the dissolution of the soviet union proved the unviability of marxism for all time the american ruling class proclaimed with beaming self confidence the end of history that capitalism had vanquished socialism and that american imperialism was ushering in a new world order of social stability based on the principles of liberal democracy today it is universally understood even by representatives of the big bourgeoisie that this declaration was positively delusional the guarantor of world order is now its chief source of chaos american democracy which presented itself as a model for the world now leads the way in a global resurgence of fascism the world s policeman did not bring order and harmony but war and a resurgence of inter imperialist conflict us imperialism destroyed entire societies in search of world domination only to weaken its own position and tear its own society apart sections of the american petty bourgeoisie that once believed in its american dream are now susceptible to hitlerian nightmares what was once the confident bulwark of world reaction against socialism abroad now promotes a strongman to crush the danger of socialism at home as only the trotskyist movement foresaw american imperialism is having its rendezvous with disaster the present juncture poses real dangers but also has profoundly revolutionary implications which tendency prevails will be determined by the intervention of our party so how did this all come to be who is donald trump donald trump was spat out after a half century of political reaction during the decline of american capitalism s post war boom if theodore dreiser were to describe trump s life he would explain that trump personifies a ruling class that is unimaginably wealthy extremely ruthless and shockingly backwards it is fitting that the story of trump s family fortune begins in a whorehouse in the yukon territory which his grandfather friedrich an émigré from rhineland palatinate in southwest germany set up in the late 1890s to provide the miners of the klondike gold rush with liquor and prostitutes it was all downhill from there trump s grandfather moved to new york where trump s father fred a fascist who praised hitler and marched with the kkk made the family s first millions born in 1946 donald trump s rise as a young man was made possible through draft dodging his father s money large and regular donations to both political parties an army of lawyers and decades of desperate and tasteless self promotion he idolized his mentor roy cohn his only true friend who served as joe mccarthy s attorney and was a driving force in the anti communist witch hunts of the 1950s trump swindled his way into adulthood through the corporate bonanza of the 1980s in the era of ronald reagan he was held up by the media establishment as the living icon of the god of american moneymaking in the time of capitalist triumphalism trump was an apt representative of american capitalism in its period of decline he tore down historically protected buildings replaced them with monstrosities and put his name on top in 1987 the stalinists invited him to moscow to build a hotel in the name of perestroika in 1989 trump demanded the death penalty be brought back to kill the central park five innocent black youth framed up by the police for an assault they did not commit in the 1990s he made friends with the clintons the giulianis and the epsteins he built a national following with the help of nbc which ran 15 seasons of his show the apprentice in his own personal views trump is without a doubt an admirer of hitler in the recent book titled frankly we did win this election journalist michael bender describes a discussion between donald trump and his former chief of staff john kelly in 2018 trump told kelly well hitler did a lot of good things bender explains that the chief of staff told the president that he was wrong but trump was undeterred trump pointed to germany s economic gains once hitler took over as chancellor according to a 1990 interview with his then wife ivana trump kept a book of hitler s speeches in his bedside cabinet vanity fair wrote that ivana trump told her lawyer michael kennedy that from time to time her husband reads a book of hitler s collected speeches my new order which he keeps in a cabinet by his bed william shirer author of the rise and fall of the third reich explained in these speeches adolf hitler talks about his views on jews and other races his domestic program his foreign policy and the aryan master race ivana also said that when one trump organization leader came to meet with trump he would always click his heels and say heil hitler upon entering trump s office in the same interview trump s lawyer told vanity fair trump is a believer in the big lie theory if you say something again and again people will believe you none of this precluded trump from being a longtime fixture in new york democratic party circles and the same politicians hiding in a bunker under the capitol on january 6 were in his office begging for money not so long before from 1989 to 2009 trump gave hundreds of thousands of dollars to the democrats far more than he gave to republicans he was a registered democrat from 2001 to 2009 but hitching his sails to the wind of the tea party movement trump launched the birther campaign in 2011 insisting that barack obama was a muslim and was not a us citizen four years later he announced his run for president the objective roots of trumpism donald trump we have often remarked did not fall out of the sky and into the oval office he is the political personification of the most dangerous tendencies of nearly 200 years of american bourgeois reaction the american ruling class in its existential struggle for self preservation has conjured up all its historically derived experience in counterrevolution and spat it out in the presidency of donald trump he borrows the strategy of the pre emptive counterrevolutionary putsch from the southern slaveowners who viewed civil war as preferable to a lincoln presidency his imperialist threats echo the racist thug teddy roosevelt who proclaimed that america had the right to dominate what he called the world s waste spaces a more polite version of trump s shithole countries trump idolizes andrew jackson for overriding the supreme court to force the removal of the native americans he pines for the days of the old frontier when sheriffs deputized the angry mob to hang suspected criminals he warns of the yellow peril and the marauding hordes of immigrants building detention centers on the same ground where japanese internment camps once stood he borrows the slogan america first from the nazi sympathizers around charles lindbergh he speaks of communism and socialism in language more violent and unrestrained than that used even by joseph mccarthy himself his worldview is rooted in a fascistic social darwinism that has always been present in the consciousness of the ruthless american capitalist class what was subdued in the period of its explosive growth is unleashed in the period of its decline social programs and regulations on corporate exploitation must be eliminated so that society can return to its natural state the survival of the fittest it is ronald reagan s dream unleashed the bipartisan response to the coronavirus pandemic has been to let the world s population get sick and die for the sake of the markets in the eyes of the ruling class the virus is cleansing society of the weak so that the strong may profit if the masses complain then let them drink bleach there are two fundamental historical processes underlying trump s rise to power first the intractable decline of us imperialism the loss of its position of geostrategic domination and the catastrophic impact of 30 years of permanent war on every level of american society second the extraordinary growth of social inequality which has shattered whatever remained of american bourgeois democracy enforced by the artificial suppression of the class struggle carried out by the democratic party and the afl cio both processes compel the ruling class ever further to reaction motivated by fear of the increasingly real prospect of social revolution in the 30 years since the dissolution of the soviet union american imperialism has turned broad swaths of the world into smoldering ruins while eviscerating domestic social programs and transferring trillions to the rich the class struggle was ruthless but one sided the country became an oligarchy the trade unions complied with their own destruction and were reduced to rumps the country is in a state of social collapse and social distress has no progressive outlet within the framework of the capitalist system mass shootings and other outbursts of despair and backwardness take place on a regular basis in 2000 amid the crisis surrounding the us presidential election the international committee of the fourth international explained that bourgeois democracy could not survive on such rotten foundations in december of that year as the supreme court deliberated over whether to halt the counting of votes in florida david north said what the decision of this court will reveal is how far the american ruling class is prepared to go in breaking with traditional bourgeois democratic and constitutional norms is it prepared to sanction ballot fraud and the suppression of votes is it prepared to install in the white house a candidate who has attained that office through blatantly illegal and anti democratic methods a substantial section of the american ruling elite and perhaps even a majority on the supreme court is prepared to do just that this is because among this social layer there has been a dramatic erosion of support for traditional forms of bourgeois democracy the decision rubber stamped the theft of the 2000 election and the democrats complied without a fight there was no constituency within the ruling class for the defense of democratic rights the path was open for bush cheney and their allies at the project for a new american century to use the shadowy events of september 11 to launch the wars in afghanistan and iraq the ruling class inaugurated a period of relentless nationalist propaganda and police state repression incredible crimes were justified by the war on terror there was endless flag waving and the military and intelligence agencies were elevated above civilian life placed beyond criticism their powers greatly strengthened through the patriot act the state transformed itself into a massive covert operation as edward snowden chelsea manning and julian assange would soon reveal rudy giuliani was held up by both parties as america s mayor certainly a great leader perhaps a future president giuliani himself tried to cancel the new york city elections that year an experience that he would later bring to bear as trump s accomplice in the 2020 election fraud lie the democratic party supported the bush administration in ushering in this period of extreme reaction shocked by the massive anti war demonstrations of 2002 2003 the democratic party turned further to the right supporting the war in iraq and sanctioning the bush administration s crimes in those rare instances where the executive branch deigned to notify the congress of its plans the democratic party sank howard dean s primary run after the vermont governor emerged as a rallying point for growing anti war sentiment in 2004 permanent war and state repression had a toxic impact on american society war seeped into every social vein in the 2004 essay militarism and social polarization as the words bagram guantanamo and abu ghraib entered the lexicon david north explained the impact these wars would have on american society we are not dealing with merely a process of intellectual degeneration the relentless accumulation of wealth in a very small stratum of the american people has the inevitable impact of narrowing the real social base upon which bourgeois rule rests the ruling class is compelled to create another base consisting of elements that stand outside of and are to a considerable extent independent of the broad mass of the people this is the role of the volunteer army which is supplemented by gangs of contract killers and torturers hired by the military to augment the forces of repression in iraq and afghanistan the experience of urban warfare in iraq where american soldiers become accustomed to and in some cases even acquire a taste for killing and repressing civilians on a mass scale is creating a dangerous social type upon which the ruling elite will increasingly depend to maintain law and order in the united states in 2007 2008 a global financial crisis on a scale comparable only to the great depression threw millions out of their homes led to widespread unemployment and levels of social suffering not seen since the hungry thirties george w bush was the most hated president in history and the wars were viewed by most of the population as crimes carried out through lies barack obama rose to prominence promising hope and change and won in a landslide election that took place weeks after the collapse of lehman brothers and aig a massive bailout was arranged for the banks and nothing done for the masses of people the american ruling class announced to the world that this time there would be no new deal fair deal or any deal at all social inequality came to dominate every aspect of political life though it received virtually no mention by any politician or the corporate press the obama administration was a battering ram for the financial aristocracy and a privileged section of the upper middle class that makes up the next nine percent behind the aristocrats in the top 1 percent the administration responded to occupy wall street protests in 2011 with no change in policy under the obama administration the democratic party s definitive break from any social reform program was solidified it deported three million immigrants and expanded the wars in the middle east north africa and east africa on april 30 2015 bernie sanders announced his candidacy for the democratic party presidential nomination though it was assumed sanders would play the role of left also rans like dennis kucinich sanders would win 13 million votes as a socialist calling for political revolution in the land of anti communism the democratic party cheated him of the nomination in 2016 and made plain it would never enact policies that would challenge the wealth of the aristocracy on june 15 2015 trump announced he was running for president in a fascist speech that began with the words our country is in serious trouble and ended with make america great again it was a rallying cry for the darkest trends in american society racism extreme nationalism militarism and anti immigrant xenophobia the democrats called trump s supporters deplorable but it was the democrats themselves who promoted such sentiments as nobly patriotic during the war on terror the media mocked trump s launch and the political establishment sagely agreed he had no chance but he too would wildly exceed their expectations his opponents in the republican primary one by one expressed their moral outrage over trump s racist appeals only to transform themselves into his most sycophantic senatorial gauleiters in november 2016 after a violent campaign in which he threatened to declare himself winner even if he lost the vote trump was the second most hated person in america but the most hated person was hillary clinton who spent much of the campaign denouncing the working class telling coal miners she was going to put them out of work forever and intimating that white people are all racist in 2016 for the first time in its history the democrats won a majority of votes from the wealthiest 10 percent of voters the democratic party had the support of the pseudo left which called for supporting clinton the decades long enrichment of the privileged upper middle class pushed its politics farther to the right bush era social critics like jon stewart and steven colbert became smiling spokesmen for the establishment under obama groups like the iso and socialist alternative rejected knee jerk anti imperialism and supported the democrats wars abroad within the top 10 percent identity politics became a weapon in the fight for positions and privilege the proponents of racial and gender politics grew more zealous and more prominent as inequality grew and the ruling class sought measures to divide workers and protect its interests but the democrats lost the electoral college support collapsed in industrial democratic cities like milwaukee detroit and philadelphia democrats ran a bellicose campaign denouncing trump as a stooge of russia and lost the most support in counties with high casualty rates from the wars in afghanistan and iraq for several hours on election night clinton refused to concede her popular vote lead was growing as the pacific states turned out massively against trump longtime clinton advisers urged her to fight but then barack obama called her twice speaking to her as a representative of the intelligence agencies and commander in chief of the military he told her that her concession was necessary to avoid social instability she complied barack obama greeted trump warmly at the white house said the election was an intramural scrimmage between two sides of the same team and having declared that this was the best time to be alive poetically left the mainland for a caribbean vacation with billionaire richard branson the trump administration assumes power trump entered the white house in january 2017 having lost the popular vote by a greater margin than any previous victorious candidate in history he was aware that the vast majority of voters who supported him did so because they were angry and confused not because they were fascists like him but he used the power of the presidency to cultivate a fascist base and to build support within the military and the repressive apparatus of the state where the roots of power lie he targeted rank and file soldiers police and immigration officials all of whom he visited in campaign style official visits during his inauguration speech he ordered military officers to appear behind him but the soldiers then received an order to pull back in an appeal to the military brass and the financial elite trump appointed a cabinet comprised first of generals and second of bankers the democratic party and corporate media heaped praise on trump for these reasonable nominations and the democrats in the senate voted to confirm his cabinet full of adults in the room but trump also appointed steven bannon his chief strategist and stephen miller his senior adviser the two most powerful non cabinet level positions after the chief of staff and it was these two fascists especially miller who would guide the white house s political strategy to the radical middle class the fact that trump did not have absolute power to do whatever he pleased from day one is proof that trump cannot be a fascist or aspiring dictator this shows how little they know about history the trump cabinet reflected the unstable character of the alliance forged by its reactionary social constituencies from the start it was a bloc of the military and the banks with fascists in the shadows and trump at the head in january 1933 hitler could only form a government based on an alliance with the german national peoples party the traditional arch conservative party and its leader alfred hugenberg in his february 1933 essay before the decision trotsky wrote the government of hugenberg hitler includes within itself a complex system of contradictions between the traditional representatives of the agrarians on the one side and the licensed representatives of large capital on the other between both of these on the one side and the oracles of the reactionary petty bourgeoisie on the other the combination is extremely unstable in its present form it will not long endure trotsky explained that even as chancellor hitler s action was limited by his bourgeois opponents writing weeks before the reichstag fire and the enabling act trotsky said that barring some extraordinary event that thrust hitler to total control the contradictory character of hitler s coalition meant he must provoke a semblance of civil war he himself is afraid of an out and out civil war to maintain power trotsky continued substantial colleagues in the ministry at whose disposal are the reichswehr and the steel helmets would prefer to strangle the proletariat by peaceful measures they are much less inclined to provoke a minor civil war for fear of a big one at some basic level trump understood this about his rivals within the ruling class though he did not command the type of movement hitler had at his disposal in 1933 at each stage he provoked social tensions to the breaking point knowing that a semblance of civil war and the growth of instability would strengthen his coalition from above the greater the opposition to trump s policies from below the more the ruling class relied on the unsavory methods of his supporters to protect their wealth trump guaranteed them a rising stock market tax cuts and an end to all restrictions on profits and he promised to crush the social opposition that would inevitably ensue trotsky wrote in before the decision the investiture of hitler with power served a twofold purpose first to decorate the camarilla of property owners with the leaders of a national movement and secondly to place the fighting forces of fascism at the direct disposal of the proprietors it was not with a light heart that the high and mighty clique made a deal with the malodorous fascists there are too many all too many fists behind the unbridled upstarts and therein lies the dangerous side of the brown shirted allies but in that very same thing is also their fundamental more exactly their only advantage and this is the advantage that decides for such are the times now that there is no guaranteeing property except with fists there is no way of dispensing with the nazis the political strategy of the trump administration 2017 2019 for the first three years of his administration trump cultivated a pogrom style atmosphere against immigrants whom he scapegoated for social ills and used attacks on immigrants as the chief ideological lever to build a fascist movement independent of both parties he appealed to fascist groups and inspired a culture of political violence against opponents he tested and expanded the power of the executive branch through declarations of national emergency he floated the possibility of arresting his opponents canceling elections and remaining in office permanently he flaunted court decisions and attacked the legislature s power of the purse trump aimed to transform congress into a body to be consulted when it agreed and ignored when it didn t and the judiciary into a rubber stamp staffed with his appointees over the course of his term congress and the courts followed trump s strategy bending to his will and affirming the legality of his extra constitutional measures at every step his first initiative in office in january 2017 was to ban travel from seven majority muslim countries on the advice of fascist aides in february trump and miller claimed that undocumented immigrants cast three million illegal votes for clinton at a rally in july he told police in long island to get rough on people calling gang members animals who transformed beautiful quiet neighborhoods into blood stained killing fields in august he threatened to unleash a possible nuclear war warning north korea he would bring down fire and fury if they challenged sanctions later that month he praised neo nazis as very fine people after a fascist murdered heather heyer in charlottesville virginia in february 2018 he told a cincinnati rally that democrats engaged in treason when they refused to applaud his state of the union address in march he joked about remaining president for life at a private speech to donors in april he signed a proclamation deploying the national guard to the border and ordered immigration officials to begin separating thousands of children from their parents many of whom have not been and will never be reunited in june he proposed ending due process for immigrants in july he tweeted a threat to destroy iran in august he began calling the press the enemy of the people in october a fascist shot and killed 11 people at a synagogue in pittsburgh in november with trump s support the border police at the tijuana border launched a savage attack on a caravan of immigrants from central america in february 2019 trump declared a national emergency at the border and ordered construction of a massive border wall in april he threatened to permanently close the us mexico border in may he laughed when a supporter at a rally in florida shouted that immigrants should be shot in june he threatened massive immigration raids on 10 so called sanctuary cities in july he congratulated fascist war criminal eddie gallagher on his acquittal in military court on july 4 he put tanks on the streets of washington d c for his salute to america two weeks later he called four democratic congresswomen communists and told them to go back to the crime infested places from which they came he encouraged crowds to chant send ilhan omar back at a rally in north carolina the supreme court ruled trump could use military funding to build his border wall in august a fascist trump supporter killed 25 people at a heavily immigrant walmart in el paso texas in october the new york times reported that trump had stated he wanted to shoot migrants in the legs and keep them away from the southern border with a trench filled with water alligators and snakes trump also reportedly asked for a cost estimate for an electrified wall with spikes that could pierce human flesh that same month he told a crowd in minneapolis that troops would be coming home from syria because we may need them for something else i e for use domestically in november trump s secretary of defense mark esper fired navy secretary richard spencer over the latter s refusal to reverse the demotion of war criminal eddie gallagher trump called gallagher one of the ultimate fighters saying of gallagher and two other war criminals i stuck with three great warriors against the deep state from 2017 to 2019 trump was ever encroaching on democratic norms as the courts and democratic party consistently gave way as trump built his extra legal coalition the strategy of the democratic party was to downplay the danger of his fascist strategy ignore or join in his ruthless attacks on immigrants and oppose him from the right on questions of foreign policy the democrats strategy was dominated by an understanding that any appeal to the social needs of working people could produce a social explosion they adopted the method of the palace coup they viciously harangued trump as a russian stooge and attempted to impeach him not for his constant violations of the constitution but for a phone call with ukrainian president zelensky in the june 2017 statement palace coup or class struggle we wrote the working class confronts in trump and his administration a vicious enemy dedicated to the destruction of its democratic rights and a further lowering of its living standards it is a government that is pursuing an international agenda based on america first chauvinism the working class must oppose this government and seek its removal but this task must not be entrusted to trump s factional opponents in the ruling class as trump carried through his term his popularity fell and social opposition grew trump used this dynamic to increase the power of his office by inducing big capital to rely on his methods this strategy would come to a head in 2020 trump and hitler characterizing the final year of trump s term requires drawing a historical comparison in the statement no to american fascism we wrote to downplay let alone deny the fact that the trump presidency is metastasizing rapidly into a right wing authoritarian regime with distinctly fascist characteristics is to close one s eyes to political reality the old refrain it can t happen here i e that american democracy is eternally immune from the cancer of fascism is hopelessly out of date that has proven to be absolutely correct we now know that trump and his advisers were consciously copying the strategy of hitler and the nazis in the lead up to hitler s appointment as chancellor in january 1933 the role of stephen miller in particular cannot be underestimated here he was one of a small handful of trump s most trusted advisers he is the only staff member whom trump has never publicly attacked he is clearly a fascist and a careful student of hitler miller is the son of liberal santa monica california landlords his great grandfather immigrated to the us from belarus to escape the tsar s anti jewish pogroms his santa monica high school yearbook quotation was from teddy roosevelt there can be no fifty fifty americanism in this country there is room here for only 100 percent americanism only for those who are american and nothing else his rise to national prominence was itself the product of the democratic party and the proponents of identity politics miller became a regular on cnn and fox news as a 20 year old duke student when as a prominent campus right winger he defended the duke lacrosse team from allegations they raped two women at a frat house in march 2006 when it became clear that the lacrosse students were not in fact guilty of rape miller parleyed his role as an opponent of the overreach of identity politics into staffer jobs for republican congresspersons including minnesota s far right michelle bachman and then alabama senator jeff sessions once in the white house miller was placed in charge of trump s immigration policy his strategy was based on hitler s writings on the us immigration system in 1928 hitler wrote approvingly of how the us immigration act of 1924 enacted by both parties with the signature of president calvin coolidge excluded non white strangers of the blood from the us hitler repeatedly praised the 1924 act and american immigration law generally as a great tool in racial purification in a series of leaked emails from 2015 and 2016 provided to the southern poverty law center by a former breitbart writer who corresponded with him miller gushed repeatedly over the 1924 immigration act of which hitler was so fond heaped praise on coolidge and cited fascist websites like american renaissance vdare and the center for immigration studies as the basis for his plans in the white house miller promoted the fascist novel the camp of the saints whose plot features a horde of indian immigrants invading france and raping white women with the help of french socialists when miller was a student at duke university he worked closely with open neo nazi richard spencer who said of miller i knew him very well when i was at duke the anti immigrant basis of trump s strategy was not the only way the american president modeled himself on the german führer trump promotes his big lie conspiracy theories about the wuhan lab leak and election fraud mimicking goebbels his speeches which are almost all written by miller are full of terms pulled directly from hitler including denunciations of special interests cultural marxism the lying media and even references to qanon style secret child trafficking rings a specter that was also regularly referenced by hitler and his supporters as part of their anti semitic propaganda trump s rallies which he carried out regularly during his term were also pageants of nationalism violence and anti communism like trump hitler and goebbels would regularly threaten hecklers and encourage supporters to rough them up in his book unfathomable ascent peter ross range writes in industrial essen a steelworkers and coal miners town hitler fanned the anger of a roughshod audience that was spoiling for corporeal vengeance against the authors of all ills communists jews big business the crowd roared when hitler issued a blunt endorsement of thuggish tactics if five hundred communists stormed the hall filled with eight thousand nazi supporters hitler said he would simply tell the police leave this to us everyone in hitler s audience knew what he meant especially the young men no doubt rubbing brass knuckles in their pockets even the backdrop of trump s rallies was a cheap mimicry of leni riefenstahl trump held rallies at airplane hangers flying in on air force one at sunset and walking from the tarmac onto the stage before taking off for his next whistle stop trump like hitler regularly made perfunctory denunciations of the excesses of his own movement ross range writes hitler was having it both ways his show of respect for the army and claim of adherence to electoral legality sent mollifying messages to the military and to polite society but his pitiless threat of beheadings on public squares fed red meat to his belligerent base for both men electoral politics was just one method of paving the way for dictatorship it was preferred to the extent that it presented the lowest risk of triggering a social explosion from below and thereby won support from finance capital but it was just a means to an authoritarian end in one of the most underreported events of the trump presidency at sometime in late 2019 stephen miller proposed invoking the insurrection act to enlist troops in personal war against illegal immigration miller was proposing to transform the myriad fascist gangs into a government sponsored posse an anti immigrant force of civilians loyal to trump modern american storm troopers the military halted this proposal for the time being at around this time miller and trump also proposed abolishing birthright citizenship enshrined in the 14th amendment trump s defense of war criminals like eddie gallagher was also pulled directly from hitler s playbook when five storm troopers were put on trial in silesia for murdering a communist in the town of potempa in 1932 hitler made them into national martyrs ross range writes hitler was outraged he very publicly sent the five storm troopers a telegram of support i feel tied to you with limitless loyalty he wrote obtaining your freedom is from this moment forward a point of honor for us this reads almost exactly like trump s tweets at the cpac conference in dallas this past july miller concluded his speech by proclaiming that with trump leading their resurgent movement we will triumph this was an almost word for word repetition of the nazi propaganda slogan wir warden siegen weil uns adolf hitler führt we will triumph because adolf hitler is leading us and last month trump gave his movement a martyr praising january 6 rioter ashli babbitt who was killed by capitol security as an innocent wonderful young woman this too is copied from hitler who promoted storm trooper horst wessel as a martyr after his death in 1930 january 6 to which we will return in greater detail also resembled the beer hall putsch of 1923 in terms of its underlying aims both were plans to kidnap political opponents and ransom them in exchange for state power both failed tactically neither was their architects last word the pandemic and the social physiognomy of trumpism the outbreak of the pandemic at the beginning of 2020 shocked the already crisis ridden society in january the pandemic spread across the world at the time the coronavirus reached the us the democrats were engaged in a hysterical impeachment campaign aimed at forcing a more belligerent policy toward russia the effort collapsed and was forgotten almost immediately both parties launched a policy toward the pandemic that was fascistic at its roots hundreds of thousands of people were to be sacrificed at the altar of capitalist production in march perhaps the world s first international wildcat strike spread across the planet as workers demanded shutdowns and the implementation of safety measures in the us a handful of democratic and republican officials implemented modest temporary restrictions including gretchen whitmer governor of michigan where most of the walkouts were concentrated the stock markets crashed posting the biggest point drops in history the strategy of the ruling class with trump in the lead began to develop and acquire a more violent form their mantra was that factories must run and the markets must rise no matter the human cost finance capital ordered that opposition from below be put down trillions must be transferred to the banks immense pressure even to the point of violence must be brought to bear on any politician who shows any hesitancy in immediately opening businesses and schools death and profits full steam ahead trotsky made clear that the petty bourgeoisie in the epoch of capitalist decay can be inspired by the revolutionary resolution of the working class and follow it in the struggle for socialism but in the absence of a movement of the working class as trotsky wrote in august 1932 the economically powerful big bourgeoisie in itself represents an infinitesimal minority of the nation to enforce its domination it must ensure a definite mutual relationship with the petty bourgeoisie and through its mediation with the proletariat he continued when the social crisis takes on an intolerable acuteness a particular party appears on the scene with the direct aim of agitating the petty bourgeoisie to a white heat and of directing its hatred and its despair against the proletariat in germany this historical function is fulfilled by national socialism nazism a broad current whose ideology is composed of all the putrid vapors of disintegrating bourgeois society over the course of the months that followed the initial shutdowns the social basis of trump s blend of american fascism crystallized and its essence appeared more clearly finance capital through trump mobilized the shop owners and layers of the professional petty bourgeoisie as its shock troops against the working class though likely not the majority of these layers a profoundly backward set of real estate agents salon owners veterans off duty soldiers and restauranteurs grew more enraged and violent the death toll grew as did social anger over the government s policy of death and profits and trump whipped up his big lies to scapegoat china for the crimes of the us ruling class in april trump tweeted liberate michigan minnesota and virginia from those states democratic governors imposition of mild restrictions to stop the spread of the pandemic in april and may trump supporters and fascist militias protested at state capitols with their assault rifles demanding an end to all covid 19 mitigation measures and a return to work trump grew louder in his claims that mail in ballots were fraudulent and that the democrats illegal immigrants and socialists were plotting to steal the election in may trump threatened to shut down twitter after the company notified users that his claims of mail in ballot fraud were not true anti asian hate crimes became more commonplace as a result of efforts to scapegoat china it was a veritable celebration of social murder the heideggerian being toward death francisco franco s viva la muerte the markets were elated when trump declared in may that the us would reopen vaccine or no vaccine on may 25 george floyd was murdered by minneapolis police eight percent of the total us population was to participate in the protests that ensued across the country beginning with his june 1 rose garden speech trump responded to the mounting opposition to his polices with a several month long attempt to invoke the insurrection act impose martial law cancel the elections if necessary and declare that protesters were terrorists subject to mass incarceration without trial such a move would have firmly established his control over the military the significance of the june 1 coup attempt on the evening of may 28 trump denounced the mass protests that had spread throughout the country attacking the protesters as thugs he warned when the looting starts the shooting starts on may 30 he tweeted that protesters at the white house would be greeted with the most vicious dogs and the most ominous weapons and would be really badly hurt at least in their book i alone can fix it reporters carol leonning and philip rucker describe internal deliberations that confirm exactly what the wsws was writing at the time of the june putsch attempt in a white house strategy meeting on may 30 stephen miller always in the inner circle argued for the invocation of the insurrection act mr president you have to show strength they re burning the country down he said chairman of the joint chiefs of staff gen mark milley also present at the meeting argued that invoking the insurrection act would lead to a drastic escalation of the crisis he did not oppose martial law as a defender of democratic rights but as a defender of the crown jewels of the american state the military was prepared to crush an insurrection milley said but the time had not come yet on june 1 trump was enraged by media coverage of his retreat to the white house bunker as protesters descended on the area he again discussed invoking the insurrection act but esper advised against it trump slammed on the resolute desk and yelled that esper wasn t helping him fix the problem he suggested milley command a military operation to take over washington d c and suppress the protests the military refused now red in the face trump demanded that somebody give him a solution because this chaos in the streets required an immediate and deafening response trump shouted you re all fucked up every one of you is fucked up though trump had again not yet ordered the invocation of the insurrection act leonning and rucker write that esper sensed the president was on the verge of giving them a direct order to activate soldiers to pre empt this esper promised 5 000 additional national guard troops and 5 000 federal law enforcement officers trump was reportedly frustrated but agreed immediately after this meeting trump attorney general william barr esper and milley held a conference call with governors about the demonstrations trump declared at the meeting that milley was in charge of the operation which contradicted the military s demands for civilian control nevertheless esper and milley both repeated the need to dominate the battle space trump expressed his attitude to all forms of social opposition it s a movement he said matter of factly if you don t put it down it will get worse and worse the democratic party agreed and deployed police or the national guard to crush protests in almost every major democratic state and city after the meeting staff for various governors who were on the call believed the president was about to impose martial law several high level military figures met that afternoon to try to stop trump from invoking the insurrection act it appeared likely that the military would refuse orders to impose the act and trump feared making any move that would set up a definitive break with the pentagon that afternoon trump delivered his infamous rose garden speech declaring that he was dispatching thousands and thousands of heavily armed soldiers military personnel and law enforcement officers to stop the rioting looting vandalism assaults and the wanton destruction of property he added if a city or state refuses to take the actions that are necessary then i ll deploy the united states military and quickly solve the problem for them later that evening esper and milley walked with trump across lafeyette square which federal police had just cleared of peaceful protesters with vicious force according to leonning and rucker some white house aides told barr esper and milley to trail several paces behind trump allowing him to lead the entourage alone trump took his photos holding a bible in front of st john s church that night esper was photographed meeting with deployed members of the national guard though questions remain about milley and esper s efforts to play both sides the military brass viewed the clearing of lafayette square as an attempt by trump to establish his control over the military through the defense secretary and the chairman of the joint chiefs under immense pressure from within the armed forces esper gave a press conference on june 3 in which he attempted to excuse his behavior claiming he was misled into appearing with trump he weakly said he thought he was inspecting a nearby bathroom and explicitly stated that the department of defense opposed invoking the insurrection act the option to use active duty forces in a law enforcement role should only be used as a matter of last resort and only in the most urgent and dire of situations he said shortly after esper s press conference esper and milley traveled to the oval office to meet with trump trump reportedly screamed at esper you betrayed me you re fucking weak what is this shit i make the decisions on the insurrection act i m the president not you this is about presidential authority this is about presidential prerogative on june 10 trump targeted social protests in seattle and portland claiming protesters were terrorists and again demanding the deployment of the military though he was opposed from within his cabinet in august trump again demanded the deployment of the military in portland to clear a protest camp there federal police without badges or name tags began arresting people on the streets and taking them away in unmarked cars when trump again demanded the implementation of the insurrection act attorney general barr explained that martial law risked triggering a massacre that would spark an uncontrollable reaction from the population for every one of these that works there s a waco where people are killed he said on august 25 fascist kyle rittenhouse murdered protesters in kenosha wisconsin and was praised by the president for exercising his rights five days later anti fascist michael reinoehl was assassinated by federal agents in lacey washington and denounced by trump as a communist and a criminal who deserved to die the 2020 election in september of 2020 polls showed trump losing heavily to biden largely as a result of the mass death and social suffering caused by the government s response to the pandemic trump escalated claims of voter fraud and ordered supporters not to vote by mail on september 23 trump said at a press conference that he would not accept the outcome of the election if he lost we re going to have to see what happens the ballots are a disaster he said on september 24 he told a rally in north carolina that he was not sure the election would be fair during the first presidential debate on september 29 he was asked to condemn the proud boys to which he replied proud boys stand back and stand by biden continued to shrug off these threats claiming they were merely proof of trump s instability not part of a fascist strategy to overturn the election biden instead appealed to his supporters for calm in early october trump tested positive for covid 19 and nearly died on october 5 he demanded to leave walter reed hospital and to return to the white house to be at the center of his ongoing plot he produced a video of his return that almost exactly mimicked leni riefenstahl s fascist propaganda film for hitler triumph of the will shot for shot on the night of october 7 as the election campaign reached a fever pitch and the covid 19 death toll swelled into its second wave the fbi arrested members of a fascist paramilitary unit that was planning to kidnap democratic governor gretchen whitmer and raid the michigan state capitol in a bid to trigger an uprising their chief grievance was that whitmer had imposed temporary restrictions on businesses due to the pandemic and that democrats were planning to steal the election they had met and organized their plot at protests called by trump to liberate the state on october 8 trump responded to the news by attacking whitmer falsely claiming she shut down churches during the pandemic on october 15 trump defended the fascist qanon conspiracy theory declaring that its adherents are very much against pedophilia they fight it very hard at a rally in michigan on october 17 he denounced whitmer s covid 19 restrictions as the crowd chanted lock her up on october 19 michigan sheriffs and police associations announced they would not enforce a proposed ban on assault weapons at polling stations on october 27 trump again downplayed the plot and repeated his denunciations of whitmer we now know that some sheriffs including barry county s darr leaf planned to seize ballot boxes and impound them so they could not be counted on election day trump was preparing to declare victory and call for a halt to vote counting of mail in ballots which were slated to be counted after the counting of in person ballots which would skew heavily for trump he transformed the white house into his election night headquarters a substantial break in tradition the military was preparing again for the possibility of a massive social explosion according to leonning and rucker in washington the triumvirate that had spent so much energy that summer and fall keeping trump from deploying active duty troops on the streets of american cities esper milley and barr were tracking intelligence and social media for any signs of unrest on election day the trio were also on guard for the possibility that trump would invoke the insurrection act in some way to quell protests or to perpetuate his power by somehow intervening in the election if trump won significant civil unrest was expected in several cities late on election night trump held a press conference and declared he had won the election and that biden was committing fraud despite biden s sclerotic basement campaign by november 3 2020 over 80 million people voted to remove donald trump from the white house in a massive popular rejection of his brutal vision for the future fifteen million more people voted against him in 2020 than in 2016 but to the state it was not the seven million vote difference that determined who would be the next president but the military which made clear it would not support trump if he attempted to remain in power and emerged as the kingmakers in washington trump fired esper and attempted to promote his own loyalists into the leadership of the military the fbi and the cia he wanted to dismiss milley as well but could not since top military brass told trump they would resign en masse if he did so the details will be the subject of the next report the role of the international committee and wsws both the putsch and the response of the democratic party testify not to the strength of capitalist class rule but to its weakness in his november 2020 lecture delivered in the midst of the election crisis david north wrote the events now taking place in america signify the end of that long period where the affairs of world capitalism could rest securely under the leadership of us imperialism the united states will no longer be able to play that role the crisis in the united states has called into question the viability of the capitalist system and it certainly opens up the opportunity for the intervention of the working class as a decisive historical force this is what is coming next it has not yet developed openly to that point but the american working class will make its presence felt people now have something to say about how this crisis is settled if not in the next week or next month six months or even a year the time cannot be long off before we begin to see a movement by that enormously powerful social force the american proletariat now we are witnessing the beginning of this process the strikes of the recent period show not only the objective development of the class struggle but also the critical role played by our party in them the ignominious collapse of the us occupation of afghanistan after 20 years of war and hundreds of thousands dead is a milestone in the collapse of the american empire that will have a profoundly revolutionary impact on the consciousness of workers all over the world the russian revolutions of both 1905 and 1917 took place amid substantial military defeats of the tsar s armies as did the german revolutions following world war i our work in this period will determine the outcome of the social struggles to come it all comes down to the crisis of revolutionary leadership it would be a grave error for comrades to underestimate the importance of the immense political authority the international committee carries forward into the present situation today the statements of the plenums of the international committee the perspectives documents and books like a quarter century of war the russian revolution and the unfinished twentieth century and the crisis of american democracy as well as the daily coverage in the world socialist web site appear jarringly prophetic this is not the product of clairvoyance but of the constant effort over the course of many decades and critical internal struggles to assimilate all the political experiences of the working class and transform this understanding into a fighting program of revolutionary action we not only foresaw crisis war and economic catastrophe we also understood that the more intense the earthquakes produced by shifts in the tectonic plates of capitalist society the more forcefully a new socialist future was emerging to break through and shatter the old order what was lacking was revolutionary leadership it is now our historic obligation to strengthen the links in this historical continuity and carry the traditions of the socialist movement into the struggles of the working class only this will prepare the party and the working class for the revolutionary upheavals ahead

it may well go down as the understatement of the year in a quite extraordinary address to the nation after the fall of kabul to the taliban the us president made this admission the truth is this did unfold more quickly than we had anticipated so what s happened afghanistan s political leaders gave up and fled the country the afghan military collapsed sometimes without trying to fight if this were the only intelligence failing of recent years then maybe a little indulgence could be shown most popular steerpike jk rowling won t forgive harry potter actors for trans stance more quickly than we had anticipated as recently as 10 august us intelligence said that it would take the taliban up to 90 days to take kabul within two days the us said it was evacuating its embassy and on 15 august kabul fell that is a pretty big misjudgement and one for which joe biden has taken a considerable amount of flak for as he rightly said the buck stops with me but most national leaders and most american presidents with the possible exception of donald trump do not make policy by themselves on the hoof they have advisers they consult experts most of all though they rely on their intelligence services and biden like all his recent predecessors receives a daily classified report however strong his belief in the importance of ending his country s failed mission in afghanistan it is unlikely that he would have scorned intelligence information about the pace of the taliban s advance unlike trump he is a veteran of the us political process he respects its norms and he comes across as cautious if he was told by his intelligence agencies that the taliban were advancing at such and such a rate he was likely to believe them yet perhaps he should have taken a more questioning approach perhaps the scepticism shown by trump towards the labyrinthine us intelligence services in particular was more justified than has commonly been supposed for whatever failures can be laid at the door of the us and uk governments in relation to the 20 year intervention the failure of intelligence as the us completed its withdrawal surely has to be among the greatest first the information at least in so far as it has been made public was that if the taliban were to reach kabul at all it would not be until well after the 9 11 deadline for the us departure then suddenly it was 90 days and then even more suddenly it was 72 hours then came reports that taliban fighters were at the gates of the city and then they were filming themselves in the presidential palace that had been vacated by its occupant barely 24 hours before now it can be said in mitigation that the taliban are a secretive and indisciplined bunch and their future moves may be less predictable than those of a more conventional fighting force but that really isn t good enough what does a country have intelligence services for if not to know the enemy figure out its capabilities and forecast how it is likely to act by all these gauges intelligence on afghanistan appears to have been catastrophically deficient even though the us had a military and civilian presence on the ground in the country for the best part of 20 years and given the special intelligence relationship between the us and the uk this failure reflects badly on the uk as well both on the quality of intelligence the uk itself may have gathered in afghanistan and on the extent of our dependence on the us for intelligence gathering if this were the only intelligence failing of recent years then maybe a little indulgence could be shown collecting intelligence in afghanistan cannot be easy the landscape the regional and tribal divisions and the still simmeriing armed conflict are all complicating factors but the whole purpose of intelligence is to penetrate the dark recesses of a country otherwise everyone in government could sit back study news reports and other open sources of information and save taxpayers quite a lot of money and it is not the first recent failure at all the war in iraq rested on two assumptions backed by intelligence both of which proved disastrously wrong the first was that us and other foreign troops would be greeted as liberators by a grateful population that in the immortal words of an adviser to george bush kenneth adelman it would be a cakewalk the other was that saddam hussein was in defiance of un resolutions because he had retained a stock of chemical weapons although it subsequently turned out that actually those stocks had been destroyed these two misapprehensions led the us the uk and others into a costly war that did much to destabilise the whole region and only fuelled the jihadism that the us was seeking to uproot then there was libya where the idea of the intervention or so it appears was to mount a limited operation to protect the threatened population of benghazi although it ended up with the violent removal of gaddafi and a protracted civil war that has again destabilised the wider region what did the intelligence assessments say about the feasibility of a limited military operation the political lie of the land in libya at the time and the stability of the regime it has to be hoped that the leading lights of this operation david cameron and nicolas sarkozy were privy to intelligence that supported their presumptions although barack obama himself was less keen and found himself accused of leading from behind all these failings may help to explain at least some of donald trump s criticisms of the us intelligence services when he was in the white house but it is hard to imagine him watching the debacle in kabul were he still president and not demanding the heads of the cia the dia and the nsa to name but three of the services as well as a mass clear out further down the ranks afghanistan is after all as much of a us intelligence failure as it is a failure of military preparations another conclusion can perhaps be drawn here too if us and uk intelligence has proved so deficient here why should anyone be confident that it is so much more reliable elsewhere might our intelligence on the capabilities plans and mentality of russia or china be at best flawed and at worst dangerously deceptive you can argue that intelligence gathering for these countries may be on a sounder footing based on more home grown expertise and sounder methods then again maybe not maybe the quality and usefulness of intelligence as currently gathered is ripe for review the miscalculation in afghanistan should sound a wider alarm

bloomberg columnist tim o brien was called out for spreading misinformation about florida s state government providing free treatment for residents battling covid 19 on monday o brien posted a tweet railing against gov ron desantis because the florida republican was promoting monoclonal antibody treatment centers for citizens infected with the coronavirus this can t be said enough the regeneron treatment desantis is pushing cost at least 1 250 per dose covid 19 vaccines cost 0 o brien tweeted o brien has been railing against desantis decision since last week when the governor announced the regeneron treatment for florida patients florida gov desantis deploys covid 19 antibody rapid response unit the regeneron treatments desantis is pushing cost at least 1 250 per dose that s less expensive than gilead s remdesivir treatment but paul and his wife probably know that because well stock trading anyway covid 19 vaccines cost 0 o brien tweeted however o brien s tweets are misleading because in a push to reduce hospitalizations desantis announced the regeneron would be free to florida patients desantis press secretary christina pushaw fired back at o brien s tweet shortly afterwards writing report this disinformation the regeneron treatment is 0 for florida patients same as the vaccines republican communicator matt whitlock also called out o brien s tweet for spreading misinformation regarding the treatment you re incorrect and should delete this twittersupport should suspend this misinformation imagine if it prevented someone from getting care they needed because they didn t know it was actually free to them whitlock wrote regeneron the company behind the monoclonal antibodies treatment also responded to o brien on twitter by informing him the federal government had also made the treatment free to patients hi timobrien please know that the u s government has made our investigational antibody cocktail for covid19 available for free to patients who qualify under emergency use authorization parameters just like the vaccines are the company wrote the tweet included a link to regeneron s previous announcement on the treatment on thursday after all the hard work the most important message we want to share is to please get vaccinated but if you get sick and qualify under the fda s emergency authorization then get treated regeneron wrote several media outlets have criticized desantis treatment center despite its authorization by the u s food and drug administration the suggestion that governor desantis is expanding access to a lifesaving covid 19 treatment with demonstrated efficacy in preventing hospitalization and death for political or financial reasons is both offensive and baseless desantis office told fox news the conspiracy theories about regeneron are particularly dangerous because they might discourage some democrats the primary audience for this anti desantis narrative from getting a proven treatment that can save their lives those who create and promote this misinformation are unethical the health and well being of their own followers doesn t matter to them if they see an opportunity to attack desantis click here to get the fox news app on thursday desantis opened the first rapid response unit for antibody treatment in jacksonville florida state officials also announced plans to possibly add additional locations throughout the state to alleviate hospital demands while announcing the unit s opening desantis also promoted vaccinations adding that treatments should be used in tangent with vaccines i don t think it s an either or desantis said we have people in society that are not vaccinated we also have people who are vaccinated who are still testing positive either way if you get in that situation particularly in these high risk categories this should be your stop
the contrast between the rise of the stock market and the underlying state of the us economy was highlighted on monday when wall street s main index the s p 500 reached a level double its low of march 2020 as the initial effects of the covid 19 pandemic led to chaos in us financial markets the new high was recorded despite the debacle in afghanistan sharply falling consumer confidence slowing growth in china and the widening impact of the delta variant both in the us and internationally traders work on the floor of the new york stock exchange ap photo richard drew the markets fell on tuesday with the s p 500 having its worst day for a month falling by 0 7 percent and the dow dropping by 500 points at one stage on the back of data which showed a 1 1 percent fall in retail sales in july compared to june but with money continuing to pour into the financial system from the fed the general sentiment appears to be that the wall street surge will continue i don t think it portends a precipitous drop around the corner i think it s very temporary one financial manager told the wall street journal fears of worsening conditions in the underlying economy were revealed in the results of the widely watched michigan consumer confidence survey published at the end of last week it showed that the consumer sentiment index fell by 13 5 percent from july to august to a level just below the april 2020 low the university of michigan uofm survey reported that the only faster rates of decline in the sentiment index were in april 2020 when it recorded a drop of 19 4 percent and in october 2008 during the global financial crisis when it dropped 18 1 percent the losses in early august were widespread across income age and education subgroups and observed across all regions according to the survey richard curtin the uofm economist in charge of the survey called the results stunning it indicates that the biden administration s economic policies and its claims that the us economy is on the way to recovery could well be going the same way as afghanistan a survey of small businesses conducted by the wall street journal showed a fall in sentiment similar to that recorded by the uofm it found that small business confidence in august had dropped to its lowest level since the early spring largely as a result of the rise in covid 19 infections due to the more infectious delta variant some 39 percent of small business owners expected economic conditions in the us to improve in the next 12 months down from 50 percent in july and 67 percent in march reporting on the survey the journal cited the owner of one small business an event production company which reported a flurry of cancellations we were slowly ramping up in anticipation of a robust third and fourth quarter he said you can drop the ro part it seems like it is just bust the resurgence of the pandemic via the delta variant is also putting a damper on international economic growth particularly in china according to data released by china s national bureau of statistics on monday the economy slowed in july by more than expected this was the result of delta infections as well as flooding due to extreme weather events in parts of the country retail sales in july rose by 8 5 percent in july compared with the same month a year ago and industrial production increased by 6 4 percent but both these figures were below the level anticipated by economists of 10 9 percent and 7 9 percent respectively china has imposed strict travel restrictions in response to an outbreak of the coronavirus that began in the middle of last month in nanjing but even before the latest outbreak there were signs that the initial bounce back of the chinese economy was slowing reporting on the latest data fu linghui a spokesman for the statistics bureau said growth in some consumer sectors and services slowed he warned that growth in the second half of the year was likely to be lower than the first six months international banks and forecasting agencies are revising down their estimates for chinese growth goldman sachs morgan stanley and nomura as well as other investment banks have all reduced their forecasts the anz bank added its voice on monday when it downgraded its forecast for full year growth from 8 8 percent to 8 3 percent it pointed to a broad based slowdown in domestic activities in july which suggests that the economy is rapidly losing steam julian evans pritchard senior economist at capital economics told the financial times ft that in addition to the fall in the growth of retail sales investment spending and industrial activity that were less sensitive to covid 19 restrictions were also weaker the drop back in consumption should reverse once the virus situation is brought under control and restrictions are lifted he said but we think the slowdown elsewhere will deepen over the rest of the year and if there is a slowdown in the rest of the world it will heavily impact on china as can be seen in the latest figures on exports which showed growth of 19 percent in july as compared with 32 percent in june the increasingly complex situation in the global economy is adding to the problems confronting the major central banks as they consider whether they should start to ease or taper their support for financial markets there appears to be something of a shift among members of the fed s governing body towards tapering in an interview with the ft last week san francisco fed president mary daly regarded as being on the dovish side said it was appropriate to start dialling back accommodation starting with asset purchases talking about potentially tapering those later this year or early next year is where i m at she said esther george the president of the kansas city fed has also indicated that it is time to transition from extraordinary monetary policy accommodation to more neutral settings the key issue here is inflation and whether this will lead to a push by workers for higher wages george alluded to this issue referring to firm inflation expectations and a recovering labour market as being consistent with fed objectives that could provide the basis for bringing asset purchases to an end the question was dealt with more bluntly in remarks by david kelly chief global strategist at jpmorgan asset management reported in the ft the official fed position is that the present spike in us inflation is transitory but there is nothing transitory about wage inflation kelly said warning that present fed policies will trigger higher wages and pressure corporate margins on the other side there is a fear that such is the dependence of wall street on the flow of cheap money from the fed and the mountain of debt and fictitious capital it sustains that any move to curb it in order to counter inflation and a wages push by workers will set off financial turbulence the financial markets will be closely following the remarks by fed chair jerome powell at the annual conclave of central bankers and financial analysts at jackson hole wyoming at the end of this month which may give some indication of the direction in which the us central bank is heading at present the differences at least as they appear in public are relatively muted but that could rapidly change as indicated by developments in britain in the middle of july the house of lords economic affairs committee which includes former bank of england governor mervyn king issued a scathing report on the bank of england s boe quantitative easing qe asset purchasing program lord michael forsyth the chair of the committee said the boe has become addicted to qe using it as the answer to all the country s economic problems the report said there were wide perceptions the bank was using qe mainly to finance the government s spending priorities and if these continued to grow it would lose credibility destroying its ability to control inflation and maintain financial stability boe governor andrew bailey responded testily to the use of the word addicted saying it had a very damaging meaning for many people who are suffering last week the boe made a tentative move towards tightening monetary policy when it announced a plan to start reducing its holding of 900 billion worth of government bonds equivalent to about 40 percent of gdp announcing the policy at a press conference bailey said when interest rates reached 0 5 percent the central bank would stop reinvesting the proceeds of bonds it owns and when they reached 1 percent it would consider selling some of them the process of unwinding qe would proceed on autopilot along a gradual and predictable path but as the ft reported this breeziness seemed odd given the market upheavals when the fed sought to reduce its balance sheet in 2013 and 2018 in 2013 the initial move to end qe resulted in a spike in interest rates in 2018 when fed chair powell indicated further rate rises in 2019 following four rises over the previous 12 months and that the reduction in asset holdings was on autopilot wall street responded with a significant fall recording its worst december since the depression

a person experiencing homelessness sleeps on the sidewalk near monument circle in the winter of 2020 in 2018 the city of indianapolis outlined a plan to end homelessness by 2023 an average of 1 600 people experience homelessness on any given night in marion county but last year the number increased numbers show nearly 2 000 in the annual 2021 count although different methods were used because of the pandemic the federal aid made available during the public health crisis has helped efforts to reach more people but challenges remain so how is the city doing in its efforts to end homelessness can we really end homelessness ending homelessness doesn t mean that no one will experience a night on the street after getting out of jail that a family won t be evicted and have to move in with relatives or friends that a young person won t sleep in their car because they were kicked out of their home the goal is to make homelessness a rare short lived and recoverable experience more specifically the indianapolis 2023 plan aims that no one has to spend more than 30 days without a permanent affordable safe place to live this goal does come with numerous hurdles most providers agree that a lack of affordable safe and stable housing for everyone regardless of the situation is significant the pandemic impacted the length of time people experiencing homelessness longer with the lockdown but hundreds of people were able to take advantage of new programs including long term stays in hotels paid for by the city through federal relief funds at the same time other service providers doubled down and addressed the housing needs of young people through transitional programs or stepped up staffing on the flip side the effort has been somewhat stalled by staffing challenges and limited people power for social work in the past services were set up to meet immediate needs with temporary solutions shelters including wheeler mission were often the only choice for many now principles are guided by numerous concepts focused on finding the right home option for every community member top among these concepts is housing first which aims to quickly and permanently find and sometimes help pay for housing without barriers and with support read more hotel for people experiencing homelessness becomes bridge other principles focus on client choice and trauma informed care this work is being done in indianapolis with the overarching principle that everyone deserves to be housed what is the plan the indianapolis community plan to end homelessness 2018 2023 is at its halfway point several strategic priorities have been laid out to accomplish five year goals the first priority is to optimize the crisis response system to reduce the time someone experiences homelessness crisis response efforts have been tested by the pandemic in some ways the coordination has improved as groups came together quickly and some oversight waned during the lockdown leaders say they are still working to reduce the length of time that people go without permanent housing secondly increasing access to safe affordable supportive housing is a priority and moves are happening recently the iha opened up its housing choice voucher lottery for the first time in years organizers say there also needs to be a focus on preserving the affordable housing stock that the city has access to read more a new home to give haven and hope for local lgbtq youth experiencing homelessness another priority is to expand wraparound services to increase housing stability these can include

hancock county one of the county s schools is requiring students and staff to wear masks as covid 19 cases climb there the obligation is prompted by an update to the school corporation s health and safety plan which continues to change amid the rapidly fluctuating landscape of the pandemic mt vernon middle school had 12 covid 19 cases among students and staff as of last friday placing it in the orange tier of the district s health and safety plan the second most severe and one in which masks are required in elementary schools the threshold is seven students staff who are covid positive in an individual building and for the high school it s 14 mt vernon s school board added covid positive totals per building as triggers to the tiered color system monday night the entire plan is available at mvcsc k12 in us mc 2 an absentee rate of 16 due to combined illness of students and staff in an individual building would also trigger the orange tier because masks are being worn close contacts are traced to three feet rather than six the orange tier also calls for deep cleaning and daily fogging once a school advances to a higher level it will remain there for a minimum of five days and until its number of current cases drops below the threshold that triggered the tier those who test positive for covid 19 must isolate for 10 days mt vernon middle school is one tier under red which does not rely on covid positive totals per building to be triggered but rather an absentee rate of 20 due to combined illness of students and staff in an individual building in that tier the school corporation would consult with the hancock county health department on possibly closing a school also as of friday mccordsville elementary school had two cases placing it in the blue tier the second least severe the high school had three keeping it green the least severe and there were two cases in the other category meaning district level employees not designated to a particular building from the district s 19 cases as of last friday there were 437 close contacts all but 63 of whom have had to quarantine chris smedley mt vernon assistant superintendent said at the school board meeting monday night that the corporation was working through several cases that came in over the weekend which totaled between 12 and 14 putting the district s total at over 30 smedley noted that of the over 400 close contacts three have recently tested positive for covid 19 themselves mt vernon had 304 covid positive individuals during the 2020 21 school year he continued adding none of their close contacts were known to become infected he attributed this year s change to a more aggressive strain of the novel coronavirus due to this new experience brought on by the delta variant we have to do something different smedley said shannon walls a school board member said the corporation has a comprehensive plan in place and that she appreciates all of the work that went into putting it together the last thing we want is for any of our students to fall behind walls said we want them in school we want them safe we want them healthy she called for unity in the wake of the video from the board s last meeting going viral illustrating a division the pandemic is creating across the country you don t have to agree with the person sitting next to you walls said you don t have to agree with any of us but as a world we re divided right now and we had 4 million eyes on us last week we have an opportunity to walk out of this boardroom tonight united we don t have to agree but we have to move forward we have to show our children what that looks like and i hope that this community can do that after tonight s decisions when mt vernon s updated plan is applied to its covid 19 data from the last school year its three elementary schools neared the orange threshold for requiring masks but never reached it the middle school reached that threshold for one 10 day period the high school did on three occasions throughout the school year including two seven day periods and an 11 day period board members also learned more about the support schools are providing students at home due to illness or quarantine including assignments and materials being provided within 48 hours and having direct and indirect instruction provided virtually by teachers and staff the meeting drew comments from several attendees including sam harper who thanked the board for letting scientific consensus guide its health and safety protocols however the stepfather of a fortville elementary school student said he s concerned the corporation lacks a consistent and comprehensive remote learning plan for kids who are quarantined particularly younger students i firmly believe that all the teachers themselves are doing the absolute best they can and i appreciate them for everything they do because this is just an untenable situation we find ourselves in harper said however our students especially in elementary school levels need guidance they need someone to walk them through it if we have what sounds like almost an entire elementary school class being sent home there s no reason virtual school can t be done in lieu of physical school dr dan stock the mccordsville resident and noblesville functional medicine physician whose criticism of federal and state covid 19 guidelines before the school board earlier this month went viral spoke as well he said while the school corporation is compelled by law to require masking in certain situations like on buses and following shortened quarantines officials don t have to require face coverings in their health and safety plan as outlined in the orange tier no one s asked you to do a misdemeanor or get yourself put in jail or anything like that but it does appear that the majority of people in this school district do not want a mask policy that has any kinds of things that put masks back on people unless it is mandated by a government authority higher than yourselves stock said the indiana department of health updated covid 19 numbers at schools across the state on monday with figures through last friday all but four of hancock county s public schools reported at least fewer than five new cases among students teachers or staff with greenfield intermediate school adding the most at nine students hancock county added a covid 19 death to its total on tuesday a woman in her 50s who died on aug 16 according to information from the state health department the county also added 51 cases on tuesday its highest single case day

nine fijian opposition politicians including two former prime ministers were recently arrested for voicing concerns about a contentious land bill as the government of prime minister frank bainimarama moves to further intimidate political critics six members of parliament and three other high profile politicians were taken into custody by police on july 26 27 following comments they had made regarding the bill before it was debated in parliament according to police the arrests were part of a proactive approach to thwart possible civil instability the nine were viliame gavoka leader of the opposition social democratic liberal party sodelpa opposition whip lynda tabuya mps adi litia qionibaravi and ro filipe tuisawau biman prasad leader of the national federation party nfp president pio tikoduadua former prime ministers sitiveni rabuka and mahendra chaudhry and unity fiji leader savenaca narube the mps were held for almost 48 hours without charge then released after questioning acting police commissioner rusiate tudravu posted a statement on the police force s facebook page baldly denying any intimidation and declaring that not everyone who is brought in for questioning will be charged so far no charges have been confirmed the crackdown carried out under the authoritarian regime s public order act came in the midst of an escalating health and social crisis arising from the deadly covid 19 outbreak there have been 38 742 cases during the surge that started in april and 345 deaths fiji has an average daily test positivity rate of 32 percent the highest in the world bainimarama opposes a full national lockdown insisting that such a move would cripple the economy and impact jobs alongside its pro business strategy the government is pursuing a mandatory vaccination campaign workers have been told they must be fully vaccinated by november or face losing their jobs only those who are vaccinated can obtain the paltry government income support the country s health system is close to collapse half of those who have died from covid 19 did so at home due largely to overcrowded medical facilities the fiji red cross society s neomai kafoa said this week that blood stocks are so low they had 85 volunteers on phones urging friends and family to donate blood the need for blood is dire if i can say right across the country she warned the working class is bearing the brunt of the worsening crisis the tourism industry has collapsed resulting in the loss of 100 000 jobs half the country s 880 000 population are experiencing extreme financial hardship even before the pandemic the minimum wage was just fj2 32 us1 12 per hour with many families struggling to get enough food charities and ngos have been distributing thousands of food packs people who criticise government handling of the crisis including some of the arrested mps have been lambasted by the administration the nfp s prasad who has been detained four times by police said the government was using the arrests as a distraction in dealing with the covid situation as people are dying not able to put food on the table or get medical care the legislation bill no 17 2021 which passed through parliament last week amends the itaukei land trust act 1940 that governs the administration of native land the bill removes the requirement of obtaining the consent of the itaukei land trust board tltb which was set up to protect indigenous landowners rights for any mortgage charge pledge or caveat on a lease under the act or for any such lease to be dealt with by a court this would mean that if the tltb granted a native land lease to someone the lessee could use that land for different purposes without having to seek the board s permission the government maintains the changes are purely administrative and designed to improve business efficiency by eliminating delays in getting consent for mortgages according to the opponents however the bill introduces a significant reduction in the power of the tltb an erosion of the guardianship role of tltb and significantly reduces the power of landowners to have their rights and interests protected by the board once their land has been leased bainimarama told parliament the opposition were super spreaders of lies seeking to mislead and incite indigenous people over 30 000 signed an on line petition against the bill raising the prospect of protests police erected several security checkpoints around the country and warned they would come down hard on any person or group that tries to cause instability and civil unrest the dispute is part of ongoing deep seated conflicts within the fijian ruling elite bainimarama who seized power in a 2006 coup has oriented to sections of the fijian capitalist class and pro business members of the chiefly elite his military junta has adopted various measures aimed at eliminating barriers to investment and private profit the ethnic fijian nationalist wing however which seeks to maintain political and economic privileges for the traditional chiefs is bitterly opposed to aspects of bainimarama s rule particularly over issues of land ownership approximately 87 percent of land in fiji is customary land owned collectively within the tribe or family through kinship ties it is often controlled by a narrow elite represented by the powerful great council of chiefs who jealously guard privileges from the land ownership system steven ratuva a university of canterbury sociologist told radio nz a critical question is whether the bill was intended to benefit the landowners or to serve the interests of foreign investors and other local entrepreneurs who have been part of the government s lobbying and patronage system in vanuatu he said the removal of regulatory process of sub leasing and mortgaging by lessees saw 90 percent of land on the main island of efate alienated through extensive sub leasing and selling by foreign investors with little income for the landowners the bainimarama government which continues to rest firmly on the military has a history of viciously suppressing political and social opposition arrests of opposition mps are a common occurrence the sedition provisions in the crimes act and the public order act have been used to target journalists activists and government critics assemblies protests and strikes are routinely banned anti democratic measures are being intensified under the cover of the pandemic in march bainimarama withdrew a police bill which would have vastly increased the search and seizure powers of the police the backdown followed an outpouring of criticism civil liberties groups ngos opposition parties sections of the media and the fiji law society all condemned the bill describing it as another step towards the transformation of fiji into a police state regional governments meanwhile including the pacific islands forum which met last week have been silent on the recent arrests new zealand s labour led government only registered concern through an anodyne ministry of foreign affairs statement head of the fiji women s crisis centre shamima ali told radio nz i have never seen such a docile international community as i have seen this time around the silence is not surprising under pressure from washington leaders in canberra and wellington have made it a priority to restore relations following bainimarama s 2006 coup in order to fend off china s growing influence they endorsed fiji s 2014 bogus election won by bainimarama s fijifirst party declaring the country had restored democracy this has paved the way for the restoration of full diplomatic economic and above all military relations doing business with the fijian government now means maintaining a hypocritical silence over the regime s ongoing abuses
in early february i argued that you should go long on us homebuilder dr horton owing to the strong american housing boom six months on the boom shows no signs of letting up with both house prices and sales still climbing the latest case shiller house price index suggests that the average house price in the us has risen by 16 in a year while some argue that the market is overheating and that a slowdown or even a 2009 style slump is just around the corner i think it s time to double down on homebuilding stocks part of the boom in the us housing market is clearly down to the combination of a

market as the pandemic and the rise of remote working make life outside the major urban areas much more attractive while this impulse will diminish as memories of the crisis fade and people return to their offices the rebalancing between the major cities and the rest of america will continue a housing shortage the us market is also suffering from the after effects of the 2006 crisis which saw the number of homes built each year fall drastically for nearly a decade with the population still growing this has led to a shortage of new homes with the national association of realtors estimating that around five million new homes need to be built over the next decade to replenish the housing stock this shortfall should bolster prices significantly over the next few years another homebuilder i consider particularly attractive is pultegroup nyse phm america s third largest and one that specialises in the detached single family houses that will benefit from the changes in the way america works and lives between 2015 and 2020 it nearly doubled its revenue and sales are expected to keep growing by double digit percentages over the next few years it has a large number of homes that have been already been sold and are in the process of being built what s more it has managed to do this while earning a strong return on capital expenditure a key gauge of profitability this has enabled the group to reduce the amount of debt on its balance sheet by more than 50 over the past four years while increasing the amount of cash that it holds which should protect it if the market does slow despite this it looks very cheap trading at only 5 7 times earnings at present the market seems to be cooling on pultegroup s shares they have declined by around 17 from their all time high earlier this year i would therefore not go long until they rise above 58 around 10 higher than their current price of 53 once they have crossed that threshold i would buy them at 35 per 1 with a stop loss of 30 this gives you a total downside of 980 trading techniques hot sun hot stocks can the weather affect the stockmarket a 2001 study by the university of michigan s business school found that higher than average morning sunshine was positively associated with daily equity returns for 26 cities between 1982 and 1997 however other studies seem to suggest that the amount of sunshine isn t the only type of weather that can move markets temperature also has an effect intuitively you might expect higher temperatures to make people happier and more eager to invest however a 2005 study by toronto s york university and the university of toronto found that there was a negative relationship between maximum temperature and stockmarket returns in the united states canada britain germany sweden australia japan and taiwan between 1982 and 1997 in other words the warmer the temperature the worse the market did that day and vice versa they explained this behaviour by pointing to research that shows that higher temperatures make people more listless and apathetic while lower ones make them more aggressive interestingly a later study in 2011 by christos floros of hellenic mediterranean university produced more ambiguous results on the one hand he detected a negative relationship between temperature and daily stock returns in austria belgium and france however in the case of the british and greek stockmarkets he found the opposite higher temperatures led to higher returns still while the negative relationship in austria belgium and france was large enough to be statistically robust the positive effect in greece and the uk was so small that it wasn t statistically different from zero ie it could have been chance how my tips have fared my long tips have struggled over the past month with three falling and two rising media group itv fell from 125p to 114p and spread betting firm plus500 declined from 1 407p to 1 389p cruise ship operator norwegian cruise line dropped from 27 28 to 24 66 falling below the stop loss level of 25 which means that the position is automatically closed us homebuilder dr horton rose from 89 03 to 94 21 while construction firm morgan

company plug power went down from 29 02 to 28 18 while cinema chain amc fell from 42 61 to 33 80 however cloud computing specialist snowflake rose from 267 to 280 electric car company tesla rose from

profitable short positions such as nikola and ocado last month since tp icap hasn t reached the price at which you should start going long i have four active long tips itv dr horton morgan sindall and plus500 and five shorts snowflake plug power bitcoin tesla and amc i think this is a reasonable balance so there is no need for you to close any additional positions however i m going to increase the

three tech companies apple microsoft and google owner alphabet reported combined profits of more than 50 billion in the april june quarter underscoring their unparalleled influence and success at reshaping the way we live although these companies make their money in different ways the results served as another reminder of the clout they wield and why government regulators are growing increasingly concerned about whether they have become too powerful the massive profits pouring into each company also illustrated why they have a combined market value of 6 4 trillion more than double their collective value when the covid 19 pandemic started 16 months ago apple apple s first iphone model capable of connecting to ultrafast 5g wireless networks continued to power major increases in quarterly revenue and profits for tech s most valuable company with iphone sales posting double digit growth over the previous year for the third consecutive quarter apple s profit and revenue for the april june period easily exceeded analyst estimates the cupertino california company earned 21 7 billion or 1 30 per share nearly doubling profits earned during the same period last year revenue surged 36 to 81 4 billion but in a tuesday conference call with analysts apple ceo tim cook lamented that the steadily spreading delta variant of the coronavirus is casting doubt on how the rest of the year will unfold the road to recovery will be a winding one cook said that uncertainty has already led apple to delay employees mass return to its offices from september to october most of apple s stores though are already open the iphone 12 released last autumn is shaping up to be apple s most popular model in several years largely because it s the first to work on the 5g networks that are still being built around the world apple s iphone sales totaled nearly 40 billion in the latest quarter up 50 from a year ago apple s services division the focal point of a high profile trial revolving around the commissions it collects from iphone apps saw revenue climb 33 from last year to 17 5 billion a potentially game changing decision from the trial completed in may is expected later this summer among apple s upcoming challenges is whether shortages of computer chips and other key parts will force the company to delay its next iphone this year as it did last year while apple expects revenue to rise 10 in the current quarter it said it may have more trouble getting parts for iphones and ipad during the upcoming months executives skirted questions about another possible iphone delay alphabet google s earnings improved markedly over the year ago period when the pandemic was starting to bite consumer spending and its partner advertising now that vaccines have allowed

germany s conservative candidate to succeed chancellor angela merkel armin laschet on tuesday called the withdrawal of forces the greatest debacle that nato has experienced since its foundation in china where the u s withdrawal is seen as creating both risks and opportunity foreign minister wang yi told u s secretary of state antony blinken in a phone call that the rapid departure of u s troops caused a severely adverse impact he also drew broader implications from the pullout saying it showed america s inability to transpose a foreign model of governance to a country with different cultural and historical attributes longtime critics of the war in afghanistan say claims about lost u s resolve and credibility ring hollow deciding not to keep fighting an unwinnable war for a less than vital interest hardly means the united states will not fight when the stakes are higher said stephen walt a scholar of international relations at harvard university on the contrary ending the long and futile war in afghanistan will allow washington to focus more attention on bigger priorities in his remarks to the nation biden latched on to the need to dislodge the united states from costly quagmires in an era of big power competition our true strategic competitors china and russia would love nothing more than the united states to continue to funnel billions of dollars in resources and attention into stabilizing afghanistan indefinitely he said biden said the united states could continue to disrupt terrorist organizations with air power although history could vindicate biden s order his administration faces difficult questions about squaring the decision with its near constant refrain that human rights and support for allies will be at the center of u s foreign policy those statements were often designed to create a contrast with the trump administration which denigrated european allies and cozied up to authoritarian leaning governments in egypt saudi arabia hungary and brazil critics of biden s policy seized on that rhetoric as the taliban swept into kabul and many women and girls sheltered at home in fear of a return to the militants harsh rule that had banned women from education and work when the taliban was last in power whatever happened to america is back said tobias ellwood who chairs the defense committee in the british parliament noting biden s promise to rebuild alliances and restore america s place in the world part of the confusion stems from the mix of ideologies inside the biden administration in particular longtime advocates of humanitarian interventions such as blinken and usaid administrator samantha power who routinely speak about the importance of human rights the outlook stands in contrast with biden s skepticism of the military which was apparent during his time as vice president when he argued against the ambitious troop surge that pentagon leaders were proposing in 2009 to check a taliban resurgence biden warning president barack obama against letting the top brass jam him unsuccessfully argued for a much leaner mission narrowly focused on blocking threats against the u s homeland but on issues involving other elements of american power like diplomacy or trade biden has articulated a more ambitious view seeking to take greater risks to advance human rights his administration has repeatedly called out china for what it views as a campaign of genocide against uyghur muslims in xinjiang for instance those things generally coexist without too much tension said a former defense official familiar with his thinking who spoke on the condition of anonymity to talk candidly in afghanistan there was a trade off biden s views and those of some of his aides were also heavily informed by the wrenching debates over intervention in libya and syria during the obama administration one of the realities that has been realized in the past two decades is that advancing human rights policy through military intervention is extremely difficult said stephen pomper who served as a senior white house official for human rights during the obama administration and is now acting policy director at the international crisis group he pointed to the 2011 intervention in libya which was intended as a shield for those rising up against dictator moammar gaddafi but which has been followed by a decade of chaos and insecurity that lesson is also apparent in afghanistan where despite important gains in health and women s rights the long u s backed effort was unable to secure lasting peace that s the lived experience of a lot of people who are now at the top of the foreign policy hierarchy in this administration pomper said brian katulis a scholar at the left leaning center for american progress said the administration has at times reacted to events at home and abroad rather than articulating an overarching ideology that raises the question what do you stand for when the chips are down he said on tuesday world powers began adjusting to the new reality of taliban rule as the group s de facto leader abdul ghani baradar arrived in the country for the first time in more than a decade at a news conference in kabul on tuesday taliban leaders offered conciliatory messages met with skepticism by some officials and analysts promising not to discriminate against women or to seek control of the media and suggesting that those who worked with the previous government and allied forces would be pardoned with the biden administration still taking stock of whether it will officially recognize the taliban as the government of afghanistan other countries began staking out their own approach russia which has long established ties to the taliban but does not officially recognize it praised the group on monday the situation is peaceful and good and everything has calmed down in the city the situation in kabul now under the taliban is better than it was under ashraf ghani said dmitry zhirnov the russian ambassador to afghanistan canadian prime minister justin trudeau meanwhile said his government had no plans to recognize the taliban government state department spokesman ned price said monday that the united states would decide whether to recognize its rule only after it demonstrates a willingness to govern inclusively and prohibit terrorists from operating on its soil we are still taking stock of what has transpired over the past 72 hours and the diplomatic and political implications of that price said
the delta variant is challenging china s costly strategy of isolating cities prompting warnings that chinese leaders who were confident they could keep the coronavirus out of the country need a less disruptive approach as the highly contagious variant pushes leaders in the united states australia and elsewhere to renew restrictions president xi jinping s government is fighting the most serious outbreak since last year s peak in wuhan the ruling communist party is reviving tactics that shut down china access to a city of 1 5 million people has been cut off flights canceled and mass testing ordered in some areas that zero tolerance strategy of quarantining every case and trying to block new infections from abroad helped to contain last year s outbreak and has kept china largely virus free but its impact on work and life for millions of people is prompting warnings that china needs to learn to control the virus without repeatedly shutting down the economy and society zhang wenhong a shanghai doctor who became prominent during the wuhan outbreak suggested in a social media post that china s strategy could change we will definitely learn more from the ongoing outbreak he said calling it a stress test for the nation the world needs to learn how to coexist with this virus wrote zhang who has 3 million followers on the widely used sina weibo platform china s controls will be tested when thousands of athletes reporters and others arrive for the winter olympics in beijing in february and the ruling party faces a politically sensitive change of leadership in late 2022 for which leaders want upbeat economic conditions last year china shut down much of the world s second biggest economy and cut off almost all access to cities with a total of 60 million people tactics imitated on a smaller scale by governments from asia to the americas that caused china s most painful economic contraction in five decades but beijing was able to allow business and domestic travel to resume in march 2020 the new infections many in people who have already been vaccinated have jolted global financial markets which worry beijing s response might disrupt manufacturing and supply chains the main stock indexes in shanghai tokyo and hong kong sank tuesday but were rising again thursday china needs to shift to creating barriers to infection within communities by stepping up vaccinations and quickly treating infected people while allowing business and travel to go ahead said xi chen a health economist at the yale school of public health he said country needs access to the full range of vaccines including allowing in the shot developed by germany s biontech i don t think zero tolerance can be sustained said chen even if you can lock down all the regions in china people might still die and more might die due to hunger or loss of jobs but beijing has shown no sign of abandoning its tactics disease controls must be even faster more firm stricter more expansive and ready he qinghua an official of the national health commission s disease control bureau said at a news conference saturday the year s biggest outbreak has tentatively been traced to airport employees who cleaned a russian airliner on july 10 in nanjing northwest of shanghai in jiangsu province according to health officials some travelers flew through nanjing to zhangjiajie a popular tourist spot southwest of shanghai in hunan province turning that city into a center for the virus s spread the disease was carried to beijing and other cities in more than 10 provinces on tuesday the government of zhangjiajie announced no one was allowed to leave the city imitating controls imposed on wuhan where the first virus cases were identified and other cities last year flights to nanjing and yangzhou a nearby city with 94 cases were suspended trains from those cities and 21 others to beijing were canceled jiangsu province set up highway checkpoints to test drivers the government called on people in beijing and the southern province of guangdong not to leave those areas if possible in yangzhou children at two tutoring centers were quarantined after a classmate tested positive according to zhou xiaoxiao a university student there she said some parts of the city were sealed eggs and some other food was scarce after shoppers cleared out supermarkets in anticipation of a lockdown zhou said she said the government was delivering rice to households the price of vegetables has risen that s nothing to me but to the kind of family whose life isn t very good and who have no income it s very troublesome said zhou 20 the 1 142 infections reported since mid july many linked to nanjing are modest compared with tens of thousands of new daily infections in india or the united states but they jolted leaders in china which hasn t recorded a fatality since early february the outbreak poses serious challenges to the country s hard won victory in the epidemic battle said the newspaper the global times which is published by the ruling party s people s daily china has reported 4 636 deaths out of about 93 000 confirmed cases so far most of the people infected in nanjing had been vaccinated and few cases are severe the head of the critical care unit at the hospital of the city s southeastern university yang yi told the shanghai news outlet the paper she said that means vaccines are protective though concerns remain that chinese made vaccines offer less protection than some others authorities have blamed nanjing airport managers and local officials for failing to enforce safety rules and to detect infections for 10 days until july 20 after the virus spread a 64 year old woman who is believed to have carried the virus from nanjing to yangzhou was arrested tuesday on charges of hindering disease prevention police announced cleaning staff at nanjing s new international terminal mingled with co workers in the domestic wing when they should have been separated according to news reports the russian flight was diverted due to bad weather from shanghai where airports are better equipped to handle foreign travelers still the city of 9 3 million people is the second biggest in eastern china after shanghai and has more resources than many smaller cities china needs to learn how to allow the virus to exist in areas with high vaccination rates and stronger health care said chen the economist he noted some areas have vaccinated at least 80 of adults i don t think they are blind to this said chen they should already be thinking about it

new you can now listen to fox news articles it was just the other day two weeks ago exactly that the biden administration announced the suspension of private property rights in america building owners are prohibited from forcing their tenants to pay rent other people now have the right to live in your house for free america s housing stock has been nationalized from here on out it s controlled by the biden administration but wait a second you ask this is america can that be legal no it s not legal it s unconstitutional the supreme court said so clearly but as maxine waters put it who cares what are those old judges going to do about it what army do they control they re not doing anything so the biden administration ignored our highest court and just did it thanks to covid the media has decided they can do that they can do anything so they are where does the leave the rest of us in a word exposed without property rights protected by a functioning judicial system american citizens have nothing at all everything you thought you owned very much including your body now belongs to the democratic party where you travel who you speak to where you live what you say and write and think all this is now controlled by the party and everything means everything even your medical autonomy and this is funny because for decades they ve told us that medical decisions can only be made between you and your personal physician that is a sacred pact politicians have no right to tell doctors what to do hey politicians get your hands off my body that would be the handmaid s tale remember turns out they didn t mean it bloomberg columnist called out for spreading fake news on florida antibody treatment and just to show you how much they didn t mean it we take you now to new york city whose mayor is not only famously incompetent but physically unclean of the 340 million americans now living in this country bill de blasio is the single last person you d go to for medical advice his diet consists almost exclusively of bong hits and pringles there s no chance he brushes his teeth every day your 17 year old stoner nephew has much better personal hygiene and yet somehow because bill de blasio still has political power due to the fact that a tiny group of people once voted for him bill de blasio has decided to overrule practicing physicians and force his subjects to take medicine they may or may not need and in some cases that might hurt them whether they want to or not that s the rule in new york city you re no longer allowed to walk indoors even on private property unless you ve taken a covid shot and carry the documents to prove that you have that s now the law a law that by the way not a single person voted for voting being part of that outmoded racist system we used to call democracy no more according to new york s new order indoor spaces are off limits to the unvaccinated how are we defining indoor spaces indoor spaces are those that have a roof or overhang and three or more walls in order to enter venues covered by the rule you will have to show id along with proof of vaccination that s the law at a press conference yesterday bill de blasio displayed this graphic showing all the places you re not allowed to go without identification and proof of vaccination your papers please that includes restaurants bars cafeterias grocery stores bakeries fast food places and aquariums hope you re not hungry or looking to see fish you can t go thousands of fake covid 19 vaccine cards some from china seized by us customs businesses in new york are forced to hang posters explaining the mandate near their entrances they don t own their walls either bill de blasio explained all this de blasio and it s easy all you have to do is show proof of vaccination that could be a cdc paper card that could be an excelsior pass an nyc covid safe app whatever works all you got to do is show that proof and have id as well oh it s totally easy just show your medical papers and this applies only to covid by the way no one is checking your hepatitis or hiv status that would be terrible but covid yes it s absolutely required or you re not allowed to eat and all you need is proof of vaccination and identification but wait a minute weren t we told it s racist to require id for voting but now it s not racist to require id for people to go inside of buildings in our largest city so what does this mean for the 72 of young african americans who are not vaccinated they re not going to be able to go anywhere so this policy by the principles of equity has a disparate impact that s the phrase they use to describe racism in action it affects some groups more profoundly than others and the group most affected by this is young african americans new zealand to enter nationwide lockdown after single coronavirus case found so how can it stand where s the civil rights division of the justice department aren t they jumping on this it s worse than a standardized test bill de blasio didn t explain any of that people with power don t need to explain themselves anymore if you don t comply you re going to jail not for looting that s fine in new york now it s reparations but failing to follow a law no one voted for and show your papers in a restaurant that s something bill de blasio will not accept de blasio and we re going to remind people that we really want people to take this seriously don t fool around with fake vaccination cards by the way it s against the law and there are serious penalties for that serious penalties what are you going to do to us the same thing you did to the people who looted macy s buzz off dumbo so what exactly does this law say we checked the fine print because we believe in the law and this rule does not allow for exemptions period not for religious reasons because religion is stupid worshiping bill de blasio is our new state religion and not for medical reasons because bill de blasio is now your doctor and he ll decide what is necessary so we asked city hall in new york to see if we were missing something they couldn t answer the question but told us that people who had concerns can contact the city s small business hotline for more information so like morons we did that we followed instructions the operator on the hotline told us they ve been inundated with hundreds of calls from people asking the same question but they didn t have the answer sorry it s a mystery surge in new covid 19 cases amid delta spread going very steeply upward finally this afternoon purely because we re a news organization and they suspected we might report some of this city hall got back to us and finally sent us some guidance they said that businesses can t allow unvaccinated customers indoors for anything beyond a quick and limited purpose so there are no exceptions to this rule and that would include people who have already had covid and therefore have high levels of protective antibodies in your system that doesn t matter they have to get the shot anyway bill de blasio demands it is that safe i ve had covid i ve recovered i have high levels of antibodies not going to get covid unlike a lot of people who have just been vaccinated probably not going to get it but you can get the vaccine anyway is that a good idea not a ton of research on this that s frowned on now but researchers at mount sinai hospital have looked into it they found it may not be safe it turns out that serious whole body reactions including chills fever and joint problems are far more common in people who d recovered from covid and got the vaccine anyway no one is surprised by this this is why we don t vaccinate people against diseases they ve already recovered from except now they must get the vaccine even though it doesn t seem to offer much protection from covid infection weirdly ask texas governor greg abbott he s vaccinated he s also sick with covid right now how d that happen what s going on here exactly what s this about we d love to know unfortunately we re long past the time when the people in power felt they had to answer even simple questions the emphasis is on us and our total obedience the disgraced governor of new york the second to last person you d call for medical advice told more than 600 000 healthcare workers in his state that regardless of what they think about medicine they must get the shot cuomo i think we need dramatic action to get control of this situation so in new york and our state hospitals all patient facing healthcare workers must get vaccinated there will be no testing option for patient facing healthcare workers that is a point of contact that could be a serious spreading event and we want to make sure that those healthcare workers are vaccinated period nobody has a sense of humor anymore getting a covid lecture from andrew cuomo the person single handedly responsible for the highest death rate from covid in america let s go ahead and put idi amin as the head of the human rights commission next time shall we and then not allow anyone to laugh about it chicago pharmacist arrested for allegedly selling 125 covid 19 vaccine cards on ebay so here you have andrew cuomo who may or may not be a made member of the mafia telling you that he suddenly knows more about covid than practicing nurses and physicians he s telling them what to do he s giving them a medical mandate what s interesting is he feels he has to what s interesting is how many of new york s health care workers remain unvaccinated they don t have the information necessary to make that decision they don t know enough about covid they treat covid and yet as of today more than 75 of new york s 450 000 hospital workers as well as 74 of the adult care facility workers and 67 of the 150 000 nursing home workers have taken the covid shot the rest have not why is that maybe before we mandate anything we should answer that question why would people in the medical profession be willing to risk losing their jobs over the shot that s a sincere question what s the answer hey business insider hey atlantic magazine hey new york times why don t you do a story on that and just answer the simple question and then answer this why are bureaucrats with no medical expertise whatsoever bill de blasio the pothead who doesn t wash his socks andrew cuomo telling nurses and doctors what drugs they must take this is totally nuts reporter houston methodist hospital requiring all staff members to get vaccinated for covid 19 or be fired nurse jennifer bridges right off the bat i pretty much decided i was not going to do it everybody in america should have the right to decide what they put in their body reporter jennifer bridges has worked at houston methodist in baytown more than 6 years nurse jennifer bridges i planned on staying with methodist the rest of my life reporter she spent the last year and a half treating coronavirus patients and even got sick herself nurse jennifer bridges i just had an antibody test a week ago but it doesn t count for them it doesn t work reporter more than a hundred co workers have joined jennifer with this lawsuit against the hospital it claims methodist is forcing its employees to be human guinea pigs click here to get the fox news app it s hard to argue with their reasoning and if you want to argue with it what s the argument against it speak slowly so we can understand but no one wants to argue anything anymore it s purely about obedience it s hardly about medicine more than 150 healthcare workers in the houston hospital system were fired remember that next time they tell you there s a healthcare shortage in this country this is lunacy we should not go along with it it has nothing to do with medicine it s a terrifying precedent that if we let solidify we will deeply regret this is not about covid it is about the existence of rational decision making in this country and personal autonomy this article is adapted from tucker carlson s opening commentary on the august 17 2021 edition of tucker carlson tonight

evaluating the business the company considers and uses non gaap measures such as non gaap operating expenses non gaap loss from operations including non gaap operating margin non gaap net loss including non gaap net margin and non gaap basic and diluted net loss per ads as a supplemental measure to review and assess its operating performance the presentation of the non gaap financial measure is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america u s gaap the company defines non gaap measures by measures excluding the impact of share based compensation expenses the company presents the non gaap financial measure because it is used by the management to evaluate the operating performance and formulate business plans the company also believes that the use of the non gaap measures facilitates investors assessment of its operating performance non gaap measures are not defined under u s gaap and is not presented in accordance with u s gaap this non gaap financial measure has limitations as analytical tools one of the key limitations of using aforementioned non gaap measures is that it does not reflect all items of expenses that affect the company s operations share based compensation expenses have been and may continue to be incurred in the business and are not reflected in the presentation of non gaap measures further the non gaap measure may differ from the non gaap information used by other companies including peer companies and therefore their comparability may be limited the company compensates for these limitations by reconciling the non gaap financial measures to the nearest u s gaap performance measures all of which should be considered when evaluating the company s performance the company encourages you to review its financial information in its entirety and not rely on a single

avenues for young people to drink and use other drugs were largely extinguished at the beginning of the pandemic according to a study published in the journal of adolescent health while the percentage of users decreased during lockdown the frequency of alcohol use amongst adolescents actually increased boredom and isolation led both heavy and social users to use substances more routinely with around 49 percent of adolescents engaging in solitary substance use and 56 percent of young adults reported symptoms of anxiety and or depressive disorders eventually some reached a point where they had to seriously reevaluate their relationship with substances whether it s alcohol weed or other drugs every day i would start drinking at 5 o clock on the dot said janelle tan a 25 year old who started working from home during the pandemic i wasn t even drinking because i wanted to get drunk it just became a ritual and a routine tan said that although she was always a heavy drinker before the pandemic she strayed from her rule of never keeping alcohol in the house drinking to create artificial divisions within her day by the end of 2020 tan said she was finishing multiple bottles in one night until one particularly jarring experience forced her to reflect on her habit i remember there was a snowstorm in new york city in december right before christmas tan said i went to the liquor store and spent 80 on alcohol to stock up i ended up drinking through it in three days and that was a huge wake up call for me tan quit cold turkey between january and april 2021 and although she has been drinking with friends since businesses opened again at the beginning of the summer tan said she is much more conscious about how much and frequently she consumes making sure that she s using substances socially and not habitually for some a reemergence of social events has not been an invitation to resume using substances taylor fogarty a junior at columbia university spent years working in the service industry and managing bars leading her to drink and use drugs regularly especially during late hours but when she quit working in the service industry right before the pandemic she didn t quit drinking alcohol i was drinking a lot during lockdown out of pure boredom and isolation fogarty said that all came to an end in october 2020 after a night she describes as rock bottom i had a particularly bad birthday where i got really drunk and lashed out at a bunch of people fogarty said i woke up in my own throw up after hooking up with a stranger off tinder i had just turned 27 the night before and i literally just woke up and was like all right this is it you re done shortly after fogarty checked into an alcoholics anonymous program a step she said she would have never taken if meetings weren t held virtually attending an aa meeting on zoom wasn t as intimidating as walking into a church fogarty said especially as a young person there s a lot of stigma associated with going to aa and with everything being online i could also go to a meeting anywhere at all hours popular swipe left below to view more authors swipe the toxic culture at tesla the toxic culture at

that if he weren t forced to live near his support networks he wouldn t have had the courage to get help the 23 year old graduated from college at the beginning of the pandemic and moved back home as campuses shut down in college luke said he was a heavy drinker and would binge drink with his friends three to four days a week and even when he moved back home to boston he would still hang out with friends and drink socially even though i was drinking with people i was always overdoing it luke said these habits only worsened as the pandemic went on as he was still living at home and working a new job remotely during the winter a time when he said he felt the most isolated he would black out alone three to four days a week after a series of near death drunk driving incidents as well as regrettable conversations he had with friends while intoxicated luke decided something had to change at the beginning of april he joined alcoholics anonymous and has been sober since he attributes his sobriety not only to the pandemic but also to being home with his parents having my parents see me drunk all the time and be like what are you doing made me realize i had an issue luke said i think if the pandemic didn t happen i would still be drinking the pandemic accelerated everything super fast including my alcoholism but for many young people being stuck at home with their parents only increased their substance use when the pandemic hit zoë who declined to give her last name for privacy reasons started using substances to cope once she realized that living at home was quickly becoming a more permanent situation every day i would wake up and smoke out of my window or drink like half a bottle of bacardi zoë said in september of 2020 zoë finally went back to campus she was less isolated living in a more social environment and said her substance use actually decreased at home for me there are so many rules zoë said it kind of felt rebellious to be drinking or smoking and also just living with my family was a lot since starting a new job at the beginning of the summer that requires drug testing zoë has been using substances less however she finds herself reaching for alcohol as a way to deal with her emotions more than she did before the pandemic how frequently i drink now depends more on my mood zoë said if i have a bad day at work i want to go to the liquor store if i have a good day i m chillin during a year of isolation many young adults have had to find new ways to cope while shaking off habits perpetuated by a culture where social events and substance use often go hand in hand and while many found themselves at their all time low it acted as a catalyst for necessary change and reflection on their relationships with substances getting sober during the pandemic made me realize how much i drink tan said and even though i still do i notice how i feel when i m drinking and when i m not i know where and when to set boundaries for myself
in an endless stream of bad news about the lack of affordable housing in our state i ll offer words of hope and perspective from one of maine s larger cities about the author alan casavant a biddeford native and former biddeford high school teacher and maine legislator currently serves as mayor he is a candidate for re election in november the pandemic altered the landscape our desirability as a place to live has fueled intense pressure on our housing stock as more and more people discovered not only the joys of working at home but also the joys of doing so while living in maine biddeford is not immune in the last decade entrepreneurs and courageous urban planning helped the city transform itself from an exhausted mill town to a city with award winning restaurants beautiful beaches a thriving university and ample trails and parks new residents have arrived from all areas of the country along with immigrants from around the world we re now the youngest city in maine unfortunately consequences of this economic resurgence have emerged intending to recoup their significant investments new owners sprucing up tenements and repurposing former mill spaces have raised rents that s expected and reasonable but it puts extreme pressure on families who now struggle to find housing that they can afford homelessness has increased in biddeford and other cities all over maine normally associated with mental illness or substance abuse the problem now also includes people who work hard but whose wages have not kept up with rising costs waiting lists for subsidized housing run years into the future and rules and programs that might have worked in the past clearly need adjustment like every community in maine biddeford now has skyrocketing demand for housing that working people can afford as mayor i ve been working with our city council to stimulate more affordable housing initiatives we continue to examine zoning and density ideas additionally actions we take regarding potential new housing always push developers to include affordable units in any market rate project they build that s a top priority for us advertisement led by maine house speaker ryan fecteau biddeford s state senator susan deschambault and the rest of our legislative delegation the legislature has passed a new law that now defines affordable housing as an acceptable use under maine s tax increment financing regulations city staff smartly identified this possible change in law and worked with our local delegation to help pass it an immediate benefit of this change will be the construction of 36 units of affordable housing under the supervision of the biddeford housing authority municipal leaders can independently forge solutions too a few months ago i had a conversation with a local developer which then led to some remarkably innovative thinking by city staff ultimately that led to our city council approving a creative package that includes 250 market rate apartments built by one developer designed specifically to fit the needs of health care workers in the nearby hospital and medical offices rents will be market rate but lower than new apartments in other parts of the city the creativity appears in what i might call part b it s a linked deal with a second developer which secures biddeford a seat at the table during master planning for an adjacent 70 acres of land the general concept is a mixture of affordable and market rate housing family homes natural environmental protections and a trail system that would connect the area to city parks schools the eastern trail and the riverwalk related biddeford to collaborate with developer on master plan for large housing project in july the press herald editorial board wrote that many communities will have to build more housing near jobs amenities and services and along busy travel corridors coordinated with public transit that s exactly what our city council just made possible i was inspired by how nimble and flexible all parties were city staff the two developers and the council as this uniquely crafted solution came together maine s affordable housing crisis is a figment of nobody s imagination it s real it hurts working people and it s indeed a crisis but i m happy to report that maine s people elected officials municipal employees and business professionals are entirely capable of working together collaboratively that s how maine will originate great ideas that make serious headway toward easing this historic housing crunch it just happened in biddeford so i know it can happen in your town or city too send questions comments to the editors previous next filed under
amid low rates the interest earnings on the state treasury s investment portfolio of nearly 5 billion dipped to 35 4 million in the fiscal year that ended june 30 state treasurer dennis milligan reported tuesday the benton republican told the state board of finance that he is proud of how hard his investment team has worked over the past year i don t have to tell you how difficult the last year has been for investors he said my investment team has been relentless in pursuing opportunities to provide our portfolio with as much cost saving and interest producing opportunities as possible exceeding even our own internal projections for 2021 afterward grant wallace chief deputy treasurer for programs and services said the treasurer s office initially projected 25 million to 27 million in interest earnings in fiscal 2021 the fiscal 2021 annualized return was 0 675 said milligan spokeswoman stacy peterson milligan told the finance board that the state treasury earned more money in fiscal 2021 than it did in fiscal 2015 when interest rates were similar earnings totaled 22 3 million in fiscal 2015 according to milligan s report to the board fiscal 2021 was the second consecutive fiscal year in which the treasury s interest earnings declined the report showed in fiscal 2020 earnings dropped to 80 7 million from 116 9 million in fiscal 2019 the previous high was 113 1 million in fiscal 2008 milligan took office in january 2015 milligan said the treasury s long term investment portfolio in the last quarter earned about 10 5 million that portfolio is made up mostly of agency and u s treasury bonds and mortgage backed securities peterson said afterward the federal open market committee is continuing its quantitative easing program and purchasing u s treasury bonds and mortgage backed securities which has kept interest rates low and asset prices inflated across all sectors of the market milligan said the market is flush with cash as investors wait for rates to rise and any time there is an upward fluctuation bonds are picked up quickly he said this along with the fed s continual purchases has limited the bond supply simply put there just aren t enough bonds for the amount of cash investors have as investors wait for opportunities to present themselves they like we are watching the bond market intently ready to buy as soon as rates fluctuate higher milligan said this is how we have been operating my entire administration and are well prepared to make those purchases when it is advantageous to the treasury he said the state treasury s short term investment portfolio which consists of demand and money market accounts and commercial paper earned roughly 659 000 in the quarter that ended june 30 this portfolio s earnings are heavily dependent on the federal interest rate which has been sitting under 0 25 for quite some time he said milligan said the treasury s investment portfolio has grown from about 3 5 billion to nearly 5 billion we are setting up a solid foundation on which treasurers can build upon and by which taxpayers can rest assured they are getting the most out of their hard earned money he said milligan is barred from seeking reelection under the state s term limits amendment he has announced his bid for state auditor next year a post held by term limited russellville republican andrea lea since 2015 milligan said his office last month hired senior investment manager steve pulley of conway to work with his investment division we are excited to have him on board and in keeping with my policy of having multiple sets of eyes on the work that we do for the state milligan said pulley has served as president and founder of chickasaw ventures inc a startup management consultancy since 2020 according to his resume his resume shows that he was first vice president of crews associates investment bankers of little rock from 2008 19 and also worked for the firm from 1984 2006 and was senior vice president and corporate risk mitigation specialist at stephens insurance group in 2007 his salary at the treasurer s office is 110 000 a year peterson said david f freeman jr a partner with arnold porter of washington d c said in a memo distributed to the finance board that the state treasury may improve its investment return and reduce the portfolio risk by seeking the board s approval of an amendment to the state treasurer s investment policies manual to make four changes freeman said these changes are allowing investment in any corporate debt obligations that are rated bbb or higher by at least two national rating agencies allowing investment in rated investment grade bank deposits as corporate obligations with or without collateral or deposit insurance allowing investment in any fund or investment pool whose assets are limited to those that the treasurer could invest in directly making clear that the treasurer is permitted to invest in corporate debt obligations that are privately issued we are in an environment of pervasively low interest rates said amy michaliszyn executive vice president of federated hermes in pittsburgh the market is tumultuous there is tremendous pressure on the short end of the yield curve pushing rates down even further there is some scarcity of commercial paper there is a a convergence of issues like we have never seen before so it is very important that investment policies have the depth and breadth they need to have to control risk but also for appropriate opportunity she told the finance board that she is not charging for any advice to the state treasury we are just industry colleagues with the arkansas state treasury michaliszyn said i would hope that at some point that the treasury may consider to use some of our investment vehicles but there is no obligation to do that she said federated hermes works with a total of 37 states wallace told the finance board that we would be looking at probably the november meeting to bring back some recommendations some thoughts for the board to consider and hopefully having those available to take in january
by nikki slusher over the last few years i ve found myself getting exhausted from what has become the modern day republican party i am not speaking about regular republicans but those who are elected officials in charge of them more specifically senator rand paul r ky and governor ron desantis r fl have been two of the more prominent republicans that every time i hear speak have me thinking what in the personality disorder void of any self awareness narcissistic stunted growth nonsense are they going on about now both lack any comprehension skills when it comes to facts science or the bible while one misleads his entire state about the coronavirus the other is having to kiss the ring of his king and apologizing for backing a different republican candidate in ohio from his lord and savior both seem to also be prophets that keep believing at least publicly that election fraud will be discovered and show trump won the election in 2020 even though literally zero evidence exists to prove this at this point i m confused no one has nicknamed either of them nostradumbass nobody should ever take medical advice from rand paul considering he isn t even a real doctor unless you believe that self certifying yourself after creating your own certification board because you couldn t pass the one already established is legit then please do continue on but the revelation of sen paul being a self licensed ophthalmologist answers the question of why he is unable to see farther than the brim of his tinfoil maga hat as for moron deathsantis whose state is one that s leading his constituents six feet down in the ground he recently announced his plan to ensure educators and students get covid while the wannabe tyrant tries to threaten school boards and teachers by withholding their pay if they require masks a move that is illegal since it s tax payers money not his we should be afraid of what this means if he becomes the gop front runner for president in 2024 if he s willing to withhold funding to schools what would he do if elected to blue states that he sees as defiant to his agenda if i m going to be quite frank neither of these men are acting like real conservatives though a foundation to the framework of the republican party is giving local and state governments the authority to decide what is best for the people who reside there a concept that their actions have shown over and over again to be counterintuitive before the public is forced to continue listening to these gqp members as to why covid 19 is just like the flu we should be asking ourselves why they are so against implementing protections to prevent it after all chances are they are vaccinated and if they fall ill they ll be covered by paid time off and top of the line health insurance funded by our own tax dollars it s really interesting to watch sen paul gov desantis and the rest of the trump train rail against universal health care and minimum wage as a socialistic agenda that will destroy murica while that s exactly how they get their six figure salaries and own health insurance yet these same people who whine about vaccines and masks being mandatory by private and public organizations about two hours later we see the same individuals then turn around on nighttime news networks blame immigrants and the radical left for increasing crime rates across the country the whole personal responsibility argument only applies when it benefits themselves the only thing pro life about them is how to keep their stock portfolios alive and thriving why else would florida gov ron desantis urge floridians to use regeneron a significantly more expensive antibody compared to a free vaccine which was given to donald trump sen paul s wife purchased shares in gilead one of the leading companies in developing treatment for the coronavirus which also happened to be the first stock she bought in over 10 years and just so happened to do so only one day after the first clinical trial for remdesivir began of course it wasn t because of the paul s understanding of the stock market but perhaps due to the briefing the senator received a month earlier on the severity of the coronavirus oh he also failed to disclose the march 2020 purchase until this week oops meanwhile their constituents are gasping for air while trying to facetime their families and friends to say their final goodbyes the only reason these leaders want their citizens to have personal liberties is plain and simple all they want is to keep profiting off their voters falling ill and dying it may not be the best re election plan but if they destroy everything in their way they ll have successfully collapsed our health care system limited voting rights back to white americans only and be able to blame the biden administration for their failures while their supporters continue waiting for their dear leader s reinstatement the only thing these men have been successful at is exhausting health care professionals making the public sick or just straight up killing them and making millions off their stocks it s time to vote for real leaders america and to stop electing egotistical maniacs who spend their days crying on tucker carlson about how mean democrats are to them on twitter we can and must do better if we want to save our country
covix 19 volatility is back monday saw the vix index which tracks how investors spend to hedge against volatility in options markets jump above 30 for the first time since the brief but violent correction for fang stocks in early september that correction was very much internally generated as a buildup of speculation through call options forced investors to buy tech stocks this incident is somewhat different this time around the market is responding to a clearer external threat the covid 19 numbers aren t good there is good reason to question whether the headline numbers are misleading but that didn t negate the psychological impact of new cases in the us topping their record from the summer wave in the sun bel people testing positive now are far more likely to survive than they were in march or april and the death rate continues to decline but statistics on hospitalization make clear that the disease is meaningfully recurring in a way that cannot be dismissed as an artefact of more testing in terms of numbers hospitalized the us is plainly in a third wave the problem is greater in europe where even germany the most successful major european country in dealing with the pandemic so far is seeing a rise in hospitalizations in germany s case this is only a second wave which remains much smaller than the first but the problem is the direction of travel which is plainly seeing the pandemic having a greater effect again crucially this means that the disease is once again creating more economic damage in the us and western europe that is what matters for the market a chart of economic activity in germany produced by longview economics in london shows that the country had almost returned to normal for the time of year but is now slipping significantly combine all this with scary news such as rash of infections in the us vice president s office and a curfew in paris and it isn t surprising that the market reacted as if on cue the covid fear index which shows the relative performance of the s p 1500 food retailers sub index compared to the s p 1500 hotels resorts and cruise lines index jolted back upward on monday the hotels index had its worst day since june food retailers have once again outperformed by a full 100 for the year this suggests it is the immediate fear of direct disruption from covid 19 that is moving markets there is still nothing to suggest that investors think they need to brace for an economic shock as severe as the one that hit in the spring the last seven months have taught everybody how to stay active in time of coronavirus but monday s market behavior can be seen primarily as a belated move to account for the growing risk from covid this is a discriminating virus in the corporate world the identity of its worst victims and of those who survive unharmed can be surprising no sector has been worse hit than travel leisure and tourism for obvious reasons the us hotels sector is down 40 for the year globally the hotels restaurants and leisure sector is still down by 10 but there is great variation within the leisure sector remarkably the s p 1500 restaurants sub index has outperformed the s p 500 generally the larger quoted us restaurant chains aren t reliant on inside dining by moving to curb side pickup and beefing up their delivery options they may even have benefited and presumably there must be high hopes that they will eventually displace smaller inside dining operations altogether renewed lockdowns might deliver the coup de grace to expensive restaurants or to the whole concept of eating out still a lot of hope is embedded in the price it s not so long since restaurants traded at much the same price sales multiple as the s p 1500 as a whole restaurants were already perceived to be worth a big premium even before covid 19 hit now their sales multiple is double that of the market some interesting bets on changes in consumer behavior after the virus are already being made return to chile almost exactly a year ago chile suddenly and dramatically descended into chaos people took to the streets throughout the country a skyscraper in santiago was set alight and within days the country s president had had to agree to hold a referendum over establishing a new constitution the current one was written under the dictator augusto pinochet and chileans chafing at inequality had had enough of it after a covid driven delay that referendum finally took place at the weekend and delivered an emphatic vote for reform the country will now spend much of the next two years drawing up a new constitution the whole story has faded from memory in the northern hemisphere amid the drama of 2020 but the prolonged political uncertainty has had an impact chile had previously been known for its stability starting with a remarkably peaceful transition from dictatorship 30 years ago and the protests came as a shock normally chilean share prices move broadly in line with the price of copper its main export this year copper has staged a big rally which is usually enough for the andean economies to lead the emerging markets for a while the opposite has happened in practice it is hard to see this changing for a while there is another moment of uncertainty next april when chileans will vote for delegates to a new constitutional assembly then it could take a year to write the new document which must be agreed by two thirds of delegates the likelihood is that any new constitution will be much less market driven than the neoliberal model adopted by pinochet chile s market performance over the last year shows that much political risk is already priced in but it will still be a while before clarity can be achieved everyone should watch carefully what transpires because the economic model established under pinochet was much admired and copied in latin america and beyond chile s pension system is now the center of popular anger and yet for decades it was taken as a template for a series of countries embarking on welfare state reform the problems for chile s system will likely recur to a greater or lesser degree in other countries that adopted a defined contribution system of pensions just as a reminder of what might be at stake i will quote again one email i received from a chilean woman who had had enough of the unfairness of chile s welfare state truth is that people are tired of working 40 years and putting their retirement money into programs which take 10 each month just so when you finally retire they give you approximately 200 a month which is not enough to finance the cost of living in chile and you might say hey but why don t they just get their whole ton of money they saved no they can t even if someone has a terminal cancer they will not give them the whole amount of money saved because that s not how the system works when our politicians get 11 000 a month but our minimum wage is 469 approximately which is what most of the country gets a month that inequality is violent when our politicians pass laws to raise their wage in less than a week but laws to have a better health plan and release money for medical supplies take months and months that s violence none of this should lessen the nation s achievement if it does manage to continue its transition from dictatorship such changes are seldom made this peacefully but the experience should be a reminder to investors the world over it may well be healthy for much of the rest of the world to move to a more egalitarian model that people recognize as fair that is what the populist movements around the western world plainly want and it is always best to avoid bloodshed but such transitions are unlikely to be made without a negative hit to the value of stocks and bonds survival tips let s return to chile it s the elongated country that gave the world the poet pablo neruda to enjoy the genius of neruda and his effect on those around him you might try il postino a wonderful movie from 1994 that infuriatingly doesn t appear to be on any of the main streaming services at present this scene gives an idea of the impact his words can have the plot is that neruda in exile helps a shy postman to win the girl of his dreams by writing poems for him the poetry loses much in translation but there are still ways for those who don t speak spanish to appreciate it this is a beautiful reading of one of my favorite neruda poems leaning into the afternoons which handily comes with subtitles or you can try listening to a snippet that i found on the internet of a setting of this poem by the american composer matthew harris to declare an interest this is a recording of the premiere and the work had been commissioned by the choir i was singing in at the time cantori new

nezavisimaya gazeta biden ditches exporting democracy us president joe biden s address to the american people in which he made an assessment of the developments in afghanistan surprised both his opponents and supporters according to biden washington had no plans to establish democracy in afghanistan but focused on the fight against international terrorism experts believe that the defeat in afghanistan raises the odds of an early change in the white house the very fact that biden had to deliver such a speech points to a systemic crisis in american foreign policy senior research fellow at the russian academy of sciences institute for us and canadian studies vladimir vasilyev pointed out he noted that the current administration in washington had suffered a string of failures stemming from the inflow of illegal immigrants to the us its consent to the completion of the nord stream 2 gas pipeline and the situation in afghanistan clearly the biden administration has failed to hammer out a clear foreign policy both on the afghan track and in general it s hard to say where all this is headed perhaps it will lead to a reshuffle of the white house foreign policy team vasilyev said according to the commentator there is a need to look closer at the us intelligence community which played an important role in trump s defeat and now has come to understand that it has traded bad for worse biden publicly framed the intelligence community praising its work on july 27 a few days before the taliban outlawed in russia captured kabul which caught the us by surprise the expert believes that mutual mistrust between us law enforcement agencies and the political leadership may expand now the question is whether biden will share nixon s fate the current us president seems to be a perfect candidate to take the blame for the failure in afghanistan vasilyev said biden s possible departure from the white house will definitely have an impact on us relations with russia and even if biden retains his position us foreign policy will change however the changes will become clear only after a reshuffle begins in the white house which is highly probable after the afghanistan defeat izvestia europe ex soviet countries to face threats after taliban s resurgence in afghanistan the biden administration intends to earmark up to 500 mln to aid afghan refugees albania and kosovo have agreed to accommodate these refugees at washington s request meanwhile the european union fears a new migration crisis and a rise in the influence of russia and china izvestia writes the west s role in afghanistan will indeed continue to wane as western countries will have less tools to impact the situation director general of the russian international affairs council andrey kortunov said according to him russia and china will probably have to face more allegations if beijing and moscow make agreements with the taliban the west will label it as a cynical policy based on a disregard for human rights secular civil society institutions and gender equity programs are destined to come under attack in afghanistan russia and china will hardly oppose that and will be blamed for cooperating with the taliban the expert pointed out over 270 000 people have fled afghanistan since the beginning of the year iran and pakistan usually receive most of the afghan refugees central asian countries uzbekistan turkmenistan and tajikistan are reluctant to accommodate refugees from afghanistan which is what the americans initially counted on said director of the center for global studies and international relations at the russian foreign ministry s diplomatic academy vadim kozyulin the main threat that the taliban pose to russia and central asia comes from their ideas islamist ideas are already popular in central asian countries and kyrgyzstan the commentator explained afghanistan may turn into a new pocket of terrorism the danger is that there are a lot of ethnic uzbeks and tajiks in afghanistan who can cross borders and enter central asia without being seen kozyulin emphasized kortunov in turn stressed that afghans viewed eu countries rather than central asian states as their final destination one of the demands that the international community will have for the taliban will be to prevent a mass exodus of people from the country one thing is clear for now it will be a serious issue and it s hard to predict its scope the analyst said vedomosti russian defense ministry unlikely to ditch il 112 project despite crash an ilyushin il 112v crashed near the kubinka military airfield on august 17 the plane was on its way from a voronezh aircraft factory to participate in the international military technical forum army 2021 set to begin in kubinka on august 22 vedomosti writes a video shows the aircraft s right engine ablaze which presumably triggered the plane crash the cause of the engine fire is to be established through an investigation since it was a prototype deputy minister of industry and trade oleg bocharov who supervises the aviation industry will head a commission looking into the causes of the accident a ministry spokesperson said the il 112v project is a protracted one like many others launched in the 1990s the plane was supposed to replace light military transport and passenger planes such as the antonov an 24 and an 26 whose operational life will expire in the current decade the defense ministry decided to abandon the project in 2011 following eight years of development efforts and cut off funding however the project was reopened in 2014 because no alternatives had been found work was delayed once again because of the need for major design changes according to oleg panteleyev from the aviaport agency no theories should be voiced until the cause of the crash is established as for the future use of the engine installed on the il 112v plane there is a need to increase the power system capacity in order to fully exploit the aircraft s potential which is in fact equal to creating a new engine panteleyev noted the russian defense ministry will not ditch the il 112v program because it needs a plane of this size and there are no alternatives director of the center for analysis of strategies and technologies ruslan pukhov emphasized however it is clear that work on the project will be delayed once again the expert added izvestia gas prices hit new highs natural gas prices have soared to record levels all around the world prices skyrocketed by nearly 1 000 in europe to 580 per 1 000 cubic meters and by 500 in east asia in the past year analysts believe that the era of cheap gas is over izvestia notes according to research director at vygon consulting maria belova the post 2020 coronavirus economic recovery is the main reason gas prices are also climbing due to low stocks caused by the cold last winter and the current hot summer president of the institute of energy and finance marcel salikhov believes that apart from economic and natural factors there is also an environmental aspect in fact the fight against global warming and carbon emissions is playing into the hands of some hydrocarbon energy sources european carbon emission prices have nearly tripled over the past 12 months making gas more competitive than coal while contributing to soaring prices there are also tactical issues related to the adjusted strategy of russia s energy giant gazprom the main provider of gas to europe the company made no effort to increase supplies in the past several months like it used to do and preferred to rake in additional profits from rising prices salikhov added market price hikes are often followed by rapid declines the current high prices are negatively affecting demand in june and july europe s gas consumption hit its lowest level in five years however demand for liquefied natural gas remained high in asia it s difficult to expect prices to remain at such a level for a long time because producers will increase supply and as for demand there are alternatives to gas which are getting more competitive as gas prices rise salikhov noted izvestia russian watchdog lashes out at google for blackmail attempt google sought to blackmail the russian government by a making a statement about plans to stop removing illegal content from search results izvestia writes citing russia s telecom watchdog the us based multinational tech giant said earlier that it could stop removing content banned in russia from search results if it lost a lawsuit to the tsargrad tv channel whose youtube account was blocked in july 2020 the company is trying to manipulate public opinion and put pressure on judicial authorities in a bid to protect its commercial interests google is ready to put the lives and health of russian users at risk the regulator stated google in turn told the newspaper that the company had never deliberately linked its work in russia to the outcome of the above mentioned lawsuit the silicon valley tech giant has in fact presented an ultimatum to the government in an attempt to blackmail it safe internet league director yekaterina mizulina pointed out notably russia is not the first country where google behaves like this the expert pointed out the indian and chinese governments earlier faced blackmail attempts and ultimatums mizulina noted this kind of blackmail from big tech is completely unacceptable these companies are active on our market making tremendous profits so they should abide by russian laws and respect the interests of russian users and businesses mizulina emphasized similar incidents in other countries usually end up in tech behemoths engaging in dialogue with the government and starting to comply with the country s laws the same will eventually happen in russia the expert said tass is not responsible for the material quoted in these press reviews

aly yale the motley fool will there be a wave of foreclosures now that foreclosure moratoriums have been lifted experts say probably not but there may be a steady uptick in activity as we close out the year according to a new report from attom data solutions foreclosure filings fell 4 in july but were up 40 compared to the year prior that was before the government s national foreclosure ban expired though when only certain foreclosures largely homes that were already vacant or abandoned were allowed now that the ban is over the majority of delinquent homeowners can be foreclosed on that is as long as they re not on a forbearance plan and their servicer follows the myriad loss mitigation rules set out by the consumer financial protection bureau worried about foreclosing new rules aim to give homeowners options to cope with mortgage struggles what now biden administration offers new aid for mortgage borrowers at risk of foreclosure due to covid 19 due to these protections the wave of foreclosures that many previously predicted may be more of a reliable flow here s how rick sharga executive vice president of foreclosure platform realtytrac put it the end of the government s moratorium won t result in millions of foreclosures but we re likely to see a steady increase in default activity for the balance of the year much of the foreclosure volume will come from the reinstatement of foreclosure proceedings on properties that had already been in default prior to the pandemic and new foreclosure activity on vacant and abandoned properties where we may see more foreclosure filings distressed properties are a popular option for investors and though a wave of them may not be in the cards a steady trickle is still an improvement particularly in this inventory strapped market to get a feel for where investors may find more of these distressed properties a look at attom s july data can help according to the numbers 23 states saw increases in foreclosure starts washington d c had the biggest uptick with a 233 jump from june to july delaware colorado and oklahoma all have 100 or higher increases as well at the metro level new york city has seen the biggest jump in foreclosure filings with a whopping 134 increase over the year riverside california chicago atlanta and houston rounded out the top five for increases though houston s was just 23 total foreclosure rates the number of foreclosure filings as a share of overall housing stock were highest in nevada where one in every 3 626 housing units was foreclosed on delaware new jersey kansas and illinois also had high rates the millionacres bottom line while all these numbers are from july with the foreclosure ban still in place they do indicate places to keep an eye on both now and down the line as these already started foreclosure filings finish out it should lead to an uptick in distressed properties in these areas opening up some much needed inventory for investors keep in mind that even with the foreclosure ban lifting there are still mortgage forbearance options in place until those run out which for some is quite a while many delinquent borrowers still have protection as do their properties the motley fool has a disclosure policy editorial opinions are ours alone and have not been previously reviewed approved or endorsed by included advertisers editorial content from millionacres is separate from the motley fool editorial content and is created by a different analyst team the motley fool is a usa today content partner offering financial news analysis and commentary designed to help people take control of their financial lives its content is produced independently of usa today unfair advantages how real estate became a billionaire factory offer from the motley fool you probably know that real estate has long been the playground for the rich and well connected and that according to recently published data it s also been the best performing investment in modern history and with a set of unfair advantages that are completely unheard of with other investments it s no surprise why but those barriers have come crashing down and now it s possible to build real wealth through real estate at a fraction of what it used to cost meaning the unfair advantages are now available to individuals like you to get started we ve assembled a comprehensive guide that outlines everything you need to know about investing in real estate and have made it available for free today simply click here to learn more and access your complimentary copy

shocks in g20 emerging economies hit rich world growth imf says domestic shocks in emerging economies in the group of twenty g20 are increasingly impacting growth in the rich world said a report released by the international monetary fund ahead of its next week s spring meetings in washington the spring meetings to convene from april 17 to 19 dc bring together central bankers ministers of finance and development parliamentarians private sector executives representatives from civil society organizations and academics to discuss issues of global concern including the world economic outlook poverty eradication economic development and aid effectiveness imf managing director kristalina georgieva will kickstart the meetings presenting the outlook for the global economy and policy priorities saudi arabia s minister of finance mohammed al jadaan will chair the international monetary and financial committee meeting al jadaan was chosen as chair of the committee for a term of three years effective january 4 2024 the committee deliberates on the principal policy issues facing the imf it normally meets twice a year in the spring and during the imf world bank annual meetings in the fall since 2000 spillovers from domestic shocks in g20 emerging markets particularly china have increased and are now comparable in size to those from shocks in advanced economies the imf wrote in a chapter of its world economic outlook report those countries ranging from china the world s second largest economy to default prone argentina have become so embedded in the global economy particularly via trade and commodity value chains that they are no longer simply on the receiving end of global shocks it added the imf also showed that since china s accession to the world trade organization in december 2001 emerging markets of the g20 now account for about 30 percent of global economic activity and about one quarter of global trade at the same time these economies have become increasingly systemic through their integration into global value chains gvcs with the potential to move global markets it showed this implies that spillovers to growth from shocks originating in these economies as well as from their structural slowdown over the past decade can have far greater ramifications for global activity the report added it said the intertwined nature of economies underscores the risks to the rich world of shocks in faraway nations but also the boost they could get if the economies strengthen again the ten emerging economies in the g20 argentina brazil china india indonesia mexico russia saudi arabia south africa and türkiye have more than doubled their combined share of global gdp since 2000 not only has this helped provide global momentum for growth and trade it has also been a force for lower output volatility thanks to cross country diversification the imf report said earlier the fund s data showed saudi arabia s gdp grew from 189 5 billion in 2000 to 1 1 trillion in 2023 however fading growth prospects for g20 ems have driven more than half of the 1 9 percentage point slowdown in medium term global growth since the global financial crisis with china accounting for about 40 percent the medium term growth outlook for g20 ems has weakened by 0 8 percentage point to 3 7 percent as a result of scars from the pandemic and the price shocks that followed the russian invasion of ukraine overall spillovers have increased almost threefold since the early 2000s led by china while spillover risks from brazil india and mexico have also grown moderately china is struggling to overcome prolonged economic headwinds with high levels of local government debt limiting infrastructure investment and the property market entering its fourth year of free fall consumer and investor confidence are also under pressure the imf said the russian economy s pivot toward asia will likely shift the direction of spillover effects across the g20 emerging markets the imf warned that average growth of 6 per year over the past 20 years would slow and lowered the medium term growth outlook to 3 7 global economic growth the imf said global economic growth will reach just 2 8 by 2030 a full percentage point below the historical average unless major reforms are made to boost productivity and leverage technologies such as artificial intelligence without ambitious steps to enhance productivity global growth is set to fall far below its historical average the imf said in a chapter of its forthcoming world economic outlook warning that expectations of weak growth could discourage investment possibly deepening the slowdown the global lender said the persistent low growth scenario combined with high interest rates could also restrict governments ability to counter economic slowdowns and invest in social welfare or environmental initiatives all this is exacerbated by strong headwinds from geoeconomic fragmentation and harmful unilateral trade and industrial policies it said in a blog accompanying chapter 3 of the weo to be released in full next tuesday a year ago the imf said it expected medium term growth to hover around 3 the new forecast reflects downward revisions for medium term growth across all income groups and regions most significantly in emerging market economies the imf urged countries to take urgent action to counter the weakening growth outlook warning that it worsened prospects for living standards and global poverty reduction an entrenched low growth environment coupled with high interest rates would threaten debt sustainability and could fuel social tension and hinder the green transition it said

it doesn t take a brainiac to balance risk and reward many people think the smartest investors are those who generate the best returns in a given year they might be surprised to learn that isn t the case it turns out long term outperformance has little to do with returns in any single 12 month period it s about balancing risk and reward over the long term the natural next question is which stocks offer that that s what we wanted to know when we asked three fool contributors to what they thought were the smartest healthcare stocks to buy right now here s why they picked resmed rmd 0 95 vertex pharmaceuticals vrtx 0 85 and idexx laboratories idxx 0 38 letting shareholders breathe easy jason hawthorne resmed resmed is best known as the leading maker of machines that provide continuous positive airway pressure commonly known as cpaps they help people with sleep apnea and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or copd breathe easier it is no 1 in market share and sells its devices in 140 countries it s also one of the largest makers of ventilators an important weapon in the fight against covid 19 the stock has sailed to 55 gains in the past 12 months and management is projecting strong demand for its products in the year ahead although ventilator sales are waning the company sold less than 20 million worth in its latest quarter compared to more than 125 million in the same period last year its other devices are more than making up the difference in fact the company can t keep up with demand its cpap sales were initially negatively impacted by the covid 19 pandemic as sleep clinics and doctor s offices were closed that headwind has abated as things get back to normal in the most recent quarter total device sales were up 30 in the u s canada and latin america it s partly because of the reopening but resmed also got a big boost from a competitor s troubles koninklijke philips phg 0 22 has had to recall about 3 5 million devices over concerns about the toxicity of a material used in its cpap machines resmed believes that will result in between 300 million and 350 million in additional sales of its units over the next year more importantly it will increase its market share that should provide recurring annual revenue from its online platform and suite of digital health solutions it will also add to the company s 15 million cloud connected devices longer term demand for cpap devices should continue to grow it s estimated that more than 80 of cases in the u s remain undiagnosed that s a lot of tailwinds at the company s back and the stock rightly reflects a lot of that optimism but it is likely to be one of the smartest and safest places to invest in healthcare over the long term a premium healthcare stock trading at a serious bargain rachel warren vertex pharmaceuticals if you re looking for a top healthcare stock to buy with oodles of room to grow and a strong competitive advantage vertex pharmaceuticals is a solid choice to consider the company is the indisputable leader in the cystic fibrosis therapeutics market and its top selling drug trikafta is approved by the food and drug administration to treat more than 90 of individuals diagnosed with the rare disease vertex has three other approved drugs on the market at present also approved to treat cystic fibrosis the development of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator cftr modulator therapies has been a game changer in the fight against the disease because these drugs deal with the genetic components that result in someone developing cf in the first place not only are all of vertex s approved medicines cftr modulator therapies but they are the only ones of this type of drug that as of yet have been approved by the fda vertex pharmaceuticals is developing other vital therapies for the treatment of cystic fibrosis one such candidate in its pipeline is a triple combination regimen that the company announced at the end of july would soon be entering phase 3 development and which is intended to build upon trikafta s vast success in treating a broad swath of the cf patient population chief medical officer carmen bozic said in a july press release with this once daily next in class triple combination regimen our goal is to develop a more effective treatment regimen with the potential to restore cftr function in people with cf to even higher levels than currently achievable the company also has a range of other drug candidates in development that have nothing to do with cf such as for the rare genetic disorders sickle cell disease and beta thalassemia as well as type 1 diabetes in 2020 vertex pharmaceuticals reported that product revenue shot up nearly 50 from the prior year and its net income grew 130 and in the first and second quarters of 2021 the company reported respective product revenue increases of 14 and 18 from the year ago periods so you might be wondering what s the catch if you ve been paying attention to vertex pharmaceuticals share price movements in recent months you may have noticed that the stock is trading down by nearly 17 from january and 30 from one year ago these downward share price movements can largely be attributed to two key clinical setbacks that occurred last october and this past june when vertex opted to discontinue development of drug candidates for the rare disease alpha 1 antitrypsin deficiency however i think it s important to remember that share price alone is never a definitive indicator of a good or bad company as vertex continues to beef up its clinical development programs and makes further progress with its current lineup of promising candidates both within and outside the cf treatment space it s just as likely that broader investor sentiment could change and send shares upward again in the meantime from a long term investing standpoint the pharmaceutical stock retains a solid competitive advantage with a small but powerful lineup of top selling drugs that dominate its respective market space patient investors could see serious benefit to their portfolios by scooping up shares at a bargain now and waiting for the company to deliver on its potential people really love their pets steve ditto idexx laboratories hate math but love making money then follow warren buffet s advice and look for companies that deliver compounding returns those that grow and become more valuable every year over the last 10 years idexx has returned 1 630 compared to 351 for the s p 500 that s a textbook example of a company delivering compounding returns although idexx may not be a familiar name the company is a leading global provider of healthcare services to veterinarians idexx provides the diagnostic testing equipment supplies and services vets need to help keep pets happy and healthy people are spending more than ever on their pets diagnostic tests like bloodwork are becoming a part of most pet visits vets are moving toward providing more diagnostic services in house particularly as the equipment has become smaller faster and more affordable covid 19 may have accelerated these trends but they show no sign of slowing down idexx s companion animal group or cag accounts for 90 of its revenue idexx has customers in more than 175 countries and expects further international expansion to help fuel the company s growth idexx management sees the global diagnostic market growing at 9 annually on the q2 earnings call idexx management reported good results and provided strong guidance revenue increased 30 operating profit increased 30 and earnings per share increased 33 compared to the previous year management raised its full year revenue outlook by 55 million to a range of 3 17 billion to 3 205 billion it looks like idexx is set to deliver continued revenue growth ceo jonathan j mazelsky commented on the results in the earnings release saying the idexx team delivered another quarter of outstanding performance reflected in continued high growth in cag diagnostics recurring revenues and accelerated gains in instrument placements as the global animal healthcare sector sustained strong growth momentum globally companies delivering compounding returns are rarely cheap and idexx is no exception with a price to earnings ratio over 80 and a price to sales ratio over 21 there s a lot of future growth already reflected in the stock price but don t let that stop you from buying idexx has a long term opportunity to grow its highly profitable recurring revenue and keep delivering compounding returns for your

and it s not even close seven pot stocks rank among the 100 most popular stocks on robinhood s hood 1 58 trading platform but only one of them is in the top 10 on the list sundial growers sndl 4 83 actually sundial claims the no 4 spot beating out quite a few larger and more successful companies sundial has definitely been a big winner this year although it has given up much of its gains from the first quarter the stock is still up more than 50 however i don t think that it s anywhere close to being the best marijuana stock to buy for the future here are five cannabis stocks that are better picks right now than sundial growers five easy picks i d put innovative industrial properties iipr 0 13 at the top of the list the company is organized as a real estate investment trust reit and focuses on the u s medical cannabis industry iip currently owns 73 properties in 18 states and will almost certainly add more soon it also offers an attractive dividend yield of over 2 4 several top u s multi state operators msos also easily beat out sundial in my view cresco labs crlbf 4 61 is a leading cannabis wholesaler it also operates 34 cannabis retail locations in 10 states including six of the seven largest cannabis markets in the u s green thumb industries gtbif 3 18 stands out as another of the biggest msos in the u s the company had 58 cannabis retail stores across 11 states in the second quarter since the end of q2 green thumb has closed an acquisition to enter virginia s cannabis market and added more retail locations to bring its total to 62 i also like a couple of up and coming msos ayr wellness ayrw f 5 66 already has operations in six states an important seventh market new jersey will be added to the list once the company s pending acquisition of garden state dispensary closes jushi holdings jushf 1 18 currently has 20 retail cannabis stores 13 of which are in pennsylvania the company is one of only a handful of license holders in virginia with operations in the northern part of the state an especially lucrative potential market what they have in common three of these five stocks were recently named strong buys by jefferies financial group analyst owen bennett ayr cresco and green thumb however all of them share several other common denominators that i think make them better picks than sundial growers most importantly they re all based in the u s that gives them better growth prospects than sundial which can t enter the u s cannabis market and retain its listing on a major u s stock exchange while marijuana remains illegal at the federal level they also all continue to deliver stronger revenue growth than sundial actually sundial s revenue declined year over year in its latest quarter meanwhile jushi s revenue more than tripled year over year in q2 innovative industrial properties and cresco reported revenue that more than doubled year over year in their latest quarterly updates green thumb s revenue soared 85 ayr came in last with its revenue jumping by only 74 year over year sundial posted a net loss of 52 3 million in canadian dollars in q2 however innovative industrial properties cresco and green thumb are profitable ayr and jushi reported losses in their latest quarterly updates but their bottom lines looked much better than sundial s then there s the matter of valuation the four msos included in my picks ayr cresco green thumb and jushi trade at forward price to sales p s multiples that are in the single digits only innovative industrial properties claims a higher forward p s ratio than sundial however the company beats sundial on virtually every other front beyond popularity you might wonder why sundial ranks as the most popular pot stock among robinhood investors when there are so many others that are demonstrably better choices the biggest reason is that most over the counter stocks aren t available on robinhood that means that robinhood investors can t buy ayr cresco green thumb or jushi on the trading platform innovative industrial properties can be bought by robinhood investors though perhaps a reit isn t as exciting as a canadian cannabis operator is to many but with better growth prospects faster revenue growth and its strong profitability i think innovative industrial properties like the four msos on my list is easily a better pick than sundial

an alternative to operating income as an indicator of financial performance restaurant operating margin is widely regarded in the restaurant industry as a useful metric by which to evaluate restaurant level operating efficiency and performance of ongoing restaurant level operations this non gaap measure is not indicative of overall company performance and profitability because this measure does not directly accrue benefit to the shareholders due to the nature of costs excluded we define restaurant operating margin as company sales less food and beverage costs restaurant labor and restaurant expenses we believe this metric provides a more useful comparison between periods and enables investors to focus on the performance of restaurant level operations by excluding revenues not related to food and beverage sales at company owned restaurants corporate general and administrative expenses depreciation and amortization and other gains and charges restaurant operating margin excludes franchise and other revenues which are earned primarily from royalties delivery fee income gift card breakage digital entertainment revenues maggiano s banquet service charge income franchise advertising fees franchise and development fees gift card equalization merchandise income and gift card discount costs from third party gift card sales depreciation and amortization expenses substantially all of which are related to restaurant level assets are excluded because such expenses represent historical costs which do not reflect current cash outlays for the restaurants general and administrative expenses include primarily non restaurant level costs associated with support of the restaurants and other activities at our corporate offices and are therefore excluded we believe that excluding special items included within other gains and charges from restaurant operating margin provides investors with a clearer perspective of the company s ongoing operating performance and a more useful comparison to prior period results restaurant operating margin as presented may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies in our industry reconciliation of

on june 7 2021 the the u s food and drug administration fda made history it approved biogen s nsdq biib aducanumab brand name aduhelm this was the first time ever that an alzheimer s drug has been approved not surprisingly biogen stock soared on the news but eli lilly nyse lly stock also jumped 10 in reaction does lilly have a stake in aduhelm and will it make money when the drug hits the market no so what gives the holy grail of drugs before we discuss the case further a little background on alzheimer s and aduhelm according to the centers for disease control and prevention 5 8 million americans are living with alzheimer s by 2060 that number may reach 14 million it is no exaggeration to say that an alzheimer s drug that works can surpass 10 billion a year in sales many drug companies have tried to develop an alzheimer s drug over the years but until this year all had failed that s why the alzheimer s drug has been referred to as the holy grail of drug development in early 2015 biogen got everyone s hopes up when it announced that aducanumab had shown evidence of reducing the buildup of plaque in the brain associated with alzheimer s the drug jumped directly into phase 3 plot twist but four years later in march 2019 biogen dropped a bombshell on investors it said that due to disappointing data in one of its two phase 3 study it was pulling the plug on aducanumab however in another twist just six months later biogen says not so fast apparently in examining data from the second phase 3 study it saw some evidence that aducanumab works well enough to try to apply for fda approval in november 2020 an independent fda panel of experts voted almost unanimously that the clinical data did not support approval the panel s vote isn t binding but it poured cold water on aducanumab s prospects because of the desperate need for an alzheimer s treatment though the fda said yes anyway to a drug that may work in reaction three members of the expert panel resigned in protest the fda does require that biogen and its partner eisai run a follow up study they must complete another study by 2029 to prove the drug brings clinical benefit or else the fda could remove the drug from the market why lilly benefits lilly is also working on an alzheimer s drug donanemab the drug works similarly but not identically to aducanumab it s currently in phase 2 study by this point you may have already guessed why the market thinks the biogen approval helps lilly you see the approval of aducanumab despite questionable statistical evidence lowers the bar for donanemab too donanemab s data has been good so far but not a slam dunk however the clinical profile is at least as good as if not better than for aduhelm raising chances of approval thus even though aduhelm is a competitor to donanemab if it s approved aduhelm s approval on balance helps lilly further in lilly s favor shortly after the aduhelm approval the fda granted breakthrough therapy designation to lilly s own alzeimer s drug donanemab lilly announced plans to file for fda approval of donanemab this year under the accelerated approval pathway based on the strength of phase 2 data even though a phase 3 study is still ongoing likely blockbuster this is great news for lilly and shareholders alike the fda s controversial aduhelm approval not only increased the odds for approval of donanemab it could shorten donanemab s time to market making it a major revenue contributor earlier than expected and the sooner donanemab is commercialized the less time aduhelm with its inherent first mover advantage would have to potentially entrench itself donanemab if approved would no doubt be a blockbuster defined as yearly sales of 1 billion or more with an outside shot at reaching 10 billion at its peak lilly s fiscal 2020 revenue was 23 billion showing what a huge impact donanemab might make unlike biogen which needs aduhelm to turn its falling sales around lilly s sales already are growing even without donanemab thus an alzheimer s drug would add a big icing on the cake the lesson here is that when investing in drug companies it is a good idea to keep tabs on what competitors are doing sometimes a favorable development for a competitor may not be necessarily a bad thing for you editor s note our colleague scott chan just pinpointed outstanding investment opportunities in the biotechnology sector looking for aggressive plays in biotech the legalization of marijuana is a social political and financial revolution that s making early investors rich legal weed is transforming the world of medicine big pharma is taking notice and making massive investments in potential cannabis treatments the team at investing daily has unearthed a trailblazing marijuana biotech that s on the verge of becoming the pfizer of pot click here for details
looking to build off its history of success in rural communities casey s is still in the early stages of expanding to small towns across the midwest and beyond iowa based casey s general stores casy 1 50 is a bit of an anomaly in how it approaches its marketplace casey s essentially masquerades as a prepared food and pizza chain that happens to sell gas in the rural communities it serves its focus on communities differentiates the company from its peers and has helped casey s become the focal point in many towns that go unnoticed by major food brands ultimately this leadership position within the communities it serves makes casey s an exciting investment to consider when trying to beat the market by becoming the go to option for pizza on a friday night in hundreds of towns across the midwest the company has built a devoted customer base and beloved brand how focusing on communities leads to growing profits with 52 of its stores in towns of 5 000 people or fewer and 78 in 20 000 or less casey s has become the focal point of many small communities taking a page out of walmart s playbook as it expanded long ago focusing on towns allows casey s to become entrenched within the community making it the primary food establishment there this entrenchment enables the company to generate a significant portion of its sales from prepared food and fountain beverages as well as grocery and other merchandise accounting for over 40 of revenue the hidden beauty of these sales is that they generate much higher gross profit margins than fuel to the tune of 40 over the fiscal year 2021 moreover these margins lead to inside sales accounting for nearly two thirds of casey s total gross profit highlighting its ability to distance itself from reliance on fuel sales for comparison murphy usa musa 1 29 a convenience store practically famous for its proximity to many walmarts has a gross profit margin of 7 6 whereas casey s comes in at 30 8 these margins trickle down to the bottom line where casey s holds a 4 1 profit margin versus murphy s 2 7 on top of this during the q4 earnings call president and ceo darren rebelez explained that these margins are poised to improve further saying we re seeing a resurgence in pizza slices dispensed beverages and bakery as our guests return to their normal daily routines overall this community focus gives casey s an edge in profitability but how does the company s remaining growth potential look early stages of the growth runway casey s is still in the early innings of its growth runway despite an over allocation to rural communities for example within the company s current geographic footprint 78 of towns with a population between 1 000 and 20 000 do not yet have a casey s store so now you may ask just what percentage of communities this size can casey s serve well if its home state of iowa is any clue that answer is roughly 80 or higher these two simple stats highlight that despite being over 60 years old casey s may just be starting its growth story furthermore even though its expertise is within rural communities it is not afraid to move into cities and urban centers as it steadily expands across the midwest with its recent acquisition of 94 bucky s convenience stores and 48 circle k stores casey s has set its sights on the major markets of omaha chicago and oklahoma city these acquisitions could be the beginning of a domino s esque geographic network as casey s aims to continue building upon its status as the fifth largest pizza chain in the u s by kitchen count taking the long term perspective the company still only operates in 16 states and could feasibly eye the coasts or beyond as its final goal only time will tell with cash on hand of 330 million and a debt to ebitda ratio of only 1 9 times casey s is well positioned to explore future acquisitions an investor s next move simply put i believe casey s focus on communities naturally begets higher profitability as they provide food options to many towns that are just considered drive through areas to most businesses furthermore this profitability is still in its nascent stages both expanding to new rural communities and ultimately moving toward the coasts and the largest cities in the united states as always especially with the increased allowance for fractional share trading i believe it would be wise to dollar cost average into a casey s general stores position however trading at a price to earnings p e ratio of 23 the company s current valuation is quite reasonable compared to the s p 500 average of 35 looking ahead to the next few quarters i will be watching the company s inside sales gross margin and whether it can trend back above 40 as its customers begin to hit the road again in full strength

accessible on the sec s website at www sec gov and the investor relations page of our website at investors kaltura com non gaap financial measures in addition to our results determined in accordance with gaap we believe that adjusted ebitda is useful in evaluating the performance of our business we define ebitda as net profit loss before interest expense net provision for income taxes and depreciation and amortization expense adjusted ebitda is defined as ebitda as defined above adjusted for the impact of certain non cash and other items that we believe are not indicative of our core operating performance such as non cash stock based compensation expenses adjusted ebitda is a supplemental measure of our performance is not defined by or presented in accordance with gaap and should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to net profit loss or any other performance measure prepared in accordance with gaap adjusted ebitda is presented because we believe that it provides useful supplemental information to investors and analysts regarding our operating performance and is frequently used by these parties in evaluating companies in our industry by presenting adjusted ebitda we provide a basis for comparison of our business operations between periods by excluding items that we do not believe are indicative of our core operating performance we believe that investors understanding of our performance is enhanced by including this non gaap financial measure as a reasonable basis for comparing our ongoing results of operations additionally our management uses adjusted ebitda as a supplemental measure of our performance because it assists us in comparing the operating performance of our business on a consistent basis between periods as described above although we use ebitda and adjusted ebitda as described above ebitda and adjusted ebitda have significant limitations as analytical tools see the tables below regarding reconciliations of these non gaap financial measures to the most directly comparable gaap measures key financial and operating metrics annualized recurring revenue we use annualized recurring revenue arr as a measure of our revenue trend and an indicator of our future revenue opportunity from existing recurring customer contracts we calculate arr by annualizing our recurring revenue for the most recently completed fiscal quarter recurring revenues are generated from saas and paas subscriptions as well as term licenses for software installed on the customer s premises on prem for the saas and paas components we calculate arr by annualizing the actual recurring revenue recognized for the latest fiscal quarter for the on prem component for which revenue recognition is not ratable across the license term we calculate arr for each contract by dividing the total contract value excluding professional services as of the last day of the specified period by the number of days in the contract term and then multiplying by 365 recurring revenue excludes revenue from one time professional services and setup fees arr is not adjusted for the impact of any known or projected future customer cancellations upgrades or downgrades or price increases or decreases the amount of actual revenue that we recognize over any 12 month period is likely to differ from arr at the beginning of that period sometimes significantly this may occur due to new bookings cancellations upgrades or downgrades pending renewals professional services revenue and acquisitions or divestitures arr should be viewed independently of revenue as it is an operating metric and is not intended to be a replacement or forecast of revenue our calculation of arr may differ from similarly titled metrics presented by other companies net dollar retention rate our net dollar retention rate which we use to measure our success in retaining and growing recurring revenue from our existing customers compares our recognized recurring revenue from a set of customers across comparable periods we calculate our net dollar retention rate for a given period as the recognized recurring revenue from the latest reported fiscal quarter from the set of customers whose revenue existed in the reported fiscal quarter from the prior year the numerator divided by recognized recurring revenue from such customers for the same fiscal quarter in the prior year denominator for annual periods we report net dollar retention rate as the arithmetic average of the net dollar retention rate for all fiscal quarters included in the period we consider subdivisions of the same legal entity for example divisions of a parent company or separate campuses that are part of the same state university system to be a single customer for purposes of calculating our net dollar retention rate our calculation of net dollar retention rate for any fiscal period includes the positive recognized recurring revenue impacts of selling new services to existing customers and the negative recognized recurring revenue impacts of contraction and attrition among this set of customers our net dollar retention rate may fluctuate as a result of a number of factors including the growing level of our revenue base the level of penetration within our customer base expansion of products and features and our ability to retain our customers our calculation of net dollar retention rate may differ from similarly titled metrics presented by other companies remaining performance obligations remaining performance obligations represents the amount of contracted future revenue that has not yet been delivered including both subscription and professional services revenues remaining performance obligations consists of both deferred revenue and contracted non cancelable amounts that will be invoiced and recognized in future periods we expect to recognize 65 of our remaining performance obligations as revenue over the next 12 months and the remainder thereafter in each case in accordance with our revenue recognition policy however we cannot guarantee that any portion of our remaining performance obligations will be recognized as revenue within the timeframe we expect or at all condensed consolidated balance sheet usd in thousands june 30 2021 december 31 2020 as restated unaudited assets current assets cash and cash equivalents 29 772 27 711

balances second quarter 2021 effective income tax rate was 23 4 percent compared with 22 8 percent last year the rate increase was driven by significantly higher earnings which diluted the benefit of

the company effected a change of the ratio of its adss to ordinary shares from one 1 ads representing twenty five 25 ordinary shares to one 1 ads representing five 5 ordinary shares the earnings per ads and number of ads information have been retrospectively adjusted to reflect the change for all periods presented management remarks mr longgen zhang ceo of daqo new energy commented we are very excited to report an excellent quarter with strong revenue growth and better than expected profitability as the company achieved record high production volume gross profit and net income with the global focus on addressing the climate challenge with plans to reach carbon neutrality market conditions remain strong for the polysilicon sector the strong increase in downstream demand has led to a shortage of polysilicon and caused our polysilicon asp to rise significantly from 11 90 kg in q1 to 20 81 kg in q2 in july and august the market price for mono grade polysilicon has remained at approximately 26 28 kg and we expect the strong price momentum to continue into the second half of this year despite the rise in solar module prices in the first half of this year we continue to see stronger than expected market demand even at the new market prices recently the solar value chain has been stable at the new market prices and downstream manufacturers are currently able to pass through price increases to their customers during the week of august 9 major solar wafer and solar cell manufacturers in china announced price increases for solar wafers and solar cells further demonstrating the strong end market demand we saw an uptick in polysilicon pricing in the last two weeks with a surge in orders from our diverse customer base we expect the constrained polysilicon supply to be the main limiting factor to the size of the global solar market this year polysilicon production is a complex chemical process and has the highest barrier to entry in the solar value chain based on our research we expect to see approximately 180 220 thousand mt of additional polysilicon supply in 2022 considering a potential six months ramp up period for other polysilicon producers this total global polysilicon supply can be used to produce approximately 240 250 gw of solar modules which can support approximately 200 210 gw of solar installations in 2022 so the polysilicon sector will still be the one with most constrained supply across the main solar pv manufacturing value chain in 2022 on the demand side more and more countries have set up time tables for peak carbon and carbon neutrality targets that will significantly increase demand for renewable energies including solar pv in addition there is still meaningful room for potential cost reduction across the value chain which will effectively stimulate larger demand especially given that solar pv has already reached grid parity in many countries and regions in the world as a result we believe polysilicon pricing will remain healthy in 2022 making our sector one of the most attractive sectors in the solar pv industry in the long run given its high entry barrier and operational complexity on the policy front during the politburo central committee meeting on july 30 regarding economic activity in the second half of 2021 with china s president mr xi jinping presiding over the meeting the central government reiterated the urgency for national coordination on carbon peak and carbon neutrality goals and the development of the peak carbon 2030 action plans and related policies as early as possible in addition china recently announced an ambitious program to massively deploy distributed generation solar projects at the local government level we believe solar will continue to be a strong beneficiary of government policies and support with regard to our esg initiatives we are in the process of incorporating environmental social and governance factors in all of our major business decisions and we published our inaugural esg sustainability report in july we are already making substantial progress on the sustainability front including installing a new wastewater treatment facility in 2018 that reduced our wastewater discharge density by 60 in 2020 compared to 2018 furthermore by increasing energy efficiency and energy recycling as well as optimizing our production process we reduced our comprehensive energy consumption density by 40 in 2020 compared to 2017 we will continue to work on our esg efforts including planning for greater renewable energy use as part of our energy sources in the future we continue to focus on initiatives to strengthen the company s long term competitiveness our major operational subsidiary xinjiang daqo new energy xinjiang daqo successfully completed its ipo listing on china s a share market and started trading on the shanghai stock exchange s sci tech innovation board sse code 688303 on 22 july 2021 the total gross proceeds of the ipo are approximately rmb6 45 billion which will fund xinjiang daqo s polysilicon expansion project and provide additional capital for its future growth plans following the xinjiang daqo s ipo daqo new energy directly holds approximately 79 6 of xinjiang daqo s shares and indirectly holds 1 1 of xinjiang daqo s shares through daqo new energy s wholly owned subsidiary chongqing daqo for a total ownership of 80 7 of the a share listed subsidiary there is no variable interest entity vie structure between daqo new energy and xinjiang daqo the successful ipo will offer us an additional venue to access the attractive capital markets in china for future growth and expansion with our advantages of competitive cost structure quality and technology advancement outstanding operational expertise and experienced management team we have set up a road map to increase our capacity to 270 thousand mt by the end of 2024 representing an approximately 50 annual growth rate of our production capacity over the next three years to better serve the fast growing global solar pv market outlook and guidance the company produced 41 287 mt of polysilicon and sold approximately 42 531 mt of polysilicon in the first half of 2021 representing full utilization level of the company s production facilities for the second half of 2021 the company expects to remain in full utilization with sales volume similar to production volume for the full year of 2021 the company raises its production guidance from the previous level of 81 000 to 83 000 mt to the level of approximately 83 000 to 85 000 mt of polysilicon for the full year inclusive of the impact of the company s annual facility maintenance this outlook reflects daqo new energy s current and preliminary view as of the date of this press release and may be subject to changes the company s ability to achieve these projections is subject to risks and uncertainties see safe harbor statement at the end of this press release second quarter 2021 results revenues revenues were 441 4 million compared to 256 1 million in the first quarter of 2021 and 133 5 million in the second quarter of 2020 the increase in revenues as compared to the first quarter of 2021 was primarily due to higher asps partially offset by slightly lower polysilicon sales volume gross profit and margin gross profit was 303 2 million compared to 118 9 million
