dover del ap the company that privatized operations at the port of wilmington several years ago owes more than 21 million in damages for breaching an agreement to buy the port s former stevedoring firm a delaware judge ruled monday vice chancellor lori will also found gt usa wilmington in contempt for violating a court confidentiality order by using materials it obtained in defending itself in a 2018 lawsuit filed by murphy marine services to negotiate a deal with one of murphy marine s largest customers monday s ruling came more than a year after a different chancery court judge ruled that gt was bound by the terms of a 2018 letter agreement regarding the purchase and sale of 100 of the equity interest of murphy marine will ruled monday that gt violated the binding letter agreement by refusing to negotiate a definitive purchase agreement with murphy marine she also said gt improperly used information obtained from murphy marine during the lawsuit to negotiate its own stevedoring contract with dole fresh fruit company officials with gt usa wilmington did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment gt usa wilmington is a subsidiary of port management company gulftainer which is based in the united arab emirates in 2018 it obtained the rights to operate the wilmington port for 50 years in exchange for agreeing to make significant upgrades and to pay the state at least 3 million annually in concession fees murphy marine is a family owned business that was purchased in 2006 by a former longshoreman and three of his cousins through trusts which are the company s stockholders will awarded the trusts more than 21 4 million direct damages for the loss of fair market value that gt agreed to pay for murphy marine s stock she also said the plaintiffs are entitled to pre and post judgment interest at a rate of 7 5 compounded quarterly from september 2018 to the date of payment will also ordered gt to pay the legal fees and expenses incurred by murphy marine regarding its motion to find gt in contempt for violating a confidentiality order governing the exchange of documents in the lawsuit according to the ruling gt used revenue and financial information for various murphy marine customers to negotiate its own stevedoring contract with dole which had been a customer of murphy marine that violation was not a technical one the judge wrote rather it is more likely than not that gt used a competitor s obviously confidential information to negotiate with a then current murphy marine customer against murphy marine under a privatization deal signed with gov john carney s administration in 2018 gulftainer agreed to take over operations at the port for 50 years and invest almost 600 million in port upgrades and a new container handling terminal at edgemoor state officials did not require gt to buy murphy marine but both companies have said they felt pressure from the state to make a deal the companies finalized the letter agreement in april 2018 and agreed shortly thereafter that kpmg would conduct a valuation analysis of murphy marine kpmg estimated murphy marine s equity value to be between 21 5 million and 26 1 million gt officials were not happy with those numbers and asked kpmg to fix its analysis according to court records a key concern for gt was that the effect of the port privatization was not included in kpmg s valuation even though the parties agreed that privatization would not be considered vice chancellor sam glasscock iii noted in a ruling last year that if gt did not acquire murphy marine its privatization of the port would have a drastically detrimental effect on murphy marine s value gt which is the largest privately owned port operator in the world could have started its own stevedoring business and shuttered murphy marine s business entirely by denying it access to the port he noted

high globally mainly due to supply chain issues and global shortages of raw materials prices are increasing significantly since the pandemic began especially in developing countries whose currencies are being shredded by the us dollar reaching all time highs until supply returns to normal exorbitant prices will continue with dealers even offering incentives to get back the cars they ve leased to customers and sell them for even higher profits the average price of a used vehicle in the united states in november 2021 was 29 011 39 higher when compared to the previous year more than half of the america s households don t have the income needed to buy an average priced used vehicle right now the car industry is at a crossroad the next few years will determine the direction companies and hence the industry overall take and how that will impact the world at large it isn t hyperbole to say that the current transition being seen is perhaps the most important since the advent of the motorcar while scientists have been talking about climate change for decades we are just now over the past few years starting to see the effects which have been devastating from droughts to heatwaves to extended cold snaps to floods we are witnessing carnage in more or less every continent and this will continue to get worse before it gets better one of the ways to combat this is to reduce reliance on fossil fuels and one of the biggest uses of fossil fuels is in providing fuel for traditional cars this is why governments all over the world are aiming to switch to electric cars in a bid to utilize renewable energy see the 10 best renewable energy stocks to buy tesla inc nasdaq tsla has capitalized on this to become the dominant company in the electric vehicle industry to the extent that its market cap is the highest among all automobile companies even touching 1 trillion at point this is despite tesla inc nasdaq tsla not being among the biggest car companies in the world by sales according to mckinsey shared mobility feature upgrades newer business models and connectivity services could result in revenue in the automotive field increasing by around 30 which could result in an increase of 1 5 trillion by 2030 compared to current revenues of around 5 2 trillion which itself was an increase of 50 from 3 2 trillion in 2015 despite shared mobility being a major factor in the future growth of the car industry vehicle unit sales will continue to increase though the annual growth is expected to be around 2 rather than the previous 3 6 in fact up to 10 of the cars sold in 2030 will be a shared vehicle in the united states the percentage of young people age 16 24 who held a driver s license decrease to 71 in 2013 from 76 in 2000 self driving vehicles are also expected to dominate the industry in the next decade even though they are currently battling technological and regulatory issues once these issues are resolved the expectation is that around 15 of the cars sold in 2030 could be fully autonomous to determine the biggest car companies in the world by sales we relied on either their sales reported by yahoo finance or consulted their latest revenues as

listen to this article listen to this article new york ap the buck isn t stopping the value of the u s dollar has been on a tear for more than a year against everything from the british pound across the atlantic to the south korean won across the pacific after rising again friday the dollar is near its highest level in more than two decades against a key index measuring six major currencies including the euro and japanese yen many professional investors don t expect it to ease off anytime soon the dollar s rise affects nearly everyone even those who will never leave the u s borders essentially that one dollar can buy more of another currency than it could before consider the japanese yen a year ago 1 could get a little less than 110 yen now it can buy 143 that s about 30 more and one of the biggest moves the u s dollar has made against another currency foreign currency values are constantly shifting against each other as banks businesses and traders buy and sell them in time zones around the world the u s dollar index which measures the dollar against the euro yen and other major currencies has climbed more than 14 this year the gain looks even more impressive compared against other investments most of which have had a dismal year u s stocks are down more than 19 bitcoin has more than halved and gold has lost more than 7 why is the dollar getting stronger because the u s economy is doing better than others even though inflation is high the u s job market has remained remarkably solid and other areas of the economy such as the services sector have been resilient that s helped offset worries about a slowing housing industry and other parts of the economy that do best when interest rates are low that in turn has traders expecting the federal reserve to follow through on its promise to keep hiking interest rates sharply and to hold them there a while in hopes of knocking down the worst inflation in 40 years such expectations have helped the yield of a 10 year treasury more than double to 3 44 from roughly 1 33 a year ago investors who want to make more income off their money and those juicier u s yields are drawing investors from all over the world other central banks have been less aggressive than the fed because their economies seem to be more fragile the european central bank just raised its key rate by the largest amount ever three quarters of a percentage point but the fed has already raised its key rate by that amount twice this year with a third expected this week some traders even say a gargantuan hike of a full percentage point could be possible following a hotter than expected report on u s inflation tuesday partly because of that less aggressive bent 10 year bonds across europe and other areas of the world offer much lower yields than u s treasurys such as germany s 1 75 and japan s 0 25 when investors from asia and europe buy treasurys they have to trade their own currencies for u s dollars that pushes up the dollar s value effects on travel purchases at home yes u s travelers in tokyo spending 10 000 yen on dinner will be using 23 fewer dollars than a year ago for the same priced meal with the dollar up sharply so far this year against everything from the argentine peso to the egyptian pound to the south korean won the dollar is going further in many countries than before a stronger dollar also helps u s shoppers by keeping a lid on prices for imports and pushing downward on inflation when the dollar is rising against the euro for example european companies make more euros on each 1 of sales with that cushion they could cut the dollar price for their products and still make the same amount of euros they could also leave the price in dollars alone and pocket the extra euros or they could find some balance of the two prices for imports fell 1 in august from a month earlier following july s 1 5 drop offering some relief amid the nation s high inflation prices for imported fruits nuts and some peels dropped 8 7 for example they re down 3 from a year earlier a stronger dollar can keep prices in check for commodities generally that s because oil gold and others are bought and sold in u s dollars around the world when the dollar rises against the yen a japanese buyer can get fewer barrels of crude for the same number of yen as before that can mean less upward pressure on oil prices are there only winners from a strong dollar no u s companies that sell abroad are seeing their profits get squeezed at mcdonald s revenue fell 3 during the summer from a year earlier but if the dollar s value had simply stayed put against other currencies the company s revenue would have been 3 higher microsoft meanwhile said changes in foreign currency values sliced 595 million off its revenue in the latest quarter a string of other companies have given similar warnings recently and further gains for the dollar could add more pressure on profits companies in the s p 500 index get roughly 40 of their revenue from outside the united states according to factset a strong dollar can put a financial squeeze across the developing world many companies and governments in such emerging markets borrow money in u s dollar terms instead of in their own currencies when they must repay their debts in u s dollars while their own currencies buy fewer dollars by the day it can create lots of stress where s the dollar headed the dollar s biggest moves may be behind it but many professionals expect the dollar to at least stay this high a while tuesday s report on u s inflation shocked the market and showed it remains more stubborn than expected that has traders upping bets for fed rate hikes going into next year fed officials have been busy recently reaffirming their commitment to keeping rates high until the job is done in breaking the nation s high inflation even if it damages economic growth that bias toward still higher rates by the fed should continue to offer support for the value of the u s dollar for the dollar to weaken meaningfully strategists wrote in a bofa global research report the fed has to get more concerned about growth than inflation and we are not there yet
for the past several months the federal reserve has used a traditional toolkit to attempt to rein in the high inflation that was unleashed by the pandemic and worsened by russia s attack on ukraine this traditional model for responding to inflation hewed to by economists for decades posits that inflation is triggered by excess demand and that the way to rein in demand and thus to put the brakes on inflation is to raise the cost of borrowing hence the rush upward in the interest rate set by the federal reserve and by extension the increased cost of borrowing for companies looking to finance new investments and for consumers looking to get mortgages from banks in the summer of 2021 for a buyer with good credit a 30 year mortgage could be approved at a 2 75 percent interest rate last week those mortgages headed north of 6 percent for a family with say a 400 000 mortgage that s a difference of roughly 14 000 per year not surprisingly millions of people are deferring home purchases between the moment when mortgage rates hit their lows last summer and now the demand for mortgages has declined by nearly a third the idea is pretty straightforward if it costs more perhaps a lot more to borrow people will defer purchases fewer new cars fewer house purchases and fewer big spending items put on credit cards lead to companies needing fewer employees which in turn recalibrates the labor market away from worker power making it harder for employees in a soft labor market to bargain up their wages that particular circle will the idea goes rapidly put the squeeze on inflation the theory which is epitomized by an economic graph known as the phillips curve says that a little bit of short term consumer pain and a willingness to tolerate higher levels of unemployment for a few months or even a couple years ought to do the trick in putting the inflation genie back in its bottle proponents of this model argue that workers short term pain is more than compensated for by the longer term gains that come with stable prices yet a strange thing is happening in this current bout with inflation as many progressive economists such as joseph stieglitz and dean baker had predicted would be the case as interest rates soar housing demand is indeed easing back as the model would predict but the broader labor market remains tight in part because so many americans dropped out of the job market during the pandemic either out of fear of exposure because they couldn t find child care or in many instances because they ended up suffering debilitating effects from long covid and despite momentary optimism that inflation was peaking in june and july the recently released numbers for august which sent the stock market into a swoon last week suggest that a higher than wanted level of inflation the federal reserve aims for inflation in the 2 percent range is firmly entrenched at the moment similarly bad inflation numbers are also being posted by other major industrial democracies the inflation rate in the u k is slightly higher than in the u s and some models predict it could hit as much as 18 percent by year s end although these worst case scenarios are likely to have been muted somewhat by prime minister liz truss s recent announcement that the government would cap energy prices in the eu the inflation rate is above 9 percent in canada it is just under 8 percent in australia inflation is hovering at around 6 percent and even in japan which has extraordinarily low levels of inflation due in part to decades of stagnant growth and in part to the government subsidizing a wide range of consumer products all the inflation indicators have gone up in recent months though price increases still remain far less of a problem there than in most other wealthy nations this stubborn persistence of inflation globally oughtn t to be surprising the traditional model assumes inflation is triggered by excess demand and thus can be curbed by reining in demand but the last couple years of supply chain disruptions have shown that when an unpredicted but catastrophic black swan event such as a pandemic holds the world in its grip prices around the world get driven up by a cascading series of glitches that make it harder both to produce goods and then to ship the finished product to stores and to consumers why for example are consumers paying so much more for cars not because there s suddenly been a spike in the number of drivers on the road but because at every level of the supply chain from rubber and steel to semiconductors there are shortages or delivery bottlenecks in the globalized economy a consumer in an import heavy economy such as the u s is particularly vulnerable to say price spikes caused by supply shortages triggered by covid lockdowns half a world away in china given this raising interest rates ad nauseam is an extraordinarily clumsy way to deal with the problem sure eventually demand will be curbed so much by the unaffordability of borrowing money that it will tamp down inflation but before it does that it s likely to cause a huge amount of pain and that hurt won t be evenly distributed since the labor market remains tight those higher up the economic ladder those with more marketable skills and higher education qualifications are more frequently able to largely neutralize the loss of purchasing power that comes with inflation through successfully negotiating for wage increases for starting bonuses and for other compensation as a result the inflation spiral will most heavily impact poorer residents who have less money saved have less power to negotiate wage increases and have poorer credit to begin with meaning that they will pay disproportionately more when they seek to borrow during a moment of rising interest rates meanwhile low income residents face particularly dire circumstances in poorer countries mainly in the global south where governments lack the clout to intervene in the energy and food markets to try to lower costs or to cushion the blow on poorer people through implementing price subsidies for food and energy in much of the world inflation triggered by the twinned dislocations of pandemic and war is soaring beyond anything experienced in the first world argentina s inflation is roughly 80 percent lebanon s 116 percent sri lanka s increased from 5 7 percent a year ago to over 60 percent today and so on last week the head of the united nations world food programme warned that up to 345 million people worldwide or roughly 50 times the number known to have died from covid so far could face starvation as food prices soar and shortages increase this represents a doubling in global food insecurity since early 2020 already roughly 50 million people are facing acute malnutrition with the recent catastrophic flooding in pakistan and the displacement of tens of millions from their homes that number will surely increase over the coming months the war in ukraine with the resulting disruptions to global markets in grain wheat soy and other staples has the un estimates pushed 70 million people closer to starvation the un s stark warning ought to have generated headlines around the world instead it simply became a side story but even while economics writers around the world fixate on spiraling inflation in economic powerhouses such as the u s the u k and the eu bloc while ignoring even worse inflation and the damage it causes in poor countries there are underlying similarities to be poor anywhere on earth is to bear a disproportionate brunt of the impact of failing one size fits all policies to be poor is to bear the brunt of inflation spirals but to be poor is also to bear the brunt of shock and awe policy responses designed to wrestle inflation back under control there are however alternative ideas on the table for tackling inflation in a fairer way last week the center for american progress released a report detailing how the supply chain could be strengthened so as to reduce disruptions and thus rein in prices the authors called for ramping up covid vaccine distribution expanding the child care system so that parents could return to work increasing immigration levels in countries such as the u s to fill jobs left empty by the contracting workforce going after price gouging trusts and ramping up investments in renewable energy so as to wean the economy from fossil fuels and from the profiteering companies that have made such fortunes during the price increase months since russia attacked ukraine in february the authors concluded that the fed s approach looking to gently tamp down demand without sinking the economy into a deep recession was unlikely to work to knock excess inflation out of the economy they warned that if the fed keeps raising interest rates eventually the landing could be extremely hard and painful in other words this strategy risks crashing both the housing and the job markets which would hurt poor americans the most better they argued to craft an economic policy that addresses the supply issues brought into high relief during this recovery because of the fed s outsized influence on global economic policy the rest of the world is likely to follow where the u s goes on interest rates raising interest rates moderately may make sense as one tool among many to tackle this rather unique inflationary moment but raising them immoderately and excluding more unorthodox supply side anti inflation interventions risks doing long term damage to those at the bottom of the economy doing so poses an acute threat to the poor both within the u s and in less affluent countries overseas which could end up plagued by persistently high inflation rising unemployment and ever greater difficulties accessing loans for businesses and for house purchases that s the sort of lose lose proposition that could create cascading problems for decades to come join us in defending the truth

brukinsa is the first bruton s tyrosine kinase btk inhibitor recommended by nice for routine use for wm brukinsa is the only btk inhibitor considered cost effective in wm beigene nasdaq bgne hkex 06160 sse 688235 a global biotechnology company that is developing and commercializing oncology medicines today announced that england s health technology assessment institute the national institute for health and care excellence nice has issued a final appraisal document fad recommending brukinsa zanubrutinib for the treatment of waldenström s macroglobulinemia wm in adults who have had at least one treatment only if bendamustine plus rituximab is also suitable this decision from nice marks brukinsa as the first and only treatment for wm to be recommended for routine use in england and wales

positive recommendation for zanubrutinib allows eligible patients in england and wales to access an important new treatment option that may offer improved outcomes compared to the current standard of care in its appraisal nice concluded that zanubrutinib could be considered a step change in managing the disease as clinical evidence suggests that people with wm may live longer and have a better quality of life with zanubrutinib compared to standard of care the nice recommendation states that brukinsa is considered cost effective at a threshold of 20 000 30 000 per quality adjusted life year

getty images new york this is part of an ongoing series from abc news reporting in battleground states across the country as voters share their personal views on major issues voters have said they have some key topics on their minds in the months before november s midterms issues like the economy and high inflation gun violence and abortion access after the overturning of roe v wade abc news recently spoke with some voters in various battleground states including arizona florida ohio and texas for their personal views the voters perspectives are not conclusive but do offer a window into individual opinions on subjects that abc news ipsos polling shows is of importance ahead of the election republicans hope to seize on president joe biden s general unpopularity and low marks on the economy democrats especially after roe and a string of economic and social spending wins in congress have focused on the gop s position on banning abortion while defending their record while in power inflation an inflation report released last week sent stocks tumbling as it showed still high prices more than 8 growth year over year and all but ensured the federal reserve would consider again hiking the interest rate to cool demand which has been a months long problem that the white house insists is a major priority voters said that they have felt the effects of inflation on their wallets a loaf of bread is like 1 50 more i m definitely noticing prices at the gas but it s not only the gas it s the food and we need food we need gas and we are wondering when is this going to let up said phoenix native karla terry terry said that she blames congress for the high prices it s coming from the top and trickling down to the bottom she said but what can we do but go to the pump and pay for gas go to the store and pay for bread we don t have a choice we re rolling with the punches miami resident daniel demillais said that he blames president biden and democratic leadership we moved from the incredibly high cost incredibly badly run state of california to the great state of florida where we can at least still live decently thanks to the great ron desantis and the republican party said demillais stock trader jorge martinez lives with his fiancé in miami and said that inflation is affecting what he buys but his biggest problem is with rent i think it s gone up like 1 000 in one year he said i normally buy like thin sliced chicken breast but now i m buying like straight up whole chickens and just kind of spending an hour at home just cutting them on my own cause i m not gonna pay an extra 15 martinez said across the gulf in texas one couple said that they were shopping with their parents at different stores to keep costs low we are still backed up from all of the things that we ve seen from all the delays in 2020 that didn t just fix magically because we are two years out katy forbes said referring to the covid 19 pandemic that experts say has been one major factor in inflation along with russia s invasion of ukraine and other developments we stopped house hunting said forbes partner chris wyant that puts them in something of a bind we just continue to rent while our rent just increases forbes said abortion echoing what abc news ipsos polling has showed some voters said that the reversal of roe by the supreme court allowing individual states to ban abortion impacted their choices gwenda gorman a diné woman who works for the intertribal council of arizona said she had a difficult time putting her feelings about abortion into words consider all our children as a gift from a creator said gorman it s really hard to say how people feel about that especially depending on who you talk to you others did not share gorman s struggle on the topic how can somebody be 100 pro life said ohio farm owner deb boyer they don t care if a child is raped democrats are on the right side of the issue this year i think the proposals coming out of the other side are a lot more extreme and i think that our state is a lot more moderate said phoenix resident ginger sykes torres trump under investigation some voters wanted to talk less about the 2022 candidates than about 2024 and a potential presidential candidate donald trump i don t think that any presidential election has ever been fair said 19 year old ohio state university student kendall mungo the electoral college is bull mungo said that she feels like the nation is more divided than ever before one of the reasons some feel that division is the fbi raid of trump s residence at mar a lago over what the government says were highly classified and sensitive documents that were improperly stored trump supporter jennifer sledge from queens insisted that she became a supporter even though she did not vote for him in the last election because she saw the tactics that the left would use other voters like susan connors a democrat from pennsylvania said that she does not know why trump is not

triblive s daily and weekly email newsletters deliver the news you want and information you need right to your inbox washington federal reserve chair jerome powell bluntly warned in a speech last month that the fed s drive to curb inflation by aggressively raising interest rates would bring some pain on wednesday americans may get a better sense of how much pain could be in store the fed is expected at its latest meeting to raise its key short term rate by a substantial three quarters of a point for the third consecutive time another hike that large would lift its benchmark rate which affects many consumer and business loans to a range of 3 to 3 25 the highest level in 14 years in a further sign of the fed s deepening concern about inflation it likely will signal that it plans to raise rates much higher by year s end than it had forecast three months ago and to keep them higher for a longer period economists expect fed officials to forecast that their key rate could go as high as 4 by the end of this year they re also likely to signal additional increases in 2023 perhaps to as high as roughly 4 5 short term rates at that level would make a recession likelier next year by sharply raising the cost of mortgages car loans and business loans the fed intends for those higher borrowing costs to slow growth by cooling off a still robust job market to cap wage growth and other inflation pressures yet the risk is growing that the fed may weaken the economy so much as to cause a downturn that would produce job losses the u s economy hasn t seen rates as high as the fed is projecting since before the 2008 financial crisis last week the average fixed mortgage rate topped 6 its highest point in 14 years credit card borrowing costs have reached their highest level since 1996 according to bankrate com powell and other fed officials still say the fed s goal is to achieve a so called soft landing by which they would slow growth enough to tame inflation but not so much as to trigger a recession by last week though that goal appeared further out of reach after the government reported inflation over the past year was a painful 8 3 even worse so called core prices which exclude the volatile food and energy categories rose much faster than expected they re going to try to avoid recession said william dudley formerly the president of the federal reserve bank of new york they re going to try to achieve a soft landing the problem is that the room to do that is virtually nonexistent at this point at a news conference he will give wednesday after the fed meeting ends powell isn t likely to drop any hints that the central bank will ease up on its credit tightening campaign most economists expect the fed to stop raising rates in early 2023 but for now they expect powell to reinforce his hard line anti inflation stance it s going to end up being a hard landing said kathy bostjancic an economist at oxford economics he s not going to say that bostjancic said but referring to the most recent fed meeting in july when powell raised hopes for an eventual pullback on rate hikes she added he also wants to make sure that the markets don t come away and rally that s what happened last time indeed investors responded then by bidding up stock prices and buying bonds which lowered rates on securities such as the benchmark the 10 year treasury higher stock prices and lower bond yields generally boost the economy the opposite of what the fed wants after the alarming august inflation report the fed seems all but sure to announce a third consecutive increase a fourth such hike is possible too if future measures of inflation don t improve the central bank has already engaged in the fastest series of interest rate hikes since the early 1980s yet some economists and some fed officials argue that they have yet to raise rates to a level that would actually restrict borrowing and spending and slow growth loretta mester president of the cleveland federal reserve bank and one of the 12 officials who will vote on the fed s decision this week said she thinks it will be necessary to raise the fed s rate to somewhat above 4 by early next year and hold it there i do not anticipate the fed cutting rates next year mester added dispelling the expectations of many investors on wall street who had hoped for such a reversal comments like mester s contributed to a sharp fall in stock prices last month that began after powell s stern anti inflation speech at an economic conference in jackson hole wyoming our responsibility to deliver price stability is unconditional powell said then a remark widely interpreted to mean that the fed will fight inflation even if it requires deep job losses and a recession many economists sound convinced that a recession and widespread layoffs will be necessary to slow rising prices research published earlier this month under the auspices of the brookings institution concluded that unemployment might have to go as high as 7 5 to get inflation back to the fed s 2 target

this week the 77th session of the united nations general assembly is meeting in new york attended by australia s foreign minister penny wong it comes less than a fortnight after the un announced that famine was imminent in somalia the australian council for international development the peak body for australian humanitarian agencies is calling on the australian government to direct 150 million towards programs targeting hunger and starvation in the worst affected regions around the world including the horn of africa syria yemen and afghanistan discussions at the un have already been held on global food insecurity forced displacement and how to support a response even without an official declaration of famine in somalia hunger and starvation are already at shocking levels an estimated 7 8 million people in somalia are facing severe food shortages with the lives of hundreds of thousands of people at immediate risk according to unicef more than half a million somali children under the age of five are expected to suffer acute malnutrition and risk death from famine this year three million livestock have died and around a million people have been forced to leave their homes in search of food the current drought is longer and more severe than previous droughts acfid is calling on the albanese government to recognise the scale of this crisis and act now to try to avert at least some of the impact somalia along with other parts of the horn of africa is staring down the barrel of famine and misery said acfid ceo marc purcell australia s action now will help to prevent the crisis from worsening rather than waiting for famine to be officially declared and more people dying said mr purcell somalia is set to suffer a fifth consecutive failed rainy season meaning that much needed food stocks cannot be replenished the hunger crisis is worst in two areas in the country s south central bay region baidoa and burhakaba districts the fao says it will most likely continue until march 2023 unless humanitarian aid is not significantly and immediately scaled up the most vulnerable groups are pregnant and lactating women and children under the age of five between january and july more than 730 children died in nutrition centres across the country according to unicef this is the third severe drought in the horn of africa over the past 12 years the 2010 11 drought caused famine a rapid and timely humanitarian response by australia gave a rapid response totaling 112 million in 2010 11 saved many 100 000s of lives australia should acts as it did last time to prevent famine it is a proven fact that early humanitarian intervention by the government saves lives said mr purcell we know from lessons learned during previous famines in the region that when humanitarian aid is provided for preventative measures it builds resilience what is famine the un s food and agriculture organization fao developed the integrated food security phase classification ipc to track hunger it is a standardised scale that categorises the severity of acute food insecurity into five phases ranging from minimal phase 1 to catastrophe or famine phase 5 parts of somalia are rated at 5 also at ipc5 are regions of the horn of africa yemen syria and afghanistan the ipc defines a famine as an extreme event where starvation death destitution and extremely critical levels of acute malnutrition are likely or present famine is declared when a region has 20 percent or more of households facing an extreme lack of food at least 30 percent of children suffering from acute malnutrition and two out of every 10 000 people dying each day from starvation or related conditions or illnesses the united nations makes the call to declare a famine in conjunction with the government of the country involved part of declaring a famine is to kickstart the donor process however the inherent flaw is that waiting for a crisis to reach official famine status means that already too many lives have been lost or upended causes the looming famine is the result of a confluence of factors including multiple failed rainy seasons conflicts including that in ukraine and the covid 19 pandemic the last time somalia suffered official famine was in 2011 when more than 250 million somalis died of starvation or disease somalia relies on russia and ukraine for more than 90 percent of its wheat supplies food prices are spiking due to shortages and fuel costs and even basic items such as red sorghum are spiraling another contributing factor is water scarcity around 6 4 million somalis lack access to safe water sources which make them more susceptible to disease outbreaks over the past two years covid 19 made its way through somalia with an official death toll of 800 and confirmed cases at 15 300 however the actual figures are believed to be far higher the pandemic exposed the extreme paucity of the country s health infrastructure another contributing factor has been plagues of desert locusts in recent years that have threatened farmlands and crops somalia country overview somalia s recent history is marked by armed conflict and political instability it also has one of the world s highest foreign debts it trails on many development indicators and child mortality rates are the highest of the world it has a population of an estimated 12 5 million although many nomads and refugees make it hard to confirm this more than 60 percent of the population is under 25 there are more than 1 1 million somalis living outside the country in the region and more than 1 1 million internally displaced somalis gdp per capital is us800 and agriculture is the most important sector helpfightfamine campaign fifty million people around the world are facing famine due to conflicts climate change and covid 19 somalia will be the first place where famine will be officially declared but it is not the only one a number of australian international aid organisations have banded together to form the helpfightfamine campaign which is a coordinated move to push the australian government to commit 150 million towards famine relief in the october budget and 200 million per annum ongoing invested in
