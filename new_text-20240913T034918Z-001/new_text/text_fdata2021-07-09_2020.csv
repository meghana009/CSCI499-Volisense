unprecedented pro competitive commitments will enhance route choice and provide all market participants railroads and shippers a fair chance to compete transaction is about creating a new rail product and pro competitive market philosophy for the future new direct rail service preserving interline routing options with the gateway commitment and offering price transparency through separately challengeable segment rates will deliver on commitment to preserve and enhance competition for all shippers montreal and kansas city mo july 08 2021 globe newswire cn tsx cnr nyse cni and kansas city southern nyse ksu kcs today outlined how the proposed combination of cn and kcs will preserve and promote competition growth and more choice for rail customers port operators employees stakeholders and communities as outlined in the joint filing to the surface transportation board stb on july 6 2021 cn and kcs will enhance competition by delivering more choices to our rail customers the combination allows shippers the ability to connect with other class i carriers up and down the combined network so that a shipper can use the most efficient and lowest cost gateway and routing options available for a particular move the combined network will connect with partner class is at numerous major gateways providing unprecedented choice resiliency and flexibility more choice tilts negotiations in the customer s favor the proposed cn kcs combination makes that possible keeping gateways open on commercially reasonable terms cn and kcs are committed to keeping cn and kcs major rail gateways open both physically and commercially this means for example that agricultural customers including farmer owned co operatives enjoying existing competitive joint line routings through gateways with cn or kcs and another carrier will continue to have those routings available upon completion of the merger everyone benefits from this commitment customers will continue to enjoy the interline service they have today along with new enhanced rail to rail competition that the combination would make possible and by creating more optionality through major gateways we will offer customers a new ability to shop for the best price and service combination using confidential voluntary binding arbitration to enforce the gateway commitment cn and kcs will offer voluntary confidential binding arbitration to permit quick resolution of any commercial dispute over the gateway commitment with our customers creating greater price transparency we are talking with our customers about a binding merger commitment in which upon request from a customer a combined cn kcs will offer a separate segment rate for the cn kcs portion of a movement in addition to a through rate for the entire movement this commitment to price transparency will enhance competition throughout the rail industry with more transparency each carrier in a move will need to justify its price escalation and service which will foster greater rail to rail competition in an op ed published by railway age on june 22nd dr william huneke the former director of the office of economics and chief economist at stb described cn s open gateways commitment as a big deal stating this commitment ensures that shippers who today enjoy competitive joint line routings with either cn or kcs will continue to have those routings available to them in a post cn kcs merger environment even if a merged cn kcs could handle the entire movement via a single line routing this means continued competition and we know that competition encourages lower rates better service and innovation the commitment is not just about maintaining physical routings but also about ensuring that the routings are commercially reasonable to the shipper what is meant by open on commercially reasonable terms this means all market participants railroads and shippers will benefit they will get a fair chance to compete they will pay and receive remunerative rates and get efficient service if a shipper is not happy with their service they can switch to another carrier because they will still have a choice a cn kcs combination will create a strong new rail to rail competitor that will provide new single line rail movements in competition with other rail carriers in addition with the gateway commitment shippers will also have the option to use an existing routing or other routings involving more than just the merged cn kcs the cn kcs combination will create a more competitive marketplace that will attract more freight

on july 4th president joe biden stood on the white house lawn to declare that america was nearing independence from the coronavirus but with covid 19 not fully vanquished he called upon his fellow citizens to get vaccinated telling them that it s the most patriotic thing you can do about 55 of americans over the age of 12 have now been fully vaccinated and a further 10 have had the first of two doses but in recent weeks america s vaccination rate has slowed markedly in april 3m doses were administered each day since june that figure has fallen to an average of 1m per day there are three possible explanations for this slow down the first is that it is typical for vaccination rates to fall as more people are jabbed since those in cities and other easy to reach areas are likely to have been targeted already yet america does not appear to have reached such a threshold other rich countries such as sparsely populated canada continued to vaccinate at a decent clip until about 75 of their populations had received their first dose see left hand chart germany which has vaccinated a similar proportion of its citizens as america is currently vaccinating at nearly three times the rate the second possibility is that the availability of vaccines has diminished in america airfinity a life sciences data company finds that domestic production of the pfizer and moderna vaccines that form the backbone of the country s programme fell from 2m doses a day in april to 750 000 doses a day in june but that is probably because of the large stock that built up the centres for disease control and prevention reports that 51m doses await use enough for 30m people or 11 of those eligible to be fully vaccinated the third perhaps most convincing explanation is that the rate is slowing because many of the remaining 33 of adults who have not yet had a first dose do not want one this is corroborated by the latest weekly survey from yougov carried out on behalf of the economist which finds that 19 of american adults do not want to get vaccinated and a further 10 are unsure about it just 6 of respondents say they are still planning to get inoculated and are awaiting their first dose as with much of american life attitudes towards vaccination are divided along political lines one third of people who voted for donald trump in november say they will not get jabbed compared with just 3 among democratic voters indeed among a clutch of socioeconomic factors that might explain county level variation in vaccination rates political affiliation has the clearest correlation counties that had a higher republican vote share have administered fewer first doses of the vaccine see right hand chart this may have to do with a propensity on the right to disbelieve scientific advice and embrace conspiracy theories it has not helped that mr trump who did not choose to be vaccinated in front of cameras has done little to convince his supporters to get jabbed that america should be hitting a ceiling in vaccination rates so soon is worrying the country missed its target of giving at least one dose of vaccine to 70 of adults by july 4th and has not yet set a new deadline to reach that level with the more infectious delta variant spreading across the country it has accounted for more than 40 of genetically sequenced cases in the past four weeks the risk is that it will intensify the epidemic in places with low vaccination rates excluding children america s unvaccinated citizens number 85m double the adult population of spain fully 6m of them are over 65 and thus most likely to die from covid 19 they should heed mr biden s assertion that vaccination is not a political statement but an act of service for yourself for your loved ones for your community and for your country
a little more than three months after it raised 115 million in a series c financing round caribou biosciences late last week filed for an initial public offering whose size has not yet been determined though the company s s 1 registration statement filed with the u s securities and exchange commission included a placeholder amount of 100 million the company plans to trade its shares on the nasdaq global select market under the symbol crbu caribou was established in 2011 by haurwitz doudna martin jínek a former postdoctoral fellow in doudna s lab now at the university of zurich who led the seminal 2012 study leading to the nobel prize and james berger professor in the department of biophysics and biophysical chemistry at the johns hopkins university school of medicine that year caribou also became operational which would make it the oldest crispr therapeutics company as far as haurwitz recalled earlier this year caribou s aim is to commercialize applications based on the nucleic acid modification capabilities found in prokaryotic crispr systems we believe that our technology has broad potential to generate gene and cell therapies in oncology and in therapeutic areas beyond oncology including immune cell therapies cell therapies derived from genome edited ipscs and in vivo genome editing therapies caribou stated in its ipo filing caribou s statement listed four planned uses for proceeds from the ipo one is advancing the clinical development of the company s sole clinical phase candidate cb 010 which targets cd19 and has pd 1 deleted by crispr genome editing cb 010 is being evaluated in the phase i antler trial nct04637763 in patients with relapsed refractory b cell non hodgkin lymphoma b nhl with initial data from the study expected in 2022 enhanced persistence a second use of ipo proceeds caribou stated will be funding ind enabling activities and potential launch of clinical studies for two of its other candidates cb 011 and cb 012 cb 011 caribou s second genome edited car t candidate targets bcma positive tumors and is being developed for the treatment of relapsed refractory multiple myeloma according to caribou cb 011 is immunologically cloaked in order to prevent the patient s immune system from rapidly clearing the therapy since allogeneic cell therapies run the risk of recognition as foreign by patients immune systems which then set out to kill the cell product fairly rapidly caribou achieves that enhanced persistence for cb 011 in two ways it uses genome editing to get rid of the protein beta 2 microglobulin beta 2 m in order to completely wipe out all class i presentation from the surface of the car t the second step is then to site specifically insert a fusion protein beta 2 m with the antigen hla e in order to prevent both the patient s t cells and their natural killer cells from rapidly clearing the therapy caribou expects to file an ind for cb 011 next year caribou is also developing a third allogeneic car t cell therapy cb 012 which targets cd371 for the treatment of relapsed refractory acute myeloid leukemia the company expects to file an ind for cb 012 in 2023 cb 012 uses fully human single chain variable fragment scfv binders for cd371 that the company has exclusively in licensed from memorial sloan kettering cancer center msk under an agreement announced in november 2020 and whose value was not disclosed the anti cd371 scfvs were developed in the lab of renier brentjens md phd at msk in collaboration with the tri institutional therapeutic discovery institute tri i tdi tri i tdi is a nonprofit drug discovery company wholly owned by msk weill cornell medicine and the rockefeller university msk has the sole responsibility for licensing these scfvs and related intellectual property for commercialization crispr hybrid rna dna cb 010 011 and 012 are complex immune cell therapies all based on caribou s crispr hybrid rna dna chrdna guide technology which the bay area company pronounces chardonnay cb 010 uses chrdna that incorporates the cas9 enzyme while 011 and all other caribou programs use cas12a chrdnas are highly specific rna dna hybrid guides that according to the company direct substantially more precise genome editing than all rna guides by driving highly specific multiplex genome editing including gene insertion the hybrid guides are designed to address the challenge of all dna guides which fail to support editing activity and all rna guides which lead to both on and off target editing the genome editing technologies currently used in the allogeneic cell therapy field generally have limited efficiency specificity and versatility for performing the multiple precise genomic edits necessary to address insufficient persistence caribou stated in its ipo our chrdna technology is designed to address these genome editing limitations and improve cell therapy activity by applying this approach to allogeneic cell therapies we believe we can unlock their full potential by improving upon their effectiveness and durability chrdnas lead to more specific genome editing because they decrease the affinity of the crispr complex for the target dna haurwitz told gen edge in march shortly after caribou completed its 115 million series c convertible preferred stock financing which generated for the company net proceeds of 108 8 million among investors participating in the series c was abbvie ventures abbvie s corporate strategic venture capital arm abbvie committed 40 million in combined upfront cash and equity investment in its up to 340 million car t therapy collaboration launched in february in return abbvie gained exclusive rights to caribou s next generation cas12a chrdna genome editing and cell therapy technologies to develop two car t cell cancer therapies against undisclosed targets under their collaboration abbvie has the option to pay a fee also undisclosed to expand the collaboration to include up to two more car t cell therapies we view this collaboration as an external recognition of the potential for our chrdna genome editing technology to significantly improve genome editing specificity and efficiency caribou stated in its ipo filing according to the ipo filing caribou has received 30 million in upfront cash from abbvie part of approximately 311 2 million in net proceeds from equity financings and contract revenues received by caribou the figure includes approximately 150 1 million in net proceeds from equity investments and approximately 88 4 million in net proceeds from the sale of intellia therapeutics common stock received under caribou s crispr cas9 license agreement with intellia written in ink caribou also said it plans to set aside some proceeds from the ipo toward continuing research and development of its program to develop ipsc derived allogeneic natural killer nk cell therapies which the company calls ink cell therapies for multiple solid tumor indications the lead candidate in that program cb 020 is a preclinical ink cell therapy for which caribou said it expects to select a cell surface target in 2022 we have not yet chosen which genome editing technology we will use to edit the ink cells nor do we know whether such editing will be successful caribou disclosed to date we have focused on cas12a chrdna editing of ipscs and on differentiating ipscs into inks caribou s filing also cited several other additional potential uses for ipo proceeds including advancement of caribou s genome editing technologies discovery stage research toward potential additional

inched up in the latest week with one analyst seeing the number as skewed and a second suggesting the market may have hit a plateau the labor market is steadily recovering but that being said we are still over seven million jobs away from full employment a benchmark we do not expect to hit until the second half of 2022 said scott ruesterholz portfolio manager at insight investment increasingly data may be skewed by states ending enhanced unemployment programs initial jobless claims rose to 373 000 in the week ended july 3 from an upwardly revised 371 000 the week before first reported as 364 000 claims economists polled by ifr markets expected 355 000 claims in the week we may have hit a plateau diane swonk chief economist at grant thornton said in a tweet claims ticked up despite the end of supplements across many states and the roll back of ineligibility for special pandemic unemployment insurance the number of those who ve collected more than 27 weeks increase in june after two months of declines she said continuing claims fell to 3 339 million in the week ended june 26 from an upwardly revised 3 484 million in the prior week initially reported at 3 469 million this is the lowest total since 3 094 million in the week ended march 21 2020 economists expected 3 338 million continuing claims i expect claims will continue to trend lower although not at the pace we saw this past spring said sarah house senior economist at wells fargo securities with businesses struggling mightily to hire they are likely to hold on more tightly to existing workers with some states no longer handing out enhanced benefits ruesterholz said when you look at the numbers including emergency programs claims fell by 450 000 a strong decline this would normally point to a significant amount of hiring activity though we caution it could be flattened by states beginning to end these programs he said these policy changes add to the uncertainty about how to interpret the data with the expiration of the enhanced benefits at the end of summer the labor supply should increase the economics team at morgan stanley said but with limited data from the states that ended the extra payments early there is only mixed evidence on whether or not it has moved the needle on labor supply but people who ve reached the end of their unemployment benefits may not necessarily be returning to the workforce they wrote in a research paper but through june 19 states that stopped the supplemental payments had the bigger drops in initial claims than states continuing to pay the extra benefits

a small canadian oil explorer may have shocked the industry this year when it published initial results that pointed to the potential of a giant oil discovery in namibia s kavango basin now as our anticipation builds over the next drill results this small canadian driller looks to be attracting attention from around the globe in april reconnaissance energy africa tsxv reco otc recaf announced early findings from the first of their initial 3 well drill program in namibia s 6 3 million acre kavango basin it came as a surprise to many of us results indicated signs of a working petroleum system after only the first test drill on june 3rd investors got another surprise when reco announced further indication of a working petroleum system in the shallow section of its second well now we re waiting for an announcement about the completion of the second drill to 12 500 feet which we think should be any day now previous projections have compared the possible numbers with some of the largest oil discoveries in the world in recent years like the midland basin in west texas and daniel jarvie an industry recognized geochemist and source rock expert thinks that the play is pretty much a no brainer it will be productive and i m expecting high quality oil he s estimated the basin generated potential billions of barrels of oil conservatively and he s not the only industry known scientist involved in this play recognized geologist bill cathey was another early bird cathey whose clients have included supermajors such as exxonmobil conocophillips and chevron performed the entire magnetic survey interpretation of the kavango basin for reconafrica and was very clear in saying nowhere in the world is there a sedimentary basin this deep that does not produce commercial hydrocarbons what some are considering now is whether there is potential for this to be the last big onshore oil discovery that the world may ever see as reconafrica looks to continue efforts to de risk kavango how big could this potentially be with the drilling of their first test well in an initial 3 well program reconafrica has had to rely primarily on some encouraging survey data to guide them in their exploration work the results so far however are reported to have well exceeded their expectations in samples from the first well reconafrica encountered clear evidence that reconafrica is sitting on a working petroleum system in the kavango basin in fact they showed even more than that sample log results from the first 6 2 stratigraphic test well 6 2 provided over 200 meters of light oil and natural gas indicators over three discrete intervals in a stacked sequence of reservoir and source rock oil was then extracted from these samples and the results supported an active petroleum system with multiple source intervals the second stratigraphic test well 6 1 has so far encountered 343 meters of oil and gas indicators just at the shallow level further confirming an active petroleum system in kavango the well is now set to reach its full depth 12 500 feet in the first part of this month following a short break for maintenance which has now been concluded with drilling having resumed last week these wells suggest there is commercial potential in the basin recon africa director dr james granath phd structural geology said in a recent statement it took 30 wells in offshore norway to get to this point we ve been lucky enough to do it in the first two we re also waiting for well analysis from some of the biggest names in the industry including schlumberger is this namibia s time to shine namibia s never produced a barrel of oil in its history so reconafrica s tsxv reco otc recaf work here could put it on the global oil map for the first time and in a very big way it could also transform the lives of many namibians starting with reconafrica s efforts to use its resources to drill community water wells for kavango residents nearly half of whom live in generational poverty and are forced to transport water by foot for miles every day one of reconafrica s first moves as it began trying to prove up kavango s commercial potential was to drill water wells for the people of kavango and that s only one part of its reported 10 million esg commitment to the country and the region 1 million of which has gone to namibia s covid 19 vaccine program the company says the aim of this play isn t unconventional either so the environmental impact questions are far less pressing reconafrica has stated that it does not have any fracking permits and hasn t applied for any putting that brief controversy to rest furthermore the company reports that drilling is taking place more than 50 kilometers south of the ecologically sensitive okavango river and some 260 kilometers west of the okavango delta 2d seismic for which reconafrica announced government approval this week is reportedly being conducted by some of the best in the business with the lightest impact in the world in addition reconafrica founder craig steinke has stated that the company is using 100 organic and biodegradable drilling fluids that are later used as vegetable garden fertilizers for namibia especially in an era with a strong focus on esg and with many eyes trained on efforts to avoid any more resource curse scenarios there may be a lot at stake and the local and national governments look to be fully on board we are pleased with reconafrica s approach to working closely and in constant consultation with our office the traditional leadership local authority and the community this is only the beginning stages and we have already started to experience the positive economic and social impact of the project in our regions kavango east governor bonifasius wakudumo said what happens next next we anticipate lots of potentially exciting news for this small explorer sitting on what could be a supermajor size exploration play at the final frontier of onshore oil that includes not only the 6 3 million acres of namibia s portion of the kavango basin but also 2 2 million acres in botswana in a matter of days we expect to hear the results of the completed second drill to 12 500 feet and now 2d seismic is reported to be kicking off with approval just granted by the government of namibia that will help reconafrica determine where to drill to commercialize this basin in the next campaign by the end of july the company reports they plan to have started the seismic acquisition program which they expect will help them target the most promising areas to drill for their next round if those results are positive and the project progresses reconafrica tsxv reco otc recaf has a right to a 25 year production sharing contract and they may seek to enter into potential jv negotiations and that s what we think could send this exploration play over the edge other companies looking to capitalize on rising oil prices exxon nyse xom is a large multinational corporation headquartered in irving texas exxon corporation engages in the exploration and production of crude oil and natural gas around the world with its headquarters being located in dallas texas and with operations all over the globe exxon has been able to create an empire that has lasted for over 100 years exxon was founded on october 17th 1999 by john d rockefeller jr who at the time was running standard oil company of new jersey which would be later renamed as exxon company usa the company began as a merger between two companies standard oil company of new jersey and humble oil refining co which were both subsidiaries of standard oil trust while exxon is one of the world s top oil producers it isn t ignoring the reality of the market it has made major

faced last year as a thing of the past eni is committing to lower the price of oil at which the company breaks even going into 2021 as a means of tackling the uncertainty of the oil economy in the coming months francesco gattei cfo at eni stated that volatility is growing every year highlighting the need to be prepared for the energy demand of the future in fact eni has now set out a plan to lower its greenhouse gas emissions by 80 by 2050 leveraging natural gas as a major tool in its arsenal in addition to its natural gas push eni is also jumping on the green hydrogen bandwagon in fact in december the italian oil major announced a partnership with entel to produce hydrogen using electrolyzers powered by renewable energy our goal is to accelerate the reduction of our carbon footprint by implementing the best applicable low carbon solution either green or blue to reduce our direct emissions as well as switching to bio products to supply our clients eni s chief executive officer ceo

didn t happen overnight the oilfield services sector is highly competitive and ripe with innovation in order to stay ahead companies must be on the absolute cutting edge of technology and that s exactly what halliburton has done and recently halliburton increased the heat for its competition partnering with microsoft halliburton has become one of the most exciting tech plays in the industry

shaw who had long been involved with land leasing for drilling purposes with his son james as president they drilled their first well near big lake texas as a leader in the permian pioneer is also making major waves in its commitment to cut back flaring in the region in fact pioneer consistently flares a smaller percentage of its production than the basin average the average flaring rate for oil producers in the permian is 3 7 according to gaffneycline yet pioneer s average is just 0 8 despite its commitment to the permian however ceo scott sheffield isn t particularly bullish on the region in the short term i never anticipate growing above 5 under any conditions sheffield also said even if oil went to 100 a barrel and the world was short of supply the shale major ceo explained this was because the service costs associated with adding more drilling rigs would undermine profit margins advertisement enterprise products partners nyse epd is a leading provider of innovative

reasonable terms cn and kcs are committed to keeping cn and kcs major rail gateways open both physically and commercially this means for example that agricultural customers including farmer owned co operatives enjoying existing competitive joint line routings through gateways with cn or kcs and another carrier will continue to have those routings available upon completion of the merger everyone

joint line routings with either cn or kcs will continue to have those routings available to them in a post cn kcs merger environment even if a merged cn kcs could handle the entire movement via a single line routing this means continued competition and we know that competition encourages lower rates better service and innovation the commitment is not just about maintaining physical routings but also about ensuring that the routings are commercially reasonable to the shipper what is meant by open on commercially reasonable terms this means all market participants railroads and shippers will benefit they will get a fair chance to compete they will pay and receive remunerative rates and get efficient service if a shipper is not happy with their service they can switch to another

global food commodity prices fell in june for the first time in 12 months according to a benchmark united nations report released yesterday the fao food price index averaged 124 6 points in june 2021 down 2 5 percent from may but still 33 9 percent higher than its level in the same period last year the decline in june marked the first drop in the index following twelve consecutive monthly increases the fao food price index tracks changes in the international prices of the most globally traded food commodities the drop in june reflected declines in the prices of vegetable oils cereals and though more moderately dairy products which more than offset generally higher meat and sugar quotations the fao vegetable oil price index fell by 9 8 percent in the month marking a four month low the sizeable month on month drop mainly reflects lower international prices of palm soy and sunflower oils the fao cereal price index fell by a more moderate 2 6 percent from may but remained 33 8 percent higher than its value in june 2020 international maize prices dropped by 5 0 percent led by falling prices in argentina due to increased supplies from recent harvests as a result of higher than earlier expected yields international wheat prices declined slightly by 0 8 percent in june with a favourable global outlook supported by improved production prospects in many key producers outweighing most of the upward pressure from dry conditions affecting crops in north america the fao dairy price index fell by 1 percent to 119 9 points in june international quotations for all dairy products represented in the index fell with butter registering the highest drop underpinned by a fast decline in global import demand and a slight increase in inventories especially in europe the fao sugar price index moved against the overall food price trend rising by 0 9 percent month on month marking the third consecutive monthly increase and reaching a new multi year high uncertainties over the impact of unfavourable weather conditions on crop yields in brazil the world s largest sugar exporter exerted upward pressure on prices the fao meat price index also rose by 2 1 percent over the month to june continuing the increases for the ninth consecutive month and placing the index 15 6 percent above its value in the corresponding month last year but still 8 0 percent below its peak reached in august 2014 world cereal inventories expected to rise for the first time since 2017 18 fao s forecast for global cereal production in 2021 has been lowered marginally to 2 817 million tonnes according to the latest cereal supply and demand brief released yesterday however the figure remains 1 7 percent or 47 8 million tonnes higher than in 2020 which would mark a new record high forecasts for world coarse grains production have been cut back to 1 513 million tonnes 3 million tonnes below last month s expectation a large cut to the brazilian maize production forecast accounts for the bulk of the expected global decline with prolonged periods of dry weather dragging down yield expectations world wheat output in 2021 has been lowered by 1 million tonnes to 784 7 million tonnes still 1 2 percent higher year on year as the dry weather conditions in the near east cut back yield prospects by contrast the forecast of global rice production in 2021 has undergone a slight upward adjustment since june with a record of 519 5 million tonnes of rice now expected to be harvested in 2021 up 1 0 percent from 2020 world cereal utilization in 2021 22 has been lowered by 15 million tonnes from the previous month to 2 810 million tonnes nevertheless still 1 5 percent higher than in 2020 21 the downward revision comes largely from lower than earlier anticipated utilization of maize in china for animal feed world cereal stocks by the close of seasons in 2021 22 are now forecast to rise above their opening levels for the first time since 2017 18 following a sharp upward revision to 836 million tonnes up 2 4 percent from last year s relatively tight level higher maize stocks foreseen in china account for the bulk of this month s upward revision to world cereal inventories fao s latest forecast for world trade in cereals in 2021 22 has been raised slightly since june and now stands at a record 472 million tonnes driven primarily by likely large maize purchases from china taking global maize trade to record levels food insecurity and covid 19 the effects of the covid 19 pandemic primarily in terms of income losses have exacerbated vulnerabilities and heightened existing levels of food insecurity according to the latest crop prospects and food situation report which will also be released on thursday fao assesses that globally 45 countries including 34 in africa 9 in asia and 2 in latin america and the caribbean are in need of external assistance for food with conflicts and climate related shocks continuing to underpin the high levels of severe food insecurity the crop prospects and food situation report also provides the latest data on low income food deficit countries lifdcs according the most recent assessments total cereal production of the 47 lifdcs is forecast to decline by 2 1 percent in 2021 to 190 million tonnes the drop mostly relates to expected production downturns in near east asian countries notably in afghanistan and the syrian arab republic where widespread and prolonged drought conditions cut yields and dampened this year s production prospects among the lifdcs in africa scarce rainfall in somalia is expected to result in a sizeable production decline and small reductions are also likely in several west african countries where conflicts continue to erode farming households productive capacities in southern african countries production upturns are expected to boost households food availability and partly offset some negative effects from the covid 19 pandemic the 45 countries in need of external assistance for food are afghanistan bangladesh burkina faso burundi cabo verde cameroon central african republic chad congo democratic people s republic of korea democratic republic

the silver bull is not transitory peter krauth of silver stock investor delves into the silver market and discusses why it looks primed to rally strongly on the back of multiple drivers transitory that s something we ve been hearing a lot lately at its latest fomc meeting the fed naturally decided to keep the fed funds rate target at 0 25 it also decided not to mess with the 120 billion monthly bond buying program to help support the flow of credit to households and businesses par for the course meanwhile inflation numbers of the previous four months have been anything but typical the fed s favored personal consumption expenditures price index has soared in february it was 1 6 march 2 4 april 3 6 and in may 3 9 but headline cpi recently came in at 5 reaching a 10 year high these recent months of elevated and increasing prices may have been exacerbated by price plunges due to the covid 19 pandemic but those were for a few months and their effects should already have dissipated and yet they haven t in fact core inflation which excludes volatile energy and food prices recently touched 3 8 its highest in 30 years the fed is looking increasingly wrong in its assessment that the inflation numbers we ve been seeing are transitory that means investors would do well to seek shelter from inflation protection assets and as i ll show for multiple reasons chief among them is silver silver is cheap vs stocks it s always informative and sometimes eye opening to look at asset prices in relation to other assets it usually provides good perspective on relative pricing in that vein there s little more surprising than to see just how cheap silver remains relative to the s p 500 ratio the following chart shows the long term ratio of silver to the s p 500 it s currently sitting near its 50 year lows for what it s worth silver would have to rise by a factor of 63 times just to match its level at its 50 peak in 1980 while this might sound sensational my point is these conditions have existed in the past this alone suggests explosive potential upside as the stock market matures and likely corrects while silver continues to climb physical silver demand remains elevated of course protection from inflation and uncertainty are great reasons to buy and own silver and as i described above inflation appears to be coming back with a vengeance in any case many investors are hedging against the risk that it becomes entrenched in the past 15 months prices for physical silver are higher than normal that s because demand for physical products has remained elevated leading to sustained high premiums over the spot price and that s if you can even get your hands on them many of the most popular coins and bars have been persistently out of stock premiums are typically 40 or higher which is nearly triple normal levels what s more in its recent world silver survey 2021 the silver institute is forecasting continued strength this year it expects physical demand to climb by 26 after a very strong 2020 in fact it foresees overall demand from all sectors to be up by 15 nearly doubling supply growth of 8 one area of note is demand from flexible electronics the silver institute indicates demand for silver in printed and flexible electronics is about 48 million ounces annually it forecasts demand will rise to about 74 million ounces in 2030 absorbing 615 million ounces of silver in this decade alone as technology becomes increasingly commonplace in our daily lives the world over printed and flexible electronics are likely to play a bigger role consider that wearable electronics like smartwatches appliances medical devices and a host of internet connected devices are exploding in use sensors for light motion temperature moisture and motion all make use of printed and flexible electronics so it s natural that the electronics subsector promises to be the fastest growing demand for industrial silver usage silver s seasonal outlook is bullish another indicator that now may be a great time to be bullish on silver is its seasonal trend the following is a 45 year chart from 1975 to 2020 which averages the annual silver price tendency from this it s quite clear that silver tends to mark a mid year low right at the end of june and from that point on on average the silver price enjoys a strong third quarter how to play silver now in my view a basket of silver stocks is a great way to approach the high potential of this sector right now one of my favorite options to accomplish this is the etfmg prime junior silver miners etf nyse silj with over 1 billion in assets and average daily volume over 1 5 million shares silj offer plenty of liquidity to enter and exit at will its top ten holdings represent over 63 of overall assets and these include hecla mining nyse hl pan american silver tsx paas nasdaq paas first majestic silver tsx fr nyse ag mag silver tsx mag nyse mag yamana gold tsx yri nyse auy hochschild mining lse hoc ssr mining tsx ssrm nasdaq ssrm silvercrest metals tsx sil nyse silv turquoise hill tsx trq nyse trq and endeavour silver tsx exk nyse exk in the end the fed is all about managing expectations not about tell us what we should really expect therefore actively hedging for inflation with a silver miners etf such as silj looks like a great option with a lot of potential upside one thing is certain silver is in the early days of a massive bull market that s why in the silver stock investor newsletter i provide my outlook on which silver stocks have the best prospects as this bull market progresses one stock in the portfolio is up 50 and several more are up over 30 since the start of 2021 alone many offer 5x to 10x return potential in just the next few years especially as

website that takes them to a different website their confidence and security might diminish to make sure that link building does not discourage donations or engagement be sure to include your nonprofit s logo on all website pages should you use link building to send users to a different website make sure that those forms also use your nonprofit s logo you can also rely on other branding

julie pedroncelli st john grew up immersed in the family business the geyserville based pedroncelli winery which celebrates 94 years in 2021 in addition to her official role as vice president of marketing and third generation family owner she is the winery s writer and editor sharing stories about her family and employees who make the winery a success she forges connections throughout the wine industry community i met pedroncelli online in april 2018 as facebook friends through wine industry colleagues although she lives in geyserville and i in napa our first face to face meeting was coffee at pennycup coffee co in my hometown of asheville north carolina in june 2018 because of our work schedules and her frequent travel on behalf of the winery we never seemed to have time to meet again especially after the pandemic lockdown in april 2020 however st john began a weekly morning zoom covid coffee chat with six regular attendees st john acorn winery s betsy nachbaur inshort direct marketing owner and wine industry network co founder elizabeth slater and writers cindy lowe rynning allison levine and me during these weekly coffee chats i became intrigued with her affinity for connecting with others and her ability to tell stories that leave you wanting to know more from the age of 4 st john lived in the family home at the winery where she was surrounded by viticulture and winemaking while trying to decide where to go and what to study in college her mother advised her to do what you want to do as there might not be a job for her at the winery she attended santa rosa junior college where she was involved in costuming for the theater arts program she attended dominican college now dominican university in marin county for her second two years of college earning an english degree with a writing emphasis after she turned 21 she began helping at the winery hosting tastings but moved to the east bay to el cerrito planning to pursue uc berkeley s publishing certificate to become an editor when one of her sisters married and was expecting her first child st john returned on weekends to assist at the winery one day her father asked if she were going to return home and told her there was a role for her at the winery missing sonoma county she returned to work in the winery s tasting room she took night classes in viticulture and wine at the junior college which became her wine industry network along with the russian river wine road now called the wine road shortly thereafter she met her future husband ed st john they have been married for more than 30 years he is vice president of marketing and sales at pedroncelli her love of writing led to her becoming pedroncelli s winery wordsmith she writes and edits the winery s weekly newsletters and blog which focus on pedroncelli s family history vineyards winery and the kitchen the name vino in my dino comes from my earliest memory of wine at our dining room table when i was 4 years old she said i had my flintstones tableware along with my dino cup my parents would pour a tiny bit of zinfandel and then add water i asked them why they put water in my vino it just didn t taste good her recent newsletter topics include cellar master polo cano vineyard foreman josé manuel diaz and engage about emerging from the pandemic hibernation and reconnecting with the outdoors family and friends she described a weekly socially distant gathering in a neighborhood cul de sac where neighbors shared conversation food and wine a book came to mind as i passed them yard wine it s a neighborly thing bringing america s neighborhoods together one porch at a time it was originally published in 2011 and is pairs nicely with the theme of my note i think it is a charming book and idea worthy of rebirth as we move out of our pandemic guidelines and into more contact with our neighbors and friends and it includes wine in a recent newsletter and blog post st john recounted why she began her weekly chats about a month into the stay at home orders i wondered if anyone would like to join me in a virtual coffee get together i love a good cup of coffee and i enjoy the conversations i have had over said cup of coffee she said the weekly chats will continue for the foreseeable future connection st john said this is how it all started during the pandemic we craved what we were missing and found ways to reach out and bond we will continue with our chats and one day we will gather around a table at a café she added over the last year there was a lot of hope for things to change for the guidelines to lift for travel to begin again the blessing in disguise was the gift of time and getting to know someone on a deeper level st john is also an avid cook and recipe collector and developer she shares suggested recipes and meal cheese and cookie pairings via the winery s website under the hashtag pairitwithped and julie s wine friendly recipe box the pairings include the signature selection chardonnay paired with roasted chicken grilled fish or pasta in light cream sauce and the merlot with pasta in rich meat sauce roast turkey or duck st john also has vegetarian recipes such as avocado toasts with arugula pesto and crisp cucumber couscous salad and creamless creamy tomato soup brandy optional in tasting a few of pedroncelli s wines i discovered some of my favorite pairings sauvignon blanc and a deconstructed no bread lobster roll and the three vineyards cabernet sauvignon with the saloon burger from napa palisades saloon the sauvignon blanc s lively citrus and tropical fruit flavors and zesty acidity begged for the lobster s juxtaposed salinity and sweetness the cabernet s blackberry black cherry and blackcurrant fruit flavors plus soft tannins and gentle oak influences enhanced the juicy rich beef topped with avocado bacon and egg if i were to pair a single pedroncelli wine with what has transpired during the past year it would be the rosé made from zinfandel for 65 vintages since 1954 it is a palate friendly taste of the winery s past and the present and an ideal summer wine to serve as we emerge from our pandemic cocoons bright and light it is a crowd pleaser whose red berry flavors pair with a variety of foods like crab shrimp prosciutto and other charcuterie and a variety of fruit meat and vegetable salads st john s suggestions include brunch fare grilled salmon burgers and cassoulet i asked st john if she had a favorite pedroncelli family recipe and wine pairing to share of course it is hard to choose just one but this one is always a winner beef mother clone a third generation family recipe that ed and i developed which is a take on the name beef bourguignon beef mother clone made with and paired with pedroncelli

the stock market has been booming it has been backed by a strong v shaped recovery in profits profit margins and corporate revenues profits are the mother s milk of stocks and the lifeblood of the economy of course profits tend to be a dirty word in washington biden world wants to tax profits to death they want to hike the corporate tax at 21 domestic minimum a global 15 g 7 g 20 tax that will hit mainly american companies they want to raise capital gains tax the estate tax the individual tax and lord knows what else they will propose the 21 domestic tax is a newbie as the original proposal was 15 and it s a tax on book profits not irs taxable profits this means no deductions or credits such as immediate expensing or research and development both of which are so important to productivity jobs wages and growth the political odds that biden world will get its way is falling but we are going to have an intense debate for the second half of the year fortunately a growing number of states are much smarter than washington they are cutting taxes which is a great thing for growth however the green new deal still hovers it has already curbed u s oil production which has not really recovered along with the economy we were doing 13 million barrels a day pre pandemic we were the swing producers in the global oil market but now we ve given that key role back to saudi arabia russia and opec due to biden world s attack on american oil as i said last night it s ok for russia and the saudis to produce more oil but it s not ok for america gasoline prices are at least a dollar higher than they ought to be forget inflation deflation could rear its ugly head soon looking around the economy however before any real biden world damage is done things still look pretty good consumers have plenty of cash and savings on hand manufacturing is strong business equipment is strong housing may have temporarily stalled from a supply shortage though lumber prices have crashed about 40 the pmis and the ism s may be off their highs but still very strong though it s worth mentioning that employment in the manufacturing and non manufacturing isms has dipped below 50 which is not a great sign there is no question that inflation is up at least temporarily i m still not convinced high inflation is going to be a long term problem i think the strong recovery from the vaccine miracle and the reopening of businesses has created a lot of one off price increases and temporary supply bottlenecks however higher inflation will last at least another couple of months this year before it backs down next year all in i m going to still argue that this is the v shaped recovery spawned by trump policies for operation warped speed vaccines lower taxes fewer regulations although the energy independent story has been diminished in other words it s still the trump economy until further legislative notice now back to the markets they don t seem to be worried about inflation with 10 year treasuries falling to nearly a buck and a quarter king dollar is steady to stronger and the 5 year tips break evens which are a bond market barometer of future inflation are well below 2 5 percent this normally gets you consumer deflator that the fed watches around 2 of course the fed has been printing a huge quantity of free money but it looks like their posture is slowly changing and their policy will be headed back to earth sooner than we or they originally thought not everybody agrees with me on inflation most of my conservative friends disagree but we ll see what the dollar does that s always my north star dow futures tumble in stock selloff yields slide meanwhile my pal tony fauci is at it again and telling folks to bring their masks back even if they are vaccinated due to the delta variant our go to guy dr marty makary says the vaccine covers the delta variant president biden wants to go door to door to vaccinate folks which i think is a really bad idea folks should get vaccinated on their own using good common sense and the government should stay out the swamp in washington is already bad enough without it spreading around the rest of the country which i fear it already is case rates have jumped overseas in japan britain france and to our friends in canada they have barely increased here in the u s but there is a lot of scare talk i will wonder out loud if it s affecting the stock market the economy business etc this article is adapted from larry kudlow s opening commentary on the july 8 2021 edition of kudlow

law firms have recently become prime targets for cybercriminals seeking to steal expose sell or otherwise extort confidential information both the digitalization of law firms sensitive documents and the increase in means available to perpetrate an online crime exacerbate these risks law firms encounter various cybersecurity risks from insiders personnel within the company and external persons as a response many law firms have adopted cybersecurity obligations to protect its clients data and the firm s integrity and reputation main cybersecurity risks facing law firms law firms naturally handle sensitive client data and confidential company information the lack of strong internal controls and compliance programs leaves law firms open to cyber attacks these attacks can be committed by insiders within the firm as well as external actors some examples of cybersecurity risks for law firms include the following data breaches this risk involves the theft of personal or sensitive data from law firms and can be perpetrated for a variety of reasons including financial gain or retaliatory purposes cyber criminals will typically execute these attacks by accessing the law firm s computer from a remote location collecting the personal or sensitive data and distributing it to third parties ransomware ransomware involves encrypting the law firm s important files and demanding a fee or ransom in order for the cyber criminal to restore the file for the law firm s use phishing this scam involves sending a scam message to an individual s in the hopes of getting them to send back confidential information this risk is especially prevalent in law firms due to the high volume of emails sent from external persons if severe the attorney s entire email account could be hacked thus revealing mounds of sensitive client details website attacks attorneys visit multiple legitimate websites in a day as a part of their daily responsibilities criminals and hackers exploit this by infecting the computers of individuals who visit less secured websites miscellaneous cyber threats additional threats to law firms security include 1 malpractice lawsuits that follow a breach and 2 cyber crimes committed by insiders a client can file a malpractice lawsuit where they believe their attorney has failed to maintain adequate safeguards over their sensitive information further insider threats can originate from former disgruntled employees or current personnel members and are often very challenging to detect because these individuals often have access to the computers storing the data by the time law firms notice the breach it may have already suffered financial loss and consequently media attention and reputational harm a robust cybersecurity compliance program would help the firm secure the data against improper access and use in other words maintaining strong cybersecurity policies within your firm is key to mitigating liability exposure dr nick oberheiden founding attorney of oberheiden p c 2020 statistics on cybersecurity and law firms the american bar association s legal technology resource center compiles an annual report on cybersecurity for law firms that discusses the adoption of compliance programs types of cyber risks and injuries caused from cybersecurity breaches the number of law firms reporting a security breach increased from 26 in 2019 to 29 in 2020 some of these results may have been impacted by covid 19 since many law firms moved operations online thus necessitating virtual work environments and online communications security breaches analyzed in the aba s report were broad and included stolen computers exploiting vulnerabilities in websites and hacking law firms experiencing viruses spyware or other infection within their company must expend significant amounts of time energy and money in correcting the issue a recent example in 2019 a senior director of corporate law and lawyer at apple was charged and indicted on insider trading charges the indictment alleged that the lawyer traded confidential information during a blackout period where no stock can be bought or sold legal obligations for law firms statutes on cybersecurity there is no federal law regulating a law firm s cybersecurity practices and policies however federal law does regulate specific industry practices for instance if a law firm has a client within the healthcare accounting or financial industry sectors additional federal obligations may apply clients in the financial industry sector may require that their law firms maintain extra security protection due to the sensitive nature of financial data the same applies for healthcare companies who store confidential health records of the public clients that specialize in accounting practices must comply with the sarbanes oxley act of 2002 which could impose additional obligations on the law firms representing those clients the failure of the law firms to properly safeguard client data in these circumstances could lead to federal investigations lawsuits loss of future clients fines and penalties and significant reputational harm in addition to industry standards encompassed by federal law each state has its own laws regulating data protection law firms in california must be mindful of the california consumer privacy act while law firms in new york must take account of the regulations of the new york state department of financial services as well as the stop hacks and improve electronic data security sheild act law firms may also find it beneficial to adhere to cybersecurity guidelines the national institute of standards and technology nist is a non regulatory agency within the department of commerce that provides guidelines for cybersecurity regulations for the federal government nist standards are voluntary but compliance with nist s cybersecurity framework is good practice for law firms and provides good evidence that the law firm took sufficient measures to comply with cybersecurity related laws and industry practices ethical obligations for law firms protecting client data and maintaining confidentiality state boards are responsible for regulating the conduct of lawyers and law firms to do this state boards often issue ethical opinions to guide them on appropriate cybersecurity practices within their law firms specifically u s law firms have to adhere to the aba s model rules of professional conduct model rule of professional conduct 1 4 requires attorneys to make sure that clients are reasonably informed about the status of the matter and to explain a matter to the extent reasonably necessary to permit the client to make informed decisions regarding the representation further model rule of professional conduct 1 6 states that lawyers must make reasonable efforts to prevent the inadvertent or unauthorized disclosure of or unauthorized access to information relating to the representation of a client comment 8 to model rule 1 explains that in order to maintain the required knowledge and skill lawyers should stay abreast of all changes including the benefits and risks associated with relevant technology aba formal opinion 483 on lawyers obligations after an electronic data breach or cyberattack provides that lawyers have a duty to make reasonable efforts to avoid data loss or to detect cyber intrusion and that an ethical violation may occur if the lawyer does not undertake these steps thus because law firms often do business with colleagues opposing counsel federal agencies and clients via electronic communications they have an obligation to ensure that all data is properly stored secured and safeguarded internal obligations for law firms strengthening cybersecurity from the inside law firms are finding it beneficial to adopt or strengthen their internal practices to strengthen overall cybersecurity examples of supplements to a law firm s cybersecurity include the following cyber insurance cloud backup encryption software reboot and backup policies strong firewalls risk assessment and internal controls robust cybersecurity compliance program crisis response plan for cyberattacks reliable antivirus software strong password combination strict controls over personnel access to sensitive information using only secured wi fi conclusion cybersecurity breaches of a law firm s sensitive or confidential data can lead to lawsuits investigations fines and penalties and unwanted media attention it can not only hurt the law firm s ability to attract clients in the future but also the reputation of the individual attorneys attorneys implicated in data breaches and other cybersecurity risks undermine the attorney s duties of competency and confidentiality to prevent such disastrous consequences that will follow from these breaches many law firms follow strict legal ethical and internal obligations regarding strong cybersecurity practices obligations such as compliance with industry standards and state laws aba ethical rules and internal best practices within the law firm enable the law firm to mitigate cybersecurity risk

why are these rent increases happening in spokane and are they even legal krem 2 asked the experts example video title will go here for this video example video title will go here for this video spokane wash across spokane and much of washington tenants are getting notices from their landlords that their rent is about to go up dramatically sometimes by 100 percent or more it comes as the statewide moratorium on rent hikes instituted by governor jay inslee during the pandemic expired at the end of june so why are these increases happening and are they even legal we asked the experts why rent is going up daniel klemme president of the landlords association of the inland northwest told krem there are a plethora of factors pushing up rents the first reason demand for housing is shooting up as spokane grows i think there s just a lot more people that can live here now because so many more jobs are work from home said klemme second supply is going down people who owned homes that they rented out are now selling those houses given the hot market leaving less spaces to rent third landlords are looking to recoup money they didn t get during the pandemic the eviction moratorium there was a significant amount of non payment of rent said klemme a lot of landlords some of them have tenants that haven t paid that owe 15 000 to 20 000 and so the only thing they can think to do to try to recapture some of that profit or even just to break even is to raise the rents on all their units klemme also blames new state laws that create more protections for tenants and restrictions on landlords if it takes 5 000 to 10 000 to evict somebody you can no longer charge a tenant for that he said and so those costs have to go somewhere three other reasons he cites property values going up costing landlords more in property taxes lumber getting more expensive and increasing the cost of maintenance and renovations and general uncertainty about the future of the housing market klemme says the best way to get prices to stabilize would be to increase housing supply the housing stock isn t being replaced with new building he said so really i think the best way to bring the prices down right now is to build more what protections for tenants exist monica holland a managing attorney at the northwest justice project in spokane says locally there are basically no restrictions on how much landlords can raise your rent there is no rent control in washington state right now she said so landlords can charge as much rent as they want as often as they want the only requirements she said are related to giving tenants proper advance notice of the increase your landlord has to give you 60 days advance notice it has to be in writing and the rent increase cannot take place cannot become effective during the term of your lease said holland the term of your lease has to end first and then the rent increase can kick in if you re in some sort of subsidized housing the notice period is shorter those tenants need to only receive 30 days of written notice of a rent increase said holland so it s really important to know what kind of rental agreement you have since the moratorium on rent hikes expired at the end of june holland believes the earliest landlords could give notice of increased rent is july 1 meaning the soonest the rent could actually go up is september 1 for non subsidized tenants or august 1 for subsidized ones if your landlord notified you anytime after july 1 that would give you another month before the increase could kick in there is one exception under which it may be illegal for landlords to raise rents according to holland that would be if they accepted rental assistance funds from the government that were provided on the condition that they did not raise rent she says if landlords do receive such funds they are required to notify their tenants about it if you think a law may have been violated and want to look into it more or request legal assistance holland suggest going to washington law help or calling nwjp s clear hotline

bismarck tribune nd jul 8 rains across north dakota slightly eased the state s dry conditions but the entire state remains in some form of drought according to the u s drought monitor an area of exceptional drought the worst of four categories centered mostly in the north central part of the state now covers about 12 of the state down from nearly 18 last week areas of extreme the second worst category and exceptional drought categories now exist in about 52 of the state a drop from almost 61 at the end of june more than 91 of the state is in the drought monitor s severe category or higher more than two thirds of the state s pasture and range is in poor or very poor condition according to the national agricultural statistics service just 3 is in good condition and none is considered excellent some 81 of the state s stock water supply is short or very short the service said with about 19 deemed adequate none of the state s alfalfa is considered excellent and just 5 is in good condition less than a quarter is in fair condition and 81 is poor or very poor the service said crop conditions likewise are lagging half the state s spring wheat is considered poor or very poor with 32 in fair condition winter wheat stands at 57 poor or very poor and 29 in fair condition soybeans are doing somewhat better with 38 in poor or very poor condition 43 deemed fair 18 good and 1 excellent there s a chance of thunderstorms friday afternoon and into the evening but nothing widespread is expected said rick krolak observation program leader for the national weather service in bismarck the chance of storms will continue into saturday in the south and central parts of the state but dissipate in the afternoon there s nothing long term or steady hit and miss thunderstorms krolak said temperatures over the next few days will be mostly in the mid to upper 80s which is about normal for this time of year the higher temps will be in the west and in the north near the turtle mountains the highs will top out in the mid to upper 70s krolak said blister beetles the state s drought has prompted extension livestock experts to warn producers of a threat from blister beetles which produce a poison that is toxic to people and livestock especially horses the beetle population increases because immature beetles feed on grasshopper eggs which are more plentiful during drought years said jan knodel ndsu extension entomologist blister beetles are attracted to blooming alfalfa fields and weeds such as goldenrod and dandelions adults are active june through september and will feed on nectar pollen leaves stems and flowers they feed for a short time and then migrate to other areas of a field or to new fields after alfalfa is cut they often move into blooming canola or other blooming field crops hay fields adjacent to rangeland pastures are at higher risk for blister beetle infestations because grasshopper populations are typically higher in rangeland pastures cantharidin oil is released when beetles are crushed and even dead beetles have high levels of the toxin knodel said thirty to 50 beetles could be lethal to horses knodel said toxicity levels in cattle have not been identified ndsu toxicologist michelle mostrom said to reduce the threat producers should control blooming weed hosts near or in alfalfa fields cut alfalfa at less than 10 bloom and or late in the season mid august to early september check fields before cutting to make sure new swarms haven t infested allow cut hay to fully dry before raking to encourage beetles to move out check for beetles in harvested hay and underneath windrows and allow them to move out before baling use equipment without hay conditioners or crimpers that may crush the beetles producers if possible should cut hay with a sickle bar mower or rotary mower so the beetles can move out after cutting said karl hoppe extension livestock systems specialist if large numbers of beetles are seen it s best to quit harvesting and let them move out hoppe said catharadin is a stable compound and the levels will not reduce during storage said janna block extension livestock systems specialist if blister beetles are suspected in harvested hay it s best not to feed it block said cover crop changes the department of agriculture s risk management agency announced this week that it allow producers to hay graze or chop cover crops on prevented plant acres at any time and still receive their full crop insurance indemnity according to information from u s sen john hoeven prior to the change producers would have faced a penalty

the perception of china as a growing and global threat has become a bipartisan issue in washington that more or less seamlessly persisted through the handover of power from the previous presidential administration to the current one indeed over the past several months the united states government effectively managed to rally its allies in multiple corners of the world to recognize and stand up to the china challenge see china brief march 25 see edm june 21 july 6 russia in turn is seen by washington as an active troublemaker and a potentially deadly nuclear superpower but one with a relatively small stagnant economy that is incapable of mass producing modern warships or any other industrial hardware at china s level western diplomats and political leaders have been increasingly vocal in telling their russian counterparts to be aware of the potential threat emanating from beijing with china s outreach continuously expanding economically technologically and militarily while russia languishes the ostensible enhanced strategic partnership between the two eurasian countries is increasingly lopsided their advice to moscow look out and distance itself from beijing or russia may end up a chinese dependency or vassal losing its coveted sovereignty and maybe even territory to a not so gentle master attempts to teach russians to understand the potential perils of being too close to china politically geographically and militarily have been coming from us european and japanese officials and academics and apparently most recently from us president joseph biden himself during his june 16 summit with president vladimir putin in geneva this prodding raised concerns in beijing in an interview last month reporters from the global times a tabloid under the auspices of the chinese communist party s flagship people s daily asked the russian ambassador to china andrey denisov some analysts suggest the biden administration may take measures to ease tensions with russia in order to concentrate on dealing with china will this strategy alienate russia from china and draw it closer to the us denisov replied matter of factly it can t happen i think we re smarter than what the americans think global times june 13 russia soviet union and china were bitter enemies for decades during the cold war following a relatively short period of close alliance in the 1950s it is notable therefore that the present top military intelligence diplomatic political leadership in russia with putin at the helm all people over 60 grew up and began their respective careers when china was considered an archenemy on par with the united states in fact the people s republic may even have been worse because it could potentially muster a 100 million plus strong peasant army to invade and overrun soviet siberia and beyond suspicion and apprehension of china and its long term intensions is deep rooted in the russian collective psyche see commentaries january 15 2010 see edm february 23 2021 see jamestown org september 13 2016 still western attempts to insert wedges into the moscow beijing strategic partnership seem to be failing as real russian money follows official rhetoric on june 3 2021 during the annual st petersburg international economic forum top russian state officials announced that the government would be shedding us dollars from the account sheet of russia s sovereign national wealth fund fnb and a month later the ministry of finance announced that this currency conversion was complete the fnb officially stood at 13 6 trillion rubles 188 billion as of july 1 the liquid part of the federal fund not invested into infrastructure and other projects totals 8 3 trillion rubles around 115 billion thirty five percent of that sum was previously parked in us treasury bonds which have now been sold off holdings in british pound denominated paper were reduced from 10 percent to 5 percent while holdings in japanese yen stayed at 5 percent holdings in euro denominated paper increased from 35 percent to 39 7 percent and doubled in chinese renminbi from 15 to 30 4 percent some 20 2 percent of the fnb reserves in different central bank accounts are today denominated in gold bullion the fnb s nominal owner is the russian finance ministry but it is managed by the central bank overall russian hard currency reserves were valued at 592 billion as of june 25 the central bank continues to keep us treasuries on its balance sheet though their amount is decreasing russia is a major gold producer and exporter in recent years the central bank has been buying up substantial amounts of gold bullion and keeping it in its vaults the gold in the fnb is physically held by the central bank kommersant july 7 the elimination of the us dollar from the national wealth fund is no small matter the fnb is formed out of surplus natural resource oil and so on export earnings that are predominantly valued in dollars russian exporters who are paid in euros in europe convert them there into us dollars repatriate this money and sell it at the moscow currency bourse where the trade is 80 percent in us dollars and 20 percent in euros the central bank buys up the currency also on behalf of the fnb and then converts it into euros or renminbi which is actually not a freely convertible currency interfax june 7 none of these operations are financially prudent because of the recent decline of the euro and gold against the dollar the fnb apparently lost up to 2 billion in a single month still the first deputy prime minister and kremlin insider andrei belousov told journalists that the decision to ditch the dollar from the fnb was taken by russia s political leadership i e putin after serious consideration to avoid the threat of sanctions interfax june 3 apparently the kremlin foresees a possible catastrophic worsening of relations with the us and its allies and a possible freeze of russian assets the fnb though managed by the central bank is still owned by the government the hard currency reserves of the nominally independent central bank per se are apparently seen as less vulnerable than government owned funds central bank reserves could possibly be frozen only if a local standoff escalates into full scale warfare between russia and the us the renminbi and gold though less easily convertible than us dollars are seen as safe havens euro denominated paper primarily german government bonds and notes are evidently seen as safe as well presumably germany would be the last western country to freeze russian government accounts in its banking system the biden putin summit in geneva last month did not change russia s overall threat assessment see edm june 17 21 and the costly selling off of us dollars from the fnb proceeded as planned rhetoric notwithstanding moscow seems wholly serious about maintaining its course of confrontation with the us while closing ranks with china

in the contest for power and resources in history people always try to outdo each other by creating divisions around race ethnicity or faith people do this to enlist group support for otherwise private agenda or whip support for personal disappointment or loss as it presently is sometimes when faith and ethnicity are the same demagogue explores doctrinaire differences as it was in europe in the 17th century where european kings fought a 30 years war dividing themselves into catholics or protestants between 1618 and 1648 europe never emerged significantly as a powerhouse until it overcame that era of darkness only then was it able to march into renaissance enlightenment industrial revolution and democracy ethnically and religiously homogeneous somalia whose war lords divided it along clans has yet to escape from the ruins and darkness of her own division rwanda to the contrary is matching forward having buried the ghost of hatred making development a focus when i was a young student both at a levels and the university it was our aspiration to seek the unity of all of africa into one country in the manner america as espoused by kwame nkrumah the first prime minister of ghana and sekou toure the first president of guinea and other great nationalists some of our mentors in nigeria such as alao aka bashorun worked as pan africanist in drafting the constitutions of many newly independent african countries in a clime when nigeria s justice akinola aguda served as chief justice of botswana we saw all africans as same and we perceived any attack on any group of africans as an attack on the rest of us it was in that spirit that on january 6 1988 rotimi ewebiyi olaitan oyerinde chris ayaze sylvester odion and my humble self all students of the university of lagos were arrested and detained after the massive protest we staged alongside nigerian workers and students following prime minister thatcher of britain s visit we were protesting in nigeria against her pro apartheid policy in south africa where we are coming from is of course very far from where we are now where people are demonstrating to break nigeria in the days of yore it was unimaginable for us that there will come a time that advocacy will become fervent that we break nigeria into separate countries nigeria which we considered then as one of the small 52 states of africa just the size of california everything from farming practices pastoralist vs farmers differences in dressing climate and land are being thrown in the discus to magnify our differences the methods are even regrettably pedestrian in what seem to be an argument that it is needless to save the unity of the country tragically those who have held high offices in nigeria at one point are stoking the current embers of disunity the truth very stubborn truth is that we are the same people more than the magnifying glasses of separatists want us to see nigeria may have diverse languages but the cultures of most nigerian ethnic groups are the same pointing to the same roots in distant history and here is why the cosmogony religious rights history and cultures of most nigerians pre colonial and pre arabic influence are largely the same despite diversity in language the african american scholar chancellor williams has already done justice to this question in his seminar work the destruction of african civilization great issue of a race williams explained that two major factors account for why africa though account for less than 3 of global trade is home to the highest numbers of languages and dialects in the world but same culture these factors are first the migration that occurred in prehistoric times because of the dry up desertification of the areas of the sahara which was home to a previously thriving culture and life the second was forced migration owing to various wars of conquest according to professor williams when people flee they go in small bands in different directions carrying the memory of their cultures and cosmogony but often lose their original languages as they travel far in nigeria it is possible to decipher a definite relationship in the pre colonial and pre arabically influenced cultures of western and northern nigeria these are presumed to be cultures whose ruling classes migrated from meriotic sudan ethiopia and egypt the same practices in the hausa bori cult of worship exists in the sango yoruba cult of worship similarly the same practices are found in the amadioha worship circle amongst the igbos who though are associated with the bantustan stock the details of these assumptions should have by now been a subject of a detail study in archaeology history linguistics using modern technology of historical reconstruction cheikh anta diop who i consider the most outstanding african scholar historian physicist archaeologist and chemist has done some pioneer work on this subject and planned a perspective for historical reconstruction of africa cultures which establishes that africans are essentially the same people not different people and can live together and must ever break from been sliced into tiny groups for easy conquest this was his preoccupation with his books cultural unity of africa africa pre colonial the african origin of civilization myth or reality civilization or barbarism and last the economic and cultural basis for a federated african state i recommend these important works for advocates of separatism who constantly repeat the false doctrine that we are different people we cannot live together let everyone go their ways africans everywhere are of the same ancestry all human beings are of the same ancestry and so says the bible in act of apostle 17 26 and hath made of one blood all nations of men for dwelling on all the face of the earth and hath determined the times before appointed and the bounds of their habitation let us resolve our economic and political challenges in nigeria in the political turf let us keep ethnic division and religious bigotry out of it ethno religious confrontation are conflicts no one can ever win as all are always losers in that field nigeria is a beautiful country the most formidable promise of the african people it started well at independence and her people had learnt to live together peacefully well until the setback of the civil war triggered by the 1966 military coup the fantastic testament of our peaceful co existence and integration includes such occasions as when the mainly christian voters of gboko elected a kanuri muslim man abubakar imam to represent them in the northern state assembly it includes when chief obafemi awolowo campaigned for ernest ikoli an ijaw man in the lagos elections against a fellow ijebu man akinsanya in the early 1960 s right to the seventies 70 s easterners like kalu anya served in borno judiciary as well as justice olagunju a yoruba man from offa who trained many jurists in the sokoto division today s setbacks are not conclusive evidence of our inability to live together but challenges we must overcome as even the most advanced countries of the world such as united states of america united kingdom spain and france still grapple with issues of identity nigerians up till today are still more tolerant of each other than the separatist s propaganda want us to believe even as we write the only seat allocated to kebbi state at the supreme court is occupied by a jurist originally from delta state who practiced in the old sokoto state and married from argungu justice amina adamu augie kebbi people do not regard her as a foreigner but a loyal daughter of kebbi it is time to talk a little more about the prime point in our journey to national integration rather than our low points nigerians can live together peacefully and in prosperity once we regain our minds to do some of the right things including decentralizing more powers to the states and local government electing focused leaders with clear vision for economic and social development with character and antecedents that show they can deliver on promises and embarking immediately on a policy of national reconciliation and inclusiveness these are what nigeria needs not division olawepo hashim businessman politician and former presidential candidate writes in from abuja you should not miss these headlines from nigerian

evidence has emerged that the common cold virus has been around for longer than previously believed a lot longer in fact in a study published online in the open access journal biorxiv a team of microbiologists and genetic researchers from copenhagen university explain how they recovered residues of the adenovirus c in a pair of 31 000 year old teeth the teeth that produced these viral samples were recovered from an archaeological site on the tundra of northeastern siberia near the yana river they belonged to a child who was part of an ethnic group known as the ancient north siberians who were ancestors of modern native americans human pathogenic viruses causing respiratory and enteric infections include the adenovirus c which is known to cause the common cold adenovirus c was found in siberia based on the latest research report which is the oldest evidence ever of the common cold in humans 31 000 years ago kateryna_kon adobe stock the oldest ever virus found in humans the common cold adenovirus c is one of several viruses that are known to cause the common cold its presence in an ancient human fossil a child s tooth in this case is unprecedented the ancient sample was the oldest virus in humans yet according to danish microbiologist and lead study author sofie holtsmark nielsen who spoke with the new scientist about her team s remarkable achievements it represents the first molecular evidence that early modern humans in the pleistocene hosted common childhood viral infections nielsen and her partners wrote in their biorxiv article previously the oldest viral sample taken from a human specimen was just 7 000 years old in the same study the scientists also found four versions of the modern herpes virus including herpes simplex 1 which can cause cold sores to develop viruses of many types were obviously well established in human populations tens of thousands of years ago during the pleistocene epoch when glaciers still covered a sizable area of the earth when humans have the common cold or the flu leukocytes white white blood cells attack the virus green in this 3d illustration there are red blood cells and white blood cells the common cold or flu virus is green siarhei adobe stock tracing the evolution of the common cold as amazing as their initial discovery was the danish researchers weren t finished taking their research one step further they compared their 31 000 year old adenovirus c residues with samples of the modern version of the virus the idea was that by comparing and contrasting these two closely related but still different entities they could determine how long ago they diverged from a common evolutionary ancestor the scientists employed the most advanced analytical tools available in evolutionary science and microbiology in their search for an answer eventually they determined that the two adenovirus c samples could be traced back to a common ancestor that existed sometime between 487 000 and 963 000 years ago with an estimated date of 702 000 years ago being the most likely time that such a virus would have been found in nature if this estimate is correct it means the common cold has been around for at least 400 000 years longer than the modern version of homo sapiens us the common cold virus would have relied on archaic human species like the neanderthals and the denisovans to act as its hosts it would have entered the homo sapiens line through interactions with such archaic hominin species like the one that occurred when modern humans met neanderthals after migrating out of africa approximately 60 000 years ago in fact the genetic analysis performed in this new study found signs of a change in the makeup of the virus that had occurred sometime within the last 70 000 years this could mean that the cold virus jumped from neanderthals to modern humans once they started living together and interbreeding different groups have mixed and migrated throughout siberia in russia and into north america over the past 40 000 years based on the latest research study it was the ancient north siberians eurasians that first caught the thing we know as the common cold martin sikora nature the ancient north siberians and the first native americans the yana rhinoceros horn site in northeastern siberia was first excavated 20 years ago it has produced prodigious quantities of animal bones along with stone tools and other evidence showing humans had settled in the area in ancient times only after examining the 31 000 year old children s baby teeth which were unearthed in 2019 did scientists realize they d found the remains of a previously unknown ethnic group of modern humans these people were dubbed the ancient north siberians and scientists say they are the closest ancestors of native americans that have ever been found the two 31 000 year old milk teeth found at the yana rhinoceros horn site in russia which led to the discovery of a new group of ancient siberians the ancient north siberians eurasians russian academy of sciences nature living in some the of coldest areas on the planet near the end of the last ice age the ancient north siberians survived by hunting woolly mammoths woolly rhinoceroses and bison about 24 000 years ago the ancient north siberians split into two genetically distinct groups one that would stay in the area from then on and another that would eventually be on the move a few thousand years later sea levels plunged and the bering strait land bridge opened between ancient siberia and the unexplored north american continent at that time one group of ancient north siberian descendants took the opportunity to cross the bridge before migrating southward and eastward these would have been the direct ancestors of at least some modern era native americans and also the descendants of the original ancient north siberians scientists say the ancient north siberians were well suited for long distance exploration and settlement they adapted to extreme environments very quickly and were highly mobile explained martin sikora a genetic researcher affiliated with the copenhagen university s lundbeck foundation centre for geogenetics sikora was involved in the 2019 study published in nature that revealed the existence of the ancient north siberians and was a participant in the new ancient viral study as well these findings have changed a lot of what we thought we knew about the population history of northeastern siberia but also what we know about the history of human migration as a whole sikora told the daily mail back in 2019 many new viruses were introduced to north south and central america by european explorers in the 15 th and 16 thcenturies many of these viruses were highly lethal to native americans who lacked immunity to these disease carrying microbes but it seems the common cold virus had already been around for more than 10 000 years by the time the europeans arrived in the new world having been carried across the bering strait land bridge by the ancient north siberians who then became the first north americans top image a scientific illustration of what the upward sun river camp in the tanana river

adamis pharmaceuticals a developer of treatments for allergic reactions opioid overdoses and respiratory ailments has sidestepped a nasty proxy fight with a disgruntled shareholder at least for now but the contentious challenge for control of the unprofitable san diego company which adamis claims is a shakedown could resurface this fall depending on the outcome of a legal proceeding in delaware chancery court that is when shareholder jerald hammann a minnesota based health care consultant will make his case that adamis board of directors breached its fiduciary duty by moving up the company s annual meeting from aug 20 last year to july 16 this year advertisement hammann contends the switch resulted in his slate of four alternative board candidates missing the deadline to qualify for the shareholder ballots under the company s bylaws if the court finds in hammann s favor it could order a special shareholder meeting later this year or early next with hammann s candidates included on the ballot among other remedies in an interview hammann said he does not plan to send out alternative proxy ballots or write a letter to shareholders advising them on the july 16 election i am going to devote my resources to getting ready for the trial and doing everything necessary in discovery to prepare for the trial he said adamis declined to comment but in letters to shareholders and court documents it claims that hammann approached the company in february and threatened to run a campaign against the board unless adamis hired him under a lucrative consulting agreement when adamis declined hammann bought shares and informed the company in march that he had begun the process of launching a proxy fight in april adamis set july 16 as its annual meeting date hammann contends the move was designed to trip up his proxy challenge and was buried on page 67 of the company s annual report he filed a lawsuit seeking a temporary restraining order to block the meeting a delaware judge rejected hammann s request for delay but the judge agreed to hear arguments on whether moving the annual meeting after learning of the proposed challenge was permissible if not that could result in an expedited new election arguments in the case are tentatively scheduled for september hammann claims adamis lacks a coherent business plan is poorly run and overpays its executives when the company first became public eight years ago its shares traded at 7 82 adjusted for splits the stock closed thursday at 1 05 revenue declined 25 percent last year to 16 5 million the company lost 49 million adamis counters that it has a solid drug development pipeline and balance sheet it contends hammann has no biotech industry experience no public company board experience and no articulated plan for adamis he owns 1 000 shares a tiny fraction of the 148 million shares outstanding yet seeks to remove 80 percent of the company s board we hope stockholders recognize that supporting mr hammann s misguided campaign would be akin to taking what we believe is a major risk adamis wrote in a july 1 letter to shareholders rather than support a litigious stockholder that is waging a costly and distracting battle with the company we urge you to reject his efforts by voting to re elect your current board
goldman sachs group and jpmorgan chase are ditching safeguards on the credit lines they extend to managers of collateralized loan obligations as they seek to defend their market share in the lucrative business of arranging clo deals the wall street behemoths are among the biggest providers of financing facilities known as warehouses which managers in the 780 billion u s clo market use to buy risky corporate loans before they slice and repackage them into bonds the pair are increasingly providing credit lines without protections that allow them to demand more cash should the value of the debt plunge before it s sold to investors according to people with knowledge of the matter the decision to take more risk with their balance sheets is a reversal of sorts for goldman and jpmorgan they were previously known for almost exclusively offering so called mark to market warehouses in contrast with the majority of rival lenders that mostly provided financing without market value triggers the people said it s a win for clo managers who have largely sought to avoid such provisions after being stung last march as the covid 19 outbreak spurred a plunge in loan prices fueling a rash of collateral calls it s painful to get the capital call when prices are trading down said young choi a partner at king street capital management in new york representatives for the banks declined to comment clo issuance has been on a record pace to start the year and is one of the biggest driving forces behind a resurgence in speculative lending that s fueling a boom in highly leveraged acquisitions by private equity firms this year while providing warehouses is generally considered at best a break even business for most banks lenders that supply the facilities almost always win clo arranging mandates which command significant fees both goldman and jpmorgan have been struggling to fend off competitors in the space recently goldman has tumbled six spots compared to the same period last year and ranks ninth among the top arrangers of u s clos in 2021 bloomberg league table data show jpmorgan has slipped one spot to second but has seen its market share decline over 6 percentage points more than any other bank in the rankings banks are flush with cash and are putting balance sheets to work said dave preston head of structured credit research at agl credit management they obviously want mark to market warehouses but investors generally prefer non mark to market ones warehouses are generally structured so that clo equity buyers most of whom commit capital prior to the debt being securitized or third party investors take the risk on the first chunk of losses in the portfolio mark to market credit lines provide lenders another buffer when leveraged loan price declines exceed certain thresholds as they did last year the extra safeguard emerged in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis in which banks were left with billions of dollars in losses after collateral managers couldn t offload debt they d been warehousing and were forced to liquidate at steep discounts since then their prevalence has steadily declined to the point where about 80 of credit lines prior to the coronavirus outbreak had no collateral triggers based on the secondary trading levels of loan portfolios citigroup inc the top clo arranger this year was among the earliest to transition to warehouses without market value triggers post crisis morgan stanley made the shift later and the banks now offer both structures market watchers say while very few warehouses ultimately liquidated last year as the federal reserve stepped in to backstop financial markets the collateral calls were nonetheless highly disruptive for clo managers and investors the pre pricing warehouse period is the one in which you face the greatest uncertainty said david moffitt co head of u s credit management at investcorp during the ramp you can be pressured by time execution risk and then finally the vicissitudes of asset and liability pricing any of which can go against you for more subscribe to the structured weekly still a handful of clo managers nonetheless prefer warehouses with market value triggers that s because banks will extend slightly more leverage and offer cheaper pricing since they re less risky for the lender managers with deep pocketed or in house equity may opt for the advantage of having better warehouse terms in exchange for the risk of having to put in more capital should the market turn most banks now offer both types of structures with the bulk of wall street now leaning heavily toward non mark to market warehouses in 2020 you could see the value of the non mark to market warehouse said ujjaval desai head of structured products at sound point capital management you could ride it out if you had a non mark to market facility

england governor mark carney and standard chartered chief executive officer bill winters is populated by hundreds of bankers airline executives sustainability experts commodities traders scientists and other business leaders on thursday after almost a year of internal wrangling the group set out its final recommendations for how to define an offset a sort of token that companies may use to

s favorite climate solution is mired in disagreements article content the next step is to establish a governance body that will determine a set of rules based on the taskforce s recommendations to drive up demand for credits that deliver on their climate promises but commodity exchanges in chicago and singapore are rushing to start trading contracts this year before the standards are decided raising concerns the taskforce will fail to provide any kind of structure to a market that already has no government oversight getting the contours of the market right could create a powerful weapon in the fight against climate change by funnelling much needed money to important environmental projects around the world but encouraging the trading of contracts without clear rules about what a high quality offset is and how the credits should be used to account for a company s total emissions could have devastating consequences companies could use questionable offsets as a license to keep

article continues below article content a key objective of the taskforce is to come up with a core carbon principle label that will be used to mark offsets that meet its standards akin to how groceries might be labeled organic members have spent months arguing over the criteria for inclusion with sharp divides over how high to set the bar even as companies have been itching to start trading we need to build this thing and launch it said tim adams head of the institute of international finance which is helping to organize the taskforce sonja gibbs another iif official said the taskforce has already done a large part of the legwork to define the principles giving direction to anyone wanting to adopt them now the non binding recommendations issued on thursday suggest that no offsets should be excluded from the market though high quality credits should get a special label each credit should be tagged with additional attributes such as its location or whether it removes co₂ there should be a robust legal framework behind all credits sold the hope is that the to be formed governance body will nail down the criteria for a high quality ccp label so trading can start in 2022 but some exchanges aren t waiting cme group inc one of the world s largest derivative exchanges has already started transactions singapore is planning to start trading ccp aligned contracts before world leaders gather in scotland for climate talks in november said adams advertisement 4 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content the trading will be facilitated by climate impact x a new platform backed by singapore s state investment firm stock exchange and largest bank the singapore trades will likely be based on rough guidelines that have been set out by the taskforce so far it s not clear whether those contracts could be later amended to fit with the ccps once they are final climate impact x declined to comment they re basically saying they promise to procure and deliver ccp certified credits to their counterparties in the future said derik broekhoff a taskforce member and senior scientist at the stockholm environment institute buyers will probably pay more than they would purchasing credits directly from brokers or project developers in exchange for the guarantee that they re buying high quality offsets endorsed by the taskforce the sellers will then be on the hook to obtain and deliver the credits he said high quality offsets that actually remove additional carbon from the atmosphere are extremely rare credits based on avoiding emissions made up 96 of all contracts issued last year according to data compiled by the taskforce mostly by seeking to prevent trees from being cut down or supporting renewable energy projects climate scientists are cautious of using such credits to erase a company s ongoing pollution because it s very difficult to determine how much carbon if any has really been saved advertisement 5 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content cme launched trading for trading carbon offset futures earlier this year accepting corsia eligible offsets issued by verified carbon standard american carbon registry and climate action reserve the first trade took place in march and included independent

when they are issued we are not climate change experts it said in a statement we are driven by customer demand and we will continue to be guided by our customers preferences and feedback we receive the decision by exchanges to move ahead with trading before the ccp label is finalized has reignited concerns from some taskforce members that the organizers of the group are willing to sacrifice

hewlett a member of the taskforce and chief technology officer at offsets registry gold standard the focus is on building a large efficient market to meet demand he said rather than working out the thorny issues of how companies should use offsets this is why there s so much suspicion the taskforce is also constrained by its lack of authority offsets trading is voluntary and project developers are reliant on companies being willing to fund their programs for some it s a question of getting trading to take off as quickly as possible so more funds can flow to boost environmental protection while slowly moving toward better standards and eventually even government regulation let s recognize and applaud those who are doing something of course and encourage them to do more said isabel

photo washington department of fish and wildlife a massive tiger trout pulled from loon lake in stevens county in late june has set a new state record state fishery managers have confirmed the 24 49 pound tiger trout broke the previous record by a full 6 pounds according to bruce baker an inland fish biologist with the washington department of fish and wildlife wdfw angler caylun peterson caught the monster tiger trout on june 26 2021 fishing in the early morning hours in part to escape the triple digit heat forecast for the day peterson said he s been fishing loon lake located about 30 miles north of spokane ever since he was a kid wdfw stocks a variety of fish in loon lake including about 85 000 kokanee in late spring several hundred jumbo rainbow trout in march april and 10 000 tiger trout in the fall tiger trout are a sterile hybrid fish produced by crossing a brown trout with a brook trout produced almost exclusively in hatcheries spin fishing and using a whole nightcrawler as bait peterson said he was targeting tiger trout on june 26 which he frequently does when fishing loon lake they fight really good they eat excellent they re just a blast to catch peterson said of tiger trout adding that they frequently grow quite large in the lake but he knew he had something special as soon as the record fish was on his line i hooked into that thing and he pulled drag for quite a while before it stopped he said as he reeled in the fish he could tell it was a big one but even once he d landed it he wasn t entirely sure he would keep it until he found it was unable to swim away on its own honestly i was ecstatic but tried to let it go because i was thinking in my head that if this thing is this big now in a year it might be a record peterson laughed well it turned out it was a record anyway fortunately peterson s mother and a neighbor quickly informed him that the state record for tiger trout was 18 pounds i said you gotta be kidding me i know this thing is over 18 pounds he said he was right a measurement confirmed the fish was a new state record and the official 24 49 pound weight was certified at wdfw s spokane office that monday the previous record for tiger trout was an 18 49 pound fish caught by angler kelly flaherty from bonaparte lake in okanogan county on may 6 2015 peterson is having his record fish taxidermied but just because he s hit a new high in his angling career he s nowhere near done fishing he s already been back to loon lake in search of the next record the washington department of fish and wildlife works to preserve protect and perpetuate fish wildlife and ecosystems while providing sustainable fish wildlife and recreational and commercial opportunities source washington department of fish and wildlife
