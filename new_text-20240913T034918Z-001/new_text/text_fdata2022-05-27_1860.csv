the retired investor wealth effect cuts both ways economists know that consumers spend more when their wealth increases even if their income remains the same however if wealth decreases the opposite occurs the concept known as the wealth effect has spurred the economy for well more than a decade as savers 401 k and other retirement accounts increased year after year at the same time real estate values have also risen of course most of the time these gains are only paper profits unless you sell your house or withdraw money from your portfolios nonetheless there is a behavioral element to this concept people tend to spend more when stocks and housing prices continue to climb because they feel wealthier and become more optimistic it is one of the reasons why in the u s consumer spending continues to remain robust until recently the federal reserve bank in past efforts to control inflation focused on removing the supply of credit to the financial markets they did so through hiking interest rates and slowing bond purchases however this time around the fed is targeting the demand side of the economic equation as well reducing demand in this case would require reversing some of the wealth accumulated over the last 10 years or more during the covid 19 pandemic stock portfolios and home prices soared thanks to the huge governmental monetary and fiscal stimulus that occurred america s top income earners who were working from home splurged on home remodeling new autos durable goods and all sorts of electronics trillions of dollars in stimulus checks and unemployment benefits supercharged consumer spending for those who made less as a result all income groups increased spending at rates far faster than before the pandemic the most recent government survey of retail sales for april 2022 indicated that retail sales outpaced inflation for a fourth straight month and while inflation climbs higher earners who already account for a large share of overall consumption seem willing to keep spending at least for now that retail sales data doesn t tell the whole story low and even middle income households are already cutting back demand is falling as the wealth effect appears to be working in reverse almost 60 percent of u s consumers according to a survey by brokerage firm jeffries conducted in april 2022 said they have reduced the number of items they typically buy in every category low and middle income consumers were cutting back far more than those in higher income groups in addition the national retail federation identified that 47 percent of consumers they surveyed last month april 2022 were switching to cheaper products and alternatives as well i have already pointed out this trend in past columns consumers are reducing meat consumption or choosing cheaper alternatives such as chicken pork or fish supermarket sales of private label brands are booming as well but inflation is not the only variable that is impacting consumers interest rates are also playing their part mortgage rates are the most obvious victim of a rising interest rate environment borrowing costs have jumped for 30 year mortgages from a sub 3 percent level last year to 5 25 percent today new home sales in april 2022 fell 16 6 percent from march and well below forecasts which was the slowest pace since april 2020 existing home sales were also falling for the last three months according to the national association of realtors auto leases and loans and credit cards are also big areas where higher rates hit the consumer most credit cards and car loans are priced off the prime rate which is in turn closely tied to the fed funds rate consumers can expect those rates to climb higher since the federal reserve bank is planning to raise the fed funds rate at least two more times in the next two months the big question most economists are asking is when will the combination of higher inflation declining stock markets and a possible downturn in the housing market start to reverse engineer the wealth effect at the higher income levels so far this year many investors have suffered anywhere from a 20 30 percent decline in their portfolios and retirement savings people are already having to rethink their retirement date as a result inflation and supply shortages are crimping remodeling and housing plans even as higher interest rates are expected to put a dent in housing prices soon as a result many americans are starting to feel less wealthy than they did last year the fed is counting on all of the above to change the psychology of consumers from spending like drunken sailors to something a bit more moderate but not enough to have them swear off entirely tinkering with the wealth effect can have unpredictable reactions how far is too far when you are trying to dampen down demand it is a fine line and the fed s tools to accomplish this feat are far from perfect if they get it wrong the economy will likely suffer let s hope they get it right

introduction to secretary blinken s address to the asia society washington d c the following is the full text of asia society policy institute aspi president kevin rudd s introductory remarks delivered at an aspi event in washington d c featuring an address by u s secretary of state antony blinken on the biden administration s policy towards china download the speech download secretary blinken members of the administration members of the congress members of the diplomatic corps distinguished guests ladies and gentlemen welcome to the asia society here in washington d c i m kevin rudd global president of the asia society and together with my vice presidents danny russel and wendy cutler we are delighted to today host the secretary of state outlining the administration s china policy founded in 1956 the mission of the asia society is to navigate shared futures between the united states and the countries of asia and over the last 65 years and across our 15 centers around the world and across constantly evolving geopolitical circumstances we have sought to do just that i would also like to acknowledge our colleagues from george washington university where we meet today including president mark wrighton and distinguished sinologist and dear colleague professor david shambaugh the future policy of the united states towards the people s republic of china is of fundamental consequence not just to these two countries but to all countries of the indo pacific region and indeed for the future of the global order itself both u s policy together with china s response will determine whether ours will be a future of strategic stability economic prosperity and environmental sustainability or whether it will be one of crisis escalation conflict or even war history of course is our somber guide on such questions but none of us are so captured by some pre determined forces of history that we cannot still secure with our chinese friends a shared future for us all the truth is that china under xi jinping has changed china has become more powerful and china under xi now seeks to assert that power in the region and in the world in a manner we have not seen in half a century that is because president xi now seeks to change the status quo in a manner that advances his definition of china s national interests and values the united states together with its friends partners and allies around the world is now responding to that challenge the secretary of state and the biden administration have as those of us across the analytical community observe indeed been active on this score the administration has been rebuilding u s alliances both in europe and in asia u s leadership has now seen nato for the first time focus fully on china s rise at the same time the administration has elevated the quadrilateral security dialogue to summit level indeed mr secretary together with the president you ve just returned from tokyo from the fourth summit level meeting of the quad since president joe biden took office this week s quad communique also announced the indo pacific partnership for maritime domain awareness to provide comprehensive aerial surveillance for the exclusive economic zones of small island developing economies of both the indian and the pacific oceans to help them preserve their valuable fish stocks and other maritime resources i know from my own experience that this is welcome across the small island countries of the pacific you ve also just held substantive discussions with prime minister fumio kishida prime minister narendra modi and my own successor as australian prime minister mr anthony albanese and earlier the newly elected leader of the republic of korea president yoon suk yeol the administration also recently gathered asean leaders here in the united states for a landmark summit meanwhile beyond the national security and foreign policy agenda the president also this week released the indo pacific economic framework drafted by secretary gina raimondo this embraces future coordination cooperation and where possible integration across a number of new drivers of pan regional economic growth including digital commerce the renewable energy revolution and supply chain security it seems therefore mr secretary that you ve had a few things on your plate indeed across the wider region there is an emerging sense that america is now well and truly back for the world at large what is also important is that the united states has been able to prosecute this significant strategic agenda in asia while at the same time dealing with the strategic crisis that now affects europe the russian invasion of ukraine in total violation of article ii of the un charter represents a signal challenge for all democracies around the world whether they are in europe or in asia or beyond indeed the russian invasion puts at risk the fundamental principles of territorial integrity and political sovereignty for all member states of the united nations system for the international community it has been important to see the united states as a leader of the free world comfortably managing both these challenges in europe and in asia at the same time such is the lot of global leadership finally mr secretary on responding to the complexity and the intensity of china s rise the international community appreciates the administration s continued efforts to carve out sufficient diplomatic and political space in the u s china relationship for strategic cooperation where there are common global interests are at stake we commend secretary john kerry and xie zhenhua s continued efforts on climate change just as we would encourage continued collaboration between the u s federal reserve and the people s bank of china on our common interest in maintaining global financial stability in these deeply uncertain global economic times and given how we all fell short in the management of the covid crisis how we could all better manage the next global public health challenge when it inevitably arises mr secretary you have always been a welcome guest among us at the asia society we very much look forward to your remarks here today please welcome the secretary of state of the united states antony blinken read secretary blinken s full address
thomas murphy a farsighted executive who built capital cities communications into a media juggernaut shocking the business world when he engineered the 3 5 billion acquisition of abc in 1985 and then oversaw his company s blockbuster merger with disney a decade later died may 25 at his home in rye n y he was 96 his death was announced in a statement by walt disney company which did not cite a cause a harvard business school graduate with a low key personality and methodical approach to business mr murphy helped reshape the national broadcasting and entertainment landscape in the late 20th century growing capital cities from a floundering television station in albany n y into a wall street darling that controlled dozens of radio television and publishing properties judging by stock price alone his leadership was phenomenally successful between 1957 when capital cities went public and 1995 when mr murphy arranged the merger with disney for 19 billion shareholders saw their investment increase in value 2 000 times but beyond his efforts to improve the bottom line he was also admired for building a corporate culture that emphasized ethical behavior and for philanthropic work that included leading the humanitarian group save the children for seven years as board chairman advertisement tom murphy was unrivaled in our industry not just for his business achievements but for his impeccable ethics his unwavering kindness and his boundless generosity former abc president and disney chief executive bob iger said in a statement he was a deeply principled man setting and demanding high standards always living up to them and never compromising ethics in the service of business mr murphy had a long history of aggressive takeovers before his company bought abc setting what was then a record for the biggest corporate acquisition outside the oil industry yet even with his track record the purchase came as a shock to analysts and investors since abc was about four times larger than capital cities one writer likened the purchase to a minnow swallowing a whale wall street cheered the transaction in part because of the lean management style at capital cities mr murphy had no legal department or personnel office and his secretary ran public relations and because of the involvement of his friend warren buffett the oracle of omaha who helped finance the deal and soon joined the board advertisement according to buffett the making of an american capitalist by roger lowenstein mr murphy started negotiating the deal in late 1984 when he visited the office of abc chief leonard goldenson leonard he said i don t want you to throw me out of the 39th floor but i have an idea instead of tossing him onto the streets of manhattan goldenson approved of the proposed acquisition trusting mr murphy to keep abc intact at a time when the network was running third in the ratings and attracting the attention of potential buyers who like mr murphy believed they could streamline the network and restore it to dominance the deal was strengthened after buffett agreed to be the 900 pound gorilla of the deal as he put it investing more than half a billion dollars in the company and refusing to sell his stake after the merger as part of an effort to prevent capital cities and abc from being snatched up by other conglomerates advertisement in part the investment was a symbol that buffett trusted mr murphy whom he had once bonded with over racquetball and a steak dinner he has none of those complexities of character that screw other people up and make for irrational behavior buffett said in a 1987 interview with the new york times indeed in a statement wednesday he said mr murphy taught me more about running a business than any other person mr murphy went on to lead capital cities and abc as chairman and chief executive aided by his longtime lieutenant daniel burke whom he described as an equal partner in the company both men employed a hands off approach emphasizing cost controls while trying to empower managers at a sprawling company that included the fledgling cable channel espn and publications such as the kansas city star fort worth star telegram and women s wear daily how many fewer people do you need to do your job they would ask and what projects can you postpone some abc journalists feared their managerial approach would devastate programs such as world news tonight nightline and 20 20 but mr murphy was generally praised for his stewardship of the news division after the company was sold journalist cokie roberts called him a world class boss and by all accounts he avoided interfering in editorial decisions mr murphy retired as chief executive in 1990 when he turned 65 but returned to the job in 1994 after burke retired as his successor a year later he negotiated with disney chief executive michael eisner to create what was then considered the most powerful entertainment company in the world uniting capital cities and abc properties with disney assets that included theme parks movie and television studios and a stable of legendary cartoon characters advertisement the deal was reported to be the second largest corporate takeover in history after the 1989 buyout of rjr nabisco for 25 billion and came during a period of growing consolidation in the entertainment business as new federal regulations freed the networks to own a financial interest in shows they broadcast just one day after the sale was announced westinghouse electric said it had agreed to buy cbs for 5 4 billion share this article share by all accounts the disney deal was arranged quickly following an impromptu conversation with eisner buffett and mr murphy at a media conference in sun valley idaho it was a career capstone for mr murphy who later served on the board of disney and of buffett s holding company berkshire hathaway while heading into retirement i m very happy we made the deal unfortunately i m going to be unemployed he joked in a 1995 interview with broadcasting cable a trade publication you know what my plan is i m going to become a character actor at disney advertisement thomas sawyer murphy was born in brooklyn on may 31 1925 his father a lawyer was active in democratic politics and became a justice of the state supreme court his mother was a homemaker whose optimism and devout catholicism were strong influences on a young tom murphy who later had his corporate headquarters in a building opposite st patrick s cathedral in manhattan mr murphy served in the navy during world war ii and graduated from cornell university with a mechanical engineering degree in 1945 four years later he received his mba from harvard after jobs as an industrial oil salesman and ad agency executive he landed at lever brothers as a brand manager only to leave in 1954 to become a station manager at hudson valley broadcasting the albany business that became capital cities advertisement the media company was initially owned by an investment group that included globe trotting radio broadcaster lowell thomas and lost money for its first few years leading mr murphy to develop an appreciation for cost controls he became president and then chairman in the 1960s after spearheading many early acquisitions by the company i always had on my desk a sheet of the people i would like to make deals with he recalled i went and saw them all that is how we built the company mr murphy was later appointed to the boards of ibm johnson johnson and texaco and he was president and chairman of the madison square boys girls club in new york city he was also a board trustee for five decades and chairman for seven of those years of what is now langone health at new york university advertisement in 1955 he married suzanne

onurdongel e via getty images diamondback energy inc nasdaq fang is one of the largest and most significant independent exploration and production companies in the permian basin this is a position that has gotten it a great deal of attention over the last year as the energy sector has been one of the best performing ones a major change from the lagging performance that the sector has delivered over the past decade diamondback energy has certainly benefited from this newfound market attention as the stock is up a phenomenal 85 78 over the past twelve months the high energy prices have also benefited the company too which is clearly illustrated in the companyâ s first quarter 2022 earnings results as is the case with many independent energy companies diamondback energy has been using its newfound good fortune to reward its shareholders this makes the company a reasonably good dividend play at least temporarily however there are some very real reasons to believe that high energy prices are with us to stay so diamondback energy could be positioned to continue to deliver solid performance for quite some time diamondback also enjoys a very attractive valuation at present so it is certainly not too late to get in and the company may even prove to be a boon for a portfolio that has been devastated by the problems in any other sector about diamondback energy as stated in the introduction diamondback energy is one of the largest and most significant independent exploration and production companies in the permian basin indeed diamondback was directly or indirectly responsible for much of the midstream infrastructure development that has benefited many other companies that operate in the region diamondback energy is a pure play operator as its only operations are located in the permian basin diamondback energy investor presentation diamondback energy boasts an impressive 423 000 net acres in the region this is a fairly good position to be in as the permian basin is one of the most mineral rich basins in the world in fact the basin has produced more than 33 billion barrels of crude oil and 118 trillion cubic feet of natural gas since it first began to be exploited in the 1920s yet geologists believe that it still has substantial resources today according to the united states geological survey the permian basin still contains over 46 billion barrels of crude oil 280 trillion cubic feet of natural gas and twenty billion barrels of natural gas liquids that can be recovered with west texas intermediate crude oil at 50 per barrel obviously prices are much higher than that now so it is conceivable that the economically recoverable resources are higher than that today this benefits diamondback energy in terms of its reserves which stood at 1 789 billion barrels of oil equivalents at the end of 2021 diamondback energy investor presentation investors often overlook an energy companyâ s reserves but they are critically important this is because the production of oil and gas is by its nature an extractive process diamondback energy literally obtains the products that it sells by pulling them out of reservoirs in the ground as these reservoirs only contain a finite quantity of resources the company must continually discover new sources of oil and gas or it will eventually run out of products to sell as there is no guarantee that the company will consistently enjoy success at discovering new resources its reserves dictate how long it can continue to operate without success at this task at diamondback energyâ s current production level of approximately 376 000 barrels of oil equivalent per day its reserves are sufficient to last for just over thirteen years this is a very reasonable reserve life that is actually greater than what many of the majors have so this is quite nice to see this long reserve life gives diamondback energy plenty of time to acquire new acreage or take other steps as needed to continue to produce over the long term defined as beyond the thirteen years that the company can already accomplish in my last article on diamondback energy i pointed out that the company has not been expressing any interest in growing its production going forward diamondback energy instead is looking to hold its production steady this is a marked departure from the companyâ s pre pandemic objective of rapid production growth diamondback energy reiterated this goal earlier this month as its management guided for a full year 2022 average crude oil production level of 218 000 to 222 000 barrels per day which is roughly what the company produced in the fourth quarter of 2021 the remainder of its production is natural gas and natural gas liquids the reason that the company is doing this is that it is aiming to maximize its free cash flow this is a direct response to several of the complaints that have been levied by investors against the oil and gas industry lately basically shareholders have been complaining about the industry generally underperforming other sectors in the years since the financial crisis if the company boosts its free cash flow then it will be better able to reward its shareholders because this is the money that allows the company to do things like buy back stock or pay a dividend diamondback energy certainly had a great deal of success at boosting its free cash flow recently in the first quarter of 2022 the company reported a free cash flow of 974 million which was a tremendous 194 26 increase over the 331 million that the company had in the first quarter of 2021 diamondback energy investor presentation todayâ s high energy prices certainly played a role but another significant contributor was the companyâ s efforts to keep its costs down this is one reason why it is being somewhat reluctant to increase production after all shale oil tends to be fairly expensive to produce which is one reason why the shale industry has been one of the largest issuers of junk debt over the past several years shale operators have certainly managed to bring these costs down over the years but that does not change the fact that diamondback energy is much more susceptible to oil price declines than an operator in the middle east for example diamondback energy expects to do even better in terms of free cash flow in 2022 due mostly to the very strong possibility that todayâ s energy prices will remain relatively consistent over the remainder of the year the company has guided for 3 6 billion or more in free cash flow in 2022 which would be a 48 70 increase over the 2 421 billion that the company had in 2021 as just mentioned the primary reason why diamondback energy has been focusing on maximizing its free cash flow is to reward the shareholders the company proved that in the first quarter of 2022 by declaring a 3 05 per share dividend this gives the stock an 8 36 annualized yield at the current price unfortunately though this incredible dividend may not prove to be permanent as is the case with many independent energy producers diamondback energy is paying its dividend on a base plus variable basis basically the company pays out a fixed amount currently 0 70 per share quarterly and then a considerable proportion of its free cash flow this could therefore cause the companyâ s dividend to decline when oil prices do since such an event would almost certainly negatively affect the companyâ s free cash flow however as just stated diamondback energy will most likely have a considerably higher free cash flow this year than it had last year thus investors will probably enjoy a very high yield over the remainder of this year as we will see in just a few moments too high oil prices will likely be a near permanent presence in our lives going forward diamondback energy could thus be positioned to be a very attractive dividend play going forward fundamentals of crude oil and natural gas as diamondback energy is primarily a producer of crude oil although it also produces natural gas it would be prudent to look at the fundamentals of these products the traditional energy industry has certainly gotten something of a bad rap recently as politicians and activists have been demonizing it over carbon emissions concerns while many in the general public are upset about todayâ s high energy prices fortunately though the overall fundamentals for crude oil and natural gas are better than might be expected and point to the very strong likelihood that high prices will be with us for many years to come the biggest reason for this is that demand for both crude oil and natural gas is likely to outstrip demand this may come as a surprise given all the talk about electrification however according to the international energy agency the global demand for crude oil will increase by 7 while the global demand for natural gas will increase by 29 over the next twenty years pembina pipeline data from iea as the majority of diamondback energyâ s production is crude oil that is the most important component of our analysis the biggest source of this demand growth can be found by looking at the various emerging markets around the world these nations are expected to experience remarkable economic growth over the time period in question which will naturally have the effect of lifting the citizens of these countries out of poverty and putting them securely into the middle class these newly middle class people will want to begin enjoying a lifestyle that is much closer to what their counterparts in the developed nations enjoy than what they have now this will require growing consumption of energy including energy derived from crude oil these emerging nations are substantially larger than the worldâ s developed nations in terms of the population so the rising oil demand there will more than offset the stagnant to declining demand that we can expect to see in the worldâ s developed nations although a 7 increase over the course of twenty years does not seem like much the traditional energy industry is ill equipped to handle it this is because the industry has been chronically underinvesting in production and infrastructure capacity since the bear back in 2015 we can clearly see this in the fact that the offshore drilling sector never recovered from its collapse around that time despite the tremendous resources that can be found offshore this underinvestment is so severe that moodyâ s recently stated that the oil and gas industry needs to increase upstream spending by 542 billion annually if it is to avoid a supply shock that is a 54 increase over current spending levels it is to put it mildly highly unlikely that the industry will do this after all it is under pressure from shareholders to maximize its returns and from politicians and activists to improve the sustainability of its operations there is basically no incentive for any company in the industry to increase spending by that degree thus we have a situation in which demand is increasing much more rapidly than supply the laws of economics state that this will result in rising prices going forward of course that would be incredibly good for the shareholders of diamondback energy since it should allow the company to keep its free cash flow and dividends high financial considerations it is always important that we analyze the way that a company finances itself before investing in it this is because debt is a riskier way to finance a business than equity because debt must be repaid at maturity as few businesses have sufficient cash to simply pay off the debt as it matures this is usually accomplished by issuing new debt and using that money to repay the maturing debt depending on the conditions in the market it may not be possible to do this at a comparable interest rate so the company may see its expenses increase when the debt matures in addition a company must make regular payments on its debt if it is to remain solvent as such a decline in cash flow could push a company into financial trouble if it has too much debt this is something that is always a concern in the oil and gas industry due to the volatility of commodity prices one ratio that we can use to evaluate a companyâ s debt load is the net debt to equity ratio this tells us the degree to which the company is financing its operations with debt as opposed to wholly owned funds it also tells us how well the companyâ s equity can cover its debt obligations in the event of a bankruptcy or liquidation event which is arguably more important as of march 31 2022 diamondback energy had a net debt of 5 699 billion compared to 13 852 billion in shareholdersâ equity this gives the company a net debt to equity ratio of 0 41 which is quite reasonable here is how that compares to some of diamondback energyâ s peers company net debt to equity diamondback energy 0 41 continental resources clr 0 80 pioneer natural resources pxd 0 12 eog resources eog 0 06 enerplus erf 1 01 apa corporation apa 6 77 click to enlarge as we can see diamondback energyâ s debt load is fairly similar to that of its peers although it is certainly not the least levered company in the group it still appears rather reasonable compared to the financial structure of similar companies thus we can conclude that investors probably do not have very much to worry about with respect to the companyâ s debt load valuation it is always critical that we do not overpay for any asset in our portfolios this is because overpaying for any asset is a surefire way to generate a suboptimal return on that asset in the case of an independent exploration and production company like diamondback energy one metric that we can use to value it is the price to earnings growth ratio this is a modified version of the familiar price to earnings ratio that takes the companyâ s earnings per share growth into account as a general rule a price to earnings growth ratio less than 1 0 is a sign that the stock is undervalued relative to its forward earnings per share growth and vice versa according to zacks investment research diamondback energy will grow its earnings per share at a 21 94 rate over the next three to five years this gives the stock a price to earnings growth ratio of 0 25 at the current price which is a very clear sign that the stock could be very undervalued at its current level here is how that compares to the companyâ s peer group company peg ratio diamondback energy 0 25 continental resources 0 16 pioneer natural resources 0 97 eog resources 0 27 enerplus na apa corporation 0 16 click to enlarge clearly it appears that pretty much the entire oil and gas sector is undervalued currently which i have been saying for quite a while we can see that diamondback is admittedly not the most undervalued stock on the list although it is clearly still a very good value today when we combine this attractive valuation with the companyâ s solid financial structure we can see that diamondback energy could deserve a place in any investorâ s portfolio as mentioned earlier too the fact that the stock is performing very well in todayâ s choppy market could make it comforting to hold in order to offset poor performers in other sectors conclusion in conclusion diamondback energy has a lot to offer any investor today the company is focusing much more on maximizing its free cash flow than it is growth which allows it to reward its stockholders with a very attractive dividend while that dividend is

washington stagflation it was the dreaded s word of the 1970s for americans of a certain age it conjures memories of painfully long lines at gas stations shuttered factories and president gerald ford s much ridiculed whip inflation now buttons stagflation is the bitterest of economic pills high inflation mixes with a weak job market to cause a toxic brew that punishes consumers and befuddles economists for decades most economists didn t think such a nasty concoction was even possible they d long assumed that inflation would run high only when the economy was strong and unemployment low but an unhappy confluence of events has economists reaching back to the days of disco and the bleak high inflation high unemployment economy of nearly a half century ago few think stagflation is in sight but as a longer term threat it can no longer be dismissed last week treasury secretary janet yellen invoked the word in remarks to reporters advertisement the economic outlook globally yellen said is challenging and uncertain and higher food and energy prices are having stagflationary effects namely depressing output and spending and raising inflation all around the world on thursday the government estimated that the economy shrank at a 1 5 percent annual rate from january through march but the drop was due mostly to two factors that don t reflect the economy s underlying strength a rising trade gap caused by americans appetite for foreign products and a slowdown in the restocking of businesses inventories after a big holiday season buildup for now economists broadly agree that the u s economy has enough oomph to avoid a recession but the problems are piling up supply chain bottlenecks and disruptions from russia s war against ukraine have sent consumer prices surging at their fastest pace in decades the federal reserve and other central banks blindsided by raging inflation are scrambling to catch up by aggressively raising interest rates they hope to cool growth enough to tame inflation without causing a recession it s a notoriously difficult task the widespread fear reflected in shrunken stock prices is that the fed will end up botching it and will clobber the economy without delivering a knockout blow to inflation this month former fed chair ben bernanke told the new york times that inflation s still too high but coming down so there should be a period in the next year or two where growth is low unemployment is at least up a little bit and inflation is still high advertisement and then bernanke summed up his thoughts you could call that stagflation what is stagflation there s no formal definition or specific statistical threshold mark zandi chief economist at moody s analytics has his own rough guide stagflation arrives in the united states he says when the unemployment rate reaches at least 5 percent and consumer prices have surged 5 percent or more from a year earlier the u s unemployment rate is now just 3 6 percent in the european union where joblessness typically runs higher zandi s threshold is different 9 percent unemployment and 4 percent year over year inflation in his view would combine to cause stagflation until about 50 years ago economists viewed stagflation as a near impossibility they hewed to something called the phillips curve named for its creator economist a w h bill phillips 1914 1975 of new zealand this theory held that inflation and unemployment move in opposite directions advertisement it sounds like common sense when the economy is weak and lots of people are out of work businesses find it hard to raise prices so inflation should stay low likewise when the economy is hot enough for businesses to pass along big price hikes to their customers unemployment should stay fairly low somehow reality hasn t proved so straightforward what can throw things off is a supply shock say a surge in the cost of raw materials that ignites inflation and leaves consumers with less money to spend to fuel the economy which is exactly what happened in the 1970s saudi arabia and other oil producing countries imposed an oil embargo on the united states and other countries that supported israel in the 1973 yom kippur war oil prices jumped and stayed high the cost of living grew more unaffordable for many the economy reeled enter stagflation each year from 1974 through 1982 inflation and unemployment in the united states both topped 5 percent the combination of the two figures which came to be called the misery index peaked at a most miserable 20 6 in 1980 stagflation and especially chronically high inflation became a defining feature of the 1970s political figures struggled in vain to attack the problem president richard nixon resorted futilely to wage and price controls the ford administration issued whip inflation now buttons the reaction was mainly scorn advertisement has stagflation arrived no for now the stagflation glass is only half full there s flation for sure consumer prices shot up 8 3 percent in april from a year earlier just below a 41 year high set the previous month consumer prices are surging largely because the economy rebounded with unexpected vigor from the brief but devastating pandemic recession factories ports and freight yards have been overwhelmed trying to keep up with an unexpected jump in customer orders the result has been delays shortages and higher prices critics also blame president biden s 1 9 trillion stimulus plan of march 2021 for overheating an economy that was already hot the ukraine war made things worse by disrupting trade in energy and food and sending prices up but the stag has yet to arrive even though the government reported thursday that economic output shrank from january through march the nation s job market has kept roaring advertisement every month for the past year employers have added a robust 400 000 plus jobs at 3 6 percent the unemployment rate is just a notch above 50 year lows this week the fed reported that americans are in solid financial health nearly eight in 10 adults said last fall that they were doing okay or living comfortably the highest proportion since the fed started asking the question in 2013 still the risks are accumulating and so are concerns about potential stagflation fed chair jerome powell acknowledged this month that the central bank might not be able to achieve a soft landing and dodge a recession he told american public media s marketplace that he worries about factors that we don t control the ukraine war a slowdown in china the lingering pandemic at the same time inflation has been eroding americans purchasing power prices have risen faster than hourly pay for 13 straight months and the nation s savings rate which soared in 2020 and 2021 as americans banked government relief checks has fallen below pre pandemic levels europe is even more vulnerable to stagflation energy prices there have skyrocketed since russia s invasion of ukraine unemployment in the 27 eu countries is already 6 2 percent why did stagflation vanish for so long for four decades the united states virtually banished inflation in the early 1980s fed chair paul volcker had jacked up interest rates so high to fight inflation 30 year mortgage rates approached a dizzying 19 percent in 1981 that he caused back to back recessions in 1980 and 1981 82 yet volcker achieved his goal he managed to rid the economy of high inflation and it stayed away the fed has worked hard since the stagflation of the late 1970s and early 1980s zandi said to keep inflation and inflation expectations closer to its target which is now around 2 percent other factors including the rise of low cost manufacturing in china and other developing countries kept a tight lid on prices that consumers and businesses pay the united states has endured periods of high unemployment it reached 10 percent after the 2007 2009 great recession and 14 7 percent after covid 19 erupted of 2020 yet until last year inflation had remained at bay in fact not since 1990 has the nation faced a year of zandi s 5 percent inflation 5 percent unemployment stagflation standard send questions comments to the editors

joe doucet s tropos and sabine marcelis shift are the latest capsules in the mortlach by design collection new york may 26 2022 prnewswire mortlach single malt scotch whisky a nearly 200 year old treasure of scotland s iconic speyside region is partnering with the american industrial designer joe doucet and the netherlands based designer sabine marcelis to release two new bespoke products during nycxdesign in may tropos a bold and reflective chair and shift a delicate yet structural glass bar cart embody the complexity and individuality of the single malt scotch that inspired them the pieces will be unveiled during nycxdesign in an exciting and immersive installation in collaboration with sized tropos by joe doucet was inspired by the way the unique top secret distillation process exclusive to mortlach that has been passed down by distillers for generations the resulting liquid produced by distillation in six distinct stills an essential element of the way was the driving force behind doucet s creative process from the design s conception to its name tropos which translates to the way in greek my aim was to design an immersive space where one could fully engage in the complexity and depth of mortlach whisky as they sat doucet explained to achieve this he played with the archetype of a classic wingback chair which envelops the sitter and is meant to block out external sight and sounds in that spirit the reflective interior of the chair creates an infinite mirror further engrossing the sitter in the mystery that defines mortlach shift by renowned dutch designer sabine marcelis is simultaneously mysterious and accessible inspired by the enigmatic nature of mortlach the bar cart is incredibly dynamic the rich brown and honey hues of the glass are dually translucent and opaque imitating the tint and transparency of mortlach liquid the object itself is both sculptural in its composition and functional in its use the two intertwined volumes create an intricate and modern feel allowing people to play with the positioning of their mortlach bottles and barware similar to how mortlach reveals its layered flavors upon tasting the bar cart reveals its dynamic layers when explored and used to serve marcelis revealed the top piece of the bar cart is loose so anyone can choose to use it as a tray leave it on top to serve glassware or remove it for external presentation the bar cart is mobile with wheels giving it the flexibility to move with the user the mobility and versatility of shift is a reflection of the journey one takes while sipping mortlach both joe and sabine s designs embody the boldness and intricacies that are central to mortlach said sophie kelly senior vp of whiskies for north america at diageo each piece is a perfect counterpart to the spirit with deep complexities that engage people as they interact with both the products and mortlach itself founded by an engineer and a doctor whose analytical minds and shared passion for precision in design informed a uniquely distinct approach to whisky making mortlach is deeply rooted in thoughtful craftsmanship mortlach by design celebrates this design forward process by partnering with some of the world s best designers and rising creatives on one of a kind products that will culminate in an extraordinary whisky experience for nycxdesign and frieze ny

for the average citizen it is often not until you fill your tank stock your fridge or heat your home that you have a tangible interaction with the global economy while it is hard to get animated about the consumer price index the national interest rate or the performance of the s p 500 paying twice as much at the pump is hard to swallow somewhere between the in your face nature of gasoline prices and the abstract financial indicators that talking heads on cnbc drone on about sits the price of diesel while diesel is a more visible indicator of economic health than most largely due to its being on the board outside each gas station the importance of that price can often go overlooked by everyday consumers today we are delving into the importance of diesel prices and more specifically the importance of the diesel shortage we are currently facing what is diesel to begin with let s establish what diesel is it is a middle distillate meaning it is made during the middle part of the crude oil distillation process that means it has a lower boiling range than light distillates such as gasoline but a higher boiling range than heavy distillates such as asphalt middle distillates are the primary fuel used in manufacturing shipping trucking freight railroads mining and farming so while gasoline may be the fuel that you follow most closely it is diesel prices that will cause the cost of nearly all other commodities to go up just like the truckers who use it diesel is one of the great unsung heroes of america s economy diesel has a greater energy density than other liquid fuels meaning it produces more energy per unit of volume that makes it the ideal fuel for larger vehicles traveling long distances or engaging in more energy intensive work it powers most farming and construction equipment in the united states and transports nearly all of the products that we consume it is also used in diesel generators that are frequently used as a source of backup electricity for everything from hospitals to utilities why is there a diesel shortage fears of a severe diesel shortage this summer are being driven by a combination of low inventories rising demand and a shortage of refining capacity these fears are particularly stark in the northeast where inventories are at record lows and biden is considering tapping an emergency stockpile of diesel in an eye opening piece for bloomberg javier blas highlighted how the number of refineries on the u s east coast had halved in the past 15 years with several of the remaining refineries operating below their normal capacity to give you an idea of just how big the current diesel problem is the price of diesel is currently higher than it was back in 2008 when oil prices hit 147 compared to 110 today so while the high price of oil is certainly a major contributing factor to today s diesel shortage it is far from the only one in fact the need for more diesel is so great that the refining margin to process crude into diesel has hit an all time high thomas nimbley the chairman and chief executive of refiner pbf energy said that any refiner who knows anything about this business and most of them do is doing everything in their power to turn every drop of gasoline into a gallon of jet fuel or diesel there are several reasons for this diesel specific shortage to begin with diesel demand has climbed rapidly since the pandemic with industry bouncing back as lockdowns were lifted refining capacity especially on the east coast has not been able to keep up since the beginning of the pandemic at least 13 u s refineries have been shut down had capacity reduced or been repurposed meanwhile demand for jet fuel which is also a middle distillate has increased tightening the fuel market further on top of all of this sanctions on russia have taken a significant portion of diesel out of the international market with gulf coast exporters increasing their exports to latin america to make up for the shortfall that increase in exports has only worsened the supply issue within the u s this is a truly global problem with the threat of diesel shortages around the world europe which traditionally imports around one million barrels per day of diesel from russia appears to be the most exposed to the problem as it races to find new sources of the vital oil product just this week brazil s state oil major warned that the country would face a diesel shortage if the government doesn t allow them to price the product at international levels the uk which has already sanctioned russian diesel is also facing a shortage and is relying on the eu to continue importing it in order to avoid a worldwide shortage looking ahead there is plenty to worry about in this space a spike in demand for gasoline and jet fuel over the summer will only tighten the fuel market meanwhile the european union is considering a ban on russian oil exports which could significantly reduce the supply of diesel on international markets importantly diesel demand is less elastic than demand for other products such as gasoline and it would take a global economic slowdown to significantly reduce this demand so next time you pull up to the gas station share a thought for that other number as well by josh owens for oilprice com more top reads from oilprice com middle east producers move to cut prices as

operations 3 includes 5 9 million due to change in estimate gift card breakage revenue which relates to the company s re evaluation of its estimated redemption pattern first quarter 2022 operating results comparable restaurant revenue 4 increased 19 7 in the first quarter of 2022 compared to the same period a year ago driven by a 12 8 increase in average guest check and a 6 9 increase in guest count the increase in average guest check resulted from a 6 0 increase in menu mix including incremental sales related to checks that include donatos pizza a 5 4 increase in pricing and a 1 4 decrease in discounts the increase in menu mix was primarily driven by our limited time menu offerings and higher dine in sales volumes the decrease in net loss compared to 2021 was primarily due to a 61 9 million increase in restaurant revenue partially offset by higher commodity and labor inflation staffing costs and marketing expenses the increase in adjusted ebitda 2 was due to the aforementioned factors less the impact of interest expense income tax benefits depreciation and amortization and other charges paul j b murphy iii red robin s president and chief executive officer said we are continuing to drive meaningful financial growth through our long term strategic investments we have now added donatos pizza to almost half our company restaurants and in the first quarter we generated total pizza sales of more than 7 million and checks with pizza were higher on average by more than 10 our integrated and seamless digital ecosystem which includes a newly designed website and the recent launch of our first app will drive trial and frequency as we increase marketing to a broader audience during the second quarter and beyond lastly we are also communicating more effectively with our growing red robin royalty members now totaling 10 6 million through a new loyalty platform that is yielding all time high guest engagement by enhancing our capabilities to personalize offers and deliver compelling campaigns murphy concluded while we are keeping a keen eye on industry challenges and the macroeconomic environment we are pleased with the current trajectory of our business our

investment in maintaining our restaurants and systems modest new restaurant growth donatos expansion to approximately 50 restaurants improvements to our operational technology solutions and off

margin pressures to persist during 2022 and improve through the year with increased staffing and dine in sales and to achieve a 2019 restaurant level operating profit margin in 2023 due to the impact of geopolitical events and their impacts on the macroeconomic environment during 2022 the company is updating its commodity cost inflation guidance for full year 2022 to low double digit inflation up

restaurant level operating profit to restaurant revenues loss from operations and net loss in thousands unaudited the company believes restaurant level operating profit is an important measure for management and investors because it is widely regarded in the restaurant industry as a useful metric by which to evaluate restaurant level operating efficiency and performance the company defines restaurant level operating profit to be restaurant revenue minus restaurant level operating costs excluding restaurant impairment and closure costs the measure includes restaurant level occupancy costs that include fixed rents percentage rents common area maintenance charges real estate and personal property taxes general liability insurance and other property costs but excludes depreciation related to restaurant equipment buildings and leasehold improvements the measure excludes depreciation and amortization expense substantially all of which is related to restaurant level assets because such expenses represent historical sunk costs which do not reflect current cash outlay for the restaurants the measure also excludes selling general and administrative costs and therefore excludes costs associated with selling general and administrative functions and pre opening costs the company excludes restaurant closure costs as they do not represent a component of the efficiency of continuing operations restaurant impairment costs are excluded because similar to depreciation and amortization they represent a non cash charge for the company s investment in its restaurants and not a component of the efficiency of restaurant operations restaurant level operating profit is not a measurement determined in accordance with gaap and should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to loss from operations or net loss as indicators of financial performance restaurant level operating profit as presented may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies in the company s industry the table below sets forth certain unaudited information for the sixteen weeks ended april 17 2022 and april 18 2021 expressed as a percentage of total revenues

________________________________________ 1 excluding depreciation and amortization which is shown separately certain percentage amounts in the table above do not total due to rounding as well as the fact that components of restaurant level operating profit are expressed as a percentage of restaurant revenue and not total revenues schedule iii reconciliation of net loss to ebitda and adjusted ebitda in thousands unaudited the company defines ebitda as net loss before interest expense income taxes and depreciation and amortization ebitda and adjusted ebitda are presented because the company believes investors understanding of its performance is enhanced by including these non gaap financial measures as a reasonable basis for evaluating its ongoing results of operations excluding the effects of material change in estimate asset impairment litigation contingencies board and stockholder matters costs restaurant closure and refranchising costs other financing costs and covid 19 related costs ebitda and adjusted ebitda are supplemental measures of operating performance that do not represent and should not be considered as alternatives to net loss or cash flow from operations as determined by gaap and the company s calculation thereof may not be comparable to that reported by other companies in its industry or otherwise adjusted ebitda further adjusts ebitda to reflect the additions and eliminations shown in the table below the use of adjusted ebitda as a performance measure permits a comparative assessment of our operating performance relative to the company s performance based on its gaap results while isolating the effects of some items that vary from period to period without any correlation to core operating performance adjusted ebitda as presented may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies and the company s presentation of adjusted ebitda should not be construed as an inference that its future results will be unaffected by excluded or unusual items the company has not provided a reconciliation of its adjusted ebitda outlook to the most comparable gaap measure of net loss providing net loss guidance is potentially misleading and not practical given the difficulty of projecting event driven transactional and other non core operating items that are included in net loss including asset impairments and income tax valuation adjustments the reconciliations of adjusted ebitda to net loss for the historical periods presented below are indicative of the reconciliations that will be prepared upon

always looking to secure domestic supply the resource consists of five deposits of sulphide mineralization hosted in 9 kilometers of strike length in the central area of stillwater west eighty three drill holes were used to calculate the resource including all the holes drilled during group ten s 2019 and 2020 campaigns these holes in addition to the 14 expansion holes drilled in 2021 and a further 133 holes drilled outside the current deposit areas will provide targeting insight for group ten s deep geological bench the team has decades of experience in the stillwater complex and now

of rhodium critical minerals add value nickel platinum palladium rhodium and cobalt all metals contained in the stillwater west resource are among the u s geological survey s 2022 list of critical minerals as are iridium and ruthenium two of the lesser known platinum group elements the survey looks at u s imports as well as the source of that supply for a range of metals and minerals to determine potential supply shortages and potential vulnerabilities to national security and the economy source group ten metals inc corporate presentation chromium also makes the list and the u s government once mined high grade chrome in the district in the 1940s for use in things like tank armor and bombs the u s is moving to secure domestic supplies of our commodities we ve worked with the u s geological survey for over four years at stillwater west rowley told streetwise reports so far government initiatives have been aimed more at processing capacity and advanced stage projects with our inaugural resources out we are now looking to advance to that status as we de risk we also believe the u s will look to supporting mine supply as well as part of the move to securing domestic sources of critical minerals a study by san antonio texas based us global investors says that demand for nickel is expected to increase by a factor of more than 15 as nickel use in lithium ion battery cathodes explodes some estimates peg the amount of nickel in one electric vehicle ev at more than 80 lb copper is one component of the stillwater west resource that has not been classified as critical but the outlook is similar one ev requires five times more copper than a car with an internal combustion engine copper prices reached all time highs in early march and show few signs of weakness cobalt is also in the mix ev manufacturing currently uses about 39 000 tonnes cobalt annually but london based international markets consultant cru expects that number to reach 120 000 tonnes by 2025 the dominant global source for cobalt is the democratic republic of congo group ten adds bushveld experience grobler is now group ten s vice president of exploration while brits is senior geologist both helped advance ivanhoe s platreef mine which shares remarkably similar geology with stillwater west grobler and brits each bring some 20 years experience with major deposits in the bushveld perhaps the world s richest mining camp the bushveld and stillwater complexes are both layered magmatic systems with two primary deposit models narrow higher grade reef type deposits and platreef style deposits that include higher levels of battery metals and are amenable to bulk mining methods production from reef deposits is ongoing in both districts but the advancement of platreef style deposits at stillwater has only recently been introduced by group ten despite the known parallels reef deposits are narrow high grade magmatic deposits they can be massive with reefs at both bushveld and stillwater running tens of kilometers the j m reef in the stillwater complex covers 40 kilometers on surface and averages about 1 8 meters thick it is the largest platinum group element deposit in the western hemisphere and the highest grade in the world containing 26 9 moz at 14 4 g t pd pt in proven and probable reserves another 39 moz at 14 7 g t pd pt in the measured and indicated category and 47 9 moz at 15 5 g t pd pt in the inferred category more than 14 moz have already been mined at grades greater than 14 g t pd pt rowley says stillwater west s location beside the j m reef is correct for the platreef style mineralization outlined in the initial resource estimate bringing a larger deposit model with a more balanced suite of commodities and also more metal to the table we ve got longer widths at bulk mining grades that add the battery metals to the mix rowley told streetwise reports so it s a different mining model but one that ultimately contains more metal on a grade thickness basis rowley says there hasn t been a formal study involving mining methods at stillwater west but suggests the different deposits could be mined by mechanized underground block caving which can be as or more economical than an open pit if gravity can be used to move the mineralized ore more efficiently than giant trucks right people right time a bear market is rarely kind to junior exploration companies and in early 2017 rowley was doing all he could to keep his property claims in good standing in ontario and yukon when he received an email from justin modroo a geophysicist who now works for group ten the cagey modroo had watched as claims were dropped in and around the stillwater complex mostly due to junior exploration companies entering bankruptcy protection between 2011 and 2013 modroo not only staked some of the best claims he bought some of the exploration data from a now defunct company that had done considerable exploration work before ultimately throwing the keys on the table the connection with modroo allowed group ten to consolidate not only the land position next to the stillwater mines but also a database a second bit of serendipity is due to the antiquated nature of u s state laws and the mineral claims system rowley says the outmoded database creates opportunity for people with local insight because without that knowledge the system s ham fisted design makes it too difficult to determine claim holdings and consolidate the essential data necessary to advance a project nonetheless in 2017 group ten completed a small placement which enabled the company to secure a district scale land package as the market for junior explorers bumped along a lengthy bottom a january 2022 research report by vancouver based couloir capital projected a 132 73 million enterprise value for the junior explorer it seems rowley s gamble is starting to see some upside funding further development group ten is focused on expanding the inaugural resource estimate at stillwater west the results from the 2021 expansion drill campaign continue to come in and a similar campaign in 2022 is funded and fully permitted group ten is also monetizing its other district scale assets as part of its focus on stillwater late in november heritage mining ltd optioned up to 90 of group ten s black lake drayton gold project in northwestern ontario representing the first in what group ten expects will be a series of deals heritage can earn up to a 90 stake in the project once it completes certain cash payments and exploration spending milestones rowley says the money and any upside in heritage s share price will help fund stillwater west development he adds that the company is talking to other companies about optioning its kluane pge ni cu project in northern british columbia couloir capital gives group ten a buy rating and a fair value price of ca 0 61 per share group ten has about 170 million shares outstanding and trades in a 52 week range of

elon musk afp indranil mukherjee elon musk faces a lawsuit accusing him of pushing down twitter s stock price in order to either give himself an escape hatch from his 44 billion buyout bid or room to negotiate a discount the suit alleges the billionaire tesla boss tweeted and made statements intended to create doubt about the deal which has roiled the social media platform for weeks filed wednesday by a shareholder the claim seeks class action status and calls on a federal court in san francisco to back the validity of the deal and award shareholders any damages allowed by law musk said last week that his bid to buy twitter won t proceed unless he gets proof of the number of spam accounts plaguing the platform adding more uncertainty to his roller coaster pursuit of the platform musk s tweet that the deal to buy twitter was temporarily on hold defied the fact that there is nothing in the purchase contract allowing that to happen the suit argued musk negotiated his twitter buyout in late april without carrying out due diligence expected in such megadeals said the suit filed by william heresniak of virginia the resulting contract needed only to be approved by twitter shareholders and regulators and was to close by october 24 of this year the suit said musk was well aware that some twitter accounts were controlled by software bots rather than real people and had even tweeted about it prior to making his offer to buy the company the suit argued musk proceeded to make statements send tweets and engage in conduct designed to create doubt about the deal and drive twitter s stock down substantially according to the complaint his aim was to gain leverage to get twitter at a much cheaper price or back out of the deal without suffering any penalty the suit argued musk s market manipulation worked twitter has lost 8 billion in valuation since the buyout was announced stated the claim twitter shares on thursday closed slightly up at 39 52 in a sign of investor doubt the buyout will be consummated at the 54 20 per share that musk originally bid musk s disregard for securities laws demonstrates how one can flaunt the law and the tax code to build their wealth at the expense of the other americans the court filing said twitter has said in regulatory filings that it is committed to completing the takeover without delay at the agreed price and terms musk did not immediately reply to a request for comment sent to tesla s press contact email

cautionary note regarding macusani concessions thirty two of the 151 concessions held by american lithium s subsidiary macusani are currently subject to administrative and judicial processes together the processes in peru to overturn resolutions issued by ingemmet and the mining council of minem in february 2019 and july 2019 respectively which declared macusani s title to 32 of the concessions invalid due to late receipt of the annual validity payments in november 2019 macusani applied for injunctive relief on 32 concessions in a court in lima peru and was successful in obtaining such an injunction on 17 of the concessions including three of the four concessions included in the macusani uranium project pea the grant of the precautionary measure medida cautelar has restored the title rights and validity of those 17 concessions to macusani until a final decision is obtained at the last stage of the judicial process a precautionary measure application was made at the same time for the remaining 15 concessions and was ultimately granted by a court in lima peru on march 2 2021 which has also restored the title rights and validity of those 15 remaining concessions to macusani with the result being that all 32 concessions are now protected by precautionary measure medida cautelar until a final decision on this matter is obtained at the last stage of the judicial process the favourable judge s ruling confirming macusani s title to all 32 concessions from november 3 2021 represents the final stage of the current judicial process however this ruling has been appealed by minem and ingemmet american lithium has no assurance that the outcome of these appeals will be in the company s favour
three publishing sales and marketing directors and two indie bookstore insiders dispelled assumptions about university presses at the u s book show five panelists opened with what university of texas press sales and marketing manager gianna lamorte called a round of myth busting levi stahl marketing director at the university of chicago press ventured to say that functionally a good university press is like a trade house in terms of how you interact with the components of your list hardcover prices can be steep but general titles are in line with the trade market and most are available through wholesalers we ve come a long way agreed lamorte we ve heard booksellers saying your books are out of reach we ve heard you we ve made a lot of adjustments columbia university press consortium sales manager catherine hobbs thinks so too when you re working with our publishers directly we are competitive hobbs said our discounts are competitive with major houses our books are as easy to return as everybody else s to see the video click here to log in to the u s book show seminary co op bookstore director of strategy and development clancey d isa and source booksellers co owner alyson turner weighed in chicago s seminary co op established in 1961 stocks an academic inventory detroit s source founded in 2002 focuses on nonfiction both have longstanding up partnerships that counteract old fashioned understandings turner recalled a book club seeking a prohibitively expensive yale up hardcover she reached out to yale which sent 20 copies of the paperback edition lamorte chimed in that for classroom use we ve rushed a book to paperback it never hurts to ask authors from university presses do events continued turner who invited author charles bell to detroit his hometown to talk about suspended punishment violence and the failure of school safety johns hopkins at the seminary co op d isa coordinates out of the box events like celebrating books from ut press s music catalog at chicago venues the world of university press books is incredibly diverse d isa emphasized with readers from all walks of life as someone who publishes these books i have to check myself and not forget how smart and curious people are lamorte agreed she once assumed a buyer at a southwestern bookstore wouldn t look twice at a 30 paperback i sheepishly said i think this one s probably a skip and it was about the border the buyer said we have some pretty smart people here similarly indies sold several thousand copies of ut austin professor omise eke tinsley s beyoncé in formation buyers will scoop up niche and regional titles lamorte insisted hobbs echoed lamorte s insights we don t expect our books to do well in every store she said yet our books add depth there s a serendipity that our books bring to the browsing experience hobbs finds that e book shoppers search keywords to find exactly what they want while impulse shoppers stay open to chance anecdotally added stahl up frontlist struggled during covid backlist did all right i attribute that to the fact people were not in stores seeing what was new alerting bookstores to those showcase titles comes at a price of course arcs are costly lamorte acknowledged and she ships them far and wide hobbs described arriving at a tradeshow tote bags loaded down with arcs we have switched to doing more digital galleys she said at seminary co op d isa likes seeing ups in the same channels as trade books if a book is on edelweiss staffers go there before requesting an arc or disposing of one they don t want efficiency gets another boost when ups time their titles to the industry panelists concurred when scheduling release dates ups need to go for tuesday said turner lamorte followed up 99 of us try to our pub dates so those books can be aligned so folks can get free shipping she said the panel wrapped up with a lightning round of titles that debunk the persistent myth of academic stodginess turner featured stefanie dunning s black to nature mississippi while clancey saluted jhumpa lahiri s essay collection translating myself and others princeton and plugged her colleague jeff deutsch s in praise of good bookstores princeton stahl held up the university of chicago press s forthcoming pow right in the eye the newly translated memoir of parisian art dealer berthe weill june 22 and former bookslut blogger jessa crispin s my three dads a tragic and scary story about a beloved teacher at her high school hobbs reminded everyone of adrian miller s 2021 barbecue book black smoke unc nominated for a 2022 james beard award and treva lindsey s america goddam california for lamorte francesca royster s forthcoming black country music is probably the most important book we ve done in several years on music the panel concluded with a collegial invitation and a bit of a dig at the mainstream our world is a small world when it comes to sales representation so i can help put you in touch with levi s reps hobbs offered lamorte then reflected that university presses have just the right amount of competitiveness we are more colleagues than anything else now when it comes to trade publishers no it s bloodthirst maybe mythbusting goes both ways

like all things crypto blockchain based carbon credit protocols have had a tough go of it during the last quarter they have been subject to the same market pressure as the rest of the industry which is struggling to regain its footing since the terra collapse but the sector s challenges are not just to do with market dynamics it s also facing an internal reckoning after questions emerged about the quality of the credits being traded inside the base carbon tokens bct issued on the toucan protocol which led verra a hybrid standards agency and registry responsible for carbon credits to take a hard look at the practice in april researchers at carbon plan a california based climate data non profit published a paper titled zombies on the blockchain which outlined how approximately 28 of the verified carbon units vcu traded in bcts on the toucan protocol and via carbon trading klimadao were from zombie projects toucan appears to be generating entirely new demand for long neglected credits that have experienced little or no demand in recent years the researchers wrote when the crypto market places higher value on bcts and klima tokens these products can bring formerly defunct offset projects back to life carbonplan highlights in its post that carbon credits under article 6 of the paris agreement prohibit the trading of credits from carbon offset projects registered before jan 1 2013 yet these older projects are being actively traded on the toucan protocol and were still being tokenized as late as november 2021 rather than eliminate supply from the voluntary market however zombie projects show that bcts are bringing new supplies into existence not in the form of new projects but of old credits that weren t previously able to find any buyers carbonplan s researchers wrote thanks to demand from blockchain buyers however these low quality credits found new life aside from the issue of zombie projects the other problem with these projects is structural the industry has been commodifying what s called retired credits when firms want to offset their emissions they use this process to purchase credits and retire them from the market in turn they get a receipt that makes the basis of their published carbon offset and bct tokens in an interview with s p global robin vix verra s chief legal policy and markets officer called this entire process mind frying as the company plans to disconnect the toucan protocol from buying retired credits verra will effective immediately prohibit the practice of creating instruments or tokens based on retired credits on the basis that the act of retirement is widely understood to refer to the consumption of the credit s environmental benefit verra s statement said vix said to s p global that verra will start scrutinizing stakeholders requests for retired carbon credits and block anything it suspects of being associated with tokenization carbon credits themselves are abstract intangible things based on counterfactuals of things that you can t actually see emissions and then crypto is another layer of abstraction on top of that vix said but all this isn t to say that verra is entirely opposed to the tokenization and trading of carbon credits or that toucan is not cognizant of the structural flaws of the arrangement verra said that it is exploring ways to immobilize current not retired carbon credits so they can be bridged over to toucan or other exchanges to trade the initial thinking is that the best way of doing this is if these tokens somehow tie back to live unretired credits so that the environmental benefit hasn t yet been used rix said to s p global in other words if you re acquiring tokens or coins you always know that the underlying is there in an interview with coindesk rob schmitt one of toucan s core developers emphasized that this isn t about verra blocking tokenization rather verra just wants to make the process better schmitt said that bridging and trading retired carbon credits weren t ideal but just a first step once verra introduces the ability to immobilize credits it would mean that credits could be sent bi directionally from toucan back off chain creating price parity this will be very positive for the on chain markets he said schmitt is also aware of carbon plan s paper on zombies he points to a post from toucan called raising standards in the on chain carbon market that outlines the protocol s filtering plan to only offer credits less than 10 years old the obsession over age isn t necessarily what s correct here if you took a climate action one year it s the same action the next it s not going to be different he said the issue with these credits is it s questionable whether these projects needed the funding from carbon credits to get going but it s an

economy file cars line up in two directions at a gas station in new york city on dec 23 1973 ap photo marty lederhandler file washington stagflation it was the dreaded s word of the 1970s for americans of a certain age it conjures memories of painfully long lines at gas stations shuttered factories and president gerald ford s much ridiculed whip inflation now buttons stagflation is the bitterest of economic pills high inflation mixes with a weak job market to cause a toxic brew that punishes consumers and befuddles economists for decades most economists didn t think such a nasty concoction was even possible they d long assumed that inflation would run high only when the economy was strong and unemployment low but an unhappy confluence of events has economists reaching back to the days of disco and the bleak high inflation high unemployment economy of nearly a half century ago few think stagflation is in sight but as a longer term threat it can no longer be dismissed last week treasury secretary janet yellen invoked the word in remarks to reporters the economic outlook globally yellen said is challenging and uncertain and higher food and energy prices are having stagflationary effects namely depressing output and spending and raising inflation all around the world on thursday the government estimated that the economy shrank at a 1 5 annual rate from january through march but the drop was due mostly to two factors that don t reflect the economy s underlying strength a rising trade gap caused by americans appetite for foreign products and a slowdown in the restocking of businesses inventories after a big holiday season buildup for now economists broadly agree that the u s economy has enough oomph to avoid a recession but the problems are piling up supply chain bottlenecks and disruptions from russia s war against ukraine have sent consumer prices surging at their fastest pace in decades the federal reserve and other central banks blindsided by raging inflation are scrambling to catch up by aggressively raising interest rates they hope to cool growth enough to tame inflation without causing a recession it s a notoriously difficult task the widespread fear reflected in shrunken stock prices is that the fed will end up botching it and will clobber the economy without delivering a knockout blow to inflation this month former fed chair ben bernanke told the new york times that inflation s still too high but coming down so there should be a period in the next year or two where growth is low unemployment is at least up a little bit and inflation is still high and then bernanke summed up his thoughts you could call that stagflation ___ what is stagflation there s no formal definition or specific statistical threshold mark zandi chief economist at moody s analytics has his own rough guide stagflation arrives in the united states he says when the unemployment rate reaches at least 5 and consumer prices have surged 5 or more from a year earlier the u s unemployment rate is now just 3 6 in the european union where joblessness typically runs higher zandi s threshold is different 9 unemployment and 4 year over year inflation in his view would combine to cause stagflation until about 50 years ago economists viewed stagflation as a near impossibility they hewed to something called the phillips curve named for its creator economist a w h bill phillips 1914 1975 of new zealand this theory held that inflation and unemployment move in opposite directions it sounds like common sense when the economy is weak and lots of people are out of work businesses find it hard to raise prices so inflation should stay low likewise when the economy is hot enough for businesses to pass along big price hikes to their customers unemployment should stay fairly low somehow reality hasn t proved so straightforward what can throw things off is a supply shock say a surge in the cost of raw materials that ignites inflation and leaves consumers with less money to spend to fuel the economy which is exactly what happened in the 1970s saudi arabia and other oil producing countries imposed an oil embargo on the united states and other countries that supported israel in the 1973 yom kippur war oil prices jumped and stayed high the cost of living grew more unaffordable for many the economy reeled enter stagflation each year from 1974 through 1982 inflation and unemployment in the united states both topped 5 the combination of the two figures which came to be called the misery index peaked at a most miserable 20 6 in 1980 stagflation and especially chronically high inflation became a defining feature of the 1970s political figures struggled in vain to attack the problem president richard nixon resorted futilely to wage and price controls the ford administration issued whip inflation now buttons the reaction was mainly scorn has stagflation arrived no for now the stagflation glass is only half full there s flation for sure consumer prices shot up 8 3 in april from a year earlier just below a 41 year high set the previous month consumer prices are surging largely because the economy rebounded with unexpected vigor from the brief but devastating pandemic recession factories ports and freight yards have been overwhelmed trying to keep up with an unexpected jump in customer orders the result has been delays shortages and higher prices critics also blame president joe biden s 1 9 trillion stimulus plan of march 2021 for overheating an economy that was already hot the ukraine war made things worse by disrupting trade in energy and food and sending prices up but the stag has yet to arrive even though the government reported thursday that economic output shrank from january through march the nation s job market has kept roaring every month for the past year employers have added a robust 400 000 plus jobs at 3 6 the unemployment rate is just a notch above 50 year lows this week the fed reported that americans are in solid financial health nearly eight in 10 adults said last fall that they were doing okay or living comfortably the highest proportion since the fed started asking the question in 2013 still the risks are accumulating and so are concerns about potential stagflation fed chair jerome powell acknowledged this month that the central bank might not be able to achieve a soft landing and dodge a recession he told american public media s marketplace that he worries about factors that we don t control the ukraine war a slowdown in china the lingering pandemic at the same time inflation has been eroding americans purchasing power prices have risen faster than hourly pay for 13 straight months and the nation s savings rate which soared in 2020 and 2021 as americans banked government relief checks has fallen below pre pandemic levels europe is even more vulnerable to stagflation energy prices there have skyrocketed since russia s invasion of ukraine unemployment in the 27 eu countries is already 6 2 why did stagflation vanish for so long for four decades the united states virtually banished inflation in the early 1980s fed chair paul volcker had jacked up interest rates so high to fight inflation 30 year mortgage rates approached a dizzying 19 in 1981 that he caused back to back recessions in 1980 and 1981 82 yet volcker achieved his goal he managed to rid the economy of high inflation and it stayed away the fed has worked hard since the stagflation of the late 1970s and early 1980s zandi said to keep inflation and inflation expectations closer to its target which is now around 2 other factors including the rise of low cost manufacturing in china and other developing countries kept a tight lid on prices that consumers and businesses pay the united states has endured periods of high unemployment it reached 10 after the 2007 2009 great recession and 14 7 after covid 19 erupted of 2020 yet until last year inflation had remained at bay in fact not since 1990 has the nation faced a year of zandi s 5 inflation 5 unemployment stagflation standard

million the increase is primarily due to a contingency loss for legal settlement of 2 52 million and a loss from equity investment of 1 12 million partially offset by decreased general and administrative expenses of 1 39 million and decreased research and development expenses of 1 20 million the contingency loss for legal settlement of 2 52 million is related to the agreement for the

carriers the recognition of a loss from equity investment of 1 12 million in the three month period ended february 28 2022 is related to management s determination that the capitalized costs in our joint venture with indorama indorama loop technologies ilt were no longer recoverable the joint venture had made a decision during 2020 that it would temporarily delay work on the project largely due to factors related to the covid 19 pandemic since that date no expenditures have been incurred by the joint venture also the company achieved significant advancements in its engineering design independently from that which was accomplished in ilt due to these advancements management has determined that engineering design costs initially capitalized in ilt are now obsolete and no longer recoverable therefore the company recorded a loss of 1 12 million relating to its investment in ilt during the three month period ended february 28 2022 this amount represents the company s 50 portion of the engineering design costs capitalized in ilt the 1 39 million decrease in general and administrative expenses for the three month period ended february 28 2022 was primarily attributable to the

new york ny accesswire may 26 2022 mr peter kern chairman of the board hemisphere media group inc c o intermedia advisors llc 228 park avenue south pmb 67521 new york ny 10003 1502 dear peter boyar asset management has been a longtime shareholder of hemisphere media group inc hmtv we re more than just disappointed at the may 9th announcement that hemisphere media will be acquired by controlling shareholder gato investments lp for 7 00 per share we re shocked yes the takeover price was an 86 premium to hmtv s previous close but this offer dramatically undervalues the company not only is it 7 below the value of the stock at the beginning of 2022 but it s also nearly 50 below hemisphere s 52 week high this wholly inadequate takeunder is hardly in the best interests of long term investors and is fraught with conflicts of interests to add insult to injury much of the past year s price decrease appears to have been attributable to some of the company s own questionable capital allocation and managerial decisions it is a travesty that the very people in our opinion who are responsible for the share price decline at hmtv are now the ones set to benefit from this laughably low bid we are far from alone in our concerns investment manager edenbrook capital which owns roughly 7 65 of the total company 14 94 of the publicly traded class a shares staunchly opposes the deal in addition to pointing out the discrepancy between the company s intrinsic value and the takeover valuation it has highlighted inconsistent assertions from the company itself as well as potential conflicts of interest all of which leave us deeply concerned about the fairness of the process thus far the company generated adjusted ebitda of 64 million in 2021 excluding pantaya losses as discussed later and political advertising revenue importantly this level of profitability was achieved in a non election year puerto rico s election cycles run every four years the next occurring in 2024 during these cycles its television networks gain a meaningful influx of high margin political advertising revenues assuming no increase in segment ebitda this year 64 million and ascribing a conservative 7x ebitda multiple based on the low end of precedent comps in the media and communications arena over the last few years produces a 448 million valuation for these properties alone the enterprise value of gato investments proposed transaction is 494 million including net debt of about 212 million equity value 282 million hemisphere owns wapa the leading broadcast network in puerto rico as well as several other prominent spanish language cable network stations in the u s and latin america wapa is a dominant property whose prime time ratings according to management surpass those of the big 4 in the u s cbs nbc abc and fox combined put up for sale on a standalone basis it could command a significant premium to gato s purchase price over the many years the boyar value group has been following media companies we ve seen many top notch properties in the cable broadcast sector command multiples in the teens including in recent years pantaya is hemisphere media s nascent streaming platform hemisphere owned a minority interest position in the business before acquiring the remaining stake in april 2021 in a purchase that valued the business at 165 million gato investments does not plan to hold onto this business instead pantaya is slated to be concurrently acquired by televisaunivision for radio assets and an undisclosed sum of cash why hmtv shareholders do not receive the proceeds from the pantaya divesture is baffling taking together 448 million for wapa and related assets 165 million for pantaya and 212 million in net debt suggests an enterprise value of at least 825 million a whopping 67 more than the proposed offer leaving net debt out of the equation we put the equity value of the assets conservatively at well upward of 613 million what s more the company has valuable stakes in several other media outlets we don t even factor into our valuation including a 40 interest in canal 1 the 3 broadcast television network in colombia according to the company s 2021 10 k issued march 16 2022 it was underpenetrated in that market with the highly scalable business model poised to grow and capture market share the company also holds meaningful positions in remezcla a digital media company focused on english speaking hispanics in the u s and snap media produces and distributes original movies and series we have a hard time believing that insiders truly think they re giving shareholders a fair deal in 2021 hemisphere media was buying back its shares at levels far higher than recent prices or the proposed takeover price mostly during 1q at an average price of 10 37 per share and 2q no average price available but the stock was never less than 11 28 during that quarter as recently as late last year the company said outright that its shares were undervalued at 11 management previously asserted that there was value to be unlocked in pantaya although value destruction has ensued instead alluding on november 5 2021 to an undrawn revolver and the ability to expand the balance sheet as needed yet just 10 days later the company announced an unexpected secondary offering of 6 million shares sparking an immediate 20 5 drawdown in equity value aside from an extremely short lived rebound just one trading session later hmtv shares have been under pronounced selling pressure ever since did the company need the money for a compelling new growth opportunity that seems unlikely especially in hindsight was it capitalizing on a healthy run up in its share price no the stock has been largely range bound over the prior 5 years or so were there unstated liquidity concerns in our opinion liquidity fears among the investment community along with share dilution concerns was largely responsible for the stock s fall over these past few months even so management continued alluding to strong growth potential calling hmtv shares undervalued on march 8 2022 in a press release touting 4q and full year 2021 results management boasted about record high advertising and retransmission revenue from wapa predicting that puerto rico s recovering economy would drive strong results this year management even went so far as to say our market value has little correlation with our true underlying value then added on the earnings call that ur stock price does not in any way reflect the fundamental value and strength of our company management had previously canceled the equity offering stating in no uncertain terms we think the stock is incredibly attractively priced we have no interest in a sales transaction at or anywhere near this price in fact we pulled our equity offering when our stock price went down to 8 or 9 we felt that we would rather be a buyer than a seller at that price and clearly at this current price level we are absolutely a buyer rather than a seller by then hmtv shares had lost about half their value since the start of the year closing at 5 45 the proposed takeover price dramatically undervalues hemisphere raising fears that company insiders may be attempting to capitalize on the reduced valuation for which they themselves could partly be blamed by taking the company private at a level they know to be well below its intrinsic value such a take private deal might benefit insiders who could continue participating in the potential synergies and accelerated growth opportunities of the combined entities but we believe that public investors are getting a raw deal any board of directors has a fiduciary obligation to strike a fair deal for minority shareholders accordingly hemisphere s board should insist on a higher takeover price and conduct a proper sales process with a view to extracting the most value for all shareholders not just for current members of management best regards jonathan boyar disclaimer this

barbara ortutay the associated press twitter shareholders have filed a lawsuit accusing elon musk of engaged in unlawful conduct aimed at sowing doubt about his bid to buy the social media company the lawsuit filed late wednesday in the u s district court for the northern district of california claims the billionaire tesla ceo has sought to drive down twitter s stock price because he wants to walk away from the deal or negotiate a substantially lower purchase price san francisco based twitter is also named as a defendant in the lawsuit which seeks class action status as well as compensation for damages a representative for musk did not immediately respond to a message for comment on thursday twitter declined to comment musk last month offered to buy twitter for 44 billion but later said the deal can t go forward until the company provides information about how many accounts on the platform are spam or bots the lawsuit notes however that musk waived due diligence for his take it or leave it offer to buy twitter that means he waived his right to look at the company s non public finances in addition the problem of bots and fake accounts on twitter is nothing new the company paid 809 5 million last year to settle claims it was overstating its growth rate and monthly user figures twitter has also disclosed its bot estimates to the securities and exchange commission for years while also cautioning that its estimate might be too low to fund some of the acquisition musk has been selling tesla stock and shares in the electric carmaker have lost nearly a third of their value since the deal was announced on april 25 in response to the plunging value of tesla s shares the twitter shareholders lawsuit claims musk has been denigrating twitter violating both the non disparagement and non disclosure clauses of his contract with the company in doing so musk hoped to drive down twitter s stock price and then use that as a pretext to attempt to re negotiate the buyout according to the lawsuit twitter s shares closed thursday at 39 54 27 below musk s 54 20 offer price before announcing his bid to buy twitter musk disclosed in early april that he had bought a 9 stake in the company but the lawsuit says musk did not disclose the stake within the timeframe required by the securities and exchange commission and the lawsuit says his eventual disclosure of the stake to the sec was false and misleading because he used a form meant for passive investors which musk at the time was not because he had been offered a position on twitter s board and was interested in buying the company musk benefited by more than 156 million from his failure to disclose his increased stake on time since twitter s stock price could have been higher had investors known musk was increasing his holdings the lawsuit claims by delaying his disclosure of his stake in twitter musk engaged in market manipulation and bought twitter stock at an artificially low price the lawsuit says

twitter shareholders have filed a lawsuit accusing elon musk of engaged in unlawful conduct aimed at sowing doubt about his bid to buy the social media company the lawsuit filed late wednesday in the u s district court for the northern district of california claims the billionaire tesla ceo has sought to drive down twitter s stock price because he wants to walk away from the deal or negotiate a substantially lower purchase price san francisco based twitter is also named as a defendant in the lawsuit which seeks class action status as well as compensation for damages a representative for musk did not immediately respond to a message for comment on thursday twitter declined to comment musk last month offered to buy twitter for 44 billion but later said the deal can t go forward until the company provides information about how many accounts on the platform are spam or bots the lawsuit notes however that musk waived due diligence for his take it or leave it offer to buy twitter that means he waived his right to look at the company s non public finances in addition the problem of bots and fake accounts on twitter is nothing new the company paid 809 5 million last year to settle claims it was overstating its growth rate and monthly user figures twitter has also disclosed its bot estimates to the securities and exchange commission for years while also cautioning that its estimate might be too low to fund some of the acquisition musk has been selling tesla stock and shares in the electric carmaker have lost nearly a third of their value since the deal was announced on april 25 in response to the plunging value of tesla s shares the twitter shareholders lawsuit claims musk has been denigrating twitter violating both the non disparagement and non disclosure clauses of his contract with the company in doing so musk hoped to drive down twitter s stock price and then use that as a pretext to attempt to re negotiate the buyout according to the lawsuit twitter s shares closed thursday at 39 54 27 below musk s 54 20 offer price before announcing his bid to buy twitter musk disclosed in early april that he had bought a 9 stake in the company but the lawsuit says musk did not disclose the stake within the timeframe required by the securities and exchange commission and the lawsuit says his eventual disclosure of the stake to the sec was false and misleading because he used a form meant for passive investors which musk at the time was not because he had been offered a position on twitter s board and was interested in buying the company musk benefited by more than 156 million from his failure to disclose his increased stake on time since twitter s stock price could have been higher had investors known musk was increasing his holdings the lawsuit claims by delaying his disclosure of his stake in twitter musk engaged in market manipulation and bought twitter stock at an artificially low price the lawsuit says
