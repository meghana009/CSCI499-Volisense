in this new energy era where fossil fuels are regaining their status as a vital energy source there are plenty of north american stocks that are also benefiting the influence and importance of russia in intimately linked to its role as a major energy provider a role that has become increasingly important during the current energy shortage it appears in 2021 that russia has regained a lot of the power and influence that it lost following the crimean invasion and resultant u s sanctions seven years ago let s imagine that a few years ago in early 2014 that vladimir putin had tossed a coin in a wishing well and asked for a more supportive market for russian oil and gas their chief source of foreign currency a mere seven years ago after the russian invasion and takeover of crimea the country was a pariah on the world stage u s sanctions intended to cripple the russian economy combined with low oil prices following the saudi decision to take back market share held by upstart american shale were delivering just the results intended the russian economy was soon in tatters and the ruble had fallen to post soviet lows and then slowly the tide began to turn if putin had indeed tossed a coin into the well in 2014 he could hardly have dreamed up a more complete delivery of this wish than the world in which we now live as 2021 nears its close a number of decisions by western american and european primarily policymakers over the years favoring green energy sources over traditional petroleum have effectively handed putin the trump card in negotiations involving europe s energy security when you combine these now questionable decisions with the alliance russia has formed with opec now generally referred to as opec you have a world in which the russian president must delight in this article we will summarize the state of the global energy environment in particular we will focus on how one decision the u s dropping sanctions on the nord stream 2 gas pipeline has put russia squarely in command of negotiations that will have a direct impact on europe s energy security this winter energy in 2021 for much of the past five years american shale has dominated the marginal balance of global oil and gas supply increases a relentless push toward growth at any cost drove american production to all time highs as recently as 2020 the pandemic combined with a new administration s push to accelerate the transition to green energy sources dropped oil prices into the cellar in april of 2020 many energy producers brought to near bankruptcy before prices began to rise again restrained development of new wells preferring to reward long suffering shareholders with increased dividends and share buybacks i discussed this trend in an oilprice article back in june american production dropped precipitously as a result before stabilizing just above 11 mm bopd the associated gas that had been produced fell as well at the same time exports of american gas as lng to european and asian markets took off to new highs the net effect of the reduced drilling and rise in exports was to lower the amount of oil and gas in storage some 30 below inventories just the year before related the u s shale industry desperately needs to drill the eu is the leader in the green energy transition and companies headquartered in member states have gotten a clear message to reduce their scope i ii and iii carbon footprints shell nyse rds a rds b is the most striking example of this emphasis with the dutch court finding against them i discussed the ramifications of this order in an oilprice article in september as part of this energy transition the eu has disincentivized new gas drilling and chosen to use gas as an emergency backup to wind and solar sources on the spot market as opposed to signing long term contracts for storage as i noted in the linked article this has brought eu supplies to dangerously low levels at a time when the wind farms offshore have under produced expected supplies of electricity due to a relatively calm wind environment add in a ramp up of the global economy as the covid impacts begin to recede a renewed asian demand for winter heating and opec s decision to stick to the moderate increases in output and you have a good snapshot of the energy situation the world and particularly the eu faces going into the winter of 2021 2 you also have one very very happy vladimir putin as he begins to negotiate increased gas shipments to the eu in conjunction with final approvals for the newly completed nord stream 2 gas pipeline nord stream 2 negotiations the nord stream 2 gas pipeline was vigorously opposed by the two prior american administrations there were geopolitical and energy security reasons for this opposition and american sanctions had largely stymied its completion over the final critical phase in may the biden administration withdrew these objections ostensibly to repair frayed relations with germany and allowed progress to continue nord stream 2 is now complete with gas flows expected to start as soon as final approvals from germany whose territory it crosses are received in a recent wall street journal article an energy expert summarized the leverage putin now possesses over eu energy security the european gas crisis has shown the extreme leverage that russia has over europe and beyond said thierry bros an energy expert and professor at sciences po paris putin is the only one who could prevent blackouts in europe because russia has spare capacity this is a position of power wsj the article notes that in contrast to the west russia has become an energy super store with surging volumes of gas oil and even coal the article estimates that russia now controls 25 of global gas and lng shipments and 13 3 of oil shipments outpacing even saudi arabia with 12 6 it is also supplying coal to china in the absence of australian imports which china has chosen to ban for diplomatic reasons in negotiations with the eu about increased gas for the winter russia appears to be using this leverage and taking a fairly hard line nothing can be delivered beyond the contracts kremlin spokesman dmitry peskov said wednesday any extra deliveries are a matter of negotiating wsj it remains to be seen as to how firmly russia will hold to this position as the winter progresses a couple of things are certain though firstly the low cost energy environment that has persisted for the last several years is probably giving way to the one we are just now beginning to appreciate higher prices and concerns about supplies will dominate both global policymakers and consumers thoughts as we go forward secondly the new prominence of russia on the energy market and on the global stage of world affairs is set to grow putin has outlasted sanctions from the crimea event which you rarely hear much about these days as the news cycle has moved on and now casts a larger shadow than ever in geopolitical circles how to invest in this new era the prices of energy stocks in the u s and canada have surged in recent months as the full potential impact of this new era has settled upon the market in the space of a year independent companies like devon energy nyse dvn have quadrupled as low prices encouraged market consolidation even oil majors like conocophillips nyse cop have surged to pre pandemic highs and made strategic acquisitions as i noted in an oilprice article earlier this month we think these companies remain investible in this environment and renewed realization of the true importance of petroleum energy sources could assist in propelling their valuations still higher advertisement related the facts behind saudi arabia s outrageous oil claims nowhere is this more true than for the major energy service companies halliburton nyse hal and schlumberger nyse slb remain our favorites and their current valuations are not reflective of the potential demand for their services in the coming quarters we should also mention the incredible values seen in canadian companies many of which we ve highlighted in past articles tourmaline oil corp otc trmlf the largest gas producer in canada still sells at a single digit earnings multiple which is sure to change as winter approaches another company we particularly like is canadian natural resources nyse cnq cnq s long life low decline heavy oil production ensures high net backs driving profits higher as demand increases for oil in transportation industrial and as a substitute for gas in the case of high gas prices for electricity generation cnq s stock is up 60 this year and we think it has further to run and pays nice dividends to shareholders the need for brevity prevents other suggestions in particular companies the energy sector has been challenged in recent years and has only recently come back into favor as noted we think investors can still find bargains in the new energy price era that has just settled on the global energy market we would leave the reader with this generalized comment that we view the entire north american energy complex above and below the 49th parallel as a target rich environment with few bad choices in today s market the reader is encouraged to do their own due diligence and consult an investment advisor before making any investing decisions by david messler for oilprice com more top reads from

address the guaranteed increase in food insecurity while wisconsin did see an increase in need for food during the covid 19 pandemic those government programs helped keep the need from spiraling out of control said maureen fitzgerald the vice president of government relations for feeding america eastern wisconsin the state s largest hunger relief organization there were programs started that were helping people i think almost putting a finger in the dam of food insecurity last year and we ve seen evidence of that fitzgerald said we ve seen people sort of hold steady for the most part for the last year in 2019 around 9 of wisconsinites experienced food insecurity according to data from feeding america the number rose to nearly 12 in 2020 feeding america projections estimate in 2021 around 10 of wisconsin residents will experience food insecurity food insecurity is even more prevalent among children in wisconsin 14 of children experienced food insecurity according to feeding america that rose to almost 19 in 2020 and feeding america estimates in 2021 16 of wisconsin children will be food insecure some covid 19 programs that helped bolster people s finances such as stimulus checks enhanced unemployment benefits and the eviction moratorium have already come to an end this year as more benefits including some food programs continue to wind down wisconsinites who are still struggling are being revealed the reason why people when they re poor need hunger relief is because they ll use all their cash to pay their bills keep the roof over your head keep utilities on said sherrie tussler the executive director of hunger task force a food bank in milwaukee and so the one thing you can be flexible with is your food buying budget pandemic food programs helped keep wisconsin households afloat the program with the biggest impact on wisconsin families was emergency foodshare fitzgerald said foodshare is the state s version of the federal supplemental nutrition assistance program snap also known as food stamps when the pandemic hit the federal government bumped up everyone s benefits to the maximum possible amount for example a senior citizen getting 16 a month in foodshare benefits before the pandemic began receiving the maximum benefit of around 200 a month fitzgerald said the program has helped keep a lot of wisconsinites fed tussler said in october 386 000 wisconsin households benefited from emergency foodshare totaling more than 72 7 million in benefits according to the usda emergency foodshare is still in effect in wisconsin the state has to get approval from the usda every month to continue the extra benefits those extra benefits are set to expire at the end of the year when the federal government s emergency order lapses tussler said one program pandemic ebt specifically focused on helping families of children who qualify for free or reduced price meals at school through the national school lunch program the pandemic ebt program reimbursed parents to help offset the cost of feeding their children while schools were closed due to the pandemic in wisconsin 100 000 children in preschool and daycares received 62 million in benefits tussler said and 210 million in benefits were paid to the parents of 292 000 school age kids pandemic ebt is still available for the 2021 22 school year for students if school is closed for five consecutive days or there are reduced attendance hours due to the pandemic another important program was the u s department of agriculture s farmers to families food box program through this program the federal government purchased fresh food from farmers and partnered with distributors like feeding america to get boxes of food out to those in need feeding america eastern wisconsin set up distribution sites around the state where people could pull up in their vehicles pop open their trunks receive a box full of fresh produce meat and dairy products then drive off it really helped people who had never relied on food pantries before and it helped food pantries who didn t either have capacity because there weren t volunteers or couldn t have people inside their facilities fitzgerald said everything was outside and the boxes were helping put money into the economy too because they were partnering with either local farmers that program ended in may nationally more than 173 million boxes of food were distributed with almost 500 000 of them in wisconsin fitzgerald said these programs were helpful to people during the pandemic and frankly the pandemic s not over fitzgerald said people are still struggling people are still coming out of it and often it s the people who are most in need that take the longest to get back on their feet so when these programs end it increases need in the community tussler expects people will start revisiting food pantries at pre pandemic levels once pandemic assistance runs out which could put an extra strain on community food pantries but those pantries are trying to plan ahead the hunger task force monitors its inventory very closely and plans for the future three six and nine months in advance tussler said the organization has money available to purchase more food if needed we feel pretty confident that we ll be able to take care of the community in the way that we need to for the next 12 months tussler said st joseph food program in the fox cities is also preparing to meet that increased need said executive director monica clare said the menasha pantry and food bank also has money set aside so they can purchase extra food if they see a big jump in the number of people who need help in milwaukee ebenezer stone ministries which serves the city s south side saw an increase in need during the pandemic s peak according to mike hass food pantry director and as emergency food programs expire he too believes it is likely that the need will continue hass said his ministry is prepared though and is not worried about emergency food programs running out at the end of the year we have a good relationship with local area businesses he said just because some of these programs go away does not mean that we don t have other alternatives in getting food the organization partners with organizations such as hunger task force and feeding america which will help with a steady food supply to feed hungry families they also rely on private donations grants and community donations we are a religious organization hass said we put all our faith in god and he always carries through i have no fear

the u s energy information administration estimates higher prices for all fuels this coming winter be prepared to spend more to heat your home this winter as the agency that collects and interprets energy data for the federal government has predicted natural gas users in the west will see an average increase of 23 5 percent compared to a year ago in fact the u s energy information administration or eia for short expects fuel prices across the board to increase contributing to inflationary pressures at home and reflecting a growing energy crunch that has impacted countries around the world the higher global and domestic energy prices that are resulting from economies beginning to grow again are going to translate into larger household bills for energy this winter said eia acting administrator steve nalley advertisement the eia on wednesday released its winter fuels outlook that estimated the country s energy consumption pricing and spending for the six months it defines as winter from oct 1 to march 31 in 13 states in the west including california the agency predicted natural gas users will pay 654 over that six month period up from 530 the previous year or 23 5 percent more other parts of the country are even worse off the eia projects natural gas customers in 12 states making up the midwest to pay 818 over six months an increase of nearly 49 percent compared to last winter the national average is expected to be 30 2 percent higher at 746 nearly half the homes in the u s use natural gas for heat eia officials based their figures on forecasts from the national oceanic and atmospheric administration that have predicted the u s will experience a slightly colder than average winter leading consumers to turn up their heaters but even if winter turns out to be about 10 percent warmer than expected the eia report said costs will still be higher than a year ago because the price of natural gas has risen so sharply the futures price for natural gas at henry hub a louisiana pipeline that serves as the benchmark for the north american natural gas market has doubled in the past six months among the reasons for the spike natural gas production has still not completely recovered in the gulf of mexico region after hurricane ida made landfall at the end of august oil and gas companies have been slow to ramp up drilling activities because after taking a financial beating in the aftermath of the pandemic investors have pressured them to instead make reducing debt a priority and gas demand in europe and asia has soared with prices in some european union countries up 400 percent to 500 percent locally of san diego gas electric s 3 6 million customers about 873 000 gas meters are serviced by the utility sdg e spokeswoman helen gao said the company uses a number of tools to deal with price swings including locking in prices through long term energy contracts we all want predictable bills so we can budget accordingly gao said in an email and sdg e is taking action to help mitigate bill impacts for our customers even when prices are beyond our control as is the case with natural gas but it s not just natural gas that s more expensive the eia winter outlook expects u s electricity customers to spend an average of 1 268 between october and march 6 3 percent more than the previous year in the west the average for six months is expected to be 1 330 up 2 8 percent the 4 percent of u s homeowners that use heating oil many of them in the northeast should be prepared to pay an average of 43 percent more this winter according to eia and the 5 percent of customers across the country who rely on propane can expect to see an average increase of 54 percent higher energy prices come as inflation starts to eat into the budgets of everyday consumers the same day eia released its outlook it was announced the consumer price index in the 12 months through september rose 5 4 percent in san diego prices increased 6 5 percent at the same time the financial effects of the pandemic have led many californians to fall behind on their utility bills earlier this year the california public utilities commission estimated more than 3 3 million residential customers of the state s big four utilities have accounts in arrears including more than 485 000 customers in the sdg e service territory as for gasoline the eia outlook had some mixed news for drivers it expects the average price in the u s to go up another 3 cents per gallon this month but then drop 16 cents in december the price of a regular gallon of gasoline has been increasing month over month since november 2020 rob nikolewski san diego union tribune california has the highest gasoline prices in the country according to gasbuddy a tech company that helps drivers find stations offering the lowest prices the average price in san diego on thursday came in at 4 39 per gallon that s 1 21 higher than a year ago an increase of 38 percent gasoline prices are tied to crude oil prices and the futures price for west texas intermediate the benchmark for crude produced in the u s is trading around 80 per barrel its highest level in seven years looking to lower gas prices and tame growing concerns about inflation the biden administration has urged the organization of petroleum exporting countries and russia a group known as opec to increase crude oil production in addition reuters citing two sources has reported the white house has talked to u s oil and gas producers recently to help bring down fuel costs both moves have raised eyebrows since biden upon taking office revoked the cross border permit for the keystone xl pipeline that was poised to send about 800 000 barrels of oil a day from canada to the texas gulf coast and issued a suspension on new drilling permits and leases on federal land by pursuing policies that restrict supply and make it harder to produce oil and natural gas here in america americans will have to pay more for their energy anne bradbury ceo at the american exploration and production council which lobbies for independent oil and gas producers told reuters last week department of energy secretary jennifer granholm said accessing the country s emergency stock of oil to help reduce prices at the pump is a tool that s under consideration the strategic petroleum reserve located in huge underground salt caverns on the gulf coast of texas and louisiana currently holds 617 8 million barrels of crude according to the energy department it was last tapped in 2011 when president barack obama sold 30 6 million barrels

its iron ore shipment guidance rio has blamed labour shortages and wa s skills crisis for the problems facing its once dominant iron ore division and lowered its annual shipment guidance by 5 million tonnes the company expects to ship 320 to 325 million tonnes of iron ore from the pilbara down from previous expectations of 325 to 340 million tonnes this comes despite the company having a better than expected september quarter shipping 83 4 million tonnes of iron ore in the september quarter compared with the 76 3 million tonnes in the june period it has been another difficult quarter operationally and despite improving versus the prior quarter we recognise the opportunity to raise our performance we have consequently modestly adjusted our guidance rio s chief executive jacques

join us in that sense if we look at europe we can see how the concentration of urban areas is much more prominent than in other countries and continents this means that many more people live in building blocks and the concentration of the population is very high all over the continent in many cases the users do not value the purchase of electric cars due to the added difficulty of not having a plug for the car at hand despite this the improvement in technology is making it possible for the development of the electric car to continue moving forward following this premise tesla has become one of the most successful firms in the ev industry as a whole even more taking into account that its products are not precisely the cheapest on the market how is that possible its competitive advantage and vertical integration which derives from a series of interrelated variables that said we are looking at the arrival of a new generation of cars that will change mobility forever can the berlin gigafactory change the rules regarding ev commercialization the answer is yes absolutely this factory is specially prepared to feed and calm the cravings of european demand so vehicle deliveries will be faster and hopefully more affordable that said tesla looks set to command the turnaround once again let s see why we are facing a unique moment in order to understand the current situation and of course what the meaning of the berlin gigafactory finally ramping up is for instance can you imagine being able to choose from a stock much more adapted to the customer s needs tesla is set to command a transition to more sustainable mobility in europe it is the company that is working the most to make the adoption of the electric car a reality the key to its future success in europe is as we already mentioned the gigafactory in berlin the days when the headquarters in tilburg was the closest thing to production that tesla had in europe are gone the company led by elon musk has carried out the installation of this factory in brandeburg to achieve very optimistic objectives in terms of production to understand the reasons for its construction it is necessary to observe the expected timing of production with an uninterrupted production rate a total of 700 000 vehicles could be made at these facilities each year and according to the portal insideev s if maintenance breaks are taken into account this figure would be reduced to about 600 000 cars year still a very significant number for any ev maker how did the data come about for its quantification it is assumed that each of the body parts has a production time of about 45 seconds this would be the case thanks to the provision of a machine capable of minimizing the number of components this would be without a doubt one of the keys to the success of this project around 2 000 vehicles could be manufactured per day while a total of 57 600 units would be put on the roads each month as elon musk himself stated production of the model y in berlin is expected to start in november this year with the first units to be delivered in december 2021 even though we will still have to wait a few weeks to know more exactly if these forecasts will be fulfilled the berlin gigafactory is expected to be a benchmark when it comes to growth as it is customary in this type of manufacturing there will be a progressive ramp up in production even more considering tesla s experience in giga shanghai and giga texas which could end up with that said 600 000 units a year plant capacity would there be enough demand for so many cars in my opinion the answer is yes and very probably even more as the truth is tesla is commanding the ev sales figures month by month in every chart not only in the us but also in europe nico caballero is the vp of finance of cogency power specializing in solar energy he also holds a diploma in electric cars from delft university of technology in the netherlands and enjoys doing research about tesla and ev batteries he can be reached at nicotorquenews on twitter nico covers tesla and electric vehicle latest happenings at torque news

cnbc s jim cramer said wednesday he believes inflationary pressures in the u s can be relieved without the federal reserve hiking interest rates an action he thinks would be damaging for the economy be patient don t panic we re getting there the seeds of deflation are being planted as we speak and the blossoms will soon be self evident to all but those who want to bet against you the fed and capitalism the mad money host said after the labor department reported earlier in the day that consumer prices in september rose slightly more than expected cramer said he was particularly interested in the bond market s reaction to the latest inflation reading as both the benchmark 10 year treasury and 30 year treasury rallied even as inflation s supposed to be steamrolling the entire world if it s true that the fed s really on the verge of tightening the bond market sure has a funny way of showing it cramer said maybe just maybe some people are thinking that inflation could soon peak meaning this might be one of the last red hot cpi numbers cramer said in his opinion he sees signs suggesting there will be improvements in the parts of the economy that are experiencing inflationary pressures for example cramer pointed to technical analysis that argues the big run in oil prices may roll over he said another commodity he watches closely linerboard may also see relief as supply ramps up helping ease packaging costs it s not just containerboard the former hedge fund manager said if you look at what the analysts are forecasting for the chemical companies and remember these are the companies that make the building blocks of american industry they re almost all expecting a down 2022 again because of overcapacity moreover the biden administration is taking steps to try alleviating port congestion and cramer said used car prices a key inflation driver so far this year were mildly lower in september home sales also are cooling he said what i m talking about occurs then you ve got to forget this whole transient inflation and get used to this new term it s called peak inflation cramer said turns out we don t need the federal reserve to destroy the economy in order to save it from inflation with enough time capitalism is going to solve the problems on its own source cnbc

deal in one of the hippest neighborhoods in philadelphia have to check out fishtown longshoremen working the historic fishing and shipbuilding industries of philadelphia used to reside in fishtown as the seafront district provided housing close to the riverfront while the industries have moved on the brickwork facades and decorative corbels of two story rowhouses dating back to the 1800s remain aspiring homeowners attending open houses in this waterfront neighborhood can utilize buses trolley cars and the el to get around as parking is notoriously hard to come by when dining in fishtown residents are more likely to stumble across a beer garden brewery or taproom than a seafood restaurant music lovers will fall in love with the neighborhood as it boasts a collection of dive bar concert venues like kung fu necktie and johnny brenda s which will hopefully get back to live music post pandemic visitors to fishtown should stop by and support the memphis tap room by getting a bite

comment the government has to act without fear and favour to investigate the names cited in the pandora papers to find out the possible wrongdoing and corruption that are taking place the aim of the investigation is mainly to clear their names the government should make it mandatory for all mps and assemblypersons to declare all their assets onshore and offshore this will enable the authorities to detect any new asset or property owned by mps especially those who hold high positions in political parties one way to overcome corruption and money laundering activities kept in offshore accounts is by introducing a central registry for beneficial ownership of companies registered in malaysia and those keeping funds in labuan it will play an important role in the transparency of ownership a beneficial owner of a company is the person who truly owns enjoys and controls the company even though the title to some form of property or security is in another s name many financial criminals use shell companies to hide money and particulars of ownership through nominees which allows corrupt criminals to launder and avoid their ill gotten wealth the use of nominee directors and shareholders will help mask the beneficial owners of these companies on another note the pandora papers is another avenue in which the inland revenue board can look to see if the tax filings of the taxpayers are consistent with the information that is automatically exchanged and received through the common reporting standards crs by participating countries the objective of the crs developed by the organisation for economic co operation and development in 2014 is to help the international community fight tax evasion fight against corruption the pandora papers is a large scale investigative journalists project by the international consortium of investigative journalists icij which is located in washington dc the icij has been working on it with 140 media organisations in 117 countries the media acts as a bipartisan observer that reports to the public on the functioning of the democratic process within this framework investigative journalism plays a crucial role in the fight against corruption the leaks include over 6 4 million documents about three million images more than one million emails and almost half a million spreadsheets the confidential documents reportedly incriminate hundreds of global wealthy elites high level officials oligarchs and billionaires using shell companies to move wealth offshore anonymously buy real estate or luxury goods for tax avoidance and corruption in their offshore accounts according to the icij over 35 percent of former and current leaders are facing allegations of fraud corruption money laundering and global tax evasion former finance minister daim zainuddin left and current finance minister tengku zafrul abdul aziz among those named in the pandora papers were malaysian businesspersons and politicians such as former finance minister daim zainuddin the current finance minister tengku zafrul abdul aziz umno president ahmad zahid hamidi deputy finance minister yamani hafez musa former pkr treasurer william leong and his wife alice chan lee businessperson g gnanalingam and the parents of fugitive financier low taek jho better known as jho low the pandora papers also revealed the owners of more than 1 500 united kingdom properties including qatar s ruling family the current finance minister of pakistan the king of jordan the czech republic prime minister and the kenyan president the governments of australia britain and pakistan have launched investigations after the secret papers showed how the elite shielded their wealth malaysia s opposition leader failed to get a parliamentary debate over the revelations in the leaks involving several government officials from both political sides offshore financial centres offshore financial centres ofcs are estimated to hold up to us 36 trillion rm150 trillion in cash gold and securities not including tangible assets such as real estate art and jewels a few years ago the boston consulting group stated that singapore held around one eighth of the global stock of total offshore wealth while the international monetary fund imf reported an estimated over 95 percent of all commercial banks in singapore are affiliates of foreign banks which is a testament to its extreme dependence on foreign and offshore money the offshore service providers are located in the cayman islands switzerland hong kong the bahamas luxembourg ireland singapore panama trinidad and tobago and seychelles to name a few the offshore countries offer the following services easy to set up companies greater privacy less regulations strict banking secrecy their laws provide prevent the identification of the real owners of companies there is no low or only nominal taxation or corporate tax protection against local political or financial instability a loss to the country an article in the guardian wrote the discussion of offshore centres can get bogged down in technicalities but the best definition comes from expert nicholas shaxson who sums them up as you take your money elsewhere to another country in order to escape the rules and laws of the society in which you operate in so doing you rob your own society of cash for hospitals schools roads many financial criminals have used offshore companies as fronts for drug trafficking money laundering weapon smuggling monopolising industries privatisation fraud and corrupt politicians and government officials an article in the foreign policy stated that money needed to pay for the pandemic is actually close at hand hidden away in ofcs more commonly known as tax havens using offshore entities outside the country is not illegal provided it is done for legitimate reasons the offshore bank accounts in malaysia are under the scrutiny of the labuan financial services authority fsa but the practice is commonly used to dodge taxes the main issue is how they got the large sums of money and their other sources of funds and wealth the un office for drug control and crime prevention stated that the real issue therefore is not to issue blanket condemnations or make efforts to eliminate bank secrecy and offshore financial services but to ensure that the legitimate uses of these facilities remain available while making it much more difficult to use them directly for criminal activities or for laundering the proceeds of drug trafficking and other such forms of organised crime the covid 19 pandemic has unfolded many weaknesses in government ministries which we thought were our strengths with our b40 now b50 it is important for all taxpayers monies to remain within malaysia and not

cape elizabeth an affordable housing proposal has divided residents of this affluent seaside community and the battle line goes right through the town center for some residents the town center is exactly where dunham court should be built within walking distance of the pond cove iga foodliner and a cvs pharmacy along with the public schools community center police and fire station and thomas memorial library for other residents the town center is the last place they want to see a four story 49 unit building it would be right on ocean house road route 77 beside the butter yellow town hall and the sprawling new village green with its block granite war memorial and ship s mast style flagpole but dunham court is the first major affordable housing project to come before town officials in 50 years at a time when already precious housing stock has grown even more scarce and costly amid a pandemic driven buying spree the median home price here is 625 000 and rising and while the lack of affordable housing may be more acute in cape elizabeth it s emblematic of a housing crisis erupting across southern maine and the nation opponents say the project would be too big the apartments would be too small for many families and it s all just happening too fast although the town council planning board and developer have held more than a dozen public meetings so far they ve asked the council to reject the dunham court proposal and form a town committee to develop a strategic plan for affordable housing and they ve threatened to gather signatures for a town referendum on the project if the council doesn t scuttle it dunham court would cast its shadow over our town green and set us on a course for subsequent infrastructure and more density both of which the majority of the town s residents simply do not want brooks bornhofft said in his testimony to the council last week advertisement supporters say dunham court would be ideal for younger people who work in town but can t afford to live here as well as older residents who want to downsize from in demand single family homes but stay in town they say the project should be built in the town center to avoid costly infrastructure expansion and preserve prized farmland and open space and they note the lack of other available or feasible building sites in town which has hampered significant affordable housing development so far despite everybody wildly applauding that they support affordable housing they want it someplace else priscilla armstrong told the council last week well i don t particularly feel that our town center is a vision of loveliness but i think this plan is lovely it s the center of town it s where it should be dunham court has come under attack early in its review when the developer is seeking four zoning amendments that would make financing and construction possible if the changes are approved the building would be 10 feet taller than the 35 foot height limit for the town center district the amendments also would halve the amount of land needed per unit more than double the building footprint limit and release the developer from hosting commercial tenants on the first floor the project also would need a tax increment financing arrangement with the town that would return a portion of property taxes to the developer over 30 years the project is proposed by the szanton co a well regarded housing developer in portland that specializes in mixed income rental housing financed through federal low income housing tax credits administered by the maine state housing authority the company has built and now manages more than 550 apartments in 11 buildings in portland biddeford lewiston auburn bath and exeter new hampshire and it has 292 units under development in projects in cape elizabeth old orchard beach bath portland and lewiston nathan szanton the company s founder invited cape residents to tour its other properties which he said are designed to be attractive and contribute to the vitality and economy of each community i m very proud of them he said szanton s partners include bobby monks a prominent town resident who is widely known as an entrepreneur financier real estate developer and political activist monks defends the dunham court proposal named for linwood dunham a highly respected town resident who died in 2000 at age 108 advertisement there is no way i would be part of any project that would be anything but healthy for our town monks said we have been lucky to live in cape and that opportunity should be afforded to everyone right now few people can afford to live in cape elizabeth according to erik jorgensen government relations director for mainehousing he spoke to the need for affordable housing at last week s council meeting the quasi state agency defines affordability as housing that doesn t cost more than 30 percent of household income jorgensen said and it considers fair market rent for a two bedroom apartment in greater portland to be 1 592 cape elizabeth a rural suburb of portland with a population of 9 300 has 535 rental units he said that includes colonial village a 22 unit subsidized senior housing complex on starboard drive that was built in the 1970s these days tenants need a yearly household income of 92 000 to lease a median priced two bedroom apartment in cape which runs about 2 300 per month including utilities jorgensen said prospective homeowners need a yearly household income of 174 000 to buy a median priced home of 625 000 he said so if you re a typical member of the workforce you probably don t have much of a chance to live in this community in the absence of a project that might provide affordable housing jorgensen said if you re a fireman working in cape elizabeth and you can t live any closer than buxton that s not a good thing advertisement jorgensen pointed to starting annual salaries for several careers in the region including firefighters 29 650 teachers 43 340 and farming fishing and forestry occupations 29 730 median household income in cape elizabeth is 123 116 according to the u s census on average renters in cape earn 41 percent less than the median household income he said jorgensen said the lack of affordable housing is a growing problem across maine and the nation driven most recently by homebuyers fleeing urban areas overwhelmed by the covid 19 pandemic maine alone needs an additional 25 000 affordable units he said including single family homes and apartments with an acute need for multi family housing in areas of cumberland and york counties where single family homes are drawing multiple offers above the asking price mainehousing is financing and building record levels of affordable housing jorgensen said and is on track to produce up to 1 000 units per year as a result of recent state and federal policy changes projects are usually financed with low income housing tax credits which require a certain scale to make the numbers work he said but developers in portland sanford biddeford kennebunk and york are trying innovative alternatives producing more affordable housing also has been identified as a priority of the greater portland council of governments and its metro regional coalition its latest progress report found that increasing demand and rising housing prices have created greater difficulty for an increasing number of households to find housing they can afford in the community they wish to live in the report concluded that increasing affordable housing options in and around portland would stem the trend of people moving outside the metro area which leads to a loss of beneficial diversity in metro communities and increases traffic congestion air pollution and demand for costly infrastructure and services in outlying towns rising housing costs in cape elizabeth have had a noticeable impact over the last decade said town planner maureen o meara the number of volunteer firefighters has fallen from about 60 to 30 and the number of students in the town s schools has fallen from about 1 800 to 1 600 she said the school district struggles to hire bus drivers and fill other positions advertisement there are far fewer people who live here and work here and it s not good for the community o meara said a 1992 town ordinance requires major housing developments to include 5 percent low income units or 10 percent moderate income units but that has produced only 15 condos or houses so far she said it has succeeded in creating some permanent affordable housing but it s not nearly enough o meara said the problem is getting worse we re getting farther and farther behind and we re becoming less and less affordable dunham court would include 41 one bedroom and eight two bedroom apartments as well as a fitness center community room for residents free wi fi heat hot water parking indoor bike storage and a coin operated laundry thirty nine apartments would be reserved for households below 60 percent of the area median income which is 42 000 for one person 48 000 for two people and 59 940 for three people ten apartments would be leased at market rate affordable rents would be 1 080 for one bedroom and 1 299 for two bedrooms market rents would be 1 495 for one bedroom and 1 695 for two bedrooms dunham court is the latest project planned as part of the 4 acre ocean house common subdivision that was approved for dr david jacobson who is building a new home for his dental practice beside the village green jacobson gave the land to the town for the green advertisement the planning board has reviewed and recommended the zoning amendments sought for dunham court the seven member town council appears to be as divided as residents and has referred the matter to its ordinance committee some opponents already have threatened to organize a town referendum on the project if the council approves the ordinance amendments when the full council will act on the requested changes is unclear but chairman jamie garvin is hopeful the project will move forward i think people are very averse to change garvin said many hold an idealized view of this town in their heads one project isn t going to solve all of the housing problems in cape elizabeth or the region but it s a start councilor caitlin jordan stated her opposition clearly during last week s council workshop do i want a four story building that ginormous in the center of our small town right now i m a no jordan said send questions comments to the editors previous next filed under

between the quantities of metals contained in the concentrates we produce versus the portion of those metals actually paid for according to the terms of our sales contracts differences can also arise

winnebago county wi wtaq wluk when hunters take to the field the weekend for the start of the thousands of birds are expected to be on the landscape stocked ahead of the event department of natural resources wildlife biologists say part of the glacial habitat restoration area in southwestern winnebago county makes a suitable setting for the upcoming pheasant hunting season that kind of wide open marshy area and then the rest of the property here is a mix of upland and wetland areas and some scattered trees said josh jackl dnr wildlife biologist jackl says hundreds of roosters were stocked in the area this week we have about 80 85 properties that are probably stocked by the dnr throughout the season at least the beginning part of the season so of that we put about 75 000 roosters on those properties throughout the season he said why do pheasants need to be stocked we have to stock because of the habitat not being the greatest so what s happened over the last 30 40 years is the habitat has gone down hill we just don t have the available habitat that s needed for the pheasants anymore so it is hard for them to sustain a population and or increase that population said jackl jackl says opening weekend hunters are allowed to take one rooster saturday and one on sunday otherwise from the third day through the rest of the season you can get two birds a day he said for many hunting the ring necked pheasant is a wisconsin tradition and jackl says continued management combined with seasonal stocking will help keep that tradition alive it happens in a split second and you think it might be an easy thing but it s very easy to miss when you get a flushing pheasant in front of you too but the whole thing is pretty exciting he said the season runs from october 16 to january 9 2022 shooting begins saturday no earlier than 9 a m
mumbai in a last ditch attempt a team of leading foreign portfolio investors fpis top brokers and mnc banks on tuesday impressed upon revenue secretary tarun bajaj an old finance ministry hand and former pmo official the need to form a working group to discuss afresh the contentious decision taken by the securities exchange board of india sebi to shorten the stock market settlement cycle by a day sebi however did not attend the meeting but a senior official of the reserve bank of india rbi participated two persons familiar with the deliberation told et offshore investors such as blackrock and fidelity brokers including bank of america and societe generale and mnc banks citi bnp and deutsche which act as custodians handling funds and securities on behalf of fpis comprised the group which put across the hurdles in migrating to a t 1 or trade plus one day system from the current t 2 days cycle by january 1 the date set by sebi the report on the operational flow required under t 1 was given by a group of officials from clearing corporations and depositories but no formal working group or committee was formed while the matter was discussed in the sebi secondary market committee last november there was no wider consultation fpis brokers want a threadbare discussion but the relationship between the regulator and the fund industry has turned frosty with the latter s open letter on t 1 which was circulated widely on whatsapp a few days ago said an official with a market intermediary the proposed t 1 system has been welcomed by most local traders who can transact more and mutual funds who can process redemptions a day earlier but is being opposed by fpis operating in different time zones their custodians and some of the brokers at present trades on indian stock exchanges are settled within two days after they take place sebi wants to quicken the process by advancing the settlement cycle by a day to t 1 from next january this would allow the buyer of stocks to receive securities in a demat account and the seller to receive funds in a bank account just a day after the trade is executed fpis have been arguing that carrying out multiple activities such as obligation matching margin collection handling of mismatches and arranging funds by converting foreign exchange into rupees in the evening when liquidity dries up would be a challenge under t 1 it would also raise the number of hand delivery trades arising out of mismatches between contract notes generated by brokers and the confirmation given by global custodians they have pointed out said a market source
in the shallow coastal waters along the eastern shore of vancouver island in british columbia low tide brings a remarkable sight when the tides are out and the tidelands of comox bay are revealed a vast field of carefully carved and strategically implanted wooden stakes suddenly rises above the water surface these are the remains of a complex of fish traps some quite ancient and some more modern that were constructed by the indigenous k ómoks first nation people along the coastline of their traditional lands at its peak performance this network of k ómoks fish traps could have captured fish by the thousands the trap system was both highly productive and fully sustainable which is why the k ómoks created it in the first millennium and continued to use it for more than 1 000 years k ómoks first nation people s fish traps and fishing weirs in and around vancouver island openstreetmap via arcgis hakai magazine first nation fish traps deciphered by nancy greene s team for a long time it seemed that knowledge about what the wooden stakes represented had been forgotten modern k ómoks saw them all the time and knew they had something to do with fishing but they didn t know much about the scale or style of fishing their ancestors had practiced this situation changed starting in the early 2000s thanks to the efforts of a local undergraduate anthropology student named nancy greene as a 20 plus year resident of the comox valley region the malaspina college now vancouver island university senior had seen the stakes many times like everyone else and was curious to find out more about their purpose and origin recruiting a team of volunteers to help her greene spent many hours out on the k ómoks first nation tidelands inspecting the wooden stakes and evaluating their designs and shapes she also spoke to many k ómoks elders about them to see if they could offer more information about their makers and their history greene s determination to find out the truth about the stakes set her off on a years long quest which continued past her school days and into her career as a professional archaeologist working in the comox valley one k ómoks elder told her a story she d first heard from her grandmother about how the stakes were arranged to make weirs a type of fish trap the woman told her granddaughter that each k ómoks family in pre european contact times was responsible for their own individual weir using this knowledge plus her own intuition to guide her studies greene and her colleagues eventually figured out the shapes of the fish traps that had been constructed from the wooden stakes it was then they realized the truth about what the ancient k ómoks had done which was to create the largest ancient fish trap system found anywhere in north america and possibly anywhere in the world nancy greene studying the massive fish trap complex in comox harbor on vancouver island british columbia nancy greene hakai magazine a breathtaking display of engineering genius when fully visible at low tide the scale of the k ómoks first nation fish trap array is breathtaking the wooden stakes the k ómoks whittled from douglas fir trees and western red cedars and deployed in the shallow wetlands near their homeland number somewhere between 150 000 and 200 000 which would have been enough to create at least 300 separate traps covering several acres of tidelands radiocarbon dating results show the oldest traps were built in the eight century ad while the youngest were installed in the 19 th century the latter were presumably constructed just before the k ómoks people were removed from their ancestral lands following the passage of the canadian indian act of 1876 this depopulation measure banished first nations peoples to reservations and outlawed traditional cultural and all their governing practices in this case the canadian government s actions destroyed a cultural practice that may have once fed and sustained as many as 10 000 to 12 000 k ómoks people as impressive as the scale of the fish traps were their design was just as awe inspiring the complex heart shaped and chevron shaped traps were lined with woven removable wooden panels that featured spaces big enough for water to flow through but too narrow for fish to swim through the meandering lines of the traps mimicked the shape of the area s natural shoreline which encouraged fish to follow them and enter the larger trap enclosure when the tide receded and the water drained away the fish would be left behind trapped in shallow pools that could easily be reached on foot k ómoks fishers could target either salmon or herring depending on the season they could also control the size of each harvest to ensure natural fish populations would remain plentiful they undoubtedly monitored salmon runs and herring movements closely to make sure they had up to date data on fish populations and their fluctuations while this was an industrial sized fishing operation the k ómoks people weren t catching fish to sell on an international market they were catching what they needed to survive and no more which means fish stocks were never seriously threatened by irresponsible overfishing two type of fish traps used by the k ómoks first nation people david mcgee and mercedes minck hakai magazine surveying the fishing cultures of ancient british columbia cory frank is the manager of the k ómoks guardian watchmen a group that supervises sustainable practices for the coastal nation frank grew up looking at the mysterious wooden stakes in the water on a daily basis and he is delighted by what greene and her colleagues have uncovered about ancient k ómoks fishing practices my ancestors were amazing engineers he marveled but they weren t the only ones archaeologists have discovered the remains of fantastic and ingenious fishing aquaculture systems created by other first nations peoples who resided in the area of modern british columbia on the gulf islands which can be found in the waters of the salish sea between vancouver island and mainland british columbia the hul q umi num and w sáneć people built low rock walls just off the beaches running parallel to the shoreline these walls were designed to trap silt brought in by the tides to make sea gardens where creatures like clams crabs sea cucumbers octopus and rockfish could be tended and harvested in controlled conditions on british columbia s broughton archipelago the kwakwaka wakw people built huge rock walls to increase water depth in their shallow bays so that clams could be grown and harvested more easily there on offshore islands and along british columbia s central coast the heiltsuk people constructed stone walled clam gardens and fish traps which were built according to various designs depending on whether they were installed on tideland in creeks or at the mouth of a river the indigenous peoples of ancient british columbia adapted to their environments in unique ways many relied largely on marine life to survive but their methods for taking advantage of the sea s bounty varied based on local ecological conditions one of the small bays where the k ómoks first nation people trap fish today komoksfirstnation the destruction of a culture is being reversed it seems incredible to realize that knowledge of this astoundingly effective and efficient fishing system had been all but lost to modern k ómoks people but that was an outgrowth of the canadian first nations peoples 19 th century contacts with white european settlers who arrived from the east carrying their germs their greed and their racist hostility with them in all too many cases deidre cullon an archaeologist from vancouver island university provided hakai magazine with details about the events that decimated native populations in british columbia the smallpox epidemic of 1862 claimed the lives of half the indigenous people on the coast of british columbia she explained in that catastrophe not only were keepers of knowledge lost entire communities were abandoned lost too was the need for a high production fishery there were far fewer mouths to feed and then right on the heels of that the canadian government chose to support commercial fishing for canneries cullon continued the government made the traps illegal and sent their fisheries officers to destroy them next came the indian act of 1876 which pushed first nations people off their traditional lands and removed indigenous children from their families young k ómoks people were sent to boarding schools where in addition to frequently experiencing horrific abuse they were also prevented from learning their native languages traditions and cultures k ómoks parents were forbidden to teach their kids about the old ways and eventually the memory of the fish trap system and what it represented was lost only now 150 years later are archaeologists and first nations historians finally rediscovering the glorious accomplishment of the k ómoks and the many other indigenous people who once occupied all of british columbia scientists in cooperation with modern first nations people who ve returned to reclaim their native lands are now attempting to reverse engineer some of the old fishing and aquacultural systems not only were these systems ecologically sustainable but they were also an essential part of north american indigenous culture and identity which makes them incredibly valuable to first nations people living today top image these wooden stakes sticking out of the water were part of an ancient k
