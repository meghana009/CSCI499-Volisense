hartford conn ap the death of a 13 year old student who apparently overdosed on fentanyl at his connecticut school has drawn renewed pleas for schools to stock the opioid antidote naloxone as well as for training of both staffers and children on how to recognize and respond to overdoses the seventh grader died jan 15 after falling ill at a hartford school that did not have naloxone on hand city officials vowed wednesday to put the antidote in all city schools as part of a wider drug use and overdose prevention strategy naloxone should be available in all schools and there should be education on signs and symptoms of overdose and how to use this said dr craig allen vice president of addiction services for hartford healthcare s behavioral health network unfortunately a horrible incident like this happens and suddenly everyone s vision is 20 20 hartford mayor luke bronin said that because of the student s young age an opioid overdose did not immediately come to mind when the school nurse and first responders who did have naloxone treated him that s why city officials are also proposing more training and curriculum changes aimed at educating staffers students and community members in substance use awareness and prevention he said in response to the student s death advocacy groups are repeating calls they ve made for several years for schools to stock naloxone often delivered as a nasal spray under the brand name narcan and train educators support staff and students to recognize signs of opioid use and overdoses especially because younger people are falling victim more frequently the powerful opioid fentanyl has been showing up in marijuana illicit pills and other substances accessible to school age children experts say fatal overdoses in the u s are at record levels fueled by fentanyl and have been increasing among younger people national data shows the national association of school nurses has advocated for naloxone to be in all schools since 2015 and for school nurses to help educate their communities about the signs and symptoms of substance abuse it s a very unfortunate outcome linda mendonca the association s president said about the hartford student s death it brings us back to school preparedness and response plans having those in place is really critical the association created a tool kit for school nurses that includes information on administering naloxone and educating the community about opioid problems the kit has been downloaded from its website more than 49 000 times the group said ethan s run against addiction is one of many advocacy groups that weighed in on social media about the hartford student s death it is named after ethan monson dupuis a 25 year old wisconsin man who died of a heroin overdose in 2016 this tragedy is unbearable our nation s opioid crisis has reached into the lives of children into places where we want to assume that they are safe the group said in a facebook post thursday all public places including schools must have narcan available we need to educate kids on how to recognize someone who is overdosing and how to use narcan in addition to a nasal spray naloxone can also be given as an injection the national institute on drug abuse says it is a safe medicine and side effects are rare but warns it doesn t reverse overdoses from other drugs training is needed the agency says because sometimes more than one dose needs to be given and people who receive the drug can experience immediate withdrawal symptoms it s not clear how often overdoses happen in u s schools but experts and advocates say they are not common in late november two school resource officers and a school nurse were given naloxone after being exposed to the synthetic opioid carfentanil which was in a piece of paper found in a student s vape pen at sequoyah high school in madisonville tennessee according to local media reports the officers and nurse became lightheaded but recovered in 2019 high schools in the tucson arizona area began stocking naloxone in response to a student overdosing on opioids while in school emergency responders who were carrying the antidote revived the student media reports said there also is no national data on how many schools have naloxone or drug use awareness training programs that include recognizing the signs of an overdose in a survey of pennsylvania school nurses conducted in 2018 and published in 2020 more than half the 362 nurses who responded reported having naloxone in their schools according to the journal public health nursing about 5 of the nurses said naloxone had been administered in their school or at a school sponsored activity the most common reason for not having naloxone in schools included a lack of support and the belief it was not needed the survey showed drug use prevention is taught in many schools and there are an array of overdose awareness and naloxone administration programs offered by local health departments and advocacy groups in eastern tennessee the carter county drug prevention group has trained hundreds of children some as young as 6 on how to use naloxone via after school programs and other extracurricular gatherings in response to rising overdoses the new york times reported twenty states had laws allowing schools to possess and administer naloxone and seven others required schools to have naloxone use policies as of august 2020 according to the legislative analysis and public policy association a nonprofit research and policy advocacy group most of the laws require training on administering the antidote in response to record drug overdoses the national office of national drug control policy in november released a model law for states to consider aimed at expanding access to naloxone including in schools the hartford student fell ill jan 13 at the sport and medical sciences academy and died at a hospital two days later the teenager s name was not released two other students recovered after apparently being exposed to fentanyl and becoming ill officials said hartford police said they found about 40 small bags containing fentanyl in the school police are still investigating the overdose and the fentanyl s source remains unclear according to the centers for disease control and prevention the 15 to 24 age group saw the largest percentage increase in drug overdose death rates from 2019 to 2020 at 49 but had the second lowest overall rates among age groups for the first time last year u s overdoses deaths topped an estimated 100 000 in a one year period with many of the deaths linked to illicit fentanyl

this article is more than 2 years old getty images next time you pick up a 69 cent can of beans consider what it took to get that can onto the store shelf every can of beans every bottle of detergent every bunch of light green bananas gets to the customer by human hands and as of late 2021 almost every supermarket in the country could have used a lot more of them nearly 6 3 million retail workers quit their jobs in the first 10 months of 2021 and by the end of october their employers were still trying to fill 1 million openings many of these openings and perhaps the ones that sting the most are in the grocery aisle people still need to eat after all but they are turning to the local supermarket to meet needs other than food grocery sales rose 8 3 in december 2021 over december 2020 and a surprising 16 9 over december 2019 online ordering and automation help cover for some worker shortages 67 of retailers were offering contactless payment in 2020 and more than half of all consumers use it still consumers even curbside pickup customers are going into the stores and they expect workers to be on hand to answer questions stock inventory and prepare foods this has inspired some creative work arounds and continued faith in the industry s ability to flex with the times hand to mouth solutions that labor for time and a half not every worker shortage fix will work and some may not be popular with employees yet for better or worse here is how food retailers are trying to get more out of fewer workers finding thrift in short shifts when compensating for worker shortages reducing overall hours is low hanging fruit doing so without compromising service however requires a valuation of customer traffic at different times of day kroger changed the closing times at stores in some markets to 9 p m from 10 p m an hour during which traffic may drop significantly adjusting operating hours among departments could yield greater savings one east coast chain began closing its deli departments at 5 p m up to five hours early due to workers shortages but heck the traffic data may show only a small percentage of total deli sales occur after 5 p m anyway cutting cake and other labor rich products like deli departments a supermarket s bakery butcher shop and prepared meals sections require a significant investment in staff to meet shopper demand for convenience still choosing when and where to cut matters a lot prepared meals for example tend to generate higher margins than overall grocery some chains are finding a middle ground by offering slightly fewer options stew leonard s an independent chain in connecticut is asking its bakers to make fewer varieties of crumb cake for example upskilling workers more than half of all retailers are planning to add training that is designed to improve their employees technology skills retail touchpoints reports count supermarkets among them especially as digital purchasing becomes more of a standard artificial intelligence is used to gauge how shoppers interact with products on the shelves to inform smart shopping carts at kroger and to scan items on the fly at amazon go the more that workers can be hands on and therefore familiar with these technologies the more likely they will stay with the employer and improve efficiencies bonus ai also can be used to detect the best fit job candidates overbooking temporary fixes and calling in the suits the managers at piggly wiggly stores in alabama and georgia are taking the overbooked airline approach to staffing and overscheduling workers wagering that a number will call off or not make it in the chain also is using temporary staffing agencies to ensure people are available to stock its shelves meantime the pittsburgh based chain giant eagle has been sending staff from its headquarters to help fill in at stores as a result it has been able to avoid closing any of its nearly 470 locations reducing break times whole foods has reduced employee break times to 10 minutes from 15 minutes that may not seem like a lot but those minutes add up when considering whole foods employees 90 00 people and in many states each full time shift includes two paid breaks so if a store schedules 50 full time workers for one shift each of them could work an additional 10 minutes adding up to 500 minutes or 8 3 hours in that shift this decision isn t popular with all workers but whole foods told cbs news the policy will provide the vast majority of team members with more break time throughout their work day getty images will these part time solutions become permanent the real test of these staff shortage solutions will be how they translate in dollars and cents if customers remain engaged with their favorite stores and sales rise any efforts that reduce margin will likely have a longer shelf life one need only look at the popularity of self checkout lanes to see that still shoppers will want to have a variety of crumb cakes for humans to show them

the department of defence spent almost 3m in a five year period renting aircraft and on civilian flight tickets to ferry irish troops to peacekeeping missions across the world according to newly revealed documents the chartering of the civilian aircraft along with pilots and crew was utilised to transport military personnel because the irish air corps do not have the capability to transport large amounts of soldiers the documents from the department of defence reveal how the money was spent on six un missions and one eu mission the journal initially lodged a freedom of information request seeking details of the government s spend on chartered and commercial flights across all departments the department of public expenditure and reform dper refused the request insisting no such records were available however data covering flights organised and paid for by the department of defence was released to kildare south td cathal berry on behalf of simon coveney the defence minister in an answer to a parliamentary question this database shows that flights to and from un and eu peacekeeping missions cost 2 7m over a five year period from 2016 to 2020 this included the leasing or chartering of aircraft and according to a defence forces source also included payments for flight tickets berry has said that the spend could have been much higher but for an agreement with the united nations for it to cover the cost of half of the flights annually to and from certain missions berry who is a former officer in the irish defence forces had sought details in light of the growing disquiet around why the air corps does not have a long distance heavy lift capability the biggest issue here is that the government are refusing to fund an internalised air craft capability which is very hard to understand because it would save a fortune in the longer term i would call on the state to look at reducing cost by improving the capability of air corps to provide this cover this should be a whole of government approach the people are there to do the job and it should be operated by the air corps cathal berry td has called repeatedly for funding for a long distance heavy lift air corps operated aircraft one example here is that the hse is paying a private company more than 2m annually for a medically equipped aircraft to sit at dublin airport just in case there is a need to ferry a sick patient the air corps does the same mission repeatedly through the year with in its allocated budget in december the department of foreign affairs paid money to repatriate irish citizens via morocco advertisement chartering flights on an ad hoc basis is costing massive money across the government simply because it is an immediate need they didn t plan for and to get the quickest provider it costs money the key message here is that there is a way to save fortune on this issue and that is to properly fund this capability in the public service last year the journal revealed that a leasing firm seraph aviation group had offered the department of defence two second hand long distance heavy lift aircraft this offer was refused by the department irish army ranger wing operators and diplomats who travelled to kabul to rescue irish citizens last year were also forced to hitch a ride to and from afghanistan on board french and finnish aircraft there was also the case of irish troops departure from unifil in lebanon being delayed due to concerns over covid 19 the un covers an overseas allowance payment for troops serving on behalf of the international body while their wages are paid by the irish government there have been occasions as documented on defence forces social media channels when the air corps used aircraft such as the government jet to ferry small numbers of troops from missions however in most instances the troops travelled either on commercially operated flights or on chartered aircraft the following is a spreadsheet breakdown of the spend a breakdown of the cost of commercially chartered flights and air travel tickets to and from irish peacekeeping missions cathal berry td cathal berry td the un missions mentioned in the answer to berry s parliamentary question are undof in the golan heights on the syria border unifil in lebanon untso in the middle east monusco operation in congo kfor a joint un nato operation in kosovo minruso special forces detachment in mali western sahara and the un headquarters in new york the european union missions are in mali training local troops to confront islamic terror groups and the eu bih operation in bosnia herzegovina which is monitoring the situation in the former yugoslavia dangerously inadequate a spokesperson for the representative association of commissioned officers said the lack of funding of the air corps was putting the irish people at risk government spending on defence the lowest in the eu by any identifiable metric is dangerously inadequate we must never apologise for the maintenance and resourcing of the state s insurance policy enhanced capability ensures the protection health safety and wellbeing of our personnel it inspires pride in the service and improves retention critical enablers possessed by normal military forces like airlift are not only logistical and strategic assets but they also enhance the safety and wellbeing of our personnel by ensuring they can be deployed and recovered from overseas missions in a safe and timely manner this is even before we look at the value for money aspect airlift can be a national asset not just a military one the arguments against investing in this most basic national security requirement are baseless the spokesperson said

our political system is broken much of its deterioration can be traced back to a single factor money more and more politicians have been drawn to the extreme on different subjects to satisfy different niche special interests this means that mainstream america gets sold out to help politicians campaign more as they seek higher office or reelection though it s easy to complain about money in politics here is a simple plan to mitigate the bulk of the influence of special interests require disclosure of all donors in political advertisements and activity forbid all members of congress from owning individual stocks mandate term limits allow 48 hours for legislators to read bills before passing this will eliminate hidden agendas prevent any organization that receives funds from government contracts from contributing to political activity this step would eliminate pay to play activity but the most impactful way to reduce special interests influence over government is by reducing the size and scope of government government has entered every part of our lives the more it grows then the more incentive special interests have to get involved smaller government means better government sam wahlen yorkville

for more schools to stock the opioid antidote hartford conn the death of a 13 year old student who apparently overdosed on fentanyl at his connecticut school has drawn renewed pleas for schools to stock the opioid antidote naloxone as well as for training of both staffers and children on how to recognize and respond to overdoses the seventh grader died jan 15 after falling ill at a hartford school that did not have naloxone on hand city officials vowed wednesday to put the antidote in all city schools as part of a wider drug use and overdose prevention strategy naloxone should be available in all schools and there should be education on signs and symptoms of overdose and how to use this said dr craig allen vice president of addiction services for hartford healthcare s behavioral health network unfortunately a horrible incident like this happens and suddenly everyone s vision is 20 20 hartford mayor luke bronin said that because of the student s young age an opioid overdose did not immediately come to mind when the school nurse and first responders who did have naloxone treated him that s why city officials are also proposing more training and curriculum changes aimed at educating staffers students and community members in substance use awareness and prevention he said in response to the student s death advocacy groups are repeating calls they ve made for several years for schools to stock naloxone often delivered as a nasal spray under the brand name narcan and train educators support staff and students to recognize signs of opioid use and overdoses

the us dollar broke higher against the yen to start the year it traded up to jpy116 35 its highest level in five year however within a few days it became clear that it was a false breakout the dollar moved back within its old range jpy113 jpy115 0 5 yen indeed the greenback finished last week near jpy113 65 ok if the dollar is going to weaken the euro is a major beneficiary after trading mostly 1 12 1 14 since mid november the euro broke higher and set a two month high on january 14 slightly below 1 1485 this break also proved to be a head fake frustratingly correlations like the yen and us rates and the canadian dollar and us stocks have broken down that said risk off broadly has lifted the yen to the top of the major currencies through the first three weeks it is up about 1 2 the canadian dollar is second best with an almost 0 8 gain currencies which typically do well when growth and risk appetites are strong like the scandis and antipodeans are the weakest since the end of last year on the other hand emerging market currencies as an asset class have done well the jp morgan emerging market currency index has risen for three consecutive weeks to start the new year this matches the longest advancing streak in 2021 latam currencies account for three of the top five performers the chilean peso is the world s best with a 6 7 gain the south african rand is second appreciating by about 5 6 peru and colombia are next 4 4 and 3 1 respectively geopolitics seems to be trumping oil prices for the russian rouble which is the worst performer off 3 25 followed by argentina 1 55 and the turkish lira 1 dollar index the bounce in the dollar index we anticipated after the key reversal materialized january 14 but stalled just above the 50 retracement objective 95 75 of the decline from the december 15 high near 96 90 the trendline from that high and early january highs comes in around 96 00 and is also the next retracement 61 8 target the macd and slow stochastic have turned up but the price action is less encouraging still this flag or pennant pattern is mostly seen as a continuation pattern a move above 96 00 would target 96 40 initially although intraday penetration of the 20 day moving average now around 95 75 occurred dxy failed to close above it initial support is seen in the 95 25 95 40 area a break of 95 00 warns of a push lower probably below the january 14 low 94 65 euro after approaching 1 1485 on january 14 it was sold back to 1 1300 ahead of the weekend the middle of the old 1 12 1 14 trading range the trendline off last year s low 1 1185 on november 24 and the mid december lows will begin the new week slightly below 1 13 which is also the 61 8 retracement objective of the gains since the low the macd and slow stochastic have rolled over but if the 1 13 area holds a bounce back above 1 14 cannot be ruled out on the other hand a break of 1 1280 would be a blow to the late longs in the futures market speculators added to their gross long position for the fifth consecutive week in the reporting period ending january 18 at almost 212k contracts each contract is notional value is 100k euros it is the largest gross long position since last august the bearish speculators have reduced their gross short position for last four weeks and at about 187 3k contracts it is the smallest since late september japanese yen after falling from jpy116 35 on january 4 to jpy113 50 on january 14 the dollar bounced last week and flirted with jpy115 on january 18 this roughly corresponds to the top of the previous jpy113 jpy115 range 0 5 yen and the 50 retracement of the slide from the early january high the greenback slipped lower in the second half of the week returning back to jpy113 60 ahead of the weekend which is where the lower bollinger band can be found the macd is falling but the slow stochastic is moving sideways near its recent trough a break could spur a test on the early december lows near jpy112 50 british pound sterling looks particularly vulnerable it finished last week on its lows and below the 20 day moving average for the first time since december 21 recall that after rallying more than a nickel from mid december to mid january it stalled near the 200 day moving average 1 3735 since posting the three month high on january 13 sterling fell in five of the next six sessions the retreat brought it to spitting distance of the 38 2 retracement objective found near 1 3530 a break would bring the next retracement 50 into view around 1 3460 the macd and slow stochastic have turned lower and the five day moving average looks poised to cross below the 20 day moving average for the first time in a month the market has priced in a slightly greater chance of a boe rate hike on february 3 now a little above 90 next week s report from the gray s inquiry into the parties at 10 downing street may keep the pressure on johnson while england s remaining covid restrictions will be lifted canadian dollar the us dollar s high for 2021 was recorded on december 20 near cad1 2965 it subsequently sold off to about cad1 2450 on january 13 it has chopped in recent days between roughly cad1 2450 and cad1 2550 before rising to cad1 2580 before the weekend the macd and slow stochastic are turning up from oversold territory the market is more confident after the december cpi report that the bank of canada will hikes the target rate 25 bp on january 26 over the past week the market increased the amount discounted to almost three quarters from slightly more than half on january 14 the near term risk is on the us dollar s upside and we suggest two targets the first is the cad1 26 area which is the neckline of the head and shoulders topping pattern which projects to around cad1 2250 the second is the cad1 2640 cad1 2650 area which corresponds to a 38 2 retracement of the sell off since december 22 and the 20 day moving average the us dollar has not closed above the 20 day moving average since december 28 australian dollar the aussie climbed three cents from early december through january 13 subsequently it met the 38 2 retracement objective near 0 7190 and is nearing the 50 retracement by 0 7155 where the lower bollinger band can be found the stronger moves have been on the downside while upticks have been more of a grind the macd is flat but appears to be rolling over the slow stochastic did not confirm the mid january high leaving a bearish divergence and is moving lower a break of the 0 7150 area could signal another half to three quarters of a cent decline our leaning is that aussie s gain through mid january were corrective in nature and look for a retest on the 0 7000 in the coming weeks the australian dollar however has been particularly strong against the new zealand dollar rising to levels not seen in around six month the cross is closed above the upper bollinger band for the past two sessions initial support is seen around nzd1 0650 more important support is near nzd1 06 which is also the neckline of a w pattern on the weekly charts if valid the measuring objective is close to nzd1 09 mexican peso of the half dozen most active latin american currencies the mexican peso is the worst performer so far this year after the argentine peso the mexican peso dropped by 0 75 last week to snap what was a seven week rally leaving it up about 0 25 for the year the brazilian real is next with a 2 2 gain helped perhaps by signals from the lula the past and likely next president that he will tow a moderate course to put it into context recall that the dollar peaked against the mexican peso last year in a spike to mxn22 1550 in late november it carved a low at the beginning of last week near the 200 day moving average mxn20 29 it appears that some momentum traders moved to reduce their short dollar exposure the greenback peaked around mxn20 5665 on january 20 the third consecutive daily advance the longest in nearly two months despite the risk off mood ahead of the weekend the peso strengthened by around 0 3 the market has about 200 bp of tightening priced in for the next 12 months the next banxico meeting is february 10 chinese yuan despite reductions in the one and five year loan prime rates and signals of a more accommodative monetary policy going forward banks being encouraged to step up their lending the yuan remained strong indeed ahead of the weekend the yuan rose to its highest level against the dollar since may 2018 there seems to be two broad explanations for the yuan s strength first is china s record trade surplus it reached 94 5 bln in december alone of course most invoices are not in yuan yet the exporters costs are so there is the conversion of export proceeds second and perhaps under appreciated is the outperformance of chinese stocks and bonds the csi 300 free float weighed index of 300 companies listed on the shanghai or shenzhen exchanges is up 1 1 for dollar based investors and chinese bonds have outperformed the other major bond markets the 10 year yield is off six basis points this year to 2 70 the us yield is up 24 bp to 1 75 this year the yield on the 10 year german bund is up almost 12 bp and at 0 13 the 10 year japanese government bond yield has doubled sure china s interest rate premium has narrowed which may exclude a market segment but other portfolio investors see value recall the us dollar low in 2018 was set in march near cny6 2430

school that did not have naloxone on hand city officials vowed wednesday to put the antidote in all city schools as part of a wider drug use and overdose prevention strategy naloxone should be available in all schools and there should be education on signs and symptoms of overdose and how to use this said dr craig allen vice president of addiction services for hartford healthcare s behavioral health network unfortunately a horrible incident like this happens and suddenly everyone s vision is 20 20 hartford mayor luke bronin said that because of the student s young age an opioid overdose did not immediately come to mind when the school nurse and first responders who did have naloxone treated him that s why city officials are also proposing more training and curriculum changes aimed at educating staffers students and community members in substance use awareness and prevention he said in response to the student s death advocacy groups are repeating calls they ve made for several years for schools to stock naloxone often delivered as a nasal spray under the brand name narcan and train educators support staff and students to recognize signs of opioid use and overdoses especially because younger people are falling victim more frequently the powerful opioid fentanyl has been showing up in marijuana illicit pills and other substances accessible to school age children experts say fatal overdoses in the u s are at record levels fueled by fentanyl and have been increasing among younger people national data shows the national association of school nurses has advocated for naloxone to be in all schools since 2015 and for school nurses to help educate their communities about the signs and symptoms of substance abuse it s a very unfortunate outcome linda mendonca the association s president said about the hartford student s death it brings us back to school preparedness and response plans having those in place is really critical the association created a tool kit for school nurses that includes information on administering naloxone and educating the community about opioid problems the kit has been downloaded from its website more than 49 000 times the group said ethan s run against addiction is one of many advocacy groups that weighed in on social media about the hartford student s death it is named after ethan monson dupuis a 25 year old wisconsin man who died of a heroin overdose in 2016 this tragedy is unbearable our nation s opioid crisis has reached into the lives of children into places where we want to assume that they are safe the group said in a facebook post thursday all public places including schools must have narcan available we need to educate kids on how to recognize someone who is overdosing and how to use narcan in addition to a nasal spray naloxone can also be given as an injection the national institute on drug abuse says it is a safe medicine and side effects are rare but warns it doesn t reverse overdoses from other drugs training is needed the agency says because sometimes more than one dose needs to be given and people who receive the drug can experience immediate withdrawal symptoms it s not clear how often overdoses happen in u s schools but experts and advocates say they are not common in late november two school resource officers and a school nurse were given naloxone after being exposed to the synthetic opioid carfentanil which was in a piece of paper found in a student s vape pen at sequoyah high school in madisonville tennessee according to local media reports the officers and nurse became lightheaded but recovered in 2019 high schools in the tucson arizona area began stocking naloxone in response to a student overdosing on opioids while in school emergency responders who were carrying the antidote revived the student media reports said there also is no national data on how many schools have naloxone or drug use awareness training programs that include recognizing the signs of an overdose in a survey of pennsylvania school nurses conducted in 2018 and published in 2020 more than half the 362 nurses who responded reported having naloxone in their schools according to the journal public health nursing about 5 of the nurses said naloxone had been administered in their school or at a school sponsored activity the most common reason for not having naloxone in schools included a lack of support and the belief it was not needed the survey showed drug use prevention is taught in many schools and there are an array of overdose awareness and naloxone administration programs offered by local health departments and advocacy groups in eastern tennessee the carter county drug prevention group has trained hundreds of children some as young as 6 on how to use naloxone via after school programs and other extracurricular gatherings in response to rising overdoses the new york times reported twenty states had laws allowing schools to possess and administer naloxone and seven others required schools to have naloxone use policies as of august 2020 according to the legislative analysis and public policy association a nonprofit research and policy advocacy group most of the laws require training on administering the antidote in response to record drug overdoses the national office of national drug control policy in november released a model law for states to consider aimed at expanding access to naloxone including in schools the hartford student fell ill jan 13 at the sport and medical sciences academy and died at a hospital two days later the teenager s name was not released two other students recovered after apparently being exposed to fentanyl and becoming ill officials said hartford police said they found about 40 small bags containing fentanyl in the school police are still investigating the overdose and the fentanyl s source remains unclear according to the centers for disease control and prevention the 15 to 24 age group saw the largest percentage increase in drug overdose death rates from 2019 to 2020 at 49 but had the second lowest overall rates among age groups
news analysis while the u s federal reserve and other central banks in the developed world are preparing to curb high inflation by winding down pandemic stimulus and raising interest rates chinese leader xi jinping is attempting to stimulate china s economy as he fears public unrest once economic and financial risks are mishandled they can easily be transmitted into the social and political sphere a recent statement by the central political and legal affairs commission of the chinese communist party ccp reads beijing claims that china s gross domestic product gdp rose by 8 1 percent in 2021 but that it s implementing expansionary monetary policy because growth in the final quarter of 2020 was only 4 percent well below the 5 percent level the ccp considers acceptable many experts believe that xi commanded interest rates to be cut in order to mend the economy and avoid social discord in 2021 xi implemented a number of policies that had a negative effect on the economy regulations intended to decrease pollution by restricting the use of coal caused manufacturing slowdowns while attempts to manage the price of electricity resulted in energy shortages for profit tutoring services were effectively outlawed wiping out hundreds of billions of dollars from the economy at the same time the ccp launched anti monopolistic regulations to rein in the disorderly expansion of capital these directives largely affected the tech and real estate sectors both of which are still suffering the ccp imposed curbs on overseas ipos and the cyberspace administration announced new rules requiring tech firms to seek approval for investment deals consequently china s tech sector stocks are down again real estate shares similarly took a nosedive in 2021 because xi cut off the taps to easy credit as the country moves into 2022 a depressed property sector is dragging down the rest of the economy in order to rejuvenate the real estate sector and hopefully revive the economy the ccp is easing its monetary policy lowering benchmark lending rates the central bank is decreasing the one year loan prime rate and one year medium term lending rate it s also cutting the five year loan prime rate which includes mortgages however in spite of cutting rates beijing is keeping the zero covid policy which is causing sporadic lockdowns restrictions and disruptions workers in protective suits stand at an entrance to a university s residential area under lockdown following the covid 19 outbreak in xi an shaanxi province china on dec 20 2021 china daily via reuters numerous large companies such as toyota volkswagen and samsung have reported suffering under covid restrictions quarantine measures disrupted shenzhou international group a textiles company that supplies nike adidas and uniqlo u s based company micron technology inc reported that lockdowns in xi an have reduced the number of workers on site which has affected the output of its dram memory chips the central political and legal affairs commission cautioned that with the economic downturn some deep seated problems may surface ccp officials have warned that unemployment among young people could cause dissent the jobless rate for those aged 15 to 24 increased to 14 6 percent in october 2021 likewise the number of migrant laborers who work in construction and manufacturing has decreased by 4 million since the pandemic began in a meeting chaired by xi in december 2021 the politburo identified economic stability as the top priority for 2022 china s central economic work conference report states that economic work next year must have stability as its watchword the central political and legal affairs commission stated if economic and financial risks are not handled properly they can be easily transmitted to social and political realms in an address at the davos economic forum on jan 17 xi told world leaders that supply chain disruptions and rising gas prices could cause instability he cited the example of kazakhstan where violence recently broke out because of general inflation and increased gas prices lowering interest rates is the ccp s attempt to fuel the economy and avoid negative fallout from two years of disastrous lawmaking he urged other countries particularly the united states not to raise interest rates this advice was given in spite of the fact that u s gdp growth exceeded pre covid 19 levels in the final quarter of 2021 the ccp may have a conflict of interest in recommending that other countries cut their interest rates however as the higher interest rates in the united states will draw foreign investment into the united states and away from china changes in lending interest rates may help stimulate china s housing market somewhat but other sectors are unlikely to recover as restrictions on the tech sector intensify the jobs won t come back similarly unless prohibitions are removed from the tutoring sector those jobs are gone forever the zero covid policy will continue to decimate the tourism sector removing any hope of recovery there investor and consumer confidence may not be sufficiently restored to invigorate the economy this is particularly true of those investors and consumers who have lost their jobs or their fortunes due to xi s policies views expressed in this article are opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of the epoch times

so who is the highest paid person in the government the answer may surprise you here s a hint it s not president joe biden who reportedly makes 400 000 a year as commander in chief so the question is who is it mark scribner managing director at oxygen financial tells newsy that this person is dr anthony fauci the director of the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases linsay tuchman so why does dr fauci make more money than the president of the united states mark scribner so his package it s about 440 000 a year and then he has a lifetime pension of 380 000 a year he is part of an old federal system i think there s only a handful of people still left it s called the csrs system and it was disbanded in 1987 so he s part of an old package that was not very effective for pensions that was costing the government way too much money so they stopped it but he s still on that program tuchman so and in part has to do with just his longevity of serving in the position that he s in scribner you know i m a financial advisor i have clients that work for the fbi atf and they ve had the same tenure in terms of length of service they don t have those kinds of packages they are you know maybe 80 000 a year in pensions they have a million dollars in their retirement accounts dr fauci has about 10 4 million in his investment accounts so there s definitely a disparity tuchman interesting so as we re talking about government employees making money there s the salary of course but we ve also seen politicians on both sides of the aisle profiting off of the stock market and sometimes it s due to some information that they have or something that they know about and that of course faces a lot of criticism what are your thoughts on making sure that doesn t happen in any sort of way that could be seen as something to be criticized scribner well for your viewers there s a great website called unusual whales and it goes through each politician and it s not a it s not a red or blue type of a topic it s all across the board but they are definitely having access to inside information now i m a financial advisor and there s a term called front running that basically prohibits us from buying an individual stock for our own accounts ahead of a client account but they have access to trade deals all kinds of big announcements and they buy individual stocks and this was something that was attempted to be resolved and it s called the stock act it got watered down in 2013 but they are buying ahead of you know some major announcements major trade deals and it actually ruins the integrity of the market when you know they have access to inside information that the average person can t it s completely unacceptable and i think it just erodes trust for the consumers

dave collins the associated press hartford conn the death of a 13 year old student who apparently overdosed on fentanyl at his connecticut school has drawn renewed pleas for schools to stock the opioid antidote naloxone as well as for training of both staffers and children on how to recognize and respond to overdoses the seventh grader died jan 15 after falling ill at a hartford school that did not have naloxone on hand city officials vowed wednesday to put the antidote in all city schools as part of a wider drug use and overdose prevention strategy naloxone should be available in all schools and there should be education on signs and symptoms of overdose and how to use this said dr craig allen vice president of addiction services for hartford healthcare s behavioral health network unfortunately a horrible incident like this happens and suddenly everyone s vision is 20 20 hartford mayor luke bronin said that because of the student s young age an opioid overdose did not immediately come to mind when the school nurse and first responders who did have naloxone treated him training and awareness that s why city officials are also proposing more training and curriculum changes aimed at educating staffers students and community members in substance use awareness and prevention he said in response to the student s death advocacy groups are repeating calls they ve made for several years for schools to stock naloxone often delivered as a nasal spray under the brand name narcan and train educators support staff and students to recognize signs of opioid use and overdoses especially because younger people are falling victim more frequently the powerful opioid fentanyl has been showing up in marijuana illicit pills and other substances accessible to school age children experts say fatal overdoses in the u s are at record levels fueled by fentanyl and have been increasing among younger people national data shows a tool kit the national association of school nurses has advocated for naloxone in all schools since 2015 and for school nurses to help educate their communities about the signs and symptoms of substance abuse it s a very unfortunate outcome linda mendonca the association s president said about the hartford student s death it brings us back to school preparedness and response plans having those in place is really critical the association created a tool kit for school nurses that includes information on administering naloxone and educating the community about opioid problems the kit has been downloaded from its website more than 49 000 times the group said ethan s run against addiction is one of many advocacy groups that weighed in on social media about the hartford student s death it is named after ethan monson dupuis a 25 year old wisconsin man who died of a heroin overdose in 2016 this tragedy is unbearable our nation s opioid crisis has reached into the lives of children into places where we want to assume that they are safe the group said in a facebook post thursday all public places including schools must have narcan available we need to educate kids on how to recognize someone who is overdosing and how to use narcan in addition to a nasal spray naloxone can also be given as an injection the national institute on drug abuse says it is a safe medicine and side effects are rare but warns it doesn t reverse overdoses from other drugs training is needed the agency says because sometimes more than one dose needs to be given and people who receive the drug can experience immediate withdrawal symptoms it s not clear how often overdoses happen in u s schools but experts and advocates say they are not common in late november two school resource officers and a school nurse were given naloxone after being exposed to the synthetic opioid carfentanil which was in a piece of paper found in a student s vape pen at sequoyah high school in madisonville tennessee according to local media reports the officers and nurse became lightheaded but recovered in 2019 high schools in the tucson arizona area began stocking naloxone in response to a student overdosing on opioids while in school emergency responders who were carrying the antidote revived the student media reports said there also is no national data on how many schools have naloxone or drug use awareness training programs that include recognizing the signs of an overdose in a survey of pennsylvania school nurses conducted in 2018 and published in 2020 more than half the 362 nurses who responded reported having naloxone in their schools according to the journal public health nursing about 5 of the nurses said naloxone had been administered in their school or at a school sponsored activity the most common reason for not having naloxone in schools included a lack of support and the belief it was not needed the survey showed drug use prevention is taught in many schools and there are an array of overdose awareness and naloxone administration programs offered by local health departments and advocacy groups in eastern tennessee the carter county drug prevention group has trained hundreds of children some as young as 6 on how to use naloxone via after school programs and other extracurricular gatherings in response to rising overdoses the new york times reported twenty states had laws allowing schools to possess and administer naloxone and seven others required schools to have naloxone use policies as of august 2020 according to the legislative analysis and public policy association a nonprofit research and policy advocacy group most of the laws require training on administering the antidote in response to record drug overdoses the national office of national drug control policy in november released a model law for states to consider aimed at expanding access to naloxone including in schools the hartford student fell ill jan 13 at the sport and medical sciences academy and died at a hospital two days later the teenager s name was not released two other students recovered after apparently being exposed to fentanyl and becoming ill officials said hartford police said they found about 40 small bags containing fentanyl in the school police are still investigating the overdose and the fentanyl s source remains unclear according to the centers for disease control and prevention the 15 to 24 age group saw the largest percentage increase in drug overdose death rates from 2019 to 2020 at 49 but had the second lowest overall rates among age groups for the first time last year u s overdoses deaths topped an estimated 100 000 in a one year period with many of the deaths linked to illicit fentanyl

the oil market is already looking beyond omicron 01 24 2022 by ricardo perez news january 23 2022 we are halfway through the first month of the new year and oil s bull run is showing no signs of slowing oil futures have vaulted 12 in the first two trading weeks of the new year boosted by several catalysts including supply constraints worries of a russian attack on neighboring ukraine and growing signs the omicron variant won t be as disruptive as feared brent crude futures settled 1 59 or 1 9 higher in friday s session at a 2 1 2 month high of 86 06 a barrel gaining 5 4 in the week while u s west texas intermediate crude gained 1 70 or 2 1 to 83 82 per barrel rising 6 3 in the week both brent and wti futures have now entered overbought territory for the first time since late october people looking at the big picture realize that the global supply versus demand situation is very tight and that s giving the market a solid boost phil flynn senior analyst at price futures group has told reuters when you consider that opec is still nowhere near pumping to its overall quota this narrowing cushion could turn out to be the most bullish factor for oil prices over the coming months pvm analyst stephen brennock has said indeed several banks have forecast oil prices of 100 a barrel this year with demand expected to outstrip supply thanks in large part to opec s limited capacity morgan stanley predicts that brent crude will hit 90 a barrel in the third quarter of this year while jpmorgan has forecast oil to hit 125 a barrel this year and 150 in 2023 meanwhile rystad energy s senior vice president of analysis claudio galimberti says if opec was disciplined and wanted to keep the market tight it could boost prices to 100 opec has lately come under pressure to ramp up production at a faster clip from several quarters including the biden administration so as to ease supply shortages and rein in spiraling oil prices but the organization is scared of spoiling the oil price party by making any sudden or big moves with last year s oil price collapse still fresh on its mind but maybe we have been overestimating how much power the cartel has to jack up production on the fly according to a recent report at the moment just a handful of opec members are capable of meeting higher production quotas compared to their current clips amrita sen of energy aspects has told reuters that only saudi arabia the united arab emirates kuwait iraq and azerbaijan are in a position to boost their production to meet set opec quotas while the other eight members are likely to struggle due to sharp declines in production and years of underinvestment underinvestments stalling recovery according to the report africa s oil giants nigeria and angola are the hardest hit with the pair having pumped an average of 276kbpd below their quotas for more than a year now the two nations have a combined opec quota of 2 83 million bpd according to refinitiv data but nigeria has failed to meet its quota since july last year and angola since september 2020 in nigeria five onshore export terminals run by oil majors with an average production clip of 900 000 bpd handled 20 less oil in july than the same time last year despite relaxed quotas the declines are due to lower production from all the onshore fields that feed the five terminals in fact only french oil major totalenergies nyse tte new deep offshore oilfield and export terminal egina has been able to quickly ramp up production turning the taps back on has been proving to be a bigger challenge than earlier thought due to a shortage of workers huge maintenance backlogs and tight cash flows indeed it could take at least two quarters before most companies can work through their maintenance backlogs which cover everything from servicing wells to replacing valves pumps and pipeline sections many companies have also fallen behind on plans to do supplementary drilling to keep production stable angola has not been faring any better in june angola s oil minister diamantino azevedo lowered its targeted oil output for 2021 to 1 19 million bpd citing production declines at mature fields drilling delays due to covid 19 and technical and financial challenges in deepwater oil exploration that s nearly 11 below its 1 33 million bpd opec quota and a far cry from its record peak above 1 8 million bpd in 2008 the southern african nation has struggled for years as its oil fields steadily declined while exploration and drilling budgets failed to keep up angola s largest fields began production about two decades ago and many are now past their peaks two years ago the country adopted a string of reforms aimed at boosting exploration including allowing companies to produce from marginal fields adjacent to those they already operate unfortunately the pandemic has stunted the impact of those reforms and not a single drilling rig was operational in the country by may the first time this has happened in 40 years so far just three offshore rigs have resumed work shale decline but it s not just opec producers that are struggling to boost oil production in an excellent op ed vice chairman of ihs markit dan yergin observes that it s almost inevitable that shale output will go in reverse and decline thanks to drastic cutbacks in investment and only later recover at a slow pace shale oil wells decline at an exceptionally fast clip and therefore require constant drilling to replenish lost supply indeed norway based energy consultancy rystad energy recently warned that big oil could see its proven reserves run out in less than 15 years thanks to produced volumes not being fully replaced with new discoveries according to rystad proven oil and gas reserves by the so called big oil companies namely exxonmobil bp plc nyse bp shell nyse rds a chevron nyse cvx totalenergies se nyse tte and eni s p a nyse e are all falling as produced volumes are not being fully replaced with new discoveries granted this is more of a long term problem whose effects might not be felt soon however with the rising sentiment against oil and gas investments it s going to be hard to change this trend experts are warning that the fossil fuel sector could remain depressed thanks to a big nemesis the trillion dollar esg megatrend there s growing evidence that companies with low esg scores are paying the price and are increasingly being shunned by the investing community according to morningstar research esg investments hit a record 1 65 trillion in 2020 with the world s largest fund manager blackrock inc nyse blk with 9 trillion in assets under management aum throwing its weight behind esg and oil and gas divestitures michael shaoul chairman and chief executive officer of marketfield asset management has told bloomberg tv that esg is largely responsible for lagging oil and gas investments energy equities are nowhere close to where they were in 2014 when crude oil prices were at current levels there are a couple very good reasons for that one is it s been a terrible place to be for a decade and the other reason is the esg pressures that a lot of institutional managers are on lead them to want to underplay investment in a lot of these areas in fact u s shale companies are now facing a real dilemma after disavowing new drilling and prioritizing dividends and debt paydowns yet their inventories of productive wells continue falling off a cliff according to the u s energy information administration the united states had 5 957 drilled but uncompleted wells ducs in july 2021 the lowest for any month since november 2017 from nearly 8 900 at its 2019 peak at this rate shale producers will have to sharply ramp up the drilling of new wells just to maintain the current production clip if we need any more proof that shale drillers are sticking to their newfound psychology of discipline there is recent data from the eia that data shows a sharp decline in ducs in most major u s onshore oil producing regions this in turn points to more well completions but less new well drilling activity it s true that higher completion rates have been leading to an uptick in oil production particularly in the permian however those completions have sharply lowered duc inventories which could limit oil production growth in the united states in the coming months that also means that spending will have to increase if we are to see shale keep pace with production declines more will have to come online and that means more money 7 000 terminals as per the date of this article click

after a 13 year old apparently overdosed on fentanyl at a hartford school advocacy groups are calling for more schools to stock the opioid antidote example video title will go here for this video example video title will go here for this video hartford conn the death of a 13 year old student who apparently overdosed on fentanyl at his connecticut school has drawn renewed pleas for schools to stock the opioid antidote naloxone as well as for training of both staffers and children on how to recognize and respond to overdoses the seventh grader died jan 15 after falling ill at a hartford school that did not have naloxone on hand city officials vowed wednesday to put the antidote in all city schools as part of a wider drug use and overdose prevention strategy naloxone should be available in all schools and there should be education on signs and symptoms of overdose and how to use this said dr craig allen vice president of addiction services for hartford healthcare s behavioral health network unfortunately a horrible incident like this happens and suddenly everyone s vision is 20 20 hartford mayor luke bronin said that because of the student s young age an opioid overdose did not immediately come to mind when the school nurse and first responders who did have naloxone treated him that s why city officials are also proposing more training and curriculum changes aimed at educating staffers students and community members in substance use awareness and prevention he said in response to the student s death advocacy groups are repeating calls they ve made for several years for schools to stock naloxone often delivered as a nasal spray under the brand name narcan and train educators support staff and students to recognize signs of opioid use and overdoses especially because younger people are falling victim more frequently the powerful opioid fentanyl has been showing up in marijuana illicit pills and other substances accessible to school age children experts say fatal overdoses in the u s are at record levels fueled by fentanyl and have been increasing among younger people national data shows the national association of school nurses has advocated for naloxone to be in all schools since 2015 and for school nurses to help educate their communities about the signs and symptoms of substance abuse it s a very unfortunate outcome linda mendonca the association s president said about the hartford student s death it brings us back to school preparedness and response plans having those in place is really critical the association created a tool kit for school nurses that includes information on administering naloxone and educating the community about opioid problems the kit has been downloaded from its website more than 49 000 times the group said ethan s run against addiction is one of many advocacy groups that weighed in on social media about the hartford student s death it is named after ethan monson dupuis a 25 year old wisconsin man who died of a heroin overdose in 2016 this tragedy is unbearable our nation s opioid crisis has reached into the lives of children into places where we want to assume that they are safe the group said in a facebook post thursday all public places including schools must have narcan available we need to educate kids on how to recognize someone who is overdosing and how to use narcan in addition to a nasal spray naloxone can also be given as an injection the national institute on drug abuse says it is a safe medicine and side effects are rare but warns it doesn t reverse overdoses from other drugs training is needed the agency says because sometimes more than one dose needs to be given and people who receive the drug can experience immediate withdrawal symptoms it s not clear how often overdoses happen in u s schools but experts and advocates say they are not common in late november two school resource officers and a school nurse were given naloxone after being exposed to the synthetic opioid carfentanil which was in a piece of paper found in a student s vape pen at sequoyah high school in madisonville tennessee according to local media reports the officers and nurse became lightheaded but recovered in 2019 high schools in the tucson arizona area began stocking naloxone in response to a student overdosing on opioids while in school emergency responders who were carrying the antidote revived the student media reports said there also is no national data on how many schools have naloxone or drug use awareness training programs that include recognizing the signs of an overdose in a survey of pennsylvania school nurses conducted in 2018 and published in 2020 more than half the 362 nurses who responded reported having naloxone in their schools according to the journal public health nursing about 5 of the nurses said naloxone had been administered in their school or at a school sponsored activity the most common reason for not having naloxone in schools included a lack of support and the belief it was not needed the survey showed drug use prevention is taught in many schools and there are an array of overdose awareness and naloxone administration programs offered by local health departments and advocacy groups in eastern tennessee the carter county drug prevention group has trained hundreds of children some as young as 6 on how to use naloxone via after school programs and other extracurricular gatherings in response to rising overdoses the new york times reported twenty states had laws allowing schools to possess and administer naloxone and seven others required schools to have naloxone use policies as of august 2020 according to the legislative analysis and public policy association a nonprofit research and policy advocacy group most of the laws require training on administering the antidote in response to record drug overdoses the national office of national drug control policy in november released a model law for states to consider aimed at expanding access to naloxone including in schools the hartford student fell ill jan 13 at the sport and medical sciences academy and died at a hospital two days later the teenager s name was not released two other students recovered after apparently being exposed to fentanyl and becoming ill officials said hartford police said they found about 40 small bags containing fentanyl in the school police are still investigating the overdose and the fentanyl s source remains unclear according to the centers for disease control and prevention the 15 to 24 age group saw the largest percentage increase in drug overdose death rates from 2019 to 2020 at 49 but had the second lowest overall rates among age groups
on a chilly tuesday afternoon this month james marsh stopped by a chipotle near his suburban chicago home to grab something to eat it had been a while since marsh had been to chipotle he estimated he goes five times a year and he stopped cold when he saw the prices i had been getting my usual a steak burrito which had been maybe in the mid 8 range said marsh who trades stock options at his home in hinsdale illinois now it was more than 9 advertisement article continues below this ad he walked out i figured i d find something at home he said the pandemic has led to price spikes in everything from pizza slices in new york to sides of beef in colorado and it has led to more expensive items on the menus at fast food chains traditionally establishments where people are used to grabbing a quick bite that does not hurt their wallet at a chipotle in costa mesa california the price of a chicken burrito nothing fancy hold the guacamole about a year ago was 7 25 these days that same burrito costs around 7 95 according to price data collected by analysts in ann arbor michigan a shackburger at shake shack used to cost 5 69 now it s 6 09 and in oklahoma city an order of 50 bone in wings from wingstop that cost 41 99 early last year is now 47 49 a 13 increase last year the price of menu items at fast food restaurants rose 8 the biggest jump in more than 20 years according to government data and in some cases portions have shrunk advertisement article continues below this ad in recent years most fast food restaurants had maybe raised prices in the low single digits each year said matthew goodman an analyst at m science an alternative data research and analytics firm what we ve seen over the last six plus months are restaurants being aggressive in pushing through prices this comes at a time when the hypercompetitive fast food market is booming chains like mcdonald s chipotle and wingstop were big winners of the pandemic as consumers stuck at home working and tired of cooking multiple meals for their families increasingly turned to them for convenient solutions but in the past year as the cost of ingredients rose and the average hourly wage increased 16 to 16 10 in november from a year earlier according to government data restaurants began to quietly bump up prices but making customers pay more for a burger or a burrito is a tricky art for many restaurants it involves complex algorithms and test markets they need to walk a fine line between raising prices enough to cover expenses while not scaring away customers moreover there is not a one size fits all approach chains that are operated by franchisees typically allow individual owners to decide pricing and national chains like chipotle and shake shack charge different prices in various parts of the country when carrols restaurant group which operates more than 1 000 burger kings raised prices in the second half of last year the number of customers actually improved from the third to the fourth quarter over time we generally have not seen a whole lot of pushback from consumers on the higher prices carrols ceo daniel t accordino told analysts at a conference in early january advertisement article continues below this ad menu prices are likely to continue to climb this year many restaurants say they are still paying higher wages to attract employees and expect food prices to rise we expect unprecedented increases in our food basket costs versus 2021 ritch allison ceo of domino s pizza told wall street analysts at a conference this month while domino s has not raised prices it is altering its promotions offering the 7 99 pizza deal only to customers ordering online and shrinking the number of chicken wings in certain promotions to eight from 10 in an effort to maintain profit margins despite the higher food and labor costs some restaurants are seeing sales and profits rebound past pre pandemic levels when mcdonald s reports earnings this month wall street analysts expect that its revenues will have hit a five year high of more than 23 billion a 2 billion increase from 2019 net income is predicted to top 7 billion up from 6 billion in 2019 other chains like cracker barrel and darden restaurants which owns olive garden and longhorn steakhouse have resumed dividend payments or cash buybacks of stock after suspending those activities early in the pandemic to conserve cash and next month when chipotle reports results for 2021 analysts expect revenues to top 7 5 billion a 34 jump from 2019 net income is expected to almost double from pre pandemic levels in the third quarter the company repurchased nearly 100 million of its stock chipotle declined to make an executive available for an interview citing the quiet period before its earnings release advertisement article continues below this ad while chipotle executives blamed higher labor costs for a 4 price increase in menu items this past summer the company has been looking for ways to boost its profitability one way was to charge higher prices for delivery delivery orders through vendors like doordash and uber eats exploded for chipotle and other fast food chains during the pandemic but so did the commission fees that chipotle paid the vendors so in fall 2020 it began running tests to see what would happen if it raised the prices of burritos and guacamole and chips that customers ordered for delivery executives told wall street analysts in an earnings call it essentially meant the customer covered chipotle s side of the delivery costs the company discovered customers were willing to pay for the convenience of delivery now customers ordering chipotle for delivery pay about 21 more than if they had ordered and picked the food up in the stores according to an analysis by jeff farmer an analyst at gordon haskett research advisors i would say that our ultimate goal so this would be over the long term maybe the medium term is to fully protect our margins jack hartung the chief financial officer of chipotle said on a call with wall street analysts last fall when you look at our pricing versus other restaurant companies for the quality of the food the quantity of the food and the quality and convenience of the experience we offer great value so we believe we have room to fully protect the margin that does not mean customers are thrilled about the extra costs advertisement article continues below this ad this month jacob herlin a data scientist in lakewood colorado placed an order a steak and guacamole burrito for 11 95 a coca cola for 3 and chips and guacamole which were free with a birthday coupon the total was 14 95 before tax but when he clicked to have the food delivered the price for the burrito jumped to 14 45 and the soda climbed to 3 65 bringing the total to 18 10 before tax 21 more than if he had picked the food up himself there was more herlin was charged a delivery fee of 1 and a service fee of 2 32 bringing the total for the delivered meal to 23 20 he tipped the driver an additional 3 herlin said he did not mind paying for delivery and wanted drivers to be paid a decent wage but he felt that chipotle was not being upfront with customers about the added costs they re basically hiding the fees two different ways through that base price increase and through the hidden service fee herlin said in an email i would very much prefer if they had the same pricing and were just honest about a 5 delivery fee

the power and poison of modern monetary theory when democratic senator joe manchin announced that he would not support the build back better act effectively dooming us president joe biden s signature legislative initiative he cited america s staggering debt his concerns echoed those of the president s republican opponents who insist that all that spending would expand the deficit and leave future generations groaning under the weight of a heavy tax burden but would it proponents of modern monetary theory mmt would beg to differ detractors of the build back better act subscribe to the conventional ricardian economic assumption that over time a government must balance its budget just like a private firm but mmt holds that as long as debt is denominated in a country s own currency its government cannot default yes excessive government spending can fuel inflation but as long as prices are stable governments can spend away using fiscal deficits rather than tax revenues to support employment and finance public goods while mmt is not new it has been gaining traction in recent years and a significant share of its followers come across almost as zealots unwilling to brook any dissent but mainstream economists largely regard mmt as tantamount to professional heresy such rigid stances have not lent themselves to productive discussion this is a pity because mmt includes both problematic propositions and perfectly reasonable even highly useful positions in the latter category the idea that stands out is essentially functional finance theory fft first proposed by abba lerner in 1943 it holds that because governments borrowing in their own currency can always print money to service their debts but still face inflation risks they should aim to balance supply and demand at full employment rather than fret about balancing the budget in lerner s view well targeted deficit spending is an effective way for governments to maintain prosperity fft supports the case for build back better which includes spending on goods like education infrastructure and the green transition the biden administration claims the act would be financed entirely with tax revenues but even if that turned out not to be the case as detractors predict wouldn t inadequate infrastructure depleted human capital and a planet ravaged by climate change hurt future generations more to be sure us policymakers broadly recognise the importance of such investments especially in infrastructure congress recently passed with bipartisan support a us 1 trillion spending plan that aims to advance objectives like overhauling the electricity grid upgrading railways and expanding high speed internet but even some democrats demanded that the new funds contained in the package be entirely offset by new tax revenue a development that highlights enduring resistance to the logic of mmt or fft and yet as james mackintosh argued recently in the wall street journal this may be largely a rhetorical issue after all he notes the infrastructure act is in fact debt financed anyway and it may well be that even if many of build back better s supporters are not convinced by biden s claims that tax revenues will offset the new spending they are not that concerned about it but mmt and fft are not synonymous mmt includes two additional propositions that in my view are unsound the first is that monetary policy should be conducted in such a way that it facilitates fiscal policy decisions such as by maintaining a constant very low interest rate this expresses a crucial feature of post keynesian economics interest rates rather than money supply are the key variables this defies conventional economic thinking which focuses on the interaction of stock and flow variables and the role of expectations more important if interest rates are held constant and prices start to rise inflation could snowball mmt proponents would advocate tax hikes as a way to manage aggregate demand and control inflation but given what we know about asset dynamics this would be a hard sell mmt s second problematic proposition that governments should provide a job guarantee in order to maintain full employment while mitigating inflationary pressures is even harder to defend it simply moves too far in the direction of socialist labour allocation and enables governments to wield excessive control over wages when i explained mmt to former japanese prime minister shinzo abe he compared it to preparing fugu if done correctly the puffer fish is a sublime delicacy but if the chef makes even a minor mistake the diner could suffer a rapid and painful death it is an apt metaphor if policymakers adopt the positive elements of mmt essentially fft they will gain new options for bolstering prosperity for current and future generations but one wrong cut and the results could be fatal
sophia song started sophia s kitchen four years ago as a hobby that grew out of her love for baking cinnamon rolls specifically a series of serendipitous events found her baking tamales a highly sought after product that helped her gain a lot of traction in the mexican and american shanghai expat communities craving a taste of home we sat down with sophia to learn more about how a northern chinese girl got into baking cinnamon rolls pies cakes breads and of course tamales ones that many agree are some of the most authentic you can find in china image courtesy of sophia s kitchen what is your background and how did you get into baking i was born and grew up in northern china i always had a passion for food and grew out of my mom s recipes searching for something different from a young age while my friends went shopping or hung out on the weekends i looked up recipes online i started cooking at home and eventually after studying business english in university gained access to an oven where my love for baking truly started i always wanted to keep it just as a hobby in 2016 i worked at hyatt and the head pastry chef asked if i wanted to join her team but ultimately i refused wanting to pursue my interest in my own way image courtesy of sophia s kitchen what was the inspiration for starting sophia s kitchen at the beginning of 2017 i traveled to the philippines and tasted cinnabon for the first time i instantly fell in love and after returning to china and trying to messily sneak some in my suitcase i couldn t stop thinking about them then and there i decided i needed to share my love on cinnamon rolls with china i tried out different recipes and shared them with my eager to taste friends based on the positive feedback i got from everyone i ultimately decided to quit my job and pursue baking full time even though many people in my life thought i was crazy how was i going to find a customer base i started advertising on chinese platforms but i found that most chinese people don t know what cinnamon rolls are so i changed my tactic to facebook groups and the expats living in china responded in droves initially i was baking at home but after a year of dealing with a neighbor complaining about me baking at all hours i moved to an official store and named it sophia s kitchen image by sophie steiner that s why do you focus primarily on tamales to clarify i have never actually been to america or mexico before however one of my mexican american friends taught me to make his favorite food from home and i instantly fell in love with tamales about a month after starting my baking business i made tamales and posted about them online immediately many of my customers reached out to see how they could purchase them over time i perfected my recipe added in a variety of different flavor profiles like mole green and red salsa jalapeño and cheese guava cream cheese etc and my business began to grow rapidly i realized that while cinnamon rolls are a sweet treat for sometimes people love to stock up on tamales that can be stored easily and prepared quickly when people don t have time to cook an entire meal tamales soon overtook my baking business as my most highly demanded product and that s the story of how a chinese girl brought a love for tamales to china despite never having tasted the real deal herself image courtesy of sophia s kitchen image courtesy of sophia s kitchen what other products do you bake cook throughout the year and sell i like to keep a tight menu to ensure that all products have the highest quality and best taste i mostly focus on tamales and cinnamon rolls this year i started selling a few different kinds of pies around the holidays as well as seasonal products like conchas pan de muerto for the day of the dead celebration in mexico and rosca de reyes for the dia de los reyes celebration in mexico image by sophie steiner that s where did you learn to cook bake my customers often ask me this and the answer is quite simple i m neither a professionally trained cook nor baker i just have a strong passion for baking that expands out into searching and testing out recipes i spend most of my free time watching youtube videos about baking and cooking and combine the good ones to make my own recipes funnily enough i have never actually tried tamales outside of my own cooking of them i just used the feedback from customers and ended up with a product that everyone says reminds them of home image courtesy of sophia s kitchen how do you source the ingredients for making your tamales the most important ingredient is maseca which is the corn flour for the tamle dough when i started in 2017 there was only one imported brand available in china red mill and it was so expensive and there wasn t a stable flow of it so many times i was left with no available product also for the mexican chilis it was nearly impossible to source them many of my customers would bring me back bags full of dried chilis from the usa and exchange them with me for more tamales a pretty good deal if you ask me after a year i found a reliable supplier they even sell mexican chilis my biggest issue still is price fluctuation but i have been able to source much better than when i first started image courtesy of sophia s kitchen what challenges have you faced in growing this business my biggest challenge is ingredient supply because the key ingredients are imported there are steep markups on these products that have only gotten more drastic because of covid slow shipment also caused my supplier to run out of stock for nearly three months last year and recently butter prices have increased 50 all of these fluctuations affect my ability to serve my customer base but for the most part people are understanding there have been times that i have felt discouraged but many of my regular customers have consistently thanked me for providing them with a taste of home and that encouragement gives me the strength to keep doing it despite a few grumpy customers along the way image courtesy of sophia s kitchen how has your business grown or changed throughout covid i think most businesses have faced problems during covid especially those like mine that rely on a mainly expat customer base in the past two years i ve had some customers that couldn t return to china and many others left but this pushes me to try out new marketing avenues and reach new people as well as trying out new products image courtesy of sophia s kitchen what would you like sophia s kitchen to grow into in the upcoming years when i started sophia s kitchen i only thought of it as a hobby i did not expect it to grow into a real business that has survived four years already but my goal for the business is still the same as it was at its inception i want everyone who tries my products to enjoy them in the future i want to make sure that goal stays at the forefront of my mind i don t want to grow so big that it sacrifices quality or the personal connection i have with my customers i want to continue growing my customer base trying out new products but most importantly i want to maintain the core business i have now image by sophie steiner that s how can tamale lovers around china purchase your products i use sf express to deliver all products as they have the best and fastest service this september i designed a wechat mini app for sophia s kitchen so anyone in china can see the product offerings and purchase directly through wechat for those who prefer to place the order directly with me they can

presidents are different from you and me but it is not their power that makes them different or their money or their perks take away those things and they would still be different one thing makes them different their drive thursday april 16 1953 was going to be a crazy day anyway one of those days only presidents put themselves through first ike would have to fly from augusta georgia to washington he was in augusta playing golf of course to give a big speech about foreign policy then there would be a limousine caravan a couple of ceremonial appearances another speech or two and finally the flight back to augusta it was an especially crazy day for a president as old as ike he was sixty two then and for a man with his medical history in 1949 though the voters never heard about it he d had what apparently was a mild heart attack as he eventually was to admit this was in 1967 long after he was out of politics he had been so ill in 49 my physician treated me as though i were at the end of the precipice and teetering a bit then the night before leaving for his trip up to washington he was awakened by sharp pains in his chest for a couple of hours he just tossed and turned then he called over mamie who was sleeping in another bed finally he called in howard snyder his personal physician snyder at first guessed it might be food poisoning and gave ike a tonic to counteract the poison subsequently snyder was to change his mind and conclude it was probably ileitis a painful abdominal illness caused by the accumulation of rough food in the small intestine which wasn t a bad guess a few years later ike was to suffer from ileitis and would have to undergo an emergency operation to remove a stubborn blockage but his problem this time wasn t ileitis it was his heart again he d suffered a mild heart attack his second counting the incident in 1949 unfortunately the doctor misdiagnosed ike though the signs would have been obvious to a heart specialist snyder wasn t a heart specialist whatever the problem ike was obviously in terrible pain and should of course immediately have been whisked to the hospital for an examination that was common sense a guy who made a buck an hour would have been sent to the hospital if he were suffering intense chest pains so certainly eisenhower should have he was after all the president of the united states leader of the free world the man with his finger on the button only the thing is a president can t just up and go to the hospital when he s sick like it s no big deal everything a president does is a big deal if he sneezes people take notice if he vomits in the lap of a japanese official at a diplomatic dinner as george bush was to do the stock market may even take a dive when in 1955 ike was to suffer his big heart attack the market would drop more than it had since the crash of 1929 and ike wasn t just sneezing he had chest pains go to the hospital with chest pains and the whole world would be alarmed there d be news bulletins special newspaper editions press conferences with doctors and specialists it d be a media circus so although ike should of course have gone to the hospital he didn t of course actually go a president only goes to the hospital when he absolutely has to besides there were political reasons for not going ike had been president just three months go to the hospital and there d be questions about his ability to finish out his term there already was a lot of loose talk that his age made him too old to be an effective president because the attack had occurred while he was on vacation people would think that he wasn t even up to golfing oh nobody would say it out loud ike was a war hero people respected him for the service he d given the country and everybody liked him smiling ike what was there not to like but people would be thinking maybe he is too old simply too old roosevelt after all had died when he was sixty three ike was now sixty two of course he would have to cancel his schedule that crazy presidential schedule he had only the thing is a president can t just cancel his schedule and announce he needs a rest anymore than he simply can decide to go to the hospital with chest pains once a president announces he s going somewhere he usually has to go especially if he s set to give a big speech and ike was stalin had died the month before and eisenhower wanted to extend an olive branch to the leaders who replaced him cancel any speech and there d be questions cancel this speech which had been advertised in advance and the world would wonder what was going on inside this new administration was ike really sick or was he having trouble deciding on a policy toward the soviet union was his administration s foreign policy in disarray the fact was his foreign policy was in disarray ike wanted to commit the united states to world disarmament negotiation and peace and his secretary of state john foster dulles did not just a few days earlier ike had exploded in anger at dulles s opposition all right then he had said if mr dulles and all his sophisticated advisers really mean they can not talk peace seriously then i am in the wrong pew for if it s war we should be talking about i know the people to give me advice on that and they re not in the state department now either we cut out all this fooling around and make a serious bid for peace or we forget the whole thing so although ike should of course have canceled his schedule he didn t of course actually do it the funny thing was he didn t even want to it was a challenge to go and ike loved challenges the more difficult a task the better he liked it so he went it appealed to his sense of duty and ike had a powerfully strong sense of duty convince him that he had a duty to do something and ike would always do it no matter how arduous he had to work no matter how great a sacrifice he had to make wednesday the day before his heart attack had been an easy day for ike as robert caro might put it a day spent on the links but thursday was to be a hard day that morning just hours after the attack in tremendous pain he dressed ate breakfast and boarded a plane for washington it was a difficult flight when he had first got on he was in pain but hopeful the pain would subside but instead of easing it grew worse by the time he reached the statler hotel where he was to give his address at noon he could barely stand he had been given medicines and sedatives but they hadn t worked they couldn t they were prescribed for a patient suffering from food poisoning and ike hadn t had food poisoning he d had a heart attack heart medicine probably would have helped but he hadn t been given heart medicine because nobody realized he had heart pain from the very beginning of the speech it was obvious to the audience that eisenhower was having difficulty delivering it and then it became more obvious the pain became so great ike recalled that it caused heavy perspiration on my face and head then he began suffering chills of a very disturbing kind then his voice actually started to falter a friend bobby cutler his national security adviser noticed his hands they were gripping the lectern so tightly it appeared he actually needed the structure to keep from falling over somewhere in the middle of the speech it occurred to eisenhower that he might actually not be able to finish it that he might even collapse he was feeling dizzy at times i became so dizzy that i feared i would faint i could concentrate on the text only by supreme effort so he started skipping whole paragraphs but he wouldn t stop wouldn t even think of stopping and eventually he made it to the end given all that was at stake it was perhaps understandable that eisenhower felt compelled to make his speech but what took place next was inexplicable truly crazy really instead of suspending the rest of his thursday schedule ike kept strictly to it he was ill he knew he was ill but seemingly he wanted to pretend he was not and somewhere inside himself he found the drive to keep going sticking to the schedule would be difficult for thursday was not only a hard day it was a long day a very long day it had started early in the morning in augusta georgia then ike had flown to washington and now he was to travel to the capital s griffith stadium it had been a tradition since william howard taft for the president to throw out the first ball at the opening season of the american league and ike felt since my promise had been given weeks ahead it would be putting too important an interpretation on what i thought was a temporary illness if i should cancel the engagement but then he had gone ahead and thrown out not just one ball but two balls the first a long and high throw to an outfielder and then he continued on he boarded his plane again and flew down to salisbury north carolina whatever his reason for keeping his date with the american league he had no real reason to keep his date with salisbury he was there after all to celebrate the 200th anniversary of rowan county but he kept it he even gave a little speech there then he took yet one more plane ride this time to return to augusta where his long hard day had begun in the course of twelve hours he had taken three plane rides crossed seven states and made two speeches and all this just hours after suffering a heart attack upon returning he did of course collapse the administration spokesman insisted to reporters that the president was only suffering from food poisoning nothing serious boys just a little ole case of food poisoning everybody can just relax ike s doing fine just fine for several days ike lay in bed recuperating fortunately it had been a mild enough heart attack that he didn t need months of relaxation as he had in 49 inside of a week he was up and around but there is no such thing as a mild heart attack to the man who has suffered one one heart attack may be worse than another but they are all bad all frightening years later when ike was compiling his memoirs he had to revisit that awful day he d spent crossing seven states in twelve hours after enduring a heart attack and it brought back terrible memories that day he was to write was one of the most miserable of his entire life notes eisenhower provides his own account of what happened in mandate for change 1953 55 1963 pp 147 48 see also robert ferrell ill advised presidential health and public trust 1992 pp 53 72 john emmet hughes the ordeal of power 1963 pp 107 15 herbert s parmet eisenhower and the american crusades 1972 p 278 i should note that there is considerable disagreement about whether ike actually had heart attacks in 1949 and 1953 snyder always insisted he did not and for years no one rose to dispute him in the 1990s ike s cardiologist in the white house dr tom mattingly reviewed eisenhower s heart records and came to the conclusion he probably had had a heart attack in 1949 and almost certainly did in 1953 ferrell cites mattingly approvingly as does robert e gilbert in mortal presidency 1992 though gilbert refers to the 1949 and 1953 episodes as mystery illnesses

in the 1970s milton friedman and other economists attacked the theoretical assumptions that animated the model arguing that it would fail to hold up over longer time horizons but the curve remained the crystal ball of choice for forecasters hoping to figure out where inflation was headed in the short term the new consensus was neatly captured by economist alan blinder in 1997 he wrote that the empirical phillips curve has worked amazingly well for decades and counselled its continued use by policymakers naive model holds its own some economists began questioning blinder s claim in 2001 two economists at the university of california at los angeles andrew atkeson and lee ohanian published a paper based on an experiment that compared the predictive prowess of the phillips curve with a model that was simple to the point of parody forecasting next year s inflation by averaging the previous four quarters rates in other words next year s inflation would be the same as the previous year s that s it we establish this naive forecast as our benchmark not because we think that it is the best forecast of inflation available but rather because we think that any inflation forecasting model based on some hypothesised economic relationship cannot be considered a useful guide for policy if its forecasts are no more accurate than such a simple atheoretical forecast they said atkeson and ohanian pitted their model against two different variations of the phillips curve as well as the federal reserve s internal forecasting metrics the result the naive model held its own against all contenders equalling and in some cases besting the sophisticated multi variable forecasting models beloved by economists subsequent studies largely corroborated these findings but added some important caveats researchers such as james stock and mark watson found in 2008 that the accuracy of forecasts rooted in phillips curve models improved when the unemployment rate deviated significantly from the nairu and faltered when the rate approached the ideal advertisement but it s worth recalling that these temporary improvements in forecasting power were relative to a model that a child could have invented what will inflation be next year same as last year this point was made even more pungently by a subsequent study by economists marie diron and benoit mojon who came up with their own equally interesting thought experiment their comparative model was even simpler take a central bank s inflation target and then use that number as a consistent prediction for inflation every single year in the us the unofficial target number was 2 per cent diron and mojon s construction therefore predicted 2 per cent inflation year in and year out they did the same thing with other countries guess what they managed to beat the complex multi variable models for one long stretch running from 1995 to 2007 not bad group think for those who continue to cling to the hope that inflation is predictable there is another method a bit more reminiscent of those oracular sheep simply ask what the rest of the herd thinks will happen in other words question ordinary people or professional forecasters about their expectations for inflation and average the answers this approach a landmark study from 2007 showed delivers better results than any of the standard forecasting models in this particular inquiry the also rans included the phillips curve as well as predictive methods that take signals from the bond markets namely data about the structure of debt that inflation expectations are reliable is understandable if you believe prices will rise you will act in ways that could insure this comes true put differently inflation expectations are as much blueprints for action as they are predictions they re self fulfilling a more recent study corroborated these results showing that inflation expectations of both ordinary consumers and professional forecasters generally topped other methods in a decade by decade match up going back to the 1960s still in two of those decades modified versions of atkeson and ohanian s model managed to come out on top advertisement if asking other people what they think will happen is the best approach surely the professional forecasters have the edge yes even here the evidence is contradictory while the professionals have a better track record over the very long term there is an embarrassingly long stretch of time 1984 to 2006 where average americans narrowly edged out the professionals let that sink in for a moment ordinary americans significant numbers of whom believe in haunted houses 42 per cent or 58 per cent depending on the poll devil possession 41 per cent the lost city of atlantis 57 per cent and astrology 30 per cent consistently outperform federal reserve economists bond market professionals and in many years professional economic forecasters it s something to keep in mind next time a trained economist tells you about a model showing that inflation will rise fall or stay the same in truth the collective wisdom of people who have never heard of the phillips curve is likely to provide a better guide to what lies ahead

still it would be wrong to discount nasdaq s efforts spurred by the racial reckoning that followed george floyd s murder at the time floyd was killed by a white minneapolis police officer in may 2020 more than three quarters of nasdaq s members did not meet the inclusion criteria it subsequently proposed more than 80 per cent of the directors on boards of the fortune 500 were white and while the number of female directors serving on those boards was expanding quickly there had been little movement towards racial diversification conservatives protested that board membership should depend exclusively on professional qualifications republican members of the senate banking committee harrumphed that america s corporate boardrooms are not the place for social engineering those very arguments had been deployed for decades to exclude women african americans and others from jobs at every level and in every industry in the us including at major media outlets in fact highly qualified women and minorities were seldom named to corporate boards because board members and chief executives who did most of the hiring were white males who recruited from their own white male networks goldman sachs whose command of corporate governance surely exceeds that of gop politicians backed nasdaq s move the argument that there is no pipeline of qualified minorities is preposterous advertisement to cite one telling example the new york times reported that the chairman of mit s chemical engineering department paula hammond a black woman and prominent cancer researcher had never even been approached before 2020 to join the board of any publicly traded company that was the case even though her scientific and managerial expertise made her an obvious selection to serve on a pharmaceutical or biotechnology company board there are encouraging signs at least a dozen states including california have adopted or are considering laws that would set quotas to diversify corporate boards or set disclosure requirements a means of forcing corporations that drag their feet to explain their recalcitrance last year nearly 60 per cent of s p 500 companies disclosed their board members ethnic and racial background more than double the rate of a year earlier advertisement nasdaq firms that do not comply with the new guidelines will be required to explain why a form of naming and shaming more progress is needed luckily there are plenty of incentives for companies to make strides and not just political and public pressure a study by mckinsey co shows that companies whose boards feature more gender and ethnic diversity are more profitable than those dominated by white males editorial board washington post washington post

after a 13 year old apparently overdosed on fentanyl at a hartford school advocacy groups are calling for more schools to stock the opioid antidote example video title will go here for this video example video title will go here for this video hartford conn the death of a 13 year old student who apparently overdosed on fentanyl at his connecticut school has drawn renewed pleas for schools to stock the opioid antidote naloxone as well as for training of both staffers and children on how to recognize and respond to overdoses the seventh grader died jan 15 after falling ill at a hartford school that did not have naloxone on hand city officials vowed wednesday to put the antidote in all city schools as part of a wider drug use and overdose prevention strategy naloxone should be available in all schools and there should be education on signs and symptoms of overdose and how to use this said dr craig allen vice president of addiction services for hartford healthcare s behavioral health network unfortunately a horrible incident like this happens and suddenly everyone s vision is 20 20 hartford mayor luke bronin said that because of the student s young age an opioid overdose did not immediately come to mind when the school nurse and first responders who did have naloxone treated him that s why city officials are also proposing more training and curriculum changes aimed at educating staffers students and community members in substance use awareness and prevention he said in response to the student s death advocacy groups are repeating calls they ve made for several years for schools to stock naloxone often delivered as a nasal spray under the brand name narcan and train educators support staff and students to recognize signs of opioid use and overdoses especially because younger people are falling victim more frequently the powerful opioid fentanyl has been showing up in marijuana illicit pills and other substances accessible to school age children experts say fatal overdoses in the u s are at record levels fueled by fentanyl and have been increasing among younger people national data shows the national association of school nurses has advocated for naloxone to be in all schools since 2015 and for school nurses to help educate their communities about the signs and symptoms of substance abuse it s a very unfortunate outcome linda mendonca the association s president said about the hartford student s death it brings us back to school preparedness and response plans having those in place is really critical the association created a tool kit for school nurses that includes information on administering naloxone and educating the community about opioid problems the kit has been downloaded from its website more than 49 000 times the group said ethan s run against addiction is one of many advocacy groups that weighed in on social media about the hartford student s death it is named after ethan monson dupuis a 25 year old wisconsin man who died of a heroin overdose in 2016 this tragedy is unbearable our nation s opioid crisis has reached into the lives of children into places where we want to assume that they are safe the group said in a facebook post thursday all public places including schools must have narcan available we need to educate kids on how to recognize someone who is overdosing and how to use narcan in addition to a nasal spray naloxone can also be given as an injection the national institute on drug abuse says it is a safe medicine and side effects are rare but warns it doesn t reverse overdoses from other drugs training is needed the agency says because sometimes more than one dose needs to be given and people who receive the drug can experience immediate withdrawal symptoms it s not clear how often overdoses happen in u s schools but experts and advocates say they are not common in late november two school resource officers and a school nurse were given naloxone after being exposed to the synthetic opioid carfentanil which was in a piece of paper found in a student s vape pen at sequoyah high school in madisonville tennessee according to local media reports the officers and nurse became lightheaded but recovered in 2019 high schools in the tucson arizona area began stocking naloxone in response to a student overdosing on opioids while in school emergency responders who were carrying the antidote revived the student media reports said there also is no national data on how many schools have naloxone or drug use awareness training programs that include recognizing the signs of an overdose in a survey of pennsylvania school nurses conducted in 2018 and published in 2020 more than half the 362 nurses who responded reported having naloxone in their schools according to the

the title of this piece is a reminder of the classic novel published in 1977 by the english author jeffery archer shall we tell the president the theme is about the plot to kill the president of the united states edward kennedy but foiled by the federal bureau of investigation fbi agent mark andrews working with the head of fbi archer later revised the novel using fictional characters with plot structures on love affairs this piece has no direct link with the theme of archer s celebrated novel there was no assassination attempt on president muhammad buhari but there are issues that the president needs to know in order to engage the relevant government functionaries on the way forward ghana secured freedom from its colonial masters in 1957 and power changed hands from the white to

central bank digital currency touted as risk free money by mike gleason web posted january 24 2022 last week shaped up to be a pivotal one for precious metals markets with some breakout price action on the board as the u s stock market got pounded hard assets perked up on safe haven buying these are the times that prove the indispensable role precious metals play in a balanced investment portfolio year to date the s p 500 is down 6 the bond market is also down and bitcoin is suffering a double digit drop so far in 2022 there has been nowhere for investors to hide except in hard assets bitcoin is touted by promoters as digital gold yet cryptocurrencies have been trading more like tech stocks than sound money the bitcoin versus gold debate won t be settled anytime soon crypto enthusiasts still anticipate a massive price run up ahead while skeptics warn the bubble may have burst regardless of where crypto markets head from here the claim that digital tokens are somehow a substitute for physical precious metals is absolutely positively 100 wrong anyone venturing into crypto markets thinking they can obtain the digital equivalent of gold or silver is making a huge mistake precious metals and cryptocurrencies are entirely separate asset classes while they both serve as alternatives to fiat currencies and conventional investments speculative digital assets ultimately can t stack up to physical bullion when it comes to long term wealth protection blockchain based cryptocurrencies like all technologies can eventually become obsolete gold and silver are basic elements that can never be replaced they will always be valued for their aesthetic properties and industrial utility even if their historic role in the monetary system diminishes to nothing of course that s not likely to be the case central banks around the world continue to accumulate gold in their reserves meanwhile individual investors have been accumulating their own gold and silver reserves at a robust pace over the past couple years â clearing out u s mint coin inventories in the process in other news the federal reserve last thursday released a paper on the prospects of issuing a central bank digital currency steve leisman cnbc the long awaited paper on the central bank digital currency being issued at this time by the federal reserve in which they say that a cbdc could offer a range of benefits and risk don t come to any particular conclusion about it but they say could offer the the general public a risk free digital money that is free from credit risk free from liquidity risk would not replace existing digital money but would be an addition to it the fed will not proceed as chair powell has said with the cbdc without support of congress and the executive branch but it is potentially the biggest change to money since i don t know currency consolidation after the civil war so we re watching it very carefully cnbc anchor yeah a huge step for mankind critics warn that a central bank digital currency would be a huge step toward a chinese style social credit and financial surveillance system under a cbdc the fed could control access to digital wallets and together with federal agencies monitor how digital dollars are used and by whom perhaps people who are behind on child support or tax bills would be denied the ability to transact in fedcoin fed issued digital wallets could also carry data on personal vaccine status or a host of other things governments and businesses may be interested in knowing although officially the fed hasn t yet announced that it will move to implement a cbdc the concept is backed by fed governor lael brainard brainard has been nominated by president joe biden to serve as vice chair of the federal open market committee some members of congress are trying to prevent the fed from issuing a central bank digital currency before it gets the chance representative tom emmer of minnesota introduced a bill that amends the federal reserve act to prevent the central bank from assigning digital accounts or issuing digital currencies to the public but there is zero chance that congress will take away the federal reserve s digital printing press the vast majority of the money supply pumped into the economy by the fed is in electronic form rather than in coins and paper bills the power to inflate by means of computer entries entails the power to destroy purchasing power at the push of a button inflation is now running at a 40 year high it threatens to wipe out holders of bonds and cash instruments that sport deeply negative real yields while there are many alternatives available in financial and crypto markets the ultimate alternative to the risks inherent in paper and digital profusions is to seek out hard assets instead mike gleason is a director with money metals exchange a national precious metals dealer with over 50 000 customers gleason is a hard money advocate and a

sydney jan 24 asian share markets slipped today with the federal reserve expected to confirm it will soon start draining the massive liquidity that has fuelled the huge gains in growth stocks in recent years adding to the caution was concerns about a possible russian attack on ukraine with the us state department pulling out family members of its embassy staff in kyiv the new york times reported president joe biden was considering sending thousands of us troops to nato allies in europe along with warships and aircraft msci s broadest index of asia pacific shares outside japan eased 0 1 per cent and japan s nikkei 1 0 per cent however wall street futures were trying to bounce after last week s drubbing with the s p 500 futures up 0 4 per cent and nasdaq futures 0 7 per cent advertisement edgy markets are now even pricing in a small chance the fed hikes rates this week though the overwhelming expectation is for a first move to 0 25 per cent in march and three more to 1 0 per cent by year end with inflation eye wateringly high the fed is on course to steadily remove the ultra accommodative monetary policy that has been a key prop to stock prices for over a decade now said oliver allen a market economist at capital economics the prospect of higher borrowing costs and more attractive bond yields took a toll on tech stocks with their lofty valuations leaving the nasdaq down 12 per cent so far this year and the s p 500 nearly 8 per cent advertisement the rout was exacerbated by a slide in netflix which tumbled almost 22 per cent shedding us 44 billion rm184 2 billion in market value such was the scale of the losses that treasuries actually rallied late last week on speculation the bonfire of market wealth might scare the fed into being less hawkish a variation of the old greenspan put however allen noted that even with the recent drop the s p 500 was still 40 per cent above where it ended 2019 and the nasdaq 60 per cent investors may not be able to rely on a so called fed put this time around given that the central bank s tightening cycle has not even begun and that the strength of the us economy suggests that much tighter policy is warranted indeed the first reading of us gross domestic product for the december quarter is due this week and forecast to show growth running at an annualised 5 4 per cent before omicron put its foot on the brakes earnings season is also well under way and companies reporting this week include ibm microsoft johnson johnson intel tesla apple and caterpillar while treasuries did bounce late last week 10 year yields are still up 22 basis points on the month so far at 1 77 per cent and not far from levels last seen in early 2020 that rise has generally supported the us dollar which added 0 5 per cent on a basket of currencies last week and last stood at 85 647 the euro was stuck at us 1 1341 having failed to sustain a recent rally to near us 1 1500 the risk is the fed s statement portrays an urgency to act soon likely in march in the face of very high inflation said joseph capurso cba s head of international economics that could even encourage markets to price a risk of a 50 basis point rate hike in march and under that scenario we expect a knee jerk reaction above its 4 january high of 96 46 the japanese yen tends to benefit from safe haven flows as stocks crumble keeping the dollar soft at 113 66 and uncomfortably close to last week s low of 113 47 gold held up at us 1 833 an ounce having hit a six week peak of us 1 842 last week oil prices were rising again having climbed for five weeks in a row to a seven year peak on expectations demand will stay strong and supplies limited brent added 74 cents to us 88 64 a barrel while us crude rose 70 cents to us 85 84 reuters
some commentators have tried to play down on the significance of the 13 rice pyramids unveiled in abuja last tuesday some people are wondering if the price of the commodity would come down with the release of the 13 million bags that constituted the pyramids into the market others for political and partisan reasons have been rather caustic in their remarks for them nothing good can happen under buhari however the optics of the massive display presented an undisputable evidence of the nation s progress in food production in the last six years the linchpin of this success is a funding arrangement known as the anchor borrower s programme abp devised by the cbn in collaboration with the commercial banks under it the banks lend to farmers with a guarantee for offtakers to buy the produce from them during harvest the fact that the loan is disbursed in kind and repaid in kind provides mitigations against the key risks like diversion of loan proceeds and default in repayments due to low sales in addition the bulk purchase from the farmers prevents a glut of the commodity in the local markets and loss of revenue to the farmers according to mr emefiele abp has catalyzed the rural economy and built a sustainable framework for financing small holder farmers in nigeria the programme has developed an ecosystem among all nodes of the agricultural value chain and these linkages can be better optimized through synergy among all stakeholders he said at the abuja event statistics abound to prove the point as at the end of december 2021 the programme has financed 4 489 786 farmers that cultivated 5 300 411 hectares across 21 commodities through 23 banks in the 36 states of the federation and fct the banks have disbursed about n900 billion to the farmers since the inception of the programme this is a huge investment which has resulted in increased production and productivity of rice led to job creation and reduction in importation under the scheme each hectare of rice farm employs between 12 to 14 people that the scheme has led to a reduction in our import bill is illustrated in the gradual disappearance of thai rice from our dinner tables thailand alone exported 1 3 million metric tons of rice to nigeria in 2014 but since the launch of abp in 2015 there ve been steady reductions in rice imports from that country by 2016 rice imports from thailand had fallen to only 58 000 metric tons and a meager 2 160 metric tons at the end of 2021 it s undoubtedly a huge savings on foreign exchange in addition to increasing national rice output from about 5 4 million metric tons in 2015 to over nine million metric tons in 2021 nigeria has also significantly improved the productivity per hectare of the smallholder farmer from about 2 4 metric tons per hectare in 2015 to between about 5 metric tons per hectare in 2021 these expansions have not only made nigeria the largest rice producer in africa but has also unlocked enormous private sector investment in the rice value chain as the number of integrated rice mills grew astronomically from six in 2015 to over 50 in 2021 with many more in various stages of completion nigerians are hoping that the release of the 13 million bags of rice should further depress its retail price in the market with the success recorded in rice production it is encouraging that the country is turning its attention to wheat the third most consumed grain in nigeria after maize and rice cbn estimates that we only produce about one per cent 63 000 metric tons of the 5 6 million metric tons of wheat consumed annually in nigeria and this explains why we spend a whopping 2 billion to import the grain every year according to the cbn wheat accounts for the second highest food import bill in nigeria thereby putting pressure on the nation s foreign exchange reserves to produce enough wheat in the country should therefore be a task that must be done with the abp our farmers have concluded the first major wet season wheat farming in plateau state planting over 100 000 hectares of the commodity across 15 states in the 2021 dry season this intervention should help in reducing the nation s wheat import bills over the coming years the government has also established a strategic maize reserve with the stock of maize submitted as loan repayment by the farmers this will provide a buffer for price modulation for the poultry and feed mills nationwide a total of 241 656 76 mt was aggregated in the 2020 wet and dry seasons out of which 217 218 53 mt has been disposed to 18 millers and poultry farmers through the poultry association of nigeria the program was able to stabilize the poultry and livestock sectors during the pandemic and saved the industry and consumers over n10 billion in raw material costs now what s the politics of the rice pyramids clearly the massive display was a good showcase for an administration assailed everyday for the security challenges in the country the risk however is a possible discontinuation of this programme or half hearted implementation by buhari s successor the president leaves office next year and godwin emefiele in 2024 this means that the fate of the anchor borrowers programme lies in the hands of the man or woman who would be elected president in 2023 we should give a thought to this in the last 25 years nigeria has achieved self sufficiency in the production of poultry cement sim cards and rice very soon we will end importation of wheat and petrol if we could record such achievement in textile production our collective prosperity would have been palpable

will 2022 be the year of sound money in the states by jp cortez web posted january 24 2022 last year was a good year for state level sound money legislation across the united states 2022 could be even better building on the success enjoyed by sound money advocates in arkansas and ohio last year more than a half dozen states are now considering legislation that rolls back discriminatory taxes and regulations on the sale use and purchase of gold and silver more states are removing sales taxes on gold silver to date 42 states have removed some or all taxes from the purchase of gold and silver and there are new bills pending now in five of the eight remaining states i e tennessee mississippi kentucky hawaii and new jersey taxing the exchange of federal reserve notes for the monetary metals is an atrocious policy for several reasons states generally don t tax the purchase of investments â states don t slap sales taxes on the purchase of stocks bonds etfs currencies and other financial instruments gold and silver are held as forms of savings and investment so taxing precious metals penalizes a single class of savers and investors taxing precious metals actually reduces a state s tax revenues â a michigan analysis revealed that the sales tax revenue extracted was actually exceeded by revenue lost from conventions businesses and economic activity driven out of the state and states with sales taxes on precious metals are at a competitive disadvantage to neighboring states that have ended the practice taxing precious metals is harmful to citizens attempting to protect their assets â purchasers of precious metals generally aren t fat cat investors most who buy precious metals do so in small increments as a way of saving money people purchase precious metals in part to preserve their wealth against the ravages of inflation inflation especially harms the poorest among us including pensioners senior citizens on fixed incomes wage earners and savers â levying taxes on precious metals is illogical and inappropriate â purchases of computers shirts and shoes are taxable to the final consumer but precious metals are inherently held for resale not consumption making the entire notion of taxing their purchase illogical from the start here is a quick rundown of pending sales tax repeal billsâ in the bluegrass state rep kirk mccormick introducedâ house bill 272 â last week to cancel kentucky sales taxes on gold silver platinum and palladium coins and bars in neighboring tennessee rep gant and sen stevens are pursuing a similar measure their efforts are bolstered by a newly released study by the tennessee advisory commission on intergovernmental relations tacir which encourages the volunteer state to end the practice of taxing precious metals house bill 514 and senate bill 870 â introduced â in 2021 by rep gant and sen stevens respectively will be considered this spring even as kentucky and tennessee legislators move forward mississippi may beat them to the punch in becoming the 43rd state to cancel sales taxes on the monetary metals so far three such bills have beenâ introduced â in mississippi house bill 426 house bill 518 and house bill 729 introduced by rep ford rep hopkins and rep bomgar respectively hawaii is also poised to end state sales taxes on gold and silver â house bill 1184 introduced by rep okimoto sailed through two committees last year passing unanimously out of one and passing overwhelmingly out of the other the bill was put on hold due to fears that enacting tax cuts could jeopardize biden s handouts to state legislatures last year meanwhile legislators in new jersey also hope toâ eliminate sales taxes on precious metals last year s sound money tax exemption effort was led by assemblyman dancer and sen doherty and they are championing this cause in the garden state again this session alabama and virginia are among the states already on the right side of the sales tax issue however both exemptions sunset this year sound money allies have already mobilized introducing measures to extend the life of those states exemptions â specifically â senate bill 13 sponsored by sen melson in alabama andâ house bill 936 sponsored by del batten in virginia let s hope they succeed because re imposing sales taxes on gold and silver has proven to be a debacle in recent years the state of ohio and louisiana both experimented briefly with resuming taxation on precious metals purchases only to reverse course after businesses coin conventions and state tax revenues exited the state more states want to end income taxes on gold silver in 2019 the sound money defense league teamed up with sound money advocates in west virginia to eliminate sales taxes on precious metals this year delegate pritt has introduced house bill 3135 to take things a step further byâ eliminating capital gains taxation on sound money â and reaffirming gold and silver as money in the state a similar effort will be considered in olympia washington introduced last session by rep chase house bill 1417 seeks toâ remove all forms of taxation on the metals rep chase wants to ensure the evergreen state remains near the top of theâ sound money index a capital gains tax on precious metals is often a tax on imaginary gains under current law a taxpayer who sells precious metals may end up with a capital gain in terms of federal reserve notes this capital gain is not necessarily aâ realâ gain it s often aâ nominalâ gain that results from the inflation created by the federal reserve and the attendant decline in the dollar s purchasing power yet this nominal gain is taxed at the federal level â and because most states use federal adjusted gross income agi as a starting point for income calculations this nominal gain is taxed again by the state in most cases neutralizing punitive income tax treatment of the monetary metals would remove the last major disincentive that stands against the ownership and use of the monetary metals the attack on sound money is rooted in federal policy of course individual states cannot bring soundness to america s monetary system on their own the root of the problem is the federal reserve u s treasury and congress who have fully embraced fiat money and abandoned monetary restraint with the consumer price index running at its highest rate in 40 years inflation is becoming the most pressing economic issue of our time while federal policymakers are exacerbating the problem some states are thankfully stepping up to give their citizens some tools to protect themselves jp cortez is a graduate of auburn university and a resident of charlotte north carolina he is theâ policy director of theâ sound money defense league an organization working to bring back

late last week kim dotcom was getting ready to make a major announcement about bitcache and the new megaupload 2 0 service however just before going public the news was halted due to a roadblock today dotcom reveals that he planned to announce a merger with a publicly listed canadian company but the stock exchange got in the way last friday it was exactly five years ago that the original megaupload service was taken offline as part of a u s criminal investigation kim dotcom wanted to use this special date to announce new details about its successor megaupload 2 0 and the associated bitcache service however minutes before the announcement something got in the way today kim dotcom chief evangelist of the service explains what happened the original idea was to announce a prominent merger deal with a canadian company that would bring in an additional 12 million in capital megaupload 2 0 and bitcache already secured its initial investment round last october through the online investment platform bnktothefuture it raised well over a million dollars from 354 investors in just two weeks to bring in more capital the startup had quietly struck a stock and cash merger deal with a publicly listed company on the canadian stock exchange at a 100 million valuation this news was supposed to break last friday but just minutes before going public the canadian securities exchange got in the way according to dotcom the canadian company sent a draft press release of its merger plans to the exchange which swiftly came back with some objections effectively blocking the announcement trading of the stock was halted while waiting for a response the exchange demonstrated a bias against the merger and requested further detailed and intrusive information a statement released by dotcom says dotcom doesn t reveal what the concerns of the exchange were but it s not unlikely that the links to a pending criminal megaupload case in the united states may play a role megaupload 2 0 and bitcache put their lawyers on the case but the company eventually decided to back away from the planned merger bitcache feels it is important as a technology startup to stay nimble and reduce corporate complexity in favor of technology development the experience of dealing with the exchange has only served to encourage that view dotcom s announcement reads while the original plan has been scuppered dotcom and his team will now focus on getting the service ready for a first beta release a proof of concept is scheduled to come out during the second quarter of the year soon followed by a closed beta the first open release is penned for the end of the year according to the current planning dotcom informs us from what has been revealed thus far megaupload 2 0 and the associated bitcache platform will allow people to share and store files linking every file transfer to a bitcoin transaction unlike the original megaupload the new version isn t going to store all files itself instead it plans to use third party providers such as maidsafe and storj megaupload 2 will be a caching provider for popular files on special high speed servers that serve the files from ram long term storage will mostly be provided by numerous third party sites that we are partnering with you can expect more details on january 20 dotcom previously told us prospective users who are eager to see what the service has in store have to be patient for a little longer but dotcom is confident that it will be a game changer on multiple fronts
