the bank of canada has raised interest rates again in an effort to quell inflation the central bank raised its policy rate by 0 75 percentage points on sept 7 bringing its benchmark overnight rate to 3 25 per cent economists are expecting the central bank to raise it again before the end of the year by now it s clear that the bank of canada did not anticipate the current rate of inflation when inflation first started increasing last year the central bank was slow to start tightening monetary policy now that inflation is persistent the bank of canada is making up for lost time by aggressively raising its policy rate to get the inflation rate back on target monetary policy has a delayed impact on the economy meaning that a change in monetary policy today will affect the economy about 12 to 18 months from now although supply chain problems high energy prices from the war in ukraine and labour shortages have exacerbated inflation the unprecedented expansionary monetary policy by the bank of canada last year is an important source of the high inflation we observe today getting back on track the goal of canada s monetary policy jointly determined by the government of canada and the bank of canada is to keep the inflation rate within a range of one to three per cent with two per cent being the most desirable rate in early 2021 all key inflation indicators started to rise dramatically and as of now are all well above the two per cent inflation target the total consumer price index inflation rate was 8 1 per cent in june 2022 and fell to 7 6 per cent in july 2022 mostly because of a decline in gasoline prices the core consumer price index inflation was also well above five per cent in july read more an economist explains what you need to know about inflation inflation also rose in the united states europe and the united kingdom with annual inflation in these countries now running at around 9 per cent and central banks flagrantly missing their inflation targets at the onset of the covid 19 pandemic in march 2020 the bank of canada rapidly lowered the policy rate to near zero and kept it there until early 2022 since then the bank has been steadily increasing the policy rate until the most recent hike according to the central bank it could be years before its policy rate is back to normal levels currently the bank of canada estimates that inflation will decrease to about three per cent by the end of 2023 and return to the two per cent target by the end of 2024 but this remains to be seen in this regard back in 2020 the bank was expecting the policy rate to remain at 0 25 per cent until 2023 but is now at 3 25 per cent and rising bank of canada assets in response to the covid 19 pandemic the bank of canada introduced a large number of lending programs and used non interest rate tools known as nonconventional monetary policy to provide liquidity to the financial markets and stimulate the economy this led to an unprecedented increase in the bank of canada s balance sheet with the central bank buying more than half a trillion dollars of financial assets primarily in the form of government of canada securities before the pandemic the bank of canada s holdings of securities were about 100 billion the expansion in the bank of canada s balance sheet led to a huge injection of liquidity in the financial system and led to an increase in the reserves that commercial banks have in their accounts with the bank of canada in fact these reserves increased by more than 1 500 times their pre covid amount such increases in bank reserves are generally considered to be inflationary restoring faith in the bank of canada the bank of canada s recent aggressive monetary tightening will be transmitted to the real economy through higher interest rates and lower asset prices including housing prices and will most likely kill the post covid economic expansion with inflation seemingly out of control central banks appear to be losing credibility the public trusts central banks to protect the buying power of money but the increasing cost of living is eroding this trust the bank of canada and other central banks including the federal reserve the european central bank and the bank of england are all desperately trying to fight inflation and restore their credibility in canada this restoration has involved the unprecedented increases in the bank of canada s policy rate that have taken place since the beginning of the year curiously other countries that are facing the same supply chain problems and higher energy prices as us are not struggling with inflation as high as ours for example the inflation rate in switzerland is 3 4 per cent in japan is 2 3 per cent and in china is 2 4 per cent but why this is the case is another conversation entirely author apostolos serletis professor of economics university of calgary

tighter monetary policy will not directly affect that but raising rates just once while headline inflation has increased from 3 2 in january to 7 9 currently is a risk the bank of thailand s inflation

balanced approach to monetary policy especially when the thai economy is recovering and the country is still experiencing net capital inflows the central bank is very very careful in raising the interest rate at the same time our economy has to recover the finance minister also said since global inflation was caused by supply side disruptions hiking up rates to curb demand might not be an effective approach he said he was not worried about servicing foreign debt even as the thai baht continues to depreciate against the u s dollar since there are other growth engines in thailand beyond the tourism sector i m not worried because debt service is still in our capacity particularly for the public debt termpittayapaisith said i think once the economy recovers i think we are not worried

the pandemic driven by improved tourism and private consumption activity chua said our expectations are for the bank of thailand to proceed with gradual policy rate hikes and monetary normalization as it balances rising inflation with a smooth economic growth lift off however he said thailand s continued negative policy interest rate differential with the u s could be problematic for the country

surged and the dollar gained across the board selling sent the s p 500 down more than 4 per cent while the tech heavy nasdaq 100 losses surpassed 5 per cent as yield sensitive stocks took the biggest hit both benchmarks are poised for their worst one day routs since 2020 swaps traders are now fully pricing in a rate increase of three quarters of a percentage point with wagers rising for a similar

strips out the more volatile food and energy components also topped forecasts overall today was a surprising day against the trend of what had appeared to be some moderation across most indicators of growth and pricing pressure so the fed s job is clearly not finished rick rieder the chief investment officer of global fixed income at blackrock inc the world s biggest asset manager wrote we think the fed will pause the rate hiking cycle potentially at year end but maybe now the central bank will have to wait a bit longer to do that after having reached a restrictive policy stance more comments headline inflation has peaked but in a clear sign that the need to continue hiking rates is undiminished core cpi is once again on the rise confirming the very sticky nature of the us inflation problem seema shah chief global strategist at principal global investors said in a note in fact 70 per cent of the cpi basket is seeing an annualized price rise of more than 4 per cent month on month until the fed can tame that beast there is simply no room for a discussion on pivots or pauses the cpi report was an unequivocal negative for equity markets wrote matt peron director of research at janus henderson investors the hotter than expected report means we will get continued pressure from fed policy via rate hikes it also pushes back any fed pivot that the markets were hopeful for in the near term core cost of living prices falling when labor markets are tight with nominal wages rising rapidly is not going to produce the soft landing fairy tale steven blitz chief us economist at ts lombard said the fed had better odds of rolling a hard eight than engineering a soft landing there is no fed pivot to prevent one there is no turning back from the path they are on although today s announcement shows that inflation remains historically high there may be signs that the pressure of inflation is abating said richard flynn managing director of charles schwab uk company inventories

u s intelligence claims that russia has agreed to purchase rockets and artillery shells from north korea the report suggests that russia s heavy use of artillery is seriously cutting into its stockpile and it cannot sustain the war on its own much longer the purchase along with shipments of low tech drones from iran implies that russia is running low on key weapons russia is purchasing millions of artillery shells and rockets from north korea u s intelligence has concluded moscow which is expending tens of thousands of shells a day in its invasion of ukraine has apparently run so low it is now set to buy them from the repressive regime the invasion well into its sixth month has gone on much longer than russia originally planned and russian forces are now running out of critical munitions the washington post citing recently declassified u s intelligence reports that russia is buying millions of short range rockets and artillery shells from north korea the post quoted an unnamed u s official stating we expect russia could try to purchase additional north korean military equipment going forward nurphoto getty images a wrecked russian 2s19 msta self propelled howitzer on display in warsaw poland july 2022 the report does not mention what specific kind of munitions russia is buying from north korea but it s likely buying 122mm shells for its 2s1 122mm self propelled howitzers typically deployed at the battalion tactical group and brigade levels and 152mm shells for its 2s19 msta s 152mm self propelled howitzers the 2s1 has no equivalent in the nato armies but the 2s19 is similar to the american m109a7 paladin and german panzerhaubitze 2000 155mm self propelled howitzers russian military doctrine emphasizes heavy artillery bombardments of enemy forces to enable maneuver suppressing enemy positions to enable armor and infantry attacks to succeed according to ukrainian military officials russian ground forces and moscow s proxy armies are firing 40 000 to 60 000 rockets and shells a day over the 201 days since the invasion started that results in at least eight million and up to 12 million munitions expended so far anadolu agency getty images 2s1 self propelled guns of the pro russian donetsk people s republic militia fire at ukrainian troops donetsk oblast ukraine may 2022 firing tens of thousands of artillery shells a day is taking a toll on russia s vast artillery reserves russian leader vladimir putin and his generals originally believed that the invasion of ukraine would take just three days russian paratroopers were originally tasked to secure gostomel airport near kyiv and quickly capture ukraine s capital city this would have led to a collapse of ukraine s civilian and eventually military leadership and end organized resistance in the country instead ukrainian forces recaptured gostomel forced russia to abandon its march on kyiv and recast the war as a long hard war of attrition in the country s east the war has now taken 198 days longer than originally projected with no clear ending in sight russia is known to have prodigious stocks of ammunition most of it dating back to the cold war but eight million artillery shells would put a dent in even the most prepared armies russia unlike western armies also uses fewer precision guided artillery shells resulting in the need to saturate a target with many shells when only a few precision shells would do str getty images north korean multiple rocket launchers firing during a women s rocket crew firing contest date unknown north korea is one of the most heavily militarized countries in the world despite a population of just under 26 million it has the world s fourth largest military with 1 2 million personnel under arms artillery is a major part of the korean people s army s kpa firepower and the kpa fields an estimated 20 500 artillery pieces including 5 100 multiple rocket launchers 4 400 self propelled artillery and 7 500 mortars the kpa has considerable stocks of artillery shells and rockets to not only blast a route through the demilitarized zone but also bombard the south korean capital of seoul north korea uses many of the same artillery calibers as russia especially 122 millimeter grad rockets and 152mm howitzer shells these are different calibers than u s and nato artillery which typically uses 227mm rockets and 155mm howitzers shells north korea came to adopt russian calibers when it was a cold war russian client state and built up vast reserves of war equipment in the event of a second korean war ed jones getty images north korean m 1991 self propelled howitzers during a military parade april 2017 the m 1991 uses the same caliber ammunition as the donetsk people s republic guns shown above the north korean artillery sale is a mixed bag on one hand it shows how desperate russia is to keep its war machine running not only must russia be close to emptying out its reserves of artillery shells its military industrial complex cannot keep the guns firing on its own it also shows that countries like china which also manufacture 152mm artillery shells are not interested in crossing western sanctions against russia and supplying it with arms finally reducing north korea s stockpile of artillery shells makes it vulnerable to supply shortages in a war of its own on the other hand more artillery shells will prolong the war in ukraine and make it more difficult for ukrainian forces to take back their own country north korea with an economy a third the size of delaware s could steer the proceeds from the sale into what many consider their most dangerous weapons nuclear weapons these weapons are pointed at north korea s enemies particularly the united states it s unlikely that russia buying weapons from north korea let alone iran was on anyone s bingo card for 2022 russia s hungry war machine is pushing it to desperate measures moscow may have a surprise in store for it though in 2010 after north korea bombarded the south korean island of yeonpyeong authorities discovered up to 25 percent of the rockets were duds that s a high failure rate for a fairly simple rocket
listen to this article listen to this article washington ap the federal reserve will need to continue lifting its short term interest rate to a level that restricts economic growth and keep it there for an extended period according to a top fed official in remarks at a recent banking industry conference fed vice chair lael brainard echoed similarly tough comments about inflation delivered by chair jerome powell late last month in jackson hole other fed officials have also in recent weeks emphasized their views that the fed has to push borrowing costs higher to bring down inflation currently near a four decade high we are in this for as long as it takes to get inflation down brainard said in prepared remarks our resolve is firm our goals are clear and our tools are up to the task the fed s benchmark interest rate will need to rise further and stay at a level high enough to slow the economy for some time to provide confidence that inflation is moving down to the fed s 2 target brainard said in july prices were 8 5 higher than a year earlier the stream of tough rhetoric on inflation from fed policymakers has led many economists to anticipate a third sharp rate hike of three quarters of a point at the fed s next meeting next week if so it would extend a rapid series of rate increases the fastest since the early 1980s that began in march at its last meeting in july fed policymakers decided to raise their short term rate by three quarters of a point to a range of 2 25 to 2 5 loretta mester president of the federal reserve bank of cleveland also reiterated her determination to push interest rates higher to get inflation under control higher borrowing costs won t necessarily cause a recession she said but they raise the chances of one even if the u s manages to avoid an economic downturn mester said higher rates will slow growth disrupt stock and bond markets and lift unemployment this will be painful in the near term but so is high inflation she said in an online discussion with mni a news wire but brainard by contrast sketched out a hopeful scenario for the fed s policies suggesting they could achieve an elusive goal known as a soft landing in which growth slows enough to bring down inflation but not so much as to tip the economy into recession brainard did not warn as powell and mester did that the fed s interest rate hikes would likely cause pain and push up the unemployment rate instead she pointed out that there are signs that supply chain snarls are easing which could boost factory output and bring down prices and auto makers and retailers enjoyed hefty profit margins when goods were scarce and americans were spending robustly but as consumers start to pull back amid high inflation retailers and car companies may have to cut prices to boost sales she said i am confident that we will see a return to 2 inflation brainard said

global us markets pushed higher overnight as investors await the cpi print due out on tuesday investors expect inflation to have cooled further and this is also the view of consumers according to a survey from the federal reserve bank of new york just like covid inflation would appear to be declining in intensity the dow jones rallied over 200 points while the s p500 gained 1 1 and the nasdaq rose 1 3 apple rose nearly 4 on reports of strong demand for the iphone14 the consumer price index print tonight is expected to see inflation cool to 8 in august from 8 5 in july falling fuel oil prices are set to be a key instigator of weakness but inflation is softening in other areas including food and other commodities the fact that supply chains are also freeing up will also be helpful this is all feeding through to the mindset of us consumers who have moderated their expectations of inflation over the next 12 months to 5 7 down from 6 2 in july on a 3 year view expectations have fallen to 2 8 from 3 2 consumers are optimistic around the notion that petrol and house prices two big drives of inflation during the pandemic will not increase significantly in the year ahead fortunately americans are not as exposed to the soaring price of gas as is the case across the atlantic in europe house prices like many other places around the world surged during the pandemic expectations for house price growth are now the lowest since july 2020 with rising mortgage rates taking the heat out of the equation while falling house prices might be seen as dampening the mood this doesn t appear to be the case perhaps americans are less hung up on marking to market the value of their homes every five minutes as we do in new zealand overall american s perceptions of their household s current financial situation compared to a year ago has improved it is amazing what a little easing of intense inflationary pressures will do over in europe and the uk cost of living pressures remain elevated and this is impacting spending power the uk economy returned to growth in july after a decline of 0 6 in june but the expansion of 0 2 was some way less than the 0 5 expected the uk services sector was the main driver of the rise while production and construction contracted for the second month in a row the tepid growth means that the uk economy is just 1 above its pre covid level in february 2020 while the queen s funeral is a huge deal and the first state funeral since that of winston churchill in 1965 princess di was not afforded one it will not come without some cost to the economy it is estimated that the public holiday to mark the occasion will shave 0 2 off uk gdp tourism and hospitality industries will largely be closed and not get the boost that they did

the bank of canada has raised interest rates again in an effort to quell inflation the central bank raised its policy rate by 0 75 percentage points on sept 7 bringing its benchmark overnight rate to 3 25 per cent economists are expecting the central bank to raise it again before the end of the year by now it s clear that the bank of canada did not anticipate the current rate of inflation when inflation first started increasing last year the central bank was slow to start tightening monetary policy now that inflation is persistent the bank of canada is making up for lost time by aggressively raising its policy rate to get the inflation rate back on target monetary policy has a delayed impact on the economy meaning that a change in monetary policy today will affect the economy about 12 to 18 months from now although supply chain problems high energy prices from the war in ukraine and labour shortages have exacerbated inflation the unprecedented expansionary monetary policy by the bank of canada last year is an important source of the high inflation we observe today getting back on track the goal of canada s monetary policy jointly determined by the government of canada and the bank of canada is to keep the inflation rate within a range of one to three per cent with two per cent being the most desirable rate in early 2021 all key inflation indicators started to rise dramatically and as of now are all well above the two per cent inflation target the total consumer price index inflation rate was 8 1 per cent in june 2022 and fell to 7 6 per cent in july 2022 mostly because of a decline in gasoline prices the core consumer price index inflation was also well above five per cent in july read more an economist explains what you need to know about inflation inflation also rose in the united states europe and the united kingdom with annual inflation in these countries now running at around 9 per cent and central banks flagrantly missing their inflation targets at the onset of the covid 19 pandemic in march 2020 the bank of canada rapidly lowered the policy rate to near zero and kept it there until early 2022 since then the bank has been steadily increasing the policy rate until the most recent hike according to the central bank it could be years before its policy rate is back to normal levels currently the bank of canada estimates that inflation will decrease to about three per cent by the end of 2023 and return to the two per cent target by the end of 2024 but this remains to be seen in this regard back in 2020 the bank was expecting the policy rate to remain at 0 25 per cent until 2023 but is now at 3 25 per cent and rising bank of canada assets in response to the covid 19 pandemic the bank of canada introduced a large number of lending programs and used non interest rate tools known as nonconventional monetary policy to provide liquidity to the financial markets and stimulate the economy this led to an unprecedented increase in the bank of canada s balance sheet with the central bank buying more than half a trillion dollars of financial assets primarily in the form of government of canada securities before the pandemic the bank of canada s holdings of securities were about 100 billion the expansion in the bank of canada s balance sheet led to a huge injection of liquidity in the financial system and led to an increase in the reserves that commercial banks have in their accounts with the bank of canada in fact these reserves increased by more than 1 500 times their pre covid amount such increases in bank reserves are generally considered to be inflationary restoring faith in the bank of canada the bank of canada s recent aggressive monetary tightening will be transmitted to the real economy through higher interest rates and lower asset prices including housing prices and will most likely kill the post covid economic expansion with inflation seemingly out of control central banks appear to be losing credibility the public trusts central banks to protect the buying power of money but the increasing cost of living is eroding this trust the bank of canada and other central banks including the federal reserve the european central bank and the bank of england are all desperately trying to fight inflation and restore their credibility in canada this restoration has involved the unprecedented increases in the bank of canada s policy rate that have taken place since the beginning of the year curiously other countries that are facing the same supply chain problems and higher energy prices as us are not struggling with inflation as high as ours for example the inflation rate in switzerland is 3 4 per cent in japan is 2 3 per cent and in china is 2 4 per cent but why this is the case is another conversation entirely author apostolos serletis professor of economics university of calgary

by december the census bureau predicts that 3 8 million people will likely be evicted from their homes rents have increased 23 since july 2020 though last month the corporate media is bragging that they fell by 0 1 out of control inflation effectively amounts to an additional rent increase and the billionaire class is eagerly trying to trigger another recession last fall voters in the twin cities showed overwhelming support for rent control in minneapolis voters passed a process to develop a strong rent control policy though mayor frey ensured renters could not directly craft a proposal in neighboring st paul voters actually passed what amounted to the strongest rent control in the country capping rent increases at 3 and excluded developer friendly loopholes like vacancy decontrol and exemptions within days after the election democratic party politicians were already working with corporate landlords and big developers to gut these two proposals in minneapolis city council unanimously set up a work group which allowed big developers to directly shape the future policy in st paul the city council did a similar thing except to retroactively review read as water down the policy that passed by popular vote socialist alternative mn played a leading role in fighting for strong rent control alongside renters unions faith groups working class homeowners in a coalition called minneapolis united for rent control after months of backroom dealmaking the exclusively democratic party run st paul city council has announced an amended policy that amounts to an utter betrayal of last fall s vote which was driven by renters and working class people the amended proposal includes full vacancy decontrol which incentivizes evictions by allowing landlords to raise the rents as much as they want in between tenants it also includes a 20 year exemption for new construction which incentivizes gentrification as a first step all elected officials who claim to represent renters should vote no against this corporate rent control policy and rigged process and host mass meetings of renters and working class homeowners to discuss how to rebuild a grassroots movement to win strong rent control however this sell out betrayal should be a warning as millions already face eviction the democratic party is already doubling down on trickle down housing economics with the looming threat of a recession on the horizon it s essential that renters and working class homeowners build independent movements rooted in grassroots organizing and direct action to fight foreclosures and evictions wall street speculation fuels a new housing crisis politicians on both sides of the aisle spent trillions to stave off economic collapse during the pandemic even though only a fraction of this spending ended up in the hands of working class people it had a huge impact however the lion s share of the pandemic bailouts went to enriching ceos inflating stock prices and directly to wall street trillions of dollars of stimulus ended up in a housing price bubble wall street speculators and working class people looking to buy a home competed for the same zero interest loans being offered by the fed in 2020 the federal reserve owned 1 4 trillion in mortgage back securities and was hoping to reduce that amount by 2022 the fed owned 2 7 trillion this home buying frenzy squeezed renters bringing rental vacancy rates to historically low levels total spending on housing rent payments mortgages repairs new constructions etc amounts to 18 of gdp in the united states and most analysts now clearly state the housing market is in a recession today home values in 97 of u s cities are overvalued now that interest rates have increased mortgages have gotten more expensive leading to a slowdown in home buying new home sales last month were down 30 percent from the previous year the chief economist at fitch ratings said no one s really sure how bad it will get but jp morgan goldman sachs and moody s analytics all predict 10 declines in home related spending for comparison the 2007 financial meltdown brought 26 declines in home related spending however declining home prices do not automatically help renters because the people who own homes at inflated prices can t afford to sell this phenomenon is called house rich cash poor and a recent poll found 59 of new homeowners feel this way this means less spending in other sections of the economy if a new recession brings mass layoffs or if wages stay stagnant these homeowners could feel compelled to refinance their valuable mortgages to get access to desperately needed cash the la times reports that 90 of the subprime loans in the leadup to the 2007 financial collapse originated this way the crisis facing renters this home buying frenzy followed by stagnation in the housing market spells disaster for renters on average there are 14 renters competing for every apartment in 2022 there are now well documented cases of bidding wars in major cities where renters offer to pay above the asking prices of the apartment a huge factor to this is an underlying lack of housing supply there is a 7 million unit shortage of apartments priced for working class people builder confidence is at the lowest level since the 2008 meltdown only one million units of public housing exist in america after decades of chronic underfunding and neglect by both republicans and democrats even though in cities like vienna public housing is still highly desired the apartment vacancy rate nationally is the lowest in decades in new york city it is below 5 1 in manhattan in the bay area and los angeles it s around 3 5 it s not just limited to urban centers the vacancy rate in orange county and the inland empire is around 2 5 currently the average renter now needs to make 24 90 an hour in order to spend less than a third of their income on rent yet because of democratic party inaction a third of all workers still make less than 15 out of control inflation eating away into the value of every paycheck amounts to an effective rent increase even if your landlord didn t increase the rent by a penny millions of people are threatened with evictions because of rising rents formal eviction through the courts are returning to pre pandemic levels many renters are getting priced out in between leases new leases are an average additional 300 or more per month compared to 160 per month for renewing an existing lease in cities where there was a 1 rent increase over the previous three months there was a 2 increase in the eviction rate many corporate landlords were already illegally evicting people during the pandemic which is why building a movement to actually resist evictions is so essential one congressional investigation looked into the abusive practices of four corporate landlords who each own tens of thousands of rental homes they carried out 14 744 illegal evictions between march 15 2020 and july 29 2021 while collecting 2 million in forgiven paycheck protection program funds property managers were told to intimidate and lie to tenants about their rights property managers carried out this directive with evident glee with one writing to an executive and a regional manager that he love getting to say that this means the eviction may happen sooner than expected and seeing the look on their faces stop the st paul sellout build an effective resistance to wall street s next housing crisis the democratic party presided over the last foreclosure and eviction crisis and they did nothing now as a new crisis emerges they are once again refusing to take meaningful action and in cities like minneapolis and st paul they are fighting tooth and nail to block any grassroots attempts to protect renters first and foremost we need to be clear to renters about what is going on in st paul the councilmember closest to unions and renters rights groups mitra jalali has introduced amendments in opposition to the sell out deal however her amendments like reducing the new construction exemption from 20 years to 15 years do not fundamentally challenge the pro corporate character of the proposed policy she should clearly call for a no vote and begin mobilizing renters to fully oppose the rotten deal in minneapolis there are three dsa members elected onto city council and two additional city councilmembers who support passing a strong rent control policy that caps rents at 3 and excludes policies like vacancy decontrol and exemptions for new construction they need to clearly oppose the st paul sellout reverse their previous support for a similar work group in minneapolis and start mobilizing minneapolis renters to support renters in st paul socialist alternative seattle city councilmember kshama sawant is an example of how elected officials can overcome entrenched corporate opposition in an elected government often starting as the sole vote in favor of an issue kshama has won victory after victory for working class people by running independent of the democratic party and basing her strength on the power of social justice movements unions social justice organizations and working class homeowners need to unite with renters to form grassroots anti eviction committees in every building these committees should be based on the power of mass organizing and direct action even to the point of physically resisting evictions if necessary an effective anti eviction movement will primarily confront democratic party politicians which is why political independence is essential socialist alternative has direct experience with this during the last recession finally we need to bring down rents and mortgage payments and we can do this by building millions of high quality permanently affordable environmentally friendly homes that are socially owned and paid for by taxing corporations and billionaires we need to bail out working class homeowners whose mortgages are worth more than the value of their homes because of speculation we need democratic control of housing finance to truly guarantee housing for human need not wall street greed

for commercial production and sale of natural gas from the wells at wareena 1 the wellhead pressure was approximately 2 300 pounds square inch based on a measurement taken prior to the workover in

opinion editor s note editorials represent the opinions of the star tribune editorial board which operates independently from the newsroom minnesota auditor julie blaha is pushing for the state to adopt what are known as esg investment guidelines short for environmental social governance quietly more corporations of all sizes have begun adopting these same principles to guide their investment portfolios it s a welcome development so what does esg investment mean like all investments it s about calculating risk and return increasingly especially when it comes to climate corporations are viewing fossil fuel investments as having increased risk investors are moving away from polluters blaha told an editorial writer the evidence is clear that it makes sense to consider climate when making investments to move away from fossil fuels and toward a net zero carbon impact polluters are going to be more heavily regulated and pose a greater risk it just makes good economic sense as the market changes the state board of investment sbi manages state assets and is also responsible for several statewide retirement systems and other investment plans recently the board introduced formal recommendations that respond to climate change a three part sbi report on climate change lays out evidence that rising global temperatures are changing the level of risk for some investments and recommends that factoring in climate change is a critical long term strategy for protecting investment funds we have the data we have options and now it s time to choose a course of action blaha said we have an obligation to protect the state s investments and the pension funds for government workers teachers nurses and others who depend on us to make wise decisions the roll call of corporations that have adopted esg guidelines features some of the biggest names microsoft nike accenture texas instruments motorola hewlett packard adobe apple eli lilly and thousands more it is not limited to any one sector or type of business these are all companies looking for strong stock performance and growth they ve found that focusing on ethical environmental and socially responsible values can be enhancements not detriments billionaire michael bloomberg has become a champion for investments that consider climate change he founded the task force on climate related financial disclosures which has gotten thousands of companies to provide data on emissions and exposure to climate risks voluntarily these and other firms want to be able to price climate risk into their investment decisions and without accurate and reliable data they can t do that bloomberg wrote in a piece for bloomberg news he added that the securities and exchange commission is in the process of adopting reporting requirements built on the framework his task force has created he puts the cost of climate change driven weather events at more than 100 billion annually accounting for these and other losses isn t social policy he wrote it s smart investing refusing to allow firms to do it comes with big costs to taxpayers but esg s growing popularity has set off a severe backlash states with significant fossil fuel interests particularly republican led states such as texas oklahoma and florida have labeled such practices woke investing and are aiming to punish such companies in texas that has meant a law barring local governments from doing business with banks that have esg policies against fossil fuels and for good measure guns why guns it s texas according to a wharton business school study that has already cost taxpayers 532 million in additional costs why cities are now limited as to who can underwrite their municipal bonds this situation was exacerbated after some of the largest underwriters in the country left the texas market including jpmorgan chase goldman sachs bank of america and fidelity blaha a democrat running for re election against republican ryan wilson argues that corporations aren t weighing climate change impact because they re particularly woke but instead because it makes good financial sense blaha favors the nuanced recommendations in the report sib commissioned it boils down to three simple things she said take a climate aware approach to investing aim ultimately for a net zero carbon portfolio and as a last resort the divestment approach there are no guarantees in the stock market ever but the growing realization that flouting climate change carries considerable risk is long overdue

we first identified all firms registered with the sec in the country next we filtered out firms that don t offer financial planning services those that don t primarily serve individual clients and those that have disclosures on their record the qualifying firms were then ranked according to the following criteria aum firms with more total assets under management are ranked higher firms with more total assets under management are ranked higher individual client count firms that serve more individual clients as opposed to institutional clients are ranked higher firms that serve more individual clients as opposed to institutional clients are ranked higher clients per advisor firms with a lower ratio of clients per financial advisor are ranked higher firms with a lower ratio of clients per financial advisor are ranked higher years in business firms that have been in business longer are ranked higher firms that have been in business longer are ranked higher fee structure

relationship with smartasset in which smartasset is compensated for lead referrals such relationships have no impact on our rankings and firms are included and ranked based strictly on the above criteria smartasset is not a client of the aforementioned firms smartasset did not receive compensation for including any of the firms on the aforementioned list why work with an advisor we believe it s more important now than ever to review your retirement plan with a fiduciary financial advisor here s why the pandemic has shown us just how quickly decades of planning investing and saving can be completely upended this could mean your current financial plan might leave you without enough money to last your retirement additionally emotionally charged decisions to sell off large quantities of stocks or other investments now lock in your losses removing any chance for future growth research suggests people who work with a financial advisor feel more at ease about their finances and could end up with about 15 more money to spend in retirement 1 consider this example a recent vanguard study found that on average a hypothetical 500k investment would grow to over 3 4 million under the care of an advisor over 25 years whereas the expected value from self management would be 1 69 million or 50 less in other words an advisor managed portfolio would average 8 annualized growth over a 25 year period compared to 5 from a self managed portfolio 2 a 2020 northwestern mutual study found that 71 of u s adults admit their financial planning needs improvement however only 29 of americans work with a financial advisor 3 assuming 5 annualized growth of 500k portfolio vs 8 annualized growth of advisor managed portfolio over 25 years the hypothetical study discussed above assumes a 5 net return and a 3 net annual value add for professional financial advice to performance based on the vanguard whitepaper putting a value on your value quantifying vanguard advisor s alpha please

democratic congressional candidate matt castelli on monday made his strongest statement yet in opposition to an assault weapons ban we do not support an ill defined assault weapons ban that fails to address keeping our cops our kids and communities safe he said speaking at a zoom news conference to release his moderate party platform castelli also called for bail reform at the state level and said he opposes defunding the police as he attempts to attract voters dissatisfied with the current direction of the two major political parties the campaign also announced it has established a moderate party of new york website at moderatepartyny com the platform calls for safety and security building a strong economy abortion rights gay and transgender rights requiring verification for voters securing the united states borders requiring verification for voters setting term limits for members of congress prohibiting members of congress from trading in stocks while in office and cracking down on unfair china trade practices the written platform outlined in a news release is primarily generalities with few specifics castelli who is challenging u s rep elise stefanik r schuylerville in the 21st district said the platform is designed to reach voters who feel a sense of being politically homeless among the vocal factions of both political parties castelli said that vermont sen bernie sanders and the squad a group of six progressive democratic house members that includes alexandria ocasio cortez and jamaal bowman both of the bronx ilhan omar of minnesota ayanna pressley of massachusetts rashida tlaib of michigan and cori bush of missouri are extreme democrats as is stefanik and the ultra maga on the republican side there are two sides to the extreme coin said castelli a former cia counterterrorism official who lives in glens falls castelli s campaign organized the independent moderate party line providing him a second ballot line in the november general election the ballot line is for the november election only castelli is the only candidate running on the line it is not an organized political party and does not have any leadership outside the castelli campaign on gun control the platform states that castelli will protect and defend the second amendment support common sense measures like universal background checks that keep our cops our kids and our communities safe while protecting the rights of law abiding gun owners throughout the democratic primary which castelli won with more than 80 of the vote castelli faced criticism from primary opponent matt putorti because castelli would not take a position on an assault weapons ban stefanik supporters such as warren county republican chairman george ferone likewise have accused castelli of attempting to hide his support of an assault weapons ban castelli at the news conference on monday did not carte blanche denounce an assault weapons ban but seemed to make the strongest statement against one so far on public safety castelli reiterated that he opposes defunding the police a term that generally means redirecting spending for police departments to other areas such as social workers and community services we are going to fully fund the police blue lives matter he said a number of police unions have endorsed stefanik castelli in the news conference called for changes to new york s bail law which many law enforcement officials have criticized as leading to increased crime new york state bail reform has become a disaster he said commenting that it is a state not a federal issue castelli said he is calling for changes because police officers and district attorneys in the congressional district have raised concerns with him about the 2019 bail reform law that eliminated cash bail in most instances asked about specific changes to the law that he would recommend castelli did not identify any castelli said that he has not spoken with gov kathy hochul or area state legislators about his concerns about bail reform asked if he supports calls from republican gubernatorial candidate lee zeldin and new york city mayor eric adams a democrat for the legislature to immediately convene a special session to discuss bail reform castelli said he would leave that up to the legislature the stefanik campaign said that castelli appears to have changed his position on bail reform citing a comment castelli made at the town hall forum at otsego county in august in which castelli spoke generally about concern about the law being oriented more to the new york city area without specifically calling for changes to the law we may not have as much of a threat that is faced in communities downstate that bail reform may be an effective solution and i am not sure i would have to experience downstate to speak on that but i sure as heck wish we had stronger voices representing the upstate communities when any of these laws are being considered that impacts us at a state level castelli said at the time the castelli campaign contacted to respond said castelli has consistently been opposed to the 2009 bail reform law that remark is clearly taken out of context the castelli campaign said in a statement castelli said at the news conference that he was a registered independent for much of his adult life he said he voted for republican presidential candidate john mccain in 2008 and democrat barack obama in 2012 the stefanik campaign said that castelli is not a moderate this downstate democrat is desperately trying to trick voters into pretending to be a moderate voters are smart it s why every law enforcement union has endorsed congresswoman stefanik and why exactly zero law enforcement unions have endorsed her opponent said alex degrasse a stefanik senior adviser

the toyota family first said in the beginning of this year we started off with everything new from scratch everything like we had to put trailers together cars together deals and we got a lot of good parts from dsr and dsm don schumacher manufacturing and then we bought some other stuff from all over the place so with new equipment new cars and new team members we started putting this team together and lo and behold right now is that it all started coming together we thought we had a car that we could win seattle didn t go our way then we got to topeka we stuck out there and then we had

bpt from seeking more fuel efficiency or seating capacity to replacing an older or less reliable car there are many reasons to be in the market for a vehicle today whatever the reason may be when it comes to purchasing there are a variety of factors to consider to set you up for success after all since the average american drives thousands of miles per year buying a car is a major decision that can be made easier with a thoughtful approach to help in your vehicle search consider asking yourself these questions 1 where should i buy determining who to buy from can play an important role in the overall experience and there is no shortage of options like traditional dealerships online retailers individual sellers or rental car companies that offer pre owned vehicles for sale buying from a seller you trust can pay big dividends when it comes to peace of mind consider whether you know the seller if buying from a retailer versus an individual consider how long they have been in business and if they have an upstanding reputation especially when it comes to providing exceptional customer service additionally who you buy from can impact if you ll need to negotiate on price which not everyone enjoys doing some dealers offer no haggle pricing meaning the price listed is the price you ll pay or price transparency which means the vehicle price taxes fees and other costs are clearly labeled and presented upfront 2 will i be purchasing a reliable vehicle no matter who you buy from ensuring that you are buying a high quality vehicle is of the utmost importance do your research before signing on the dotted line and always conduct a test drive if you can some dealers also offer additional benefits to help protect a purchase for example all vehicles purchased through enterprise car sales are enterprise certified and pass an inspection by ase certified technicians these vehicles also come with a 12 month 12 000 mile limited powertrain warranty 12 months of roadside assistance and offer a seven day return policy 3 how soon do i need the vehicle today lead times to obtain vehicles can vary widely for example wait times for a build to order car that is a car custom ordered from a factory may last up to 12 weeks with some lead times lasting six months to more than a year on the contrary many used car sellers feature inventory that is readily available so you can select from options that you know are in stock including different makes and models with a wide range of different features if you need a vehicle now purchasing a used car could be a faster option 4 how do i want to purchase the vehicle purchasing a vehicle today can be done in a variety of different ways choosing a seller that matches your buying preference is something to consider buying a car in person remains a common option but vehicles today can also be purchased in many states without ever stepping foot inside a dealership there are hybrid purchasing models as well for example enterprise car sales customers have the option to begin their purchase online and finalize it at one of the many enterprise dealerships across the u s if they choose there are several considerations to keep in mind when shopping for a vehicle today and there is no one size fits all approach said mike bystrom vice president at enterprise car sales one thing is certain regardless of how or where you choose to purchase you shouldn t have to compromise on receiving great customer service

backlash is growing after an environmental watchdog recently urged consumers not to buy lobster with petitions against the organization and calls to boycott businesses that support it drawing national food retailers whole foods market blue apron and hello fresh into the fray monterey bay aquarium s seafood watch added the u s lobster fishery to a red list of seafood to avoid last week because the group says it s harvested in ways that are likely to harm wildlife or the environment american lobster was included because of the risk that endangered north atlantic right whales can become entangled in vertical lobstering lines fourteen types of seafood were added to the list on sept 5 members and supporters of the maine lobster industry which landed 108 million pounds of lobster in 2021 at a value of 735 million immediately denounced the listing as unfair no right whale deaths can be attributed to maine gear industry backers said and there have been no documented entanglements in maine gear since 2004 shortly after the red listing meal kit delivery services blue apron and hello fresh both announced they would no longer include lobster in their menus in response calls to boycott those companies began circulating on social media whole foods market which is listed as a partner of seafood watch on its website also was targeted however a whole foods spokesperson said that while the company is a partner with seafood watch the upscale supermarket chain isn t pulling lobster from its stores or planning to stop buying lobster because of the listing at this time we will continue to sell american lobster from fisheries that are certified sustainable by the marine stewardship council the spokesperson said this includes the gulf of maine lobster fishery which is currently msc certified advertisement still the company has been drawing ire from some lobster lovers on sunday portland restaurant j s oyster posted a call on its facebook page to boycott whole foods whole foods will stop carrying live lobsters because they say it is inhumane the post read stop shopping there j s oyster is closed mondays and could not be reached for comment but the post may refer to a 2006 ban whole foods placed on live lobster due to concerns about stress the animals experience during shipment however the whole foods spokesperson said the portland store maine s only whole foods location is exempt from that ban our portland store is the one whole foods market store in the country that has the ability to carry live lobsters he said he explained that the lack of lobsters in the store monday was because they were out of stock managers and associates at whole foods in portland would not comment on public reaction to the seafood watch listing jacob johnson a lobsterman fishing out of tenant s harbor posted on facebook on monday that he s thinking about suing seafood watch advertisement i m serious about doing something he said he called the red listing slander and said he is trying to pursue a class action lawsuit i feel that something needs to be done we re not doing any harm and just seems like we re getting hit hard and it s not going to end and they suffer no repercussions i ve never seen a right whale in maine waters he said during a telephone interview monday i ve never even heard of a right whale they don t even care about the right whales because if they did they would have approached it differently and it s all about the lobstermen and the right whales and nobody else and nothing else they don t care if anybody s seeing them they don t care about them it s obvious meanwhile maine s congressional delegation and gov janet mills who have been vocal about their opposition to the red listing since its announcement sent a letter to seafood watch on thursday urging the group to reconsider the listing the letter said the accusation that maine lobster fishermen are responsible for right whale deaths is flat out wrong related maine politicians scramble to show support for lobster industry right whales are not dying in maine lobster gear and the report blindly ignores everything that maine lobstermen have done to create a sustainable industry the letter states make no mistake your designation will have a real world impact with the industry already facing challenges the inaccurate designation will hurt the thousands of hardworking lobstermen their families and businesses across our state at a news conference about the red listing u s sen angus king said here s one of the things that really frosts me the maine lobster industry has done a hell of a lot over the past 10 15 years to mitigate whatever risk there is even though the risk hasn t been demonstrated he read a section of the seafood watch report on the red listing that stated that effectiveness of mitigation efforts put forth by the canadian and u s lobster industries has not been proven we got to prove that what we re doing works they don t have to prove a damn thing he said that s what i just don t get i ve never experienced anything like this advertisement virginia olsen the maine lobstering union s director said the red listing does not pass the straight face test she too pointed out that no right whales have been found entangled in gear that could be attributed to the maine lobster fishery despite it being the largest fixed gear fishery while right whales have been found entangled in gear that is attributed to massachusetts and canada i think the hardest part for us is that we ve already been found guilty and we haven t had any sort of proof that we re guilty she said she claimed that ship strikes cause more right whale deaths than entanglement yet there was no advisory against products carried in cargo ships or against vacationing on cruise ships the maine lobster marketing collaborative also has begun a petition against the seafood watch listing on change org saying its decision to red list lobster is not supported by facts and is counterproductive the monterey bay aquarium s decision ignores a long history of efforts from the fishery designed to protect right whales including removal of more than 27 000 miles of floating rope the use of weak links designed to allow whales to break free in the rare event they are entangled and distinctive gear marking as well as compliance and collaboration with state and federal rule makers on all regulations the petition reads maine lobster has always been sustainable and the baseless decision by the seafood watch program greatly impacts an industry that is the backbone of the economy in maine supporting entire communities composed of generations of fishermen who have always prioritized the health of the fishery and the gulf of maine the petition had more than 1 150 signatures as of monday afternoon send questions comments to the editors previous next filed under
benefits will rely in large part on what the bureau of labor statistics says about the consumer price index on monday stock markets kept up their positive momentum from last week as investors were willing to look on the bright side of all the economic uncertainties facing the world right now as we ve seen on many occasions in the past the nasdaq composite ixic 1 79 led the way higher but the s p 500 gspc 1 20 also managed to climb more than 1 and even the lagging dow jones industrial average dji 0 65 put in a solid performance index daily percentage change daily point change dow 0 71 230 s p 500 1 06 43 nasdaq 1 27 154 the bear market in stocks in 2022 has taken its toll on everyone s finances but older americans who have invested all their lives have seen the value of their retirement nest eggs fall sharply this year at the same time expenses have gone up dramatically due to inflation affecting retirees regardless of how much they have in savings investors across the market are looking forward to the tuesday release of the latest consumer price index reading for august as it will give another indicator of whether inflation has truly peaked yet for those receiving social security the report has added significance as you ll see below inflation expectations come down nearly everyone expects the monthly inflation figures to show flat to slightly downward prices for august forecasts among economists are calling for a 0 1 drop in the cpi compared to july s figures however you can expect the headlines about the report to remain focused on the big year over year change in the figure even with that level of a drop inflation over the past 12 months will remain at elevated levels above 8 that s more than four times the 2 mark that the federal reserve typically sets as its baseline annual inflation target the good news for investors though is that year over year inflation is likely to be down a full percentage point from its highest levels above the 9 mark earlier this summer that will further support the argument that inflationary pressures have already hit their peak moreover if energy prices continue to fall as they have in the first couple weeks of september it could bring even lower inflation levels why it matters for social security meanwhile americans receiving social security will also be watching the latest inflation figures closely that s because the august report provides one of the three monthly numbers that go into determining how big a cost of living adjustment cola social security will pay out starting in january in simplest terms the social security administration takes one measure of the cpi for july august and september and averages the three months numbers together it then compares the result to the average for the same period last year if inflation does indeed stay flat or ease lower in august then it just about guarantees that the social security cola won t reach the double digit percentage figures that some have hoped to see however it would leave a roughly 9 boost to monthly benefits very much on the table obviously what the result is will be critical to those seniors living primarily on the income generated by social security however even those who ve been successful in accumulating savings over their lifetimes are nervous about the volatile financial markets and the resulting hit to their portfolio balances a slightly larger monthly check from social security could go a long way toward restoring confidence that at least one source of retirement income is reliable and able to stand up to inflationary pressures
the legal concept of conflicts of laws is difficult to say the least confounding even seasoned litigators and judges with bulky treatises and entire law school classes devoted to the subject generally speaking the term of art conflicts of laws refers to the question of how to determine which state s laws provide the rules of decision to resolve a particular problem controversy or dispute for example when a business divorce litigant sues he or she may allege a mix of substantive claims like breach of contract breach of fiduciary duty and accounting among any number of other colorful claims in the business divorce litigant s palette conflicts of laws problems arise when the entity is incorporated in one state for example delaware but the entity operated the applicable contract was made or the alleged tortious activity occurred in another state for example new york to determine whether the plaintiff sufficiently alleged or proved the essential elements of a legal cause of action the court must first determine which state s laws govern the claim sometimes a claim will be sufficient under the laws of one state but insufficient under another so the conflict of law analysis may be outcome determinative of whether the plaintiff can pursue or recover on a particular claim things can get even more tricky when one state s laws refer the court back to the other state s laws and vice versa this circularity problem is called renvoi transactional lawyers avoid the renvoi problem by including choice of law provisions in their contracts containing language that disputes arising under the contract will be governed by the laws of a particular state without regard to principles of conflicts of laws or words to that effect things can get trickier still when a lawsuit is venued in federal court based upon diversity jurisdiction and the court must under the erie doctrine apply state substantive law but federal procedural law the matrimonial turned business divorce dispute recently manhattan matrimonial division justice douglas e hoffman issued an interesting decision addressing some complicated choice of law questions in a business divorce dispute between italian billionaire silvio scaglia scaglia and his business partner spouse julia haart haart over haart s alleged misappropriation of 850 000 in cash from a delaware entity freedom holding inc freedom one day after she was informed of her imminent termination as ceo of freedom s wholly owned subsidiary high profile modeling agency elite world group inc ewg in the resulting decision freedom holding inc v haart 2022 ny slip op 22225 justice hoffman rejected haart s assertion that delaware law applied across the board to freedom and scaglia s claims simply by virtue of the entity s incorporation in delaware before we get to the facts how did freedom end up in the matrimonial division freedom is yet another example among many we have written about read here and here where a matrimonial dispute spawned parallel business divorce litigation in freedom the parties fought hard over whether the case should be venued in the commercial division or the matrimonial division with haart prevailing in that particular battle scaglia and haart s matrimonial turned business divorce litigation also spawned separate litigation in delaware chancery court with haart suffering a major loss earlier this year read here when vice chancellor morgan t zurn issued an exhaustive post trial decision rejecting haart s claim she was an owner of freedom s preferred stock the amended complaint and the dismissal motion according to the amended complaint in freedom scaglia and haart became equal 50 shareholders of freedom s common stock after scaglia gifted haart her shares in anticipation of their imminent ultimately short lived marriage freedom in turn was the sole member of ewg ewg was one of the plaintiffs in freedom though it voluntarily withdrew its claims based upon haart s alleged misappropriation of 850 000 from freedom freedom and scaglia alleged five causes of action conversion breach of fiduciary duty breach of contract unjust enrichment and constructive trust haart moved to dismiss all claims but breach of fiduciary duty you can read the brief here here and here haart advocated for delaware law under the internal affairs doctrine except as to the breach of contract claim which she conceded was governed by new york law because her alleged oral promise not to withdraw money from freedom in excess of 250 000 was made in new york freedom and scaglia advocated for new york law except as to the breach of fiduciary duty claim which they conceded was governed by delaware law under the internal affairs doctrine as a result the court was required to determine the applicable law for three claims conversion unjust enrichment and constructive trust an outsized portion of the briefing focused on the conversion claim in haart s view delaware law provides that a cause of action for conversion is improper where as here a claim for the payment of money is involved in the resulting decision justice hoffman provided a nuanced treatment of the choice of law question analyzing each claim independently the choice of law framework under new york s choice of law framework wrote justice hoffman the initial question is whether there is a difference between the laws of delaware or new york for the claims and if no conflict exists between the laws of the jurisdictions involved there is no reason to engage in a choice of law analysis quotation omitted if there is an actual conflict between the two state s laws the next question becomes which state new york or delaware has the greatest interest in the application of its laws to the particular dispute usually determined by which state has the most significant contacts to the matter in the controversy the internal affairs doctrine according to haart delaware had the greatest interest in the dispute under the internal affairs doctrine because of freedom s incorporation in delaware justice hoffman took a far more narrow view of the doctrine writing that the conflict of laws internal affairs doctrine could apply and result in application of delaware choice of law only if the claims are regarding the internal affairs of a delaware entity and its officers directors or shareholders as such justice hoffman wrote that the internal affairs doctrine only governs the choice of law determinations involving matters peculiar to corporations that is those activities concerning the relationships inter se of the corporation its directors officers and shareholders not to all claims automatically simply because they relate to a business entity quotations omitted the court ruled haart is not alleged to be an officer or director of freedom and lthough she is alleged to hold 50 of the common but not preferred shares of freedom she is not alleged to be its controlling shareholder for fiduciary duty purposes therefore held the court the complaint does not allege sufficient facts to require application of delaware law to these three claims quotations omitted presumably to protect itself on appeal the court noted that it would nonetheless where appropriate consider delaware law out of abundance of caution disposition of the claims the court applied both new york and delaware law to the conversion claim ruling that the claim was insufficient under either state s laws the court held the tort of conversion whether in delaware or new york has roots in common law and new york would take a similar view of alleged conversion of non specific monies claims for conversion of monies are allowed only if the funds in question were separate distinct separately identifiable and not commingled with other monies the court ruled that under either state s laws the cash haart allegedly misappropriated was not separately identifiable and dismissed the claim as currently alleged without prejudice to plaintiff s remaining claims or if so advised appropriate amended allegations if they were to sufficiently allege a conversion claim haart challenged the unjust enrichment claim as duplicative of others particularly the breach of contract claim the court applied new york law to the unjust enrichment claim but also wrote there does not appear to be a substantive difference however between the laws of new york and delaware on the issue of whether potentially duplicative claims may be allowed at this stage of the proceeding under each pleading in the alternative at this stage may be allowed in other words the court declined to dismiss the unjust enrichment claim as duplicative on the grounds that a plaintiff is entitled to plead alterative or inconsistent legal theories but signaled that it might later consider doing so at the appropriate time in a final paragraph justice hoffman disposed of the constructive trust claim as alleged by scaglia only for lack of standing leaving the claim to survive as alleged by freedom and the applicable law being that of new york outcome if there s any takeaway from freedom it s that business divorce litigants and their counsel should devote careful attention to the conflict of laws analysis when litigating claims in new york relating to foreign incorporated entities wooden reliance on the internal affairs doctrine may be shortsighted where the claims relate to a discrete transaction or conduct not directly related to or dependent upon the parties unique roles as directors officers shareholders managers or members that said i could see other thoughtful judges disagreeing with the court s internal affairs doctrine holding for the simple reason that it is hard to see in what capacity other than as a fiduciary of freedom haart allegedly misappropriated money from the business perhaps we will eventually get clarification on this difficult issue from the appeals court

billion to 1 4 billion on a positive note the company added over 800 000 postpaid phone accounts and 300 000 net fiber customers making 2q22 one of the company s best for customer additions management attributed the negative cash results to higher corporate expenses related to 5g and to an increase in the number of customers late on bill payments through all of this at t has kept up its quarterly dividend payments the company has an enviable history of reliability while it has made adjustments to the dividend to ensure payment the company has never missed a quarterly payment since it started paying out common share dividends in 1984 the current payment was declared at the end of june and paid out on august 1 at 27 75 cents per share that annualizes to 1 11 and gives a yield of 6 5 the

ocean power technologies nyse american optt is a right place right time company or so it would seem at least the company had a lot to prove to financially minded investors in its just released fiscal q1 2023 earnings report however i am neutral on ocean power technologies stock as the company didn t demonstrate progress in pursuit of profitability headquartered in new jersey ocean power technologies provides maritime data as well as power harnessed from the renewable energy of ocean waves it s a high conviction business to be involved in as governments around the world are implementing clean power initiatives in the 2020s for example president joseph biden signed the inflation reduction act sometimes also called the clean energy bill into law in august this law earmarks 370 billion toward national efforts to reduce america s greenhouse gas emissions 40 below 2005 levels by 2030 it s part of a global green energy trend that should benefit hydroelectric energy companies like ocean power technologies however optt stock traders might not be convinced yet that the company is financially viable enough to provide superior value to the shareholders thus there s a lot at stake with each and every quarterly earnings report if ocean power technologies can t prove itself on the fiscal and operational fronts as a competitive hydro power business shareholders might find themselves adrift and rudderless ocean power technologies had notable achievements in fy2022 from an operational standpoint ocean power technologies moved full steam ahead in fiscal year 2022 it could be argued that for such a small company market cap of 56 million ocean power achieved a lot during a short period of time probably the most notable accomplishment during fy2022 was ocean power s acquisition of marine advanced robotics mar based in california mar develops and manufactures autonomous surface vehicles or uncrewed equipment in waters around the world these surface vessels range from eight feet 2 4 meters to 100 feet 30 meters mar s price tag at 11 million was hefty but will likely provide ocean power technologies with robust revenue in the long run the company contends that mar expands ocean power s commercial offering into autonomous vehicles for maritime data services and expects mar to contribute roughly 2 million to ocean power s fiscal year 2023 revenue after the mar acquisition ocean power technologies most interesting recent achievement would be a contract from the u s department of energy doe that could be worth over 1 million specifically the doe selected ocean power for the phase ii development of a next generation wave energy converter over a period of 18 to 24 months ocean power technologies will receive up to 1 097 212 from the doe for this contract after disappointing past results optt needed a home run these notable achievements can provide some encouragement to ocean power technologies investors however at the end of the day the bottom line is the bottom line can ocean power demonstrate earnings growth this question should be top of mind for the company s shareholders as ocean power s past results were lackluster at best and disappointing at worst this isn t to suggest that ocean power technologies has failed on all fiscal fronts in fact the company increased its revenue to 756 000 during q4 of its fiscal 2022 furthermore for the full fiscal year ocean power grew its revenue to 1 76 million on the other hand as mentioned earlier ocean power technologies had to cough up a lot of dough to acquire mar indeed ocean power acknowledged the overhang of expenses related to the acquisition of mar as the company s selling general and administrative costs increased in recent quarters as a result ocean power technologies demonstrated no earnings growth whatsoever from q4 fy2021 to q4 fy2022 during both of those quarters ocean power reported a net loss of 5 2 million probably not what the company s investors wanted to see ocean power technologies q1 2023 results came up short if you re only focused on revenue growth then you might say that ocean power technologies made the grade in its most recently reported quarterly results yet bottom line watchers will find a bright red flag as ocean power is according to one crucial metric at least moving in the wrong direction there s no denying that during q1 of fiscal 2023 which ended on july 31 2022 ocean power technologies maintained a powerful pace of revenue generation to be more specific the company increased its revenue to 714 000 marking a vast improvement over the 272 000 of revenue achieved in q1 fy2022 ocean power technologies president and ceo philipp stratmann exuded confidence stating i remain encouraged with our ability to achieve our 9 0 million bookings target for fiscal 2023 that s all fine and well but did the company make any progress toward achieving a profitable profile the answer regrettably is no as it turned out ocean power technologies quarterly net loss widened to 5 9 million contributing to this problem no doubt is the fact that ocean power s quarterly selling general and administrative costs increased by 166 000 quarter over quarter conclusion should you consider optt stock ocean power technologies has a lot going for it the company operates in an industry that should get a boost from the inflation reduction act it s also encouraging that ocean power scored a government contract that s potentially worth over 1 million these factors may help ocean power technologies maintain its impressive pace of revenue growth still ocean power s deepening quarterly losses are problematic therefore it s likely wise to stay docked on the sidelines rather than wade into the perilous market seas with optt stock disclosure

global force majeure coming after declaration of world war iii many financial obligations contracts and pensions will be vacated a series of events has been set in motion that we believe will end in a global force majeure act of god among western nations if this analysis is correct it means that many financial obligations potentially including social security us treasury debt pensions derivatives commodities paper contracts industrial deliverables insurance payout obligations etc would be nullified this appears to be part of the great reset plan to clear out us treasury debt and the overbearing debt of other western nations by defaulting without defaulting i e blaming some other great emergency for the cancellation of financial obligations and the wholesale resetting of the global money canvas in order to achieve this western nations must first invoke global war with either russia or china as we have exhaustively documented this year many efforts are under way by the biden regime controllers to ignite war with both adversaries the latest example is the ukrainian counteroffensive heavily hyped by western media that saw russian military forces withdraw from a region containing around 40 50 small villages and towns in order to avoid being encircled by ukrainian forces the key here is to understand that ukrainian forces were trained and led by nato military leaders while deploying nato equipment including high precision artillery and long range rocket artillery himars for example operated largely by british and american troops in effect the counteroffensive against this particular segment of russia s front lines in eastern ukraine was run primarily by the uk and usa not ukrainian military leadership this attack was the west s practical declaration of war against russia even if such a declaration has not yet been officially voiced russia already knows world war has begun will be declared soon russia fully recognizes this fact russia knows it is in a full scale war with nato and western europe not merely a special military operation that can be won with reserve units thus russia is preparing to now officially declare war against the west and invoke its full military forces to engage and destroy western europe in my analysis russia has come to the conclusion that nato will never allow russia to exist as a sovereign nation and russia now faces an existential threat from nato nations and western europe in general you may recall that russia had recently promised the world it would not use nuclear weapons unless it faced an existential threat the nato led ukrainian counteroffensive has now made it clear that russia does indeed face precisely such a threat and that failure to defeat nato as a whole will mean the end of russia there will be no coexistence either western europe nato or russia must be defeated thus the nato driven ukrainian counteroffensive just handed russia the internal justification it needed to escalate to a full scale war against the west which may include the deployment of nuclear weapons but will almost certainly see the use of non nuclear thermobaric weapons which are also devastating in their own way this escalation is exactly what biden and the democrats need to throw the world into chaos before the midterm elections biden s controllers already know they are facing an election wipeout in november by any means necessary they believe the november election must be thrown into chaos or democrats lose the house and possibly the senate rendering the biden administration largely ineffective for the next two years thus it is in the interests of democrats to see a world war emerge before halloween even if it means staging a nuclear detonation on a us city and blaming it on russia rest assured this is one of the options in their portfolio of doom that is being considered other options include a national power grid takedown scenario blamed on russian cyber attacks or a financial armageddon that would freeze banks halt all transactions and plunge the nation into instant chaos and civil unrest this can be accomplished at the flick of a switch all while blaming russia for a cyber attack the more aggressive russia s response to ukraine s counteroffensive the more quickly biden obama and the globalists can push us all into world war at which point they can invoke the same unconstitutional abuses of power that america saw in world war ii in case you re not familiar with what happened back then allow us to refresh your memory forced internment in concentration camps based on your ethnicity japanese internment government confiscation of commercial inventory from private and public companies government takeover of private business forcing war time production government price controls on strategic commodities criminalization of anti government speech rationing of clothing sugar coffee milk meat cheese butter and other foods citizens were handed rationing coupons and had to make do with limited supply of food basics in other words under war the us government became a dictatorship see these rationing line photos from world war ii in america to get an idea of what s coming but all under digital control and with constant surveillance by the government this is exactly what democrats are trying to achieve yet again as a way to keep themselves in power and nullify the constitution as well as elections they simply need putin to declare war and start launching more aggressive weapons including thermobaric missile strikes that can be claimed as nuclear weapons by the dishonest media once the big bombs start dropping biden s handlers just throw the kill switches to take down the power grid and banking institutions then declare putin has unleashed cyber warfare against america that will be almost instantly followed by wartime powers declarations and the unleashing of military occupation across america combined with the government suspension of all constitutional rights a hyperbaric missile detonation near a sea vessel covid 19 lockdowns were a dry run for precisely this scenario under the ndaa signed into law by obama in 2012 the federal government has the unrestricted power to seize all food farms fuel ammunition commodities fertilizer and anything else it deems to be a strategic national resource all they need now is war the current trajectory puts us into world war iii in a matter of weeks unless cooler heads prevail we are on a trajectory to world war iii in what could be a matter of a few weeks russia is rumored to be just days away from its own declaration of war against the west and this would almost certainly be followed by a stepping up of missile attacks against western cities such as berlin paris london and perhaps even brussels notably western european nations have no means to stop hypersonic missile strikes nor any real means to stop russia s mid range nuclear missiles such as the iskander missiles which are nuclear capable thus russia can turn europe s cities into rubble in mere minutes quite literally the flight time is under 3 minutes meaning there will be no warning whatsoever for millions of europeans who could be vaporized in an instant even while their cities are turned to rubble and ash western europe is already facing a devastating winter with obscene levels of food and energy scarcity cost increases if the power grid is taken down and the municipal water systems don t function because they ve been hit by russian missiles western europe would find itself in the dark ages freezing to death starving dying from feces borne diseases and begging for humanitarian assistance from a world that s already in a food and energy crisis at this point nato has given russia no option other than escalation that s because once again the usa wants world war iii before november at this rate of escalating events they may very well get exactly what they are begging for if europe erupts into world war the entire western financial system i e debt pyramid ponzi scheme will collapse because it is built on highly leveraged debt financialization instruments rather than actual assets and earnings right now the entire western financial system is hanging by a thread running on hype and faith that s pushed by the lying corporate media the stock market real estate market and commercial debt markets are essentially fictitious frauds with very little in the way of underlying asset values that could justify the current inflated prices as a result even a small incursion into the fragile financial pyramid could result in a catastrophic contagion collapse get more details on all this in today s sobering situation update podcast brighteon com 9d2517c9 d88c 4df7 94cc 76e9712af121 asd asd

the bank of canada has raised interest rates again in an effort to quell inflation the central bank raised its policy rate by 0 75 percentage points on sept 7 bringing its benchmark overnight rate to 3 25 per cent economists are expecting the central bank to raise it again before the end of the year by now it s clear that the bank of canada did not anticipate the current rate of inflation when inflation first started increasing last year the central bank was slow to start tightening monetary policy now that inflation is persistent the bank of canada is making up for lost time by aggressively raising its policy rate to get the inflation rate back on target monetary policy has a delayed impact on the economy meaning that a change in monetary policy today will affect the economy about 12 to 18 months from now although supply chain problems high energy prices from the war in ukraine and labour shortages have exacerbated inflation the unprecedented expansionary monetary policy by the bank of canada last year is an important source of the high inflation we observe today getting back on track the goal of canada s monetary policy jointly determined by the government of canada and the bank of canada is to keep the inflation rate within a range of one to three per cent with two per cent being the most desirable rate in early 2021 all key inflation indicators started to rise dramatically and as of now are all well above the two per cent inflation target the total consumer price index inflation rate was 8 1 per cent in june 2022 and fell to 7 6 per cent in july 2022 mostly because of a decline in gasoline prices the core consumer price index inflation was also well above five per cent in july read more an economist explains what you need to know about inflation inflation also rose in the united states europe and the united kingdom with annual inflation in these countries now running at around 9 per cent and central banks flagrantly missing their inflation targets at the onset of the covid 19 pandemic in march 2020 the bank of canada rapidly lowered the policy rate to near zero and kept it there until early 2022 since then the bank has been steadily increasing the policy rate until the most recent hike according to the central bank it could be years before its policy rate is back to normal levels currently the bank of canada estimates that inflation will decrease to about three per cent by the end of 2023 and return to the two per cent target by the end of 2024 but this remains to be seen in this regard back in 2020 the bank was expecting the policy rate to remain at 0 25 per cent until 2023 but is now at 3 25 per cent and rising bank of canada assets in response to the covid 19 pandemic the bank of canada introduced a large number of lending programs and used non interest rate tools known as nonconventional monetary policy to provide liquidity to the financial markets and stimulate the economy this led to an unprecedented increase in the bank of canada s balance sheet with the central bank buying more than half a trillion dollars of financial assets primarily in the form of government of canada securities before the pandemic the bank of canada s holdings of securities were about 100 billion the expansion in the bank of canada s balance sheet led to a huge injection of liquidity in the financial system and led to an increase in the reserves that commercial banks have in their accounts with the bank of canada in fact these reserves increased by more than 1 500 times their pre covid amount such increases in bank reserves are generally considered to be inflationary restoring faith in the bank of canada the bank of canada s recent aggressive monetary tightening will be transmitted to the real economy through higher interest rates and lower asset prices including housing prices and will most likely kill the post covid economic expansion with inflation seemingly out of control central banks appear to be losing credibility the public trusts central banks to protect the buying power of money but the increasing cost of living is eroding this trust the bank of canada and other central banks including the federal reserve the european central bank and the bank of england are all desperately trying to fight inflation and restore their credibility in canada this restoration has involved the unprecedented increases in the bank of canada s policy rate that have taken place since the beginning of the year curiously other countries that are facing the same supply chain problems and higher energy prices as us are not struggling with inflation as high as ours for example the inflation rate in switzerland is 3 4 per cent in japan is 2 3 per cent and in china is 2 4 per cent but why this is the case is another conversation entirely author apostolos serletis professor of economics university of calgary
